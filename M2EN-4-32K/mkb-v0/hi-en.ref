My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
On the pious festival of Deepawali, greetings to all of you.
We are familiar with the lines of the Shlok- Shubham Karoti Kalyanam, Aarogyam Dhansampadaa.
The shlok says: It is Light that ushers in joy, health and prosperity into our lives, dispelling negative thought, bringing in positivity.
I salute the divine flame respectfully.
To make this Diwali memorable, what could be a better way than an attempt to let light spread its radiance, encouraging positivity, with a prayer to quell the feeling of animosity
These days Diwali is celebrated across many countries.
And notably, it is not limited to Indian communities even governments, citizens and social organisations wholeheartedly celebrate Diwali with gaiety and fervour.
In a way, they nurture a microcosm of India at their respective places.
Friends, festival tourism has its own exciting attractions.
Our India, the country of festivals, possesses limitless possibilities in the realm of festival tourism.
It must be our endeavour to ensure that we should welcomingly include people of other states, other countries when we celebrate Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal or Bihu, spreading their true spirit.
Here, every state, every region is replete with distinct festivals, generating a lot of interest in people from other countries.
Hence, the Indian Diaspora has a significant role to play in promoting festival tourism in India .
My dear countrymen, in the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided to do something different this Diwali.
I had urged all of you to celebrate Indias Nari-Shakti, the power and achievement of women, thereby felicitating the Lakshmi of India.
And within no time, there followed a slew of innumerable inspirational stories on social media.
Kodipaka Ramesh from Warangal has written on Namo App-My mother is my strength.
My mother is God to me.
She is the Lakshmi of India in every sense of the term.
Ramesh ji , respectful greetings to your mother.
Geetika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for her, Major Khushbu Kanwar, daughter of a bus conductor, who has led an all women contingent of Assam Rifles, is the Lakshmi of India.
For Kavita Tiwari, her daughter is the Lakshmi of India, her strength.
She is proud of her daughters excellent painting ability.
She has also secured a good rank in the CLAT exam.
Whereas Megha Jain has mentioned that a 92 year old woman has been offering free drinking water to passengers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Megha Ji is truly inspired by the humility and compassion of this Lakshmi of India.
Many such stories have been shared by people.
Do read them, get inspired and share similar instances. I respectfully salute all the Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the well known 17th century poetess Sanchi Honnamma has penned a poem in Kannada that embodies the same thought, the same words pertaining to every Lakshmi of India that we referred to.
One feels the foundation of the idea was laid in the 17th century itself.
You will notice the beauty of word, sentiment and thought in this poem in Kannada: (Penninda permegondanu himavantanu.
Penninda broohu perchidanuPenninda janakaraayanu jasuvalendanu) Which means, Himwant, Lord Mount attained fame on account of daughter Parvati, Rishi Brighu on account of his daughter Lakshmi and King Janak because of daughter Sita. Our daughters are our pride...
their prodigious virtuosity cradles our social fabric, ensuring its bright future.
My dear countrymen, the 12th of November, 2019 is the day when the 550th Prakashotsav of Guru Nanak dev ji will be celebrated across the world.
The luminescence of Guru Nanak Dev jis influence can be felt not only in India but around the world.
Many of our Sikh brothers and sisters settled in other countries committedly follow Guru Nanak dev jis ideals.
I can never forget my visits to Gurudwaras in Vancouver and Tehran.
There is much about Guru Nanak Dev ji that I can share with you, but it will require many an episode of Mann ki Baat.
He accorded the highest significance to the spirit of service.
Guru Nank Dev ji firmly believed that any service done selflessly was beyond evaluation.
He stood firm against social ills such as untouchability.
Sri Guru Nanak Dev ji radiated his message to all corners of the world.
He was the widest travelled of those times.
And wherever he went he won hearts through his straightforwardness, humility and simplicity.
Guru Nanak Ji undertook many significant spiritual journeys called Udaasi.
Carrying the message of harmony and equality, he travelled north, south, east and west, meeting people, saints and sages.
It is said that the revered Assamese saint Shankar Dev too was inspired by him.
He also travelled to the holy land of Haridwar.
There is a holy place in Kashi named Gurubagh Gurudwara. It is believed that Guru Nanak Dev Ji had halted there.
He also went to Buddhist holy sites such as Rajgir and Gaya.
His journeys to the south took him to Sri Lanka, as well.
During his Yatra to Bidar, Karnataka, he devised a solution for water woes the place was grappling with.
Gurunanak Jhira Sahib is a famous place in Bidar dedicated to him, cherishing reminiscences of him.
During one Udaasi, Gurunanak Dev Ji travelled north to Kashmir and neighboring areas.
This forged a strong bond between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji also went to Tibet where people accorded him the status of a Guru.
He is revered in Uzbekistan too, which he had visited.
During one Udaasi, he widely travelled to Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Just a few days ago, Ambassadors of approximately eighty-five countries went to Amritsar from Delhi.
There in the Golden Temple itself, they undertook a holy Darshan, commemorating the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
Besides Darshan, all these Ambassadors had the opportunity to know more about Sikh traditions and culture.
Following that, many Ambassadors shared those photos on social media, writing about their glorious experiences.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure all of you remember the significance of the 31st of October.
Sardar Patel used to observe even the minutest of things in-depth
He was a 'Man of Detail' in the true sense of the term.
Along with that, he was also adept at organising skills.
Chalking out plans and devising strategies was his core forte'.
When we read and hear about Sardar Saheb's style of working, we come to know of the sheer magnitude of the meticulousness in his planning.
In 1921, in the Congress Session in Ahmedabad, thousands of delegates from across the country were slated to participate.
Sardar Patel was entrusted with overlooking all the arrangements.
He utilized this opportunity in improving the citys water supply network.
He contacted farmers and urged them to craft khadi bags.
These were made and sold to the delegates.
They carried the bags with their shoes inside, free from any tension of the footwear getting stolen.
On the other hand, it led to a major rise in the sale of khadi.
Our country will always be indebted to Sardar Patel for his steller role in the Constituent Assembly.
He strove to ensure enshrinement of fundamental rights that obliterated any possibility of discrimination on the basis of caste and community.
Friends, all of us know that as Indias first home minister, Sardar Patel undertook the colossal, historic task of integrating Princely states.
Actually, when we refer to Sardar Patels endeavour, his role in the unification of just a few notable States is discussed.
He played a far more significant role, when it came to a small region such as Lakshadweep too.
Soon after Partition in 1947, our neighbour had cast an eye on Lakshadweep a ship bearing their flag was sent there.
When Sardar Patel was informed of this, he wasted no time in initiating stern action.
Following his orders, the Tricolour was promptly unfurled there and the nefarious dreams of the neighbour of annexing Lakshadweep were decimated within no time.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the Mudaliar brothers to personally ensure all assistance for development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly in Indias progress.
It is an attractive tourist destination too.
I hope you get the opportunity to visit the picturesque islands and its pristine beaches.
My dear countrymen, the 31st of October, 2018, is the day when the 'Statue of Unity',in memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world.
It is the tallest statue in the world.
It is double in height compared to the 'Statue of Liberty' located in the US.
The distinction of having the world's highest statue fills every Indian with pride
the head of every Indian is held high.
You will be happy to note that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists visited the 'Statue of Unity'.
This means that an average of eight and a half thousand people witnessed the grandeur of the 'Statue of Unity' every day.
The reverence and devotion for Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in their hearts was reflected in the form of homage paid to him. Besides, at present,it houses many centres of attraction such as Cactus Garden, Butterfly Garden, Jungle Safari, and Childrens Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery, which are all constantly evolving and providing a fillip to the local economy.
Local people are not only getting innovative opportunities of employment but for the convenience of visiting tourists, many villagers are providing facilities like home stays.
And these hosts are being professionally trained in the technique of running a home stay.
The locals have now started the cultivation of Dragon fruit and I am sure that it will soon become a major source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, for our nation and the constituent states, as well as for the tourism industry, this 'Statue of Unity' can be a subject of research.
We are all witness to the fact that how within a year a place developed as a world famous tourism destination.
People arrive there from the country and abroad.
And one after the other, ancillary services like transport, lodging, guides and eco-friendly services are getting inducted by themselves.
A large economy is developing and people are generating facilities as per the requirement of the tourists.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, as you know that 31st October every year since 2014 has been celebrated as 'National Unity Day'.
This day imparts the message to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost.
On 31st October, this year too Run for Unity is being organized in consonance with previous years.
It will include people from all walks of life, from every segment of our society.
Run for Unity is a symbol of unison, that the nation being united, is moving in one direction and collectively aims for- One goal
Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat
The last five years have witnessed - not only in Delhi but in hundreds of cities of India, union territories, state capitals, district centres, even in small cities belonging to tier two or tier three categories, innumerable men, women, be they the city folk, village folk, children, the youth, the elderly, divyang, all are participating inRun for Unityin large numbers.
Anyway, at present, people have adopted and found a passion for the marathon.
Run for Unity is also one such unique provision.
Running is beneficial for the mind, body and soul.
During Run for Unitynot only do we have to run, but in doing so the spirit of FIT India is also reflected.
We also find ourselves connected with Ek Bharat- Shrestha Bharat
And so, not just our body, but our mind and value system get integrated with ushering unity in India to take India to loftier heights
And so, in whichever city you reside, you can find out about the Run for Unity schedule.
In this portal, information has been provided about the venues where Run for Unity is to be organized across the country.
I hope you will all run on October 31st not only for the unity of India, but also for your physical fitness
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel integrated the nation with the thread of unison.
This mantra of unity is like a sacrament in our life and in a country like ours filled with diversities, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unison on all paths, at every bend, and at every pit-stop.
My dear countrymen, our nation has always been very proactive and alert in strengthening unity and communal harmony in the country.
If we look around us, we will find many examples of individuals who have been working ceaselessly to foster communal harmony. But sometimes it so happens, that the efforts of the society and its contribution, get wiped from our collective memory.
Friends, I remember when the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi in September 2010.
Various interest groups were playing games to take advantage of that situation in their own way
The kind of language that was spoken in order to generate tension in the atmosphere
But this scenario had continued for five days, or seven days, or ten days, but, the delivery of the courts decision generated a pleasant and surprising change of mood in the country.
On the one hand, the machinations went on to generate tension for week or two, but, when the decision was taken on Ram Janmabhoomi, the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all sects and saints gave restrained and balanced statements.
But I remember that day vividly.
And whenever I do that, I get happy that the dignity of the judiciary was very proudly honoured and no allowance for any heated discourse or tension was made anywhere.
These incidents should always be remembered as they impart us a lot of strength.
That day, that moment, instills in us all a sense of duty.
It is an example of how the voice of unison can bestow strength upon our country.
Today, I pay homage to her too.
My dear countrymen, today, if one story that rings from home to home, and rings far and wide,is heard from north to south, east to west and from every corner of India, then that IS the story of cleanliness and sanitation.
But therein lies a pleasant and interesting experience too.
I heard it and I think, I will share it with you too.
Just imagine the highest battlefield in the world, where the temperature drops from zero to 50-60 degrees minus.
Oxygen in the air is also at a miniscule level.
Living in the midst of such adverse conditions and challenges is not less than any display of valour.
In such a difficult situation, our brave heart soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country, but are also running a Swacch Siachen campaign in that arena.
On behalf of our countrymen, I commend the Indian Army for this amazing commitment.
I also express my gratitude.
It is so cold there that its near impossible for anything to decompose.
In such a situation, the segregation and management of garbage is a very important task in itself.
In this scenario, to remove 130 tons and more of garbage from the glacier and its surrounding areas fragile eco-system is a great service
We all know that Siachen as a glacier is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, running a cleanliness campaign here means ensuring clean water for those who live in low-lying areas and also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shyok.
My dear countrymen, festivals are occasions that awaken a new consciousness in our lives.
And especially during Diwali, it is customary in every family to buy something new, get something from the market in smaller or larger quantity.
I had once said that we should try to buy local products.
There is no need to go to the tehsil if our need is met in our village.
If it is found in Tehsil, then there is no need to go to the district.
The more we try to buy our local things the 'Gandhi 150' will become a great event in itself.
And I keep insisting that we must buy some handloom products made by our weavers, our khadi artisans.
Even during this Diwali, you must have bought quite a few or a lot of things before Diwali. But there are many people who think that if they go shopping after Diwali then may be they could get a good bargain.
So there will be many people, who still have their shopping left.
Hence along with the best of wishes on Deepawali, I would urge you to come forward and become a patron of local things and buy local.
And witness for ourselves, how we can play an important role in making Mahatma Gandhi's dream come alive.
I once again wish you all the very best on this auspicious festival of Diwali.
In Diwali we burst fire crackers of all kinds
But, sometimes fire is caused due to carelessness.
An injury can also occur.
I urge all of you to take utmost care of yourself and also celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
I extend many felicitations to you.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Will he be able to get some control over his life and destiny through your step
Can we remember that mantra of Bapu
Can we spare a thought while purchasing anything as to who in my country will be benefitted by this purchase
Today, the entire country is celebrating Rakshabandhan.
Heartiest greetings to all fellow citizens on this auspicious occasion.
The festival of Rakshabandhan symbolizes the bond of love trust between a brother a sister.
For centuries, this festival has proved to be a shining example of social harmony.
In the nations history, there are innumerable accounts of this sacred thread, binding together people of distant lands, different religions, around a spindle of trust.
In a few days from now, we shall celebrate the festive occasion of Janmashtami.
The whole atmosphere will reverberate to the sonorous chants calls of Hathi, Ghoda, Palki, Jai Kanhaiya Lal ki and Govinda-Govinda.
It is indeed an extremely joyous experience to imbue the essence of Bhagwan Krishna revel blissfully.
Friends, apart from Rakshabandhan, Shravan Poornima is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
I congratulate all those actively involved in preserving conserving this glorious heritage, helping it to reach out to the masses.
India takes great pride in the fact that Tamil is the most ancient of world languages. We Indians also feel proud that from Vedic times to the modern day, Sanskrit language has played a stellar role in the universal spread of knowledge.
Sanskrit language literature encompasses a storehouse of knowledge pertaining to every facet of life.
Science technology, agriculture health, Mathematics Management, economy environment, the entire spectrum has been touched upon. It is said that our Vedas have detailed reference on Mantras, on ways means to counter the challenges of global warming.
You will be pleased to know that even today, residents of village Mattur in Shivamoga district of Karnataka use Sanskrit as their lingua franca.
You will be astonished to know that Sanskrit is a language that possesses the capacity for infinite word formation with two thousand verb roots, 200 suffixes 22 prefixes
But those who are well acquainted with Sanskrit Subhashitas epigrammatic verses, know very well that it is possible to make a crisp, precise statement, using very few words through the usage of subhashitas. And since there is a sense of geographical cultural belonging, they are easy to understand assimilate.
For example, in order to illustrate the significance of the Guru in ones life, it has been said : r - , u.
We must abide by the same essence, the same spirit as we celebrate Teachers Day.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as Teacher Day across the country.
I felicitate all the teachers in the country on this occasion. I also salute your sense of commitment towards science, education and students.
It provided much needed succor to the scorched trees shrubs, and to parched water bodies on the other hand excessive rainfall causes devastating floods.
Its a vagary of Nature that some places have received higher rainfall compared to other places.
We just saw how the terrible floods in Kerala have affected human lives.
In todays pressing, hard times, the entire Nation is with Kerala.
Our sympathies are with those families who lost their loved ones. Loss of lives cannot be compensated, but I assure the grief-stricken families that in this moment of suffering misery, a hundred twenty five crore Indians stand by them, shoulder to shoulder.
I earnestly pray for those injured in this natural disaster to get well soon.
I firmly believe that the sheer grit and courage of the people of the state will see Kerala rise again.
From Kutch to Kamrup, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everyone is endeavoring to contribute in some way or the other so that wherever a disaster strikes, be it Kerala or any other part of India, human life returns to normalcy.
Irrespective of age group or area of work, people are contributing.
Everyone is trying to ensure speedy mitigation of the sufferings people in Kerala are going through, in fact sharing their pain.
We know that jawans of our armed forces are the vanguards of rescue relief operations in Kerala.
They have left no stone unturned as saviors of those trapped in the floods.
I would like to specially mention the arduous endeavors of the NDRF daredevils.
At this moment of hardship agony, their service stands out as a shining example.
The capability, commitment controlling situation through rapid decisions of the NDRF have made them a cynosure of every Indians eye, worthy of respect admiration.
Yesterday was the festival of Onam. We pray for Onam to provide strength to the country, especially Kerala so that it returns to normalcy on a newer journey of development.
Once again on behalf of all Indians, I would like to re assure each everyone in Kerala and other affected places that at this moment of calamity, the entire country stands by them.
My dear countrymen
I was looking into the suggestions received for Mann Ki Baat.
The subject about which most of the people from across the country have written is Our revered Atal Behari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonepat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar, Bihar and numerous others have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov asking me to speak on various aspects of Ataljis life.
As soon as the people in our country and abroad heard of the demise of Atalji on 16th August, everyone drowned in sadness.
He was a leader who gave up his position as Prime Minister fourteen years ago.
In a way, he was cut-off from active politics for the last 10 years.
He was neither seen in the news nor in public life.
During these last days, many great aspects of Atalji came up to the fore.
People remembered him as the best member of Parliament, sensitive writer, best orator and most popular Prime Minister and will continue to remember him.
India will remain ever grateful to Atalji for bringing the 91st Amendment Act, 2003.
This change brought about two important changes in Indias politics.
First one is that the size of the cabinet in states was restricted to 15 of the total seats in the state Assembly.
And the second one is that the limit under the Anti Defection Law was enhanced from one-thirds to two-thirds.
Besides, clear guidelines were defined to disqualify the defector.
For many years in India, the political culture of forming a very large cabinet was being misused to constitute jumbo cabinets not only to create a divide but also to appease political leaders.
Atalji changed it.
This effort of his resulted in saving of money as well as of resources.
This also helped in improving efficiency.
It could only be a visionary like Atalji who brought in this transformation and as a result of this, healthy traditions blossomed in our polity.
Atalji was a true patriot.
It was during his tenure that the timing of presenting the budget was changed.
Earlier, as was the British tradition, the Budget used to be presented at 5 pm because in London, Parliament used to start working at that time.
In the year 2001, Atalji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 am.
A number of such rules have been included in this code which made it possible to unfurl the tricolor in public places.
This provided a chance to more and more of our countrymen to unfurl our national flag.
Thus, he brought our beloved tricolor closer to the common man.
Similarly, you can see that presently efforts are afoot and discussions are being held about simultaneously holding the elections for Lok Sabha and for state assemblies.
The Government and the opposition both are putting forth their view points.
This is a good development and a healthy sign for our democracy.
I must say that developing healthy traditions for a sound democracy, making constant efforts to strengthen democracy, encouraging open-minded debates would also be a appropriate tribute to Atalji.
Reiterating our resolve to fulfill his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I along with all of you pay tributes to Atalji.
The monsoon session of Parliament ended just a few days back.
You will be glad to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha remained 118 percent and that of Rajya Sabha was 74 percent.
All the members rose above party interests to make the Monsoon session most productive and this is why Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and in Rajya Sabha fourteen bills were passed.
This Monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session for social justice and youth welfare.
A number of important bills beneficial to the youth and the backward classes were passed during this session.
As you know, a demand to constitute an OBC Commission similar to SCST commission was long pending for decades.
The country fulfilled its resolve this time to make an OBC Commission and also granted it Constitutional powers.
This step will prove to be the one to move forward our march towards achieving the goal of social justice.
An amendment bill to secure the rights of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes also were passed in this session.
This Act will give more security to the interests of SC and ST communities.
This will also forbid criminals from indulging in atrocities and will instill confidence among the dalit communities.
No civil society can tolerate any kind of injustice towards the woman-power of the country.
The nation will not tolerate those committing rapes. With this point in view Parliament has made a provision of strictest punishment by passing the Criminal Act Amendment Bill.
Those guilty of rape will get a minimum sentence of ten years and those found guilty of raping girls below the age of 12 years will be awarded the death sentence.
Recently, you might have read in newspapers, that a court in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh, after a brief hearing of two months, pronounced the death sentence on two criminals found guilty of raping a minor girl.
Earlier, a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh awarded the death sentence to the guilty after a hearing of just five days.
Courts in Rajasthan have also taken similar quick decisions.
This Act will play an effective role in curbing crimes against women and girls.
Economic growth will be incomplete without a social transformation.
The Triple Talaq Bill has been passed by the Lok Sabha although it could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha, I assure the Muslim women that the whole country stands by them to provide them social justice.
When we move ahead in the national interest, a change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived ones can also be brought about.
In the Monsoon session, this time, everyone jointly presented an ideal approach.
The attention of crores of Indians is focused on the Asian Games being held in Jakarta.
Every morning, first of all, people look for newspapers, Television, News and Social Media to check Indian players winning medals.
The Asian Games are going on.
I wish to congratulate all players who have won medals for the country.
I extend my best wishes to those players who are yet to compete.
Indian players are performing exceedingly well in shooting and wrestling but our players are winning medals in those competitions too, in which our performance has not been so good earlier-like WUSHU and ROWING. These are not just medals but an evidence of the sky high spirits of the Indian players.
Among those winning medals for our country are a large number of our daughters which is a very positive sign so much so, that youngsters of only 15-16 years of age have brought honour to our country by winning medals.
This too is a very positive indication that most of the medal-winners hail from small towns and villages and these players have achieved this success by putting in sheer hard work.
We shall celebrate National Sports Day on 29th August and I extend my best wishes to all sport lovers and also pay my tributes to the legendary hockey wizard Shri Dhyanchandji.
I request every citizen to make it a point to play and take care of their fitness because only a healthy India will build a developed and prosperous India.
Once again, I congratulate the medal winners at the Asian Games and also wish the remaining players perform well.
Many good wishes to you all on the National Sports Day.
Namaste Bhawnaji, I respect your sentiments.
All of us have seen houses and buildings being constructed of bricks and stones but can you imagine that about twelve hundred years ago, a giant mountain which was a single stone mountain was give the shape of an elegant, huge and a unique temple this may be difficult to imagine, but this happened and that temple is Kailash Nath Mandir in Ellora, Mahrashtra.
Would you believe if someone tells you that about a thousand years ago, an over sixty metres tall pillar of granite was built and another granite rock weighing about 80 tonnes was placed over its top.
But, Brihdeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this unbelievable combination of Engineering and Architecture can be seen.
Anybody will feel overawed on seeing Rani Ki Vaav of the 11th Century in Patan in Gujarat.
Our land has been an engineering laboratory.
There have been several engineers in India who made the unimaginable possible and presented such marvels of engineering before the world.
In this lineage of great engineers, we were blessed with a diamond whose work is still a source of wonder for all. He was Bharat Ratna Dr.
He is greatly revered in that part of our country and the whole nation remembers him with great respect and regard.
In his memory, 15th September is observed as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, our engineers have created their own identity in the world.
When I talk of wonders in the Engineering world, I am reminded of an incident of 2001 when a devastating earth quake hit Kutch in Gujarat.
I used to work as a volunteer there during those days, I got a chance to go to a village and had a chance to meet a lady of more than a hundred years of age. And she was looking at me and mockingly, saying, Look at my house.
But, you did not find any damage anywhere.
These houses were built by our ancestors in sync with nature and surroundings of this place. And she was saying all this with such a feeling of pride that it made me think that engineers in that era had constructed such structures according to the local situations which kept the common man safe and secured.
While observing Engineers Day, we should think of the future as well.
Workshops should be held at different places.
What are the things we need to learn in the changing times
The world is facing natural calamities.
What then should be the new form of structural engineering
What courses should be designed to that end
What should be taught to the students
How do we make zero waste our priority
All such points need to be pondered upon when we observe Engineers Day.
There is a mood of festivity and with this the preparations for Diwali also begin.
We will keep meeting through Mann Ki Baat, and will keep sharing matters close to our hearts.
With these feelings, I extend my best wishes to you all.
Thanks.
We shall meet.
Of late, News of abundant rainfall has been steadily coming in.
At places, we are hearing of rising concerns on account of excessive showers at some places, people are anxiously waiting for the rains to begin.
The vastness and diversity of India, in fact, at times even rains play hide seek through partiality laced likes dislikes. But why should we blame the rains
And that is why it becomes our collective responsibility... Let us be lovers of nature, protectors of Nature, conservers of Nature... and thus, ensure spontaneous balance in her myriad bounty.
Come to think of it, recently an incident pertaining to a natural disaster attracted global attention, leaving every heart mind perturbed.
V... in Thailand a team of 12 teenaged football players and their coach went on an excursion to a cave.
Usually it takes a few hours to enter and exit that cave.
But destiny had different plans that day.
Barely had they entered deep into the cave that a sudden heavy downpour caused water logging at the inlet of the cave.
One can only imagine the predicament of these teenagers in the face of death, where every second was fraught with danger.
on the other, the world over, humanity joined hands in expressing the noblest the most righteous of human virtues.
The world over, people prayed for the safe secure exit of these children.
The government, their parents, family members, media, citizens of that country, each one of them displayed an awe-inspiring sense of peace and patience.
All of them came together as a team to accomplish their mission.
During the operation, a sailor from Thailand Navy sacrificed his life.
The whole world is be wildered at the way they held on with courage and patience, without losing hope, despite the odds against them in the water-logged dark cave.
This proves that when humanity stands together, it creates wonders.
What is certainly required is focusing on your goal with a calm steady demeanour and the will to strive.
A few days ago, the countrys beloved poet Neeraj Ji left us forever.
Neeraj ji was blessed with a special quality...
Usually, the months of July and August are very important for farmers and the youth.
This is the time which is Peak season for colleges.
Like Satyam, Hundreds of thousands of youth leave schools to join colleges.
Whereas February and March get consumed in exams, papers and answers, April May are meant for enjoying vacations, followed by results and thereafter, shaping a course for ones life through career choices.
July is the month when the youth step into a new phase of life, where the focus shifts from questions and veers towards cut-offs.
The attention of students steers from home to hostel.
Students submit themselves to the tutelage of Professors vis a vis the shadow of their parents.
I firmly believe that my young friends must be enthusiastic happy on the commencement of their college life.
Leaving home for the first time, moving out of ones village, coming out of a protective environment amounts to taking charge of the course of ones life.
This multitude of young people leave their homes for the first time to chart a new direction for their lives.
Some students might have joined their respective colleges and some must be about to join.
All I would like to say to you is Be calm, enjoy life, seek inner happiness in life.
There is no alternative to books, one has to study, yet ones bent of mind should be towards discovering new things.
Old friends are invaluable.
Childhood friends are precious, but selecting, making maintaining new friendships is a task that requires immense prudence.
Keep learning something new, such as newer skills and languages.
Young people who leave their homes for the sake of studies should discover their new places, know more about the people, language, culture tourism facets related to them.
My best wishes to all the young people about to begin a new innings.
His father earns his daily bread by waste-picking.
I congratulate him on his success.
There are many such instances of students from deprived families who, through sheer determination perseverance overcame all odds and stood out to be beacons of inspiration to others.
Examples such as Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father is a DTC bus driver, Abhay Gupta of Kolkata who studied on foothpaths under street lights, Bitiya Afreen Sheikh of Ahmedabad, whose father drives an auto rickshaw, Nagpurs daughter Khushi, whose father is a school bus driver, Karthik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand, whose father is a brick-kiln labourer...
or Gurgaons divyang angel Anushka Panda, who suffers from a hereditary disorder called spinal muscular atrophy... all of them overcame each every obstacle through their firm resolve and eal, attaining success for the world to see.
If we look around, we can see many such examples.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago I happened to glance through a news item, it said- Two youths make Modis dream come true. On reading further, I came to know how our youngsters put in efforts to transform the lives of the common man by making smart and creative use of technology.
It so happened that once I was interacting with Indian youth in San Jose town of America hailed as a Technology Hub.
I had appealed to those young people to think over how could they use their talent to Indias benefit and do something in that direction whenever they found time.
I had made an appeal to change brain-drain into brain-gain.
With their joint efforts, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have developed a SmartGaonApp by utilizing their professional skills.
This App is not only connecting the villagers with the whole world but now they can obtain any information on their own mobile phones.
Residents of the village Taudhakpur in Rae Bareilly, village chief, District Magistrate, CDO and every one joined in to create awareness amongst the masses.
If you look into this incident minutely, one thing will strike you and that is the young man living in America adhering to that countrys life-style and ideology, who left India many years ago but, knows the finer details about his village, knows about the challenges and still is emotionally attached to his village.
This seems to be the reason as to how he could develop this App which is most suited to needs of the village.
A sense of belonging towards the village and towards ones roots and also a spirit to show and do something is naturally there in each and every Indian.
But, sometimes because of time, sometimes because of distance and at times because of situations that spirit gets faded but just with a touch of a tiny spark, everything re-emerges which takes one back to old memories.
We should also check if such a thing has happened in our case too whether circumstances, situations, distances have made us alien, whether dust has gathered over our determinations.
Santoshji, many - many thanks for your phone call.
Actually, Pandharpur Wari is an amazing journey in itself.
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, which fell on 23rd July, is celebrated as a day of grand transformation of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandharpur is a holy town in Solapur district in Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days before Ashadhi Ekadashi warkari or pilgrims start the Pandharpur Yatra on foot.
This yatra (journey) is known as Wari and lakhs of warkaris join this.
Wooden foot wear or padukas of great saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram are placed in a palki and pilgrims begin their pilgrimage chanting Vitthal-Vitthal.
Pilgrims go to have a darshan of Vitthal who is also known as Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vitthal safeguards the interests of the poor, the deprived ones and the ones who are suffering.
People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana have deep devotion and respect for Vitthal.
Visiting Vithoba temple in Pandharpur and its grandeur, beauty and spiritual bliss is a unique experience in itself.
I request the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to visit Pandharpur Wari at least once, whenever they get a chance.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ram Dass, Tukaram are relevant even today in educating the masses.
They are imparting energy to fight against superstition in each and every corner across the country.
May they be compositions like Bharud (Hkk:M) or Abhang (vHkax), we get a great message of amity, love and brotherhood.
We get the mantra to enable the society to fight against blind-faith through devotion and bhakti.
These were the people who, at times restrained and corrected the society, even showed a mirror and ensured that old evil traditions get eradicated from the society and that people inculcated a culture of compassion, equality and righteousness.
Our mother India is a land full of gems and treasures and the tradition of these great saints that adorned our land are at the same level as the great men who dedicated and sacrificed their lives for our Mother India.
One such great man has been Lok Manya Tilak who has left a very deep impression on the hearts of a large number of Indians.
We remember and pay our homage to Tilak ji on his birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and self-confidence.
He had the courage to show a mirror to the British about their wrong doings.
The British were so afraid of Lok Manya Tilak that they tried to charge him of sedition thrice in two decades this is no small thing.
I want to narrate an interesting incident to the countrymen which is connected with Lok Manya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When in October 1916, Lok Manya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, more than 40,000 people that time gave him a welcome and during that very visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had a chance to talk to him. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was greatly impressed by Lok Manya Tilakji.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected the Mayor of Ahmedabad municipal corporation and he immediately selected Victoria Garden as a venue for Lok Manya Tilaks memorial and this was the very Victoria Garden which was named after the British ueen.
Finally, the statue got built and Sardar Saheb got it unveiled by none other than Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February, 1929 and the most interesting point is that during that inaugural ceremony revered Bapuji said that with the coming of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got a man but it has got the strength on the basis of which, building the statue of Tilakji has become possible.
And my dear countrymen, the speciality about this statue is that this is a rare statue of Tilakji in which he is sitting in a chair and in this Swaraj is our birthright (Swaraj Hamara Janma Sidhha Adhikar Hai) is inscribed right below Tilakjis statue.
Tradition of publicly celebrating Ganesh Utsav was also initiated with the efforts of Lok Manya Tilakji.
The celebration of Ganesh Utsav publicly had become an effective medium in promoting a spirit of social awakening, integration, amity and equality among the masses besides projecting a sense of dedication and festivity in them.
This was the period when there was a need for people to get united in the fight against the British these festivals, by breaking the barriers of casteism and communalism served the purpose of uniting all.
Such events gained more popularity with the passage of time.
Thus, it becomes clear that our younger generations still care for the brave heroes of our ancient past, its heritage and history.
Today, you can see Ganesh pandals in almost every street of various cities.
This is an excellent chance for our youth wherein they can learn qualities of leadership and organization and inculcate these in themselves.
I had requested last time too and now, while remembering Lokmanya Tilak, I will once again urge all of you to celebrate Ganesh Utsav with great enthusiasm and fervour whole heartedly but insist on keeping these celebrations eco-friendly.
Right from Ganesh idol to all decorative material everything ought to be eco friendly and I will appreciate that separate competitions be organized in each city, prizes be awarded for these and I will like that eco friendly items related to Ganesh Utsav are displayed for wider publicity on My Gov and Narendra Modi App.
I will surely send your ideas and efforts to the people.
Lokmanya Tilak evoked self- confidence amongst our countrymen and gave the slogan Swaraj is our birth right and I shall have it.
Today is the time to say that Good Governance is our birth right and we will have it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and positive results of development.
I am talking about none other than Chandrasekhar Azad.
Where will you find a young man in India who will not be inspired listening to these lines -Sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamare dil mein hai Dekhna hai zor kitna baazu-e-qaatil mein hai(The desire for martyrdom is now in our heartsLet us see the strength in the arms of my executioner) These lines inspired many young people like Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad and many others.
Azads courage and passion for freedom inspired the youth of the day.
Chandrashekhar Azad put his life on the stake, but he never bowed in front of the foreign rule.
It was my privilege and good fortune that I had the opportunity of going to Chandrasekhar Azads native village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
I had the opportunity to pay homage in Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad, Chandrasekhar Azad Ji was a brave man who did not wish to die by the bullet of foreigners - he wished to fight for independence as a free man and if he had to die, he wished to remain a free man
Once again, I bow and pay tributes to the two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilakji and Chandrasekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland, India's brave daughter and a farmer daughter Hima Das made history by winning the gold medal in the 400-meter race event.
Ekta Bhyan, another daughter of the country, in response to my letter, has emailed me from Indonesia, where she is now preparing for the Asian Games.
Ekta in her e-mail writes - 'The most important moment in the life of any athlete is that when he or she holds the tricolor and I am proud that I could do that.
' Ekta, we all are proud of you.
You have brought glory to the Nation.
Ekta has won the gold and bronze medals in World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 held in Tunisia.
Her achievement is all the more special because she has made the imposing challenges in her life the key to her success.
Daughter Ekta Bhyan in 2003, lost the use of half of her lower body due to road accident, but this daughter did not lose courage and made herself all the more stronger to perform this grand feat.
Another Divyang, Yogesh athuniaji, has won the gold medal in the discus throw in Para Athletics Grand Prix in Berlin and in the process bettered the world record, along with Sundar Singh Gurjar who also won the gold medal in javelin.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is significant because it is filled with historically important dates and festivals, but due to the weather sometimes sickness also enters the house.
I wish all of you best wishes for good health, for this month of August imbued with the spirit of patriotism and for many festivals that have continued over centuries.
We will meet once again for Mann Ki Baat' next time.
NNamaskar.
My dear countrymen, Im fortunate once again to be face to face with you in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Just a few days ago, a historic Cricket match took place in Bengaluru.
Of course you must have realized that I am referring to the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistans first international match and its a matter of honour for us that this historic match for Afghanistan was played with India.
Both teams performed par excellence. Besides, bowler Rashid Khan had performed exceedingly well in the IPL earlier this year.
I remember Afghanistan President Shriman Ashraf Ghanis words on Twitter tagging me along The people of Afghanistan are extremely, proud of our hero Rashid Khan.
Im also thankful to our Indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents what constitutes the best of Afghanistan.
He is an asset to the world of cricket. Then he quipped No, we are not giving him to anyone
This match will remain etched in our memories for a long time.
Anyway, being the first match, it is naturally memorable, but I will cherish it for a special reason.
The Indian team did something that is exemplary to the whole world.
What does a winning team do while receiving the trophy
The Indian team, while receiving the trophy, warmly invited the Afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs.
This incident exemplifies the very spirit of sportsmanship.
Sports is an excellent route to unite society and to showcase the talents skills of our youth.
My dear countrymen, this 21st of June, the fourth Yoga Day presented the rarest of sights.
The whole world appeared as one entity.
In the European Parliament in Brussels, at the UN headquarters in New York, on Japanese naval warships, there were sights of people performing yoga.
Saudi Arabia witnessed its first, historic yoga programme and I am told many aasans were demonstrated by women.
On the snow capped mountain peaks of Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers performed yoga in unison.
Yoga breaks all barriers of borders and unites people.
ealous citizens of hundreds of lands overlooked divisions of caste, religion, region, colour and gender to transform this occasion into a massive festival.
If people from the entire world ardently participated in programmes on Yoga Day, why should India not feel elated many times over
Our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky, some 15 thousand feet above the earth.
Spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air.
Schools, colleges, offices, parks, skyscrapers, playgrounds came alive- as yoga venues.
Yogahas broken barriers of caste, creed and geography to unite the people of the entire world, which is the very essence of the real sentiment innate to Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have followed in letter and spirit over centuries.
Our Rishis, sages and saints have laid emphasis on certain tenets yoga has proved them in a concrete manner.
More and more people will come forward to make it a part of their lives.
My dear countrymen, many of you have urged me on My gov and Narendra Modi app to mention Doctors Day, the 1st of July. You are absolutely right.
We are a people who, by nature, revere the Mother as the equivalent of god since she is the source of our very existence, our life. On the other hand, there are times when it is the Doctor who gives us re-birth.
The role of a doctor is not limited to mere treatment of ailments.
Today, doctors possess not just medical expertise they have a vast experience on the co- relation between general lifestyle trends and their effect on our health.
Indian doctors have carved a niche for themselves in the entire world through their capabilities and skills.
Our doctors have gained recognition for their expertise in the medical field, hardworking attitude and the ability to solve complex medical problems.
My dear countrymen, as a people, we are truly blessed to be born in this land, bhoomi of Bharat, India.
India has had a rich historical canvas. Every single month, every single day in fact, is a marker of one historical event or the other.
Every place in India is replete with signposts of heritage.
Every place has been blessed with a saint, a luminary or a great, famous personality who has contributed through his sagacity.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is correct that I am reaching Maghar on the 28th.
I am sure you know about Kabirwad in Gujarat when I used to work there, I had organized a National session of people belonging to the tradition of saint Kabir.
Do you know why Kabir Das ji chose to go to Maghar
In those days it was believed that death in Maghar was a roadblock in ones pathway to heaven.
On the contrary, breathing ones last in Kaashi was a guarantee for entry into heaven.
Maghar was considered unholy but Sant Kabirdas never subscribed to that view.
He toiled relentlessly to quell many such superstitions and evil social customs of his times. That is why he went to Maghar and chose to attain Samadhi there.
Sant Kabir Das ji, through his verses Saakhis and Dohas stressed upon the virtues of social equality, peace and brotherhood.
These were his ideals.
We can feel the essence of these ideals in his compositions. They are relevant inspiring even in modern times.
I quote a doha , , The true saint is the one who recognizes understands the sufferings of others.
Kabir Das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion.
He was a thinker way ahead of his times.
Compassion should be the universal way of life.
In another doha, Kabir has written. , , Compassion leads to righteousness,Greed leads to sin.
Ask him about his repository of knowledge.
And one such guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev.
He showed the righteous path of life to millions, inspiring them for centuries.
Guru Nanak Devji said that the service to the poor and the needy is service to God.
Wherever he went, he took many initiatives for the welfare of the society.
The establishment of a kitchen free of social discrimination where a person of any caste, sect, religion or community could eat or what we know as the langarsystem was initiated solely by Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to join this great festival with enthusiasm and fervour.
To celebrate this festival in the entire Indian society and around the world I also urge you to suggest new ideas, new concepts, and innovations on which we can ponder and make preparations and thus we can also celebrate the Prakash parv as Prerna Parv with great pride.
My dear countrymen
The history of India's struggle for independence is very long, very vast and is filled with countless sacrifices.
There is another chapter of history associated with Punjab.
In the year 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh will come to a full circle, it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity.
How can we remember the completion of 100 years of this horrific event is something we canall give a thought to, but we must also remember the everlasting message that this incident has imparted that is - violence and cruelty can never solve any problem.
It is peace and non-violence, renunciation and martyrdom that are triumphant in the end
Mr. Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi, has written on 'Narendra Modi Mobile App' that oncoming July 6 happens to be Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjees birthday and he wants me to talk about Dr.
Thank you very much, Raman ji.
It feels great to see your interest in India's history.
You know, yesterdayjune 23, was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
Very few people would also be knowing that in 1937, on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation in Kolkata University in Bangla.
This was the first time under British rule that the convocation in Kolkata University had been addressed to in Bangla.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries minister of India and, in a sense, helaid a strong foundation for Indias industrial development, he had prepared a solid base, it was he who had prepared a stout platform.
Mukherjee's dream was for India to be industrially self-reliant, competent and prosperous in every sphere.
He had wanted India to develop heavy industries and also pay full attention to MSME, handloom, textiles and cottage industry.
He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal.
It was the result of his understanding, prudence and activism that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India.
For Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India - and for this, at the young age of 52, he also sacrificed his life.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjees message of unity imbued with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and remain proactive with all our might for the progress of India.
During the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of different schemes of government through video call.
I got an opportunity to know beyond the confines of the files the changes which are being ushered in the lives of people directly from them.
People spoke about their determination, their happiness and their achievements.
I believe that this was not a mere governmental programme for me, but it was a unique learning experience and during this time the joy of seeing people's faces lit with happiness, can be the moment of greatest satisfaction in anyone's life
When I would listen to the stories of a common man, his guileless words narrating his experience would touch my heart.
In far-distant villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers.
Asister from Chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, many lakhs of young besides running the Yuva Jan Aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages.
At the same time a young man from West Bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur
And not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people.
Whereas young school students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their schools tinkering lab.
I just do not know how many such stories were shared with me, there wasnt a single corner of the country where people did not have a success story of theirs to share with me.
In such an environment, when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope, new zeal and events that have taken place in his life, it is not to the government's credit.
An incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people.
With the help of technology, through the video bridge even a single moment spentwith the beneficiaries was very enjoyable, very motivational and provided satisfaction to work more.
There is a renewed joy in dedicating your life for the upliftment, and youre left with renewed fervour and inspiration.
I am very grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength.
I again want to express my gratitude to you all.
I always feel that if we look around us, somewhere or something good always happens.
Many good people out there are involved in beneficial work.
We can also smell the fragrance of righteousness.
In the past, one thing came to my attention and it happens to be a very unique combination.
On one hand, where we have professionals and engineers, on the other hand, there exist farmers tilling the fields, our brethren-sisters associated with agriculture.
But there exists a link, in Bangalore, corporate professionals and IT engineers came along and created an effortless Samridhi trust with which they have doubled the income of the farmers by successful activation of this trust.
This trust remained associated with farmers, drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers.
Farmers producing grains have also become associated with this trust.
On one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from cultivation till the marketing of crops, whereas on the other hand, to make certain the farmers' participation in reaping profits is an attempt to guarantee their right.
A separate seed bank has been created to make good agricultural strains available for reaping a bumper harvest.
Women have also been added in this activity and they supervise the work of this seed-bank.
I congratulate these young people for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these young professionals, technocrats and others associated with the world of engineering, got out of their comfort zone to make a connect with the farmer, the village, fields and barns.
I once again felicitate the youth of my country for their innovative experiments, some of which I might have got to know, some might have escaped me, some people might or may not be aware of but nonetheless I wish countless people involved in doing beneficial work ,very good luck from my side.
Its been an year when GST was implemented. 'One Nation, One Tax' was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today.
If Ive to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of One Nation One Tax reform, then I credit the states of our nation.
GST is a great example of Cooperative federalism, where all the states decided to take a unanimous decision in the interest of the nation, and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country.
So far, there have been 27 meetings of the GST Council and we can all feel proud that people from different political ideologies have been involved in these meetings. These meetings involve representatives of different states
Before the onset of GST scheme, there were 17 different types of taxes prevailing in the country, but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country.
GST is not only the victory of integrity but it is also a celebration of honesty.
Earlier, in the case of taxation and allied affairs in the country, there were rampant complaints of Inspector Raj.
Everything from return to refund is done through online information technology.
The check post has become extinct after the arrival of the GST scheme and the movement of goods has become faster, which not only saves time but is also accruing benefits in the areaof logistics.
GST is probably be the biggest tax reform in the world.
The successful implementation of such a huge tax reform in India was successful only because the people of the country adopted it and through the power of the masses, fuelled the success of the GST scheme.
It is generally believed that such a big tax reform, in a huge country like ours with such a large population takes 5 to 7 years for effective adoption. However within a year, the enthusiasm of the honest people of this nation, the celebration of integrity in the country and the participation of people resulted in this new tax system managing to create a space for itself, has achieved stability and according to the need, it will bring reform through its inbuilt arrangement.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I once again have been blessed with the opportunity to be face-to-face with you.
I am sure you distinctly remember that for the last many months, a naval team comprising six women Commanders was on a voyage.
I want to tell you something about the Naavika Saagar Parikrama.
These six illustrious daughters of India circumnavigated the globe for over more than 250 days on board the INSV Tarini, returning home on the 21st of May.
The entire country welcomed them with open arms, with high spirits.
They traversed a multitude of oceans, many a sea, over a distance of almost twenty two thousand nautical miles.
This was a first of its kind event in the entire world.
Last Wednesday, I got an opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate these daughters and their spirit of adventure for bringing laurels to the country, for raising the glory of the Navy and significantly so, for conveying to the world that Indias daughters are no less.
Who does not know of the sense of adventure
If you view the journey of human evolution, you will notice that breakthroughs in progress have taken birth in the womb of some adventure or the other.
There is an umbilical link between development and adventure
the resolve to achieve something, the burning desire to do something unparalleled, the sentiment proclaiming I too can do it. The number of such people may be miniscule, but they turn out to be sources of inspiration for millions of others, spanning an array of eras.
On the 16th of May, a team comprising five tribal students of an Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra- Maneesha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madhavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam- scaled the worlds highest peak.
These Ashram School students began training in August, 2017, covering Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Leh-Ladakh.
These young boys girls had been selected under Mission Shaurya. True to its name, they brought glory to the country with their brave deed of conquering the Everest.
I congratulate these young friends and members of the school in Chandrapur, from the core of my heart.
Just a while ago, 16 year old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to scale Everest from the Nepal side.
Heartiest congratulations, Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter became the first ever father-daughter duo to ascend Everest.
And its not that only the young are climbing Everest.
On the 19th of May, Sangeeta Bahal, aged more than 50, scaled the Everest.
This deed is commendable indeed it also displays their commitment towards cleanliness and the environment.
People have been ascending the Everest for years many have managed to reach the peak successfully.
I congratulate these daredevils, especially the daughters from the core of my heart.
that a large number of people would come forward to support it.
When I say Fit India, I believe that the more we play, the more we will inspire the country to come out play.
People are sharing videos of Fitness Challenge on social media they are tagging each other to spread the challenge.
And in the last episode, our heroes of the Commonwealth Games shared with us their Mann Ki Baat, matters close to their hearts through this programme.
Chhavi Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that sports games that were once a part parcel of every childs life, in every lane in the neighbourhood, are fading into oblivion.
These games used to be a special feature of summer holidays.
Of course, those games were known by different names, depending on the place. Pitthoo is one such game.
Some called it Lagori, at other places it was Satoriya, Saat Pathar, Dikori, Satodiya... one game with many names
Traditional sports and games comprise both varieties...
outdoor and indoor as well.
The unity, intrinsic to our countrys diversity can be witnessed in these games.
A single game is known by distinct names at different places.
I am from Gujarat. I known of a game played in Gujarat called Chomal Isto.
It is played with cowries or tamarind seeds or dice on an eight by eight square board.
It used to be played in almost every state.
We used to play this game in our state as well
Who amongst us would not have enjoyed playing Gilli-Danda in our childhood
This is a game that is played across villages and cities.
It is also known by different names.
In Andhra Pradesh it is called Gotibilla or Karrabilla.
In Odisha its called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra, Vittidaaloo.
Some games are seasonal.
You must have seen many a child, shy by nature, leap up with zest, the moment a game begins.
From tiny tots to Grandfather-Grandmother, when we all play these games together then the term Generation Gap disappears on its own.
At the same time, we also come to know about our culture and traditions.
Many games also make us aware about our society, environment and other spheres.
Through crowd sourcing we can create a very large archive of our traditional games.
The Videos of these games can be shot, outlining the way to play these games along with the mandatory rules and regulations.
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of June, our nation, India will officially host the World Environment Day Celebrations.
This is a very important achievement for India and it is also an acknowledgement as well as recognition of India's growing leadership in the direction of tackling climate change.
This time the theme is 'Beat Plastic Pollution'.
I appeal to all of you, that while trying to understand the importance of this theme, we should all ensure that we do not use low grade polythene and low grade plastics and try to curb the negative impact of plastic pollution on our environment, on our wild life and our health.
Let us all visit the World Environment Day website wed-india 2018 and try to imbibe and inculcate the many interesting suggestions given there into our everyday life.
In the past few weeks, we all witnessed that there were dust storms in the different regions of the country, along with heavy winds and unseasonal heavy rains.
There was also loss of life and property.
We have to live in harmony and in synchronicity with nature, we have to stay in touch with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this wisdom at every step of his life.
Today when India speaks of climate justice or plays a major role in the Cop21 and Paris agreements or when we unite the whole world through the medium of International Solar Alliance, they all are rooted in fulfilling that very dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this environment day, let all of us give it a good thought as to what can we do to make our planet cleaner and greener
How can we progress in this direction
What innovative things can we do
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, you do remember the 21st of June now
not only you and I, June 21st remains a part of the entire worlds collective consciousness.
The 21st of June has been mandated and is celebrated as the International Yoga Day in the entire world and people start preparing for it months in advance.
The news being received these days is that there are preparations afoot in the whole world to celebrate 21st June as International Yoga Day.
] This observation expressed centuries ago, straightaway implies that practicing yogic exercises on a regular basis leads to imbibing benefic attributes which stand by our side like relatives and friends.
The practice of yoga leads to building up of courage, which always protects us like a father.
The practice of yoga leads to germination of a sense of forgiveness in the same manner as a mother has for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend.
Bhartahari has said that with regular yogic exercise, truth becomes our child, mercy becomes our sister, self restraint our brother, earth turns in to our bed and knowledge satiates our hunger.
When so many attributes become one's partner, then that yogi conquers all forms of fear.
Once again, I appeal to all the citizens to adopt their legacy of yoga and create a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
My dear countrymen, today is the 27th of May, the death anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I render my pranam to Pandit ji.
Memories of this month are also linked with Veer Savarkar.
This was the very month, the month of May 1857, when Indians had displayed their strength against the British.
In many parts of the country, our youth and farmers demonstrated their bravery whilst standing up against the injustice.
It is indeed sad that we kept on calling the events of 1857 only as a rebellion or a soldiers mutiny for a very long time.
In fact, May 1857 was not only evaluated as a minor historical incident but was also an attempt to dent our self-respect.
It is also an amazing coincidence that the month which witnessed the First Struggle for Independence was the month in which Veer Savarkar ji was born.
Savarkar jis personality was full of special qualities
A wonderful account about Savarkarji has been given by our dear honorable Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji.
What an accurate depiction of Savarkar by Atal ji
Savarkar marched along with both poetry and revolution.
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a courageous revolutionary.
My dear brothers and sisters, I was watching a story on TV about our underprivileged daughters of certain slums in Sikar, Rajasthan.
Our daughters, who were forced to sift through garbage and beg from home to home in order to earn a living - today they are learning sewing and stitching clothes to cover the impoverished.
This is an example where the daughters are stitching ordinary to good quality clothes for themselves and other families.
Along with this, they are undergoing a training course in skill development.
These daughters have become self-reliant today and are living their lives with respect and have become a strong support to their families.
I wish all these daughters, brimming with hope and trust, a very bright future.
They have demonstrated that if you have the desire to do something and if you are determined towards that goal then success can be achieved despite all odds And this is not only about Sikar, but in every corner of India, you will witness something akin to this.
If you observe in your neighbourhood, then you will witness for yourselves how people overcome the difficulties in their lives
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, and enjoy tea there, a discussion with some of the customers automatically ensues.
These discussions are also political and social in nature, can be about movies, sports and sportspersons or can focus even on the problems of the country any problem with probable solutions are discussed at length but often the problems and their solutions remain limited to such animated discussions only. But there are some people who go ahead with their work, to bring about a change through their hard work and dedication
Such is the story of D. Prakash Rao, living in the slums of Cuttack, Orissa, who gave up everything of his in order to adopt and realize the dreams of others
Just yesterday Ive had the good fortune of meeting D. Prakash Rao.
Shriman D. Prakash Rao has been a tea vendor in the city of Cuttack for the past five decades.
He ensures education, health and meals for all the children coming to this school.
I congratulate D. Prakash Rao for his hard work, his persistence and for providing a new direction to the lives of those poor children attending his school.
He has banished the darkness from their lives.
His life is an inspiration to us, our society and the whole country.
Come, let us take positivity forward.
The month of June is so hot that people anxiously wait for the rains, gazing towards the sky for the clouds to appear.
People will wait for the moon in a few days from now onwards.
Witnessing the moon means that the festival of Eid can be celebrated.
After an entire month of fasting during Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a harbinger of celebrations.
I hope and believe that everyone will celebrate Eid with gaiety and fervor and on this occasion children will specially get a grand Eidi.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
Heartiest felicitations to all of you.
My dear countrymen, many thanks to you all.
We shall meet once again in another episode of Mann Ki Baat next month.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
V.
Expressing support for this, many people have written to me, sent me letters, shared fitness mantra- Fit India stories on social media. A gentleman Shriman Shashikant Bhonsale, sharing his photo by the swimming pool, has written, My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Rooma Devnath writes, I truly feel happy healthy through my Morning Walks. She further adds, For me, fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy.
Let us turn this vacation into a learning opportunity, for a totally new experience. My dear countrymen
My dear countrymen, we often hear that in, times to come, the world will face a war because of water. Everyone talks about this but do we not have any responsibility towards conservation of water
Do we not feel that water conservation must be a social responsibility
He has written in Gitanjali He, who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students. I do not know Bangla but had the habit of rising early since my childhood and in Eastern India, radio broadcasts start early while in Western India these start a bit late.
I have a faint memory that probably around 5:30 in the morning, Rabindra Sangeet used to be broadcast on radio and I had developed a habit to listen to Rabindra Sangeet on radio. And, whenever I got a chance to listen to poems like Anandloke and Aaguner, Poroshmoni, I used to feel as if my mind was being energised.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian. We must be proud of the fact that India is the birthplace of Lord Buddha, the very synonym of power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people around the world. This Buddha Purnima reminds us of all of our obligation to emulate Lord Buddhas teaching as well as, pledge ourselves to follow his footsteps.
Ambedkar stressed that Lord Buddha has been a great inspiration in his social philosophy. Baba Saheb had said My Social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words
Today is the holy day of Ram Navami.
My heartiest greetings to countrymen on this pious, festive occasion.
We have seen how closely the power of Ram Naam, the chant of Lord Rams name, permeated every moment of revered Bapus life.
A while ago, when distinguished dignitaries of all ASEAN Countries were here on the 26th of January, they were accompanied by cultural troupes from their respective countries. And its a matter of immense pride that a majority of these countries presented the Ramayan in front of us.
This signifies that Ram Ramayan continues to inspire and have a positive impact, not just in India, but in that part of the world too.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ramnavami.
My dear countrymen, just like every time earlier, I have received a rather large number of letters, e mails, phone calls and comments from you.
I read a post written on MyGov by Komal Thakkar ji, where she has referred to starting on-line courses for Sanskrit.
Alongwith being IT professional, your love for Sanskrit has gladdened me.
I have instructed the concerned department to convey to you efforts being made in this direction.
I shall also request listeners of Mann Ki Baat who are engaged in the field of Sanskrit, to ponder over ways means to take Komaljis suggestion forward.
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar ji of Village Baraakar, District Nalanda, Bihar I read your comments written on the Narendra Modi App.
The concerns you have raised on the depleting ground water levels is indeed of great importance.
You have urged one and all to retain and keep aside some water for birds animals, during summer time.
Sakal ji, I have conveyed your sentiments to our listeners.
Shriman Yogesh Bhadresha Ji has asked me to speak to the youth concerning their health.
He feels that our youth are physically weak, compared to those of other Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, I feel I should speak in detail to all of you on Fit India.
Recently, the President of France paid a visit to Kashi, Varanasi based Shriman Prashant Kumar has written that glimpses of that visit were extremely touching, appealing left a deep impact.
And it is his heart felt desire to see all those photos videos being shared on social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India has already done that on social media and the Narendra Modi App, beginning that very day.
Let me tell Anagha, Jayesh other children that these letters enliven me up after a hard days work.
Now, if I start including all those phone calls, comments, whatever I could read or hear, many of which touched my heart if I exclusively speak about them, perhaps Ill require a few months to respond to them in some way or the other.
This time, maximum number of letters are from children who have written about exams.
They have shared their vacation plans.
Theyve expressed their concern on the availability of water for birds animals.
Our farmer brothers sisters have written on Kisan Melas, Farmer Carnivals and activities revolving around farming, being held across the country.
uite a few active citizens have sent in suggestions on the subject of water conservation.
During the festival season, our festivals, our culture, our traditions are focused upon.
And its equally true that our heartfelt thoughts do bring about a change of season in someones life, figuratively speaking.
And why should not things change
In a way, this is endowed with the might to transform the entire season-cycle of the country.
Thirteen years ago, on account of a delay in medical treatment, a Cab driver from Kolkata, Saidul Laskar lost his sister. He vowed to construct a hospital in order to ensure that none of the underprivileged face a similar situation due to lack of medical aid.
In this mission of his, Saidul sold off family jewellery and raised funds through charity.
This way, after mobilizing funds for twelve long years, Saiduls mammoth efforts paid rich dividends. Today, through sheer hard work and a firm resolve, a thirty bedded hospital has finally come up at Punri Village near Kolkata.
Innumerable shining examples like these are the hallmark of our country.
Today, the entire country, the youth, women, the marginalized, the underprivileged, the middle class, in fact every section has awakened to a new confidence ...
YES, we can go forward, the country can take great strides.
An atmosphere of positivity built on a self confidence filled with hope has pervaded all over.
This self confidence, this very positivity will by a catalyst in realising our resolve of New India, of making our dream come true.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very crucial for our farming brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji, Chaudhari Devi Lal ji they all recognized agriculture and the farmer as vital aspects of the nations economy and also for the common mans life.
How attached was Mahatma Gandhi attached to the soil, they farms and the farmer is reflected from this sentence in which he said- To forget how to dig earth and to tend the soil, is to forget ourselves.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastriji generally insisted on conservation of trees, plants and vegetation and also highlighted the importance of an improvised agricultural infrastructure.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lal ji had talked of creating a mass awakening on an extensive scale about the necessary measures to ensure a better income for our farmers and provide better irrigation facilities and to increase food and milk production.
This state has a small area but it has attained a grand success.
Our farmers in Meghalaya, in the year 2015-16, achieved record production as compared to the last five years.
They have showed that if once the targets are set, spirits are high and with a strong resolve, the set targets can most certainly be attained.
I have received a number of letters in which a large number of farmers have written about MSP and they wanted that I should talk to them at length over this.
Brothers and sisters, in this years budget a big decision has been taken to ensure that farmers get a fair price for their produce.
It has been decided that the MSP of notified crops will be fixed at least one and a half times of their cost.
Efforts are on to connect local village mandis to wholesale market and then on with the global market.
Twenty- two thousand rural haats in the country will be upgraded by creating the necessary infrastructure and these will be integrated with APMC and e-NAM platform- so that the farmers would not have to go to distant places for selling their produce.
In other words, such a system is being set up where in farms in any part of the country will have a market-connect.
My dear countrymen, this year Mahatma Gandhis 150th birth anniversary celebrations will begin.
How should the country celebrate it
Swachch Bharat is already our resolve besides this, how can our 125 crore countrymen pay the best tribute to Gandhiji by working in close harmony
I request you all to share your opinions and suggestions with everyone via MyGov.
What should be the logo for Gandhi 150
What should be the slogan, mantra or a catch-phrase
Send your suggestions on all of these.
We all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and have to take the country to newer heights by drawing inspiration from Bapu.
Thanks, you have rightly said it and I believe that Swachch Bharat and Swasth Bharat are supplementary to each other.
In the health sector the nation has now moved ahead from the conventional approach.
Earlier, every aspect regarding health used to be a responsibility of the Health Ministry alone. But now, all departments and ministries- be it the Sanitation Ministry or Ayush Ministry or Ministry of Chemicals Fertilizers, Consumer Affairs Ministry or the Women Child Welfare Ministry or even the State Governments- they are all working together for Swasth Bharat and stress is being laid on affordable health alongside preventive health.
Preventive health care is the least costly and the easiest one as well.
And, the more we become aware about preventive health care, the more beneficial will it be for the individuals, the family and the society.
The first necessity for a healthy life is cleanliness.
Yoga has attained worldwide recognition as a measure of preventive health care.
Yoga is a guarantee of both fitness and wellness.
It is the result of our concerted efforts and commitment that Yoga has now become a mass movement and reached every house.
Less than a hundred days are now left for the International Yoga Day on 21st June.
On the previous three International Yoga Days, people in our country and people all over the world participated with great zeal and enthusiasm.
This time too, we need to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and motivate our family, friends and all others from now itself to do yoga.
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
I will share these videos with you so that we may do aasans and pranayam together.
Efforts are being extensively undertaken to make health care accessible and affordable, make it easily accessible and affordable for the common man.
Presently, more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country and more than eight hundred medicines are being made available there at an affordable price.
More such centres are being opened.
I appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to provide this information about Jan Anshadhi Kendras to the needy ones it will cut their expense on medicines.
This will be a big help to them.
The cost of heart stent for heart patients has been reduced to 85.
Under Ayushman Bharat Yojana , the Government of India and insurance companies will jointly provide 5 lakh repees for treatment to about 10 crore families or say 50 crore citizens per year.
In the present 479 medical colleges, MBBS seats have been increased to about 68 thousand.
One new medical college will be set up for every three districts.
A target has been fixed to make the country TB-free by 2025.
This is an enormous task.
Your cooperation is needed to create public awareness.
All of us will need to make united efforts to become TB-free.
My dear countrymen, April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
According to him the industry was an effective medium by which jobs could be made available to the poorest of the poor and the poorer.
Today India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy and today the highest foreign direct investment or FDI in the world, is flowing to India.
The whole world is looking at India as a hub for investment innovation and development.
That the development of industries could only be possible in the cities, was the kernel of the idea of Dr. Baba Sahib Ambedkar and that was the reason he banked upon urbanization of India.
In continuance with his vision, smart city mission and urban mission were kick-started in the country so that all kinds of amenities whether good roads, water supply, health facilities, Education or digital connectivity are available in the big cities and small towns of the country.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in self-reliance.
He did not want anybody to languish in poverty forever.
He also believed that poverty cannot be ameliorated by mere distribution of capital among the impoverished.
Today our monetary policy, Start Up India, Stand Up India initiative have become seedbed for our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
In the 30s and 40s when only roads and railways were being talked about in India, Baba Saheb Ambedkar mentioned about ports and waterways.
It was Dr. Baba Saheb who envisaged water power as nation power.
Today there are landmark efforts, being embarked upon for waterways and ports in our country.
New seaports are being constructed on a number of seaways of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
In the era of 40s, while most of the discussions were centred around the Second World War, the looming Cold war and the partition it was during those times Dr.
Ambedkar had laid the foundation of Team India's spirit in a way.
He had talked about the importance of federalism, federal system and stressed on Center and states working together for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted in all aspects of governance the mantra of co-operative federalism and going a step further, we have adopted competitive cooperative federalism but most importantly, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for millions of people like me, who belong to backward classes.
He showed us that to succeed it is not necessary for the person to be born in an illustrious or rich family, but even those who are born to poor families in India can also dare to dream their dreams and realize those dreams by achieving success.
And of course, this is exactly what happened as many people mocked Dr.
It is an India which is Ambedkars India, of the poor and the backward.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar from April 14 to May 5 Gram-Swaraj Abhiyan, is being organized.
Under the aegis of this campaign, separate programmes on village development, poverty amelioration and social justice will be held throughout India.
I urge you all to be a part of this campaign.
My dear countrymen, a spectrum of many festivals would dawn upon us in the next few days- Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and the Baisakhi.
The day of Bhagwan Mahavir's birth anniversary is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavirji, the apostle of non-violence will inspire us all.
I extend felicitations to all on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti.
The very mention of Easter reminds us of the inspirational preaching of Lord Jesus Christ which has always impressed on mankind the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion.
Vaisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and in parts of western India in April simultaneously, the twin festive connects of Jud -Sheetal and Satuwain in Bihar, and Poila Vaisakh in West Bengal will envelop everyone with joy and delight.
All of these festivals are connected in one way or another to our fields and granaries, and through these festivals, we thank nature for the priceless gifts we receive as produce.
Once again, my best wishes to you all on the occasion of the festivals coming our way.
Let us begin todays Mann Ki Baat with a phone call.
All of us have seen that the sea appears blue, but we know from routine life experiences that water has no colour at all.
Have we ever thought why water acquires colour in rivers and seas
The same thought occurred to a young man in the 1920s.
The same question gave rise to a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about Science, the first name that strikes us is that of Bharat Ratna Sir C. V.
One of his discoveries is famous as the Raman Effect.
We celebrate the 28th of February as National Science Day since on this very day, he is said to have discovered the phenomenon of light scattering, for which the Nobel Prize was conferred upon him.
This land has given birth to many a great scientist.
On the one hand, there has been a tradition of great Mathematicians like Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupt and Aryabhatt on the other, in the field of medicine, Sushrut Charak have bestowed upon us a place of pride.
Right from Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargobind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose have brought laurels to India.
The famous particle BOSON has been named after Satyendranath Bose.
It was interesting to know about the ongoing miraculous accomplishments in the field of Science.
Through self learning, machines today can enhance their intelligence to a smarter level.
Can we use it to provide assistance to farmers on crop yield
A few days ago, I got an opportunity to accompany the Prime Minister of Israel to Ahmedabad, Gujarat for the inauguration of I create.
Science and Technology are value neutral.
They dont possess any value in themselves.
Any machine will work the way we want it to.
It entirely depends on us what task we want it to perform.
Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, failed many a time in his experiments.
Once, on being asked about it, he quipped, I have devised ten thousand ways of how NOT to make a light bulb. What I mean to say is, Edison transformed even his failures into his own strength.
Coincidentally, I am fortunate today to be in Auroville, the land, the karmabhoomi of Maharshi Arvind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged British rule, fought against them and questioned subjugation.
Thus, as a great sage, he questioned every facet of life.
Extracting answers, he showed the right path to humanity.
The relentless quest to ask questions for knowing the truth is very important.
And this is the very essence, the real inspiration behind scientific inventions and discoveries.
Never rest till every why, what how are answered.
I congratulate our scientists, and all those connected with Science on the occasion of National Science Day.
Friends, safety in the times of crises, disasters are topics on which many messages keep coming in- people keep writing to me.
In a comment posted on Narendra Modi Mobile App, Shriman Ravindra Singh from Pune has referred to occupational safety.
He writes that in our country, safety standards at factories and construction sites are not upto the mark.
Since the 4th of March is National Safety Day, the Prime Minister should include safety in the Mann Ki Baat programme in order to raise awareness on safety.
If we are not aware of safety in daily life, if we are not able to attain a certain level, it will get extremely difficult during the time of disasters.
We often read signboards on streets bearing lines such as Lose alertness invite mishaps or , One mistake can cost you dear- rob you of your joy smile or , Dont be in a hurry to leave this world embrace the culture of safety or Dont play around with safety, your life will be treated cheap. Beyond that, these sentences serve no purpose in our lives.
If we stay alert, abide by the prescribed rules regulations, we shall not only be able to save our own lives but we can prevent catastrophes harming society.
There are times when we come across many slogans on safety at the work place but none following their letter and spirit.
In a way it will a natural part of the overall learning curve. India is a land of geographic and climatic diversities.
As far as disasters are concerned, this country has borne the brunt of many a natural as well as man made disaster, such as chemical industrial mishaps.
In Districts prone to floods and cyclones, an initiative names Aapada Mitra has been launched for training Volunteers.
Training and awareness have a very important role to play.
Two- three years ago, thousands of people would lose their lives every year due to heat-wave.
After that, NDMA organized workshops on heat wave management as part of a campaign to raise awareness in people.
Mass participation led to good results.
In 2017, the death toll on account of heat wave remarkably came down to around 220 or so.
This proves that if we accord priority to safety, we can actually attain safety.
I laud the role played by innumerable individuals, citizens who immediately embark upon rescue and relief operations wherever a disaster strikes.
And there are numerous such unnamed, unsung heroes.
Well have to turn ourselves into a risk conscious society.
In our culture, we often talk of safety of values we now need to realize the values of safety.
Well have to make it part of our life, our being.
So, was there a provision for giving our information
WHY
Because by nature, we are not conscious. And that is why our ears hear when we sit in the aircraft, but no one realizes that these instructions are for me.
We experience this in all walks of life.
Let us not think that safety is only meant for someone else. If all of us become conscious and aware of our own safety, the essence of safety of society will be inbuilt.
My dear countrymen, in the current budget, emphasis has been laid on turning waste to wealth and waste to energy through Bio gas, under the Swachch Bharat Campaign.
An effort was initiated which was named GOBAR-Dhan - Galvanizing Organic Bio Agro Resources.
The aim of this GOBAR- DHAN scheme is ensuring cleanliness in villages and generating wealth and energy by converting cattle dung and solid agricultural waste into Compost and Bio Gas.
Some European countries and China use animal dung and other Bio-waste to produce energy. But India was lacking full capacity utilization.
Under the Swachch Bharat Mission (Rural), we are taking rapid strides in this direction.
A target has been set to use cattle dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste to produce Bio gas based energy.
Under the Gobardhan Scheme our farmer brothers sisters in rural India will be encouraged to consider dung and other waste not just as a waste but as a source of income.
Under the aegis of 'GobarDhanYojana', many benefits will accrue to rural areas.
It will be easier to keep the village clean and sanitized, livestock health will improve and farm yields will increase.
Biogas generation will increase self-reliance in energy utilized for cooking and lighting.
Farmers and cattle herders will be helped in augmenting their income.
There will be novel opportunities for newer jobs linked to waste collection, transportation, biogas sales etc.
An online trading platform will be created for better implementation of 'Gobar Dhan Yojana', it will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers can get the right price for dung and agricultural waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially our sisters residing in rural India, to step forward, and through creation of self-help groups and cooperative societies extract full advantage from this opportunity.
I invite you to become part of the movement comprising clean energy and green jobs, to become a part of the initiative to convert waste in your village to wealth and by converting dung into Gobar dhan.
My dear countrymen, till date, we have been hearing about the myriad types of festivals - be it music festivals, food festivals, film festivals and many other kinds of festivals.
But in a unique endeavor in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the state's first 'Trash Mahotsav' was organized.
The objective behind this festival sponsored by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to generate awareness about cleanliness and the methods using which city's waste can be creatively used and inculcate awareness about various ways to recycle the garbage.
A plethora of activities were organized during this festival, which found full participation of students and adults.
Different types of artifacts were made utilizing garbage.
Many Workshops were organized to inform people on the entire aspects of waste management.
Raipur inspired various types of such garbage or trash festivals in other districts too.
Many individuals taking initiative on their own behalf shared innovative ideas, held discussions, conducted poetry recitals.
A festive atmosphere regarding cleanliness got geared up.
The way the school children took part in the entire endeavor was amazing.
For the innovative manner in which importance of waste management and cleanliness were displayed in this festival, I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the entire populace of Chhattisgarh, its government and administration.
Every year on March 8, 'International Women's Day' is celebrated.
There are many programs that are held in our country and the world.
On this day, women are also felicitated with 'Nari Shakti Puraskar' who have performed exemplary tasks in different sectors in the past.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda.
Hed said 'The idea of perfect womanhood is perfect independence' - This idea of Swami ji about one hundred and twenty five years ago expresses the contemplation of woman power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure the participation of women in every field of life, be it social or economic life, it is our fundamental duty.
We are part of a tradition where men were identified due to women-Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-Putra, these were identities of a son.
Not only has she advanced herself but has carried forward the country and society to newer heights.
A few days ago, a gentleman had given me a very sound proposition.
He had suggested that on 8th March myriad events herald 'Women's Day' Why cannot we felicitate mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every Indian village or city,
Can a program of paying respect for such centenarians be held and cannot we reflect upon a life lived long
Under the auspices of this campaign starting from January 26, 2018, these women constructed 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days and made a record of sorts.
There were about one lakh Sakhi Mandals, 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water carriers, 10 thousand female cleaners and 50 thousand women masons were involved in this campaign.
You can imagine what a mammoth undertaking it was
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is an integral component of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which will change the course of the campaign of cleanliness in general life, the effective role of hygiene in the nature of the people ingeneral.
My dear Brothers and sisters, I was just watching the TV news two days ago that electricity has reached three villages of the Elephanta island after 70 years of independence, and this has led to much joy and enthusiasm among the people there.
You all know very well, that Elephanta is located 10 kms by the sea from Mumbai.
I was surprised to know that despite being such a prominent center of tourism its close proximity from Mumbai, electricity hadnt reached Elephanta after so many years of independence.
For 70 years, the lives of the denizens of three villages of the Elephanta Island, Rajbunder, Morbandar and Centabandar, were engulfed by darkness, which has got dispelled now and there is brightness in their lives.
I congratulate the administration and the populace there.
I am glad that now the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be lighted due to electrification.
This is not just electricity, but a new beginning of a period of development.
There is no greater contentment and joy than the fact that the lives of the countrymen be full of shine and there be happiness in their lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, we just celebrated the festival of Shivaratri.
And now the month of March beckons us with ripe crops in the fields, playful golden earrings of wheat and the captivating blossom of mango pleasing to the mind are the highlights of this month.
But this month is also very special to all of us because of the festival of Holi.
On 2nd March the entire country immersed in joy will celebrate the festival of Holi.
In The festival of Holi, the importance of colors is as important as the ceremony of 'HolikaDahan' because it is the day when we burn our inherent vices in the fire.
Holi makes us forget our rancours and gives us an opportunity to be a part of each other's happiness and glad tidings, and it conveys the message of love, unity and brotherhood.
I wish a very joyous festival of Holi to all my countrymen, I further wish you colour laden felicitations.
I wish and hope that this festival forever remains a festival of colourful cheer in the lives of all the countrymen- this is my wish.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
My dear countrymen, Shriman Prakash Tripathi has written a rather long letter on the Narendra Modi App, urging me to touch upon the subjects he has referred to.
He writes, The 1st of February is the death anniversary of astronaut Kalpana Chawla.
She left us in the Columbia space shuttle mishap, but not without becoming a source of inspiration for millions of young people the world over.
I am thankful to Bhai Prakash ji for beginning his long letter with the sad departure of Kalpana Chawla.
Its a matter of sorrow for all of us that we lost Kalpana Chawla at that early age, but her life, her work is a message to young women across the world, especially to those in India, that there are no upper limits for Nari Shakti ...
If one possesses the will the determination, a firm resolve to achieve something, nothing is impossible.
Its a matter of joy that women in India are taking rapid strides of advancement in all fields, bringing glory to the Nation.
In our country, respect for women, their status in society and their contribution has proved to be awe inspiring to the entire world, since ancient times.
There has been a long tradition of Vidushis...
Many Vidushis of India have contributed in composing the verses of the Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee...
This underscores the importance that has been given to women in our society.
And that is why, in our society, women have been accorded the status of Shakti.
This woman power binds closely together society as a whole, the family as a whole, on the axis of unity oneness.
Shriman Prakash Tripathi has further cited some examples.
He writes that the flight of our courageous Defence Minister Nirmala Seetharaman in a Sukhoi 30 fighter plane is inspirational for him.
Three braveheart women Bhavna Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become fighter pilots and are undergoing training on the Sukhoi- 30.
An Air India Boeing jet with an all woman crew led by Kshamata Vajpayee flew from Delhi to San Francisco, USA and back.
These are all women achievers. You are absolutely right.
A few days ago, Honble President took an initiative.
He met a group of extraordinary women who have achieved something significanty new in their respective fields.
Women achievers of our country... the first female Merchant Navy Captain, the first female passenger train driver, the first female fire fighter, the first female Bus Driver, the first woman to set foot on Antarctica, the first woman to reach Mount Everest... First Ladies in every field.
They proved that through perseverance, grit and a firm resolve, all kinds of obstacles and barriers can be broken crossed, to chart out an all new path...
A book has been compiled on these women achievers, first ladies, so that, the entire country comes to know about the power of these women and derive inspiration from their life work.
This is also available as an e-book on the Narendra Modi Website.
The countrys woman power has contributed a lot in the positive transformation being witnessed in our country society these days.
Today, as we speak of women empowerment, I would like to refer to a railway station.
You must be wondering what a railway station has got to do with women empowerment.
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India which is run by an all woman staff.
All departments have women performing duties... the commercial department, Railway Police, Ticket checking, Announcing, Point persons, its a staff comprising over 40 women.
This time, after watching the Republic Day Parade, many people wrote on Twitter and other social media that a major highlight of the parade was the BSF biker contingent comprising women participants.
Daredevil stunts performed by them was awe inspiring for our foreign guests.
Empowerment is another form of self reliance.
Today our Nari Shakti is assuming leadership roles.
It is becoming self reliant.
When we refer to Adivasi women, a stereotypical image comes to our minds, comprising jungles, pathways in the woods and women carrying kindlewood on their heads.
But the woman power of Chattisgarh, the tribal women there broke this stereotype presented an all new picture of themselves.
Dantewada in Chattisgarh is a Maoist infested region.
Violence, torture, explosives, guns, pistols... the Maoists have created a scary reign of terror.
In this dangerous atmosphere, Adivasi women are becoming self reliant by driving e-rickshaws.
In a short span of time, a number of women have become part of this phenomenon.
I laud the efforts of the District Administration which has played a significant role in the successful endeavour of these women by ensuring availability of grants imparting training to them.
Leaving out things that are beyond the constraints of time and accepting betterment in things wherever necessary.
The benchmark of any living society is its self correcting mechanism.
In our country, there have been unending endeavours against social ills and evil practices, both individually collectively.
Just a while ago, Bihar launched an interesting initiative.
In order to uproot social ills in the state, the worlds longest human chain spanning over thirteen thousand kilometers was formed.
This campaign made people aware of social maladies such as child-marriage and the dowry system.
The entire state thus resolved to fight against these social evils.
Children, the elderly, the youth full of energy and enthusiasm, women, girls turned out to participate in this battle.
The human chain that commenced formation from Gandhi Maidan in Patna gained momentum, touching the state borders.
In order to ensure that the fruits of progress rightly reach all sections of society, it is imperative that our society is freed of these ills.
Come, let us pledge to come together to wipe out these evil customs from our social fabric...
let us build an empowered, capable New India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister, the administration, in fact every member of the human chain for this massive, special initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan from Mysore, Karnataka has written on My gov. He was undergoing an expenditure of six thousand rupees a month on medicines alone for the treatment of his father.
Earlier, he wasnt aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
But now that hes come to know of the Jan Aushadhi Kendra, he has begun purchasing medicines from there and his expenses have been reduced by about 75.
He has expressed his wish that I mention this in Mann Ki Baat, so that it reaches the maximum number of people and they can benefit from it.
Over some time lately, many have written on this subject many of them have been telling me about it.
It gives you inner satisfaction.
I felt good to see Shriman Darshan ji think about sharing with others what he gained from it.
The motive behind this scheme is making healthcare affordable and encouraging Ease of Living.
Medicines available at the Jan Aushadhi Centres are 50 to 90 cheaper than branded drugs available in the market.
This is great help for the common man, especially for senior citizens who require medicines on a daily basis and results in a lot of savings.
Generic medicines sold under this scheme strictly conform to prescribed standards set by the World Health Organisation.
That is why good quality medicines are made available at affordable prices.
Today, over three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This has led to not only availability of cheaper medicines, but also new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are now available at Amrit Stores at Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Jan Aushadhi Centres at hospitals.
The sole aim behind this step is ensuring availability of uality affordable health service to the poorest of the poor, so that a healthy prosperous India comes into being.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
It was such a striking photo that my attention was magnetically drawn towards it.
The photo showed that a grandson was participating in the 'Clean Morna River' along with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organized a cleanliness campaign to clean the Morna river under the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan'.
The Morna river was a perennial river flowing throughout the twelve months of the year but now it has become seasonal.
The second painful fact was that the river was completely filled with wild grass and hyacinth.
A lot of garbage was being dumped into the river and along its banks.
An action plan was chalked out and on January 13th a day before Makar-Sankranti, in the first phase of 'Mission Clean Morna' sanitation of the two sides of the bank of the Morna river at fourteen places spread over an area of four kilometers, was carried out.
This noble and grand task named 'Mission Clean Morna', involved more than six thousand denizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, Colleges, Students, children, the elderly, mothers, sisters, almost everybody participated in this task.
On January 20th, 2018, this Sanitation Campaign continued in the same vein and Ive been told that this campaign will continue every Saturday morning till the Morna river is completely cleaned.
'Mission Clean Morna' shows that if a person is determined to do something, then nothing is impossible.
Huge social reforms can be brought about through mass movements.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and the municipal corporations administration, all the citizens who were associated with this mass movement, I laud your efforts which are not only very much appreciated but this will inspire the other citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, these days you must be hearing a lot about the Padma Awards.
These awards also attract attention in newspapers and television also.
There was a certain methodology of awarding Padma Awards every year, but this entire process has been changed for the past three years.
Now any citizen can nominate any person in our country.
Transparency has been brought about in the entire process by making it operable online.
In a way, the selection of these awards has been transformed completely.
You may have noticed that many ordinary people not visible in big cities, in newspapers or on TV are being awarded with Padma citations.
Now the identity of the awardee is not the deciding factor of the award, rather the importance of his work is increasing.
You must have heard the name of Arvind Gupta ji.
It will gladden your heart to know, that Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent all his life creating toys for children.
He has been making toys from garbage for over four decades so that children can increase their curiosity towards science.
He has been trying to get children inspired to conduct scientific experiments using waste towards this end he has been encouraging children by showing them films made in 18 languages in three thousand schools across the country.
What a wonderful life, what a dedicated mission
A similar story is that of Sitavaa Jodatti from Karnataka.
She has not been hailed as 'Goddess of women empowerment' just for nothing
For the past three decades, in Belagavi, she has made a great contribution towards changing the lives of countless women.
At the age of seven she had dedicated herself as a Devadasi but in a turnaround, for the welfare of the Devdasis, she has spent her entire life.
Not only this, she has done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women too.
You must have heard the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shri Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor tribal family.
He was employed in a small job for eking out his living, but he was also fond of painting in the traditional tribal art form.
Today, due to this hobby, he garnered respect not only in India but the entire world.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who made India proud in many nations abroad, was also recognized and he was awarded the Padma Shri.
You will be pleasantly surprised listening to the story of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutti.
Laxmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still resides in a hut made of palm leaves in a tribal tract amidst dense forests.
She has created five hundred herbal medicines relying solely on her memory.
She has mastery in synthesizing medicines used for treatment of snake bites.
Lakshmi Ji is continuously serving society with her knowledge of herbal medicines.
Identifying her anonymous persona, she has been honoured with the Padma Shri for her contribution to society.
I would like to mention another name today, that of 75 year old Subhasini Mistri, hailing from West Bengal, who was selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistri is a woman who, in order to construct a hospital, cleaned utensils in the homes of others and also sold vegetables.
At the age of 23 she lost her husband due to lack of proper treatment, and this incident inspired her to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in this hospital that has come up through hard-work.
I am convinced that there are many men and women in our land filled with gems, Bahuratna-Vasundhara, many gifted women and men who remain faceless or unknown.
The failure to identify such people is also a loss to the society, the Padma awards are only a medium of acknowledgement, but I would also like to tell the countrymen that people serving the society around us, people giving up all that they have got for the sake of society, millions of people who have worked for a life time for us bestowed with one or the other useful attribute should be acknowledged in our midst.
They do not labour for any honor, but their work inspires us.
These people should be invited to schools and colleges to share their experiences.
Beyond awards, there should be some more efforts from our society in acknowledging their contribution.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas on January 9th every year.
It was on the 9th of January, when our revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond that exists between Indians in India and Indians living around the globe.
This year we organized a program on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, where all MPs and Mayors of Indian origin were invited.
You will be pleased to know that in this programme, Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Surinam, South Africa and America, and many other countries wherever our Mayors or MPs of Indian Origin exist, all of them participated.
I am happy that the people of Indian origin who live in different countries continue to serve those countries and at the same time they have maintained their strong relationship with India as wellThis time, the European Union, has sent me a calendar, in which they have displayed the contributions by Indians in various fields of life living in different countries of Europe
whether working in the field of cyber security, or dedicated to Ayurveda, entertaining the society through music, or through poetry
someone researching on climate change or working on ancient Indian texts, someone driving a truck for livelihood, who went on to construct a Gurudwara or has built a mosque wherever our people are, they have in their own way embellished or adorned the land of their adoption.
I would thus like to thank the European Union, for recognizing the people of Indian origin and through them in making people in India and people the world over aware of their exemplary work.
The 30th of January is the death anniversary of our revered Bapu, who showed us a new path.
On that day we also observe 'martyrs day' in solemn memory of the great martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the defense of the country and pay our homage at 11 in the morning.
The path of peace and non-violence, is the path of Bapu and this is applicable not only for India or the world, but also for a person or a family or a society.
The ideals which Bapu practiced in his life, things that he imparted are relevant even today.
They were not just mere theories.
At present we witness at every step how accurate Bapu's words were.
What can be a bigger tribute than taking a vow that we shall tread the path of Bapu - and walk, as far as possible
My dear countrymen, with my best wishes to all of you for 2018, my speech draws to a close.
Where the youth between 18 and 25 could sit together and brain storm about new India, find ways and chalk our plans.
How could we realize our resolves before 2022
How could we build an India of the dreams of our freedom fighters
B.
A.
These are the strength of our nation, they are my youth, they are the future of my country. My dear countrymen, whenever there is a reference to famous religious places, not only of India but of the whole world, it is very natural to mention about the Sabrimala temple of Kerala. Millions of devotees come to this world famous temple, seeking blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami.
And especially, since this place is situated in the midst of hills and forests. But, Sabrimala temple in itself is an example to show how this challenge could be converted into a sanskar, a habit and what a tremendous strength public participation has One police officer P.
Who would have drafted such rules
There must be hardly an Indian citizen who does not show deep regard for her, does not revere her.
She is elder to most of us and has been a witness to myriad phases, different eras the country has passed through.
She turns ninety this 28th of September.
Before leaving on the foreign tour, I was blessed with an opportunity to converse with her on the phone.
This chat was akin to a younger brother speaking to his elder sister affectionately.
Modi Ji : Lata Didi, Pranaam.
This is Narendra Modi speaking.
Modi Ji : So, I thought, before leaving, I would wish you in advance... heartiest best wishes on your birthday.
Lata Didi: There are many who are elder just by age, but greater are the blessings of those who do great work, and hence are greater.
Lata Didi: All this is just the fruit of the blessings of my parents the blessings of my listeners.
I am a nobody.
For everyone from the new generation, it is a lesson. For us it is an immense source of inspiration that even after reaching glorious heights, you have always accorded the highest priority to acknowledge the upbringing, the sanskar bestowed by your parents and also to being humble.
Lata Didi: Jee...
Modi Ji : And whenever I visited you, you offered me a variety of Gujarati dishes.
Lata Didi: You do not have an idea of what you are.
I know for sure that your advent is transforming the landscape of India.
It gives me joy, feels nice.
Modi Ji : Didi, all we want is that you continue blessing us, blessing the whole country, may we keep on doing the good work. I keep getting your letters and gifts as well.
Our close bond feels like family and gives me immense joy.
Lata Didi: Of course.
I do not wish to trouble you further, since I can see how busy you are with myriad pressures on the work front.
There are so many things that you have to think of.
After you had gone to touch your mothers feet, I too sent someone to her to seek her blessings.
Modi Ji : Yes.
My mother remembered. She was telling me that.
Lata Didi: And she blessed me over the telephone. I felt overjoyed.
Once again, I extend my heartiest wishes for your birthday.
This time when I had come to Mumbai, I felt like meeting you in person.
Lata Didi: Of course, sure.
I shall feel fortunate privileged.
Modi Ji : Pranaam, Didi.
Lata Didi: Pranaam.
Modi Ji : Lots of good wishes to youLata Didi: Greetings to you.
Modi Ji : Pranaam Didi.
The ensuing weeks shall be witness to the sparkle of festivals throughout the country.
Heartiest greetings to all of you for these festivals to come.
During festivals, families come together.
Perhaps this adage is not just a set of words for us, it is an order a philosophical thought, or an inspiration.
there are some homes, bathed in shimmering lights on the other hand, just close by, there are some homes mired in darkness.
There are homes where sweetmeats are left to rot there are homes where children yearn for a sweet
The true joy radiating out of festivals is only when the darkness subsides and dissipates and a radiant glow emerges.
Let us distribute joy, where there is a paucity of it...
On the one hand, when we experience the Delivery In of sweetmeats, apparel, gifts and so on, let us think for a moment on the process of Delivery Out.
At least in our homes, items that are in excess and thus, not required anymore, could be allocated for Delivery Out.
In many cities, many NGOs run by young friends have formed Start ups for this endeavor.
They collect clothes, sweets, food from homes, look for the needy and hand them over discreetly.
Can we, this time, during the festival season, dispel some of the darkness beneath the lamp with due awareness and resolve
The smiles thus accrued on the faces of numerous underprivileged families will more than double your joy during festivals... your faces will be lit up with a glow that will brighten your Diwali immensely.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi, the goddess of wealth, makes an entry into each and every household in the form of fortune and prosperity.
In our culture, daughters are considered Laxmi, since they are harbinger of fortune and prosperity.
This Diwali, can we arrange programmes to honor the Laxmi of India
If you look around, youll find many daughters and daughters-in-law who are performing extraordinarily.
Some must be engaged in teaching underprivileged children, others could be occupied in spreading awareness in the field of sanitation and health, while many could be doing society a service by working as Doctor and Engineers.
Or striving for justice to someone by working as Lawyer
Our society must recognize such daughters, honor them and feel proud of them.
Programmes to felicitate them should be held throughout the country.
We could do something more we could highlight the achievements of these daughters by sharing their achievements on social media, using the hashtag BHARAT KI LAMI.
The way we jointly ran a mega campaign Selfi with daughter, which spread globally.
Similarly, this time, let us do a campaign BHARAT KI LAMI.
Encouraging the Laxmi of Bharat amounts to strengthening the paths of prosperity for the country and her citizens.
My dear countrymen, as I have mentioned earlier, a great advantage of Mann Ki Baat is that, Im blessed with the opportunity to converse with a lot of people, known or unknown, directly or indirectly.
A few days ago, AleenaTaayang, a student from far off Arunachal has written an interesting letter to me.
Respected Mr. Prime Minister, my name is Aleena Taayang.
I hail from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
On my exam result this time, some people asked me if I had read the book Exam Warriors
I replied in the negative.
But on returning, I purchased the book and read it more than twice.
My experience after that has been very good.
I felt, had I read the book before my exams, I wouldve benefitted a great deal.
I liked quite a few aspects of this book, but I noticed that it contains may mantras for students, but for parents and teachers this book does not have much.
My young student friends, first of all, I thank you for writing to me.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors more than twice and special thanks for pointing out shortcomings in the book.
As you have told me, I shall positively try to write something for parents as well as teachers, as and when I get the time to pen a new edition.
It is about experiences in your daily lives. I call upon all students, teachers and parents to come up with your experiences and suggestions on aspects of stress free exams.
I shall duly go through them, study them.
Ill give it due thought and whatever comes across as apt, I shall try and incorporate that in my own words.
So, I shall eagerly wait for your thoughts to flow.
Once again, I express my gratitude to our little friend, student Aleena Taayang from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you update yourselves with the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers and television, you even discuss the engagements.
But, I hope you are aware that I am just as common a being as you are.
in the case of Medvedev, there was no sign of the slightest pallor on his countenance. Rather, his expression lit up the faces of those watching him with meaningful smiles.
He won hearts with his humility and simplicity the epitome of the spirit of sportsmanship in the truest sense that he is, in letter and spirit.
Spectators welcomed his reflections with warmth and fervor.
The way Medvedev heaped praise on his opponent after a defeat in a fierce duel makes him a living example of the true essence of the spirit of sportsmanship.
Of course, on the other hand champion Nadal too showered glowing praise on Daniils game.
The display of the indomitable ardour of the defeated and the sheer humility of the victorious in the same frame was a sight to behold.
The wisdom of our ancestors is truly praiseworthy.
Our ancient texts observe: : Meaning, when ability and humility amalgamate in a person, whose heart will he not be able to win over
As a matter of fact, this young player has won the hearts of people across the globe.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, what I am going to tellyou now is directly for your benefit.
Things that spawn and spread a lot are very difficult to stop at later stages.
But, if we become aware at an early stage and put a stop to it, then a lot can be saved.
Continuing in the same vein, I feel, today, that I should definitely have a talk with my young friends.
We all know that addiction to, tobaccois very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit this addiction.
People who consume tobacco are vulnerable to high risk diseases like cancer, diabetes, blood pressure etc.
Everyone knows that.
Tobacco intoxication occurs due to the nicotine present in it.
Brain development is hampered by its consumption during adolescence.
But, today, I want to have a discourse with you on a new topic.
You must be knowing that, recently the e-cigarette got banned in India.
An e-cigarette is a type of electronic device unlike a typical cigarette.
While we all understand the dangers of common cigarettes, a misconception has been generated about e-cigarettes.
The myth that has been spread is that e-cigarettes pose no danger.
His effort is that no family member should take to smoking.
He knows that smoking or tobacco causes great damage to the body.
The smoker also knows this fact and so do people around.
But the case of e-cigarettes is quite different.
There is little awareness among people about e-cigarette.
They are also completely unaware of its danger and for this reason sometimes e-cigarettessneak into the house out of sheer curiosity.
And our real wealth -the youth become condemned to tread on the path of waste, quite unaware
In fact, many harmful chemicals are added to e-cigarettes, which have a deleterious effect on health.
You are aware of the fact that when someone smokes around us, we come to know about it through its odour.
However, this is not the case with an e-cigarette and many teenagers and young people, unknowingly and sometimes proudly displaying an e-cigaretteas a fashion statement, keep itbetwixt their books, in their offices, in their pockets, sometimes hold it in their hands and thus fall prey to it.
The younger generation is the future of our country.
The e-cigarette has been banned so that this new form of intoxication does not destroy our demographically young country.
It does not trample the dreams of a family and waste the lives of our children.
This scourge and this obnoxious habit should not become rooted in our society.
I urge all of you to quit the addiction to tobacco and do not harbour any misconceptions about e-cigarettes.
Come, let us all build a healthy India.
Oh Yes
Do you still remember Fit India
Fit India does not mean that if we go to the gym for two hours every morning and evening, it will suffice
Our Mother India, our country is a bountiful land
Many gems of human beings took birth here.
India has not only been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, but also the land of their karma.
And these are the people who have spent themselves in service of others.
One such illustrious Indian is being honoured in Vatican City on 13th October.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that, on the coming 13thOctober, His Holiness Pope Francis will declare Sister MariamThresia a saint.
Sister MariamThresia, in her short lifespan of 50 years, worked for the good of humanity becominganoble example for the entire world.
She rendered service in the fields of education and social service.
She had built many schools, hostels and orphanages, and throughout her life, remained devoted to this cause.
I once again pay heart felt tributes to Sister MariamThresia and congratulate the citizens of India, and especially our Christian brothers and sisters, for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world today, while we are celebrating Gandhi 150, our 130 crore countrymen have pledged to be rid from the menace of Single Use Plastic.
In view of the kind of lead that India has taken towards environmental protection, today the countries of the entire world are looking towards India as a model example.
I am confident that you will all be a part of the campaign for liberation from the menace of Single Use Plastic on 2ndOctober.
In India, citizens are contributing in this campaign in their own way.
But, a young man from our country has initiated a very unique campaign.
My attention was drawn towards his work, so, I talked to him on the phone and tried to understand the new experiment being attempted by him.
It could be that this attempt of his may work for other people of our country.
RipudamanBelviji is making an unique effort by attemptingplogging
When I first encountered the term Plogging, it was novel even to me.
Perhaps this word is in usage in certain measure in foreign lands.
But, in India, RipudamanBelviji has promoted it to a great extent.
Let's talk to him.
And friends this time on the anniversary of revered Bapu, the Ministry of Sports too is organizing a Fit India Plogging Run.
On the 2nd of October, plogging for two kilometers and it will be held across the country.
We heard through the experiences of Ripudaman Ji, how this programme should be organised
Through endeavor, we shall not only pay better attention to our health we shall also take a step towards ensuring protection for Mother Earth.
This campaign is resulting in raising awareness levels in people as far as sanitation and cleanliness, along with fitness levels.
I do believe that a single step towards freedom from single use plastic taken by 130 crore countrymen will give India a lead by a 130 crore steps.
Ripudaman ji, once again, many thanks to you.
And to your team, and your imaginative, innovative bent of mind, heartiest congratulations from my side.
We want to move forward devoting our lives in the interest of the nation.
I would like to remind you one thing in advance.
Although in the next episode of 'Mann Ki Baat' I shall dwell upon it in detail, still today I am telling this ina advance so that you get time to prepare.
You do remember that, 31stOctober is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and that Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat is our common dream
So, better start preparing from this instant onwards
I shall talk about it in detail later, but right now we have time on our hands some people can begin their practice, whereas some can chalk out a plan.
My dear countrymen, you will remember, that on 15 August, I had in my address said from the ramparts of Red Fort that by 2022, you should visit 15 tourist destinations in India.
At least 15 places and if possible, make a program to stay over there for an over night, two-night stay.
You should observe, understand and experience India.
We have so much diversity.
And when holidays come in the shape of Diwali and allied festivals, people do travel and that's why I urge you to visit any 15 such places in India.
And you will be delighted to know that today our rank is thirty four on this index whereas five years ago we were ranked65th, which in a way is a big jump.
If we tried all that harder, then by the 75th year of our independence, we would have carved a place for ourselves amidst the major tourist destinations of the world.
Also, please see to it that during the celebration of Diwali, firecrackers do not lead to incidents of fire or loss of a life.
Whatever precautions or preventive care is to be taken, should be taken during Diwali.
Come
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat November 2017
Can you imagine how hard their task would have been to frame the Constitution of our country which has such big diversities
Konkan coast, where the sea has a significant role, was under Shivaji Maharajs realm. Many forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj like Sindhu Durg, Murud Janjira, Swarn Durg, etc were either situated on the sea coast or were encircled by sea. The security of these forts was the responsibility of the Maratha Navy.
The very thought is dreadful. There will be no soil, no plants and trees will grow
how will human life be possible
We worship mother Earth but have we ever thought as to how much damage is caused to the health of our mother- Earth because of the usage of fertilizers like Urea This has been proved by all scientific methods that a serious damage is caused because of an excessive use of urea. The Farmer is the son of the soil, how can a farmer see the mother Earth falling sick
The need of the hour is to revive the mother-son relationship. Can our farmers, the sons of our soil make a resolve that by the year 2022, when we complete 75 year of our independence, they will cut down the urea usage to half of what is being used presently
People of North India may not be knowing what all is there in the South
People of West India may not be knowing what all is there in the East
Our country is full of such myriad diversities. If you refer to Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekanand, our former President Abdul Kalamji then you will notice that when they toured around India, they got to see and understand India and they got inspired to do and die for the country. All these great men travelled widely in India.
Can you post on incredibleindia
You see, if all the people of one state will do this, then I will ask the government to do a scrutiny of it and prepare publicity material based on seven common things received from each state. In other words, how can tourist destination be developed keeping public aspirations in mind
My dear countrymen, Saadar Namaskar.
When on the one hand, a sense of festivity pervades the land, and on the other, news of violence comes in, from one part of the country, it is only natural of be concerned.
Ours is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, it is the land of Sardar Patel who gave up his all for the unity of the nation.
For centuries, our forefathers have imbibed community values, nonviolence, mutual respect these are inherent to us.
We have been hearing and saying Ahimsa ParmoDharmah from our childhood.
I want to assure my countrymen that people who take the law into their own handsand are on the path of violent suppression whether it is a person or a group neither this country nor any government will tolerate it.
My dear countrymen,our country is a land of diversities these diversities are not limited to our cuisine, life style and attire.
We observe diversity in every walk of life.
Even our festivals are replete with diversity. Ours is arich cultural heritage, spanning thousands of years when we look at our cultural traditions, social customs, historical events, there would hardly be a day left in the year which is not connected with a festival.
You would have noticed, that all our festivals follow the almanac of nature.
There is a direct connect with nature.
Many of our festivals are linked straightaway with farmers and fishermen.
Speaking about festivals today, I would first like to wish you all michhamidukkadam.
The Jain community celebrated the SamvatsariParva yesterday.
In the month of Bhadra, ParyushanParva is celebrated by the Jain Community.
The last day of ParyushanParva is observed as Samvatsari.
This is indeed a remarkable tradition.
The festival of Samvatsari is symbolic of forgiveness, non-violence and brotherhood.
It is also known as the KshamavaniParva, and on this day, people traditionally greet each other with, michhamidukkadam.
We have been hearing in our shaastras, our holy texts, KshamaVeerasya Bhushanam, that is, forgiveness is the adornment of the brave.
The one who forgives is valiant.
And Mahatma Gandhi always said, that forgiveness is the quality of great men.
Shakespeare in his play, The Merchant of Venice, while explaining the importance of forgiveness, has written, Mercy is twice blest, It blesseth him that gives and him that takes, meaning, the forgiver and the forgiven both stand to receive divine blessing.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great fervor all across the country. When we speak of Ganesh Chaturthi, it is but natural to talk about SarvajanikGaneshotsav, that is, community celebrations of the Ganesh Festival.
This tradition was established by Bal Gangadhar Tilak 125 years ago, and it was 125 years ago thatSarvajanikGaneshotsav became a symbol of Indias struggle for freedom.
And after Independence, this festival has become a vehicle of raising social and educational awareness.
Ganesh Chaturthi is a ten-day festival.
This Mahaparva, mega-festival stands for unity, equality, integrity and honesty.
My heartiest greetings to all of you on the occasion of Ganeshotsav.
The festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerela.
Of the numerous colourful festivals of India, Onam is a prime festival of Kerela.
This festival is known for its social and cultural significance.
This festival showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
It gives the message of love and harmony - awakens new hopes and aspirations, and gives new confidence to the people.
Our festivals are now becoming great attractions for tourism.
And I would like to mention to my countrymen, that festivals like Navaratri in Gujarat, or Durga Utsav in Bengal are tremendous tourist attractions.
Other festivals of our country too, provide an opportunity to attract foreign visitors.
We should think about what more can be done in this direction.
In this series of festivals, Eid-ul-uha will be celebrated in a few days from now.
Heartiest felicitations and best wishes to all countrymen on the occasion of Eid-ul-uha.
Festivals are of course symbols of faith and belief in the New India, we should transform them into symbols of cleanliness as well.
In individual households, festivals and cleanliness are linked together.
In fact, preparationsfor festivals always begin with cleaning.
This is nothing new for us, but it is important to convert it into a social character.
Public cleanliness must be insisted upon not just in our homes but in our villages, towns, cities, states and in our entire country Cleanliness has to be inextricably linked to our festivals.
My dear countrymen, definitions of being modern are perpetually changing.
These days, a new measure to gauge a new dimension, a new parameter, has come in to being. It determines what your upbringing has been, how modern you are, how modern your thinking is.
Are your activities ecofriendly, environment friendly or otherwise
It is considered to be unacceptable in society today, of you are not environment friendly.
And as a result of this I find that, the ecofriendly Ganpati, in this Ganesh Festival has turned into a huge campaign.
If you go on YouTube, you will see that children in every home are making earthen Ganesh idols and are colouring them.
All sorts of experiments are being carried out in every family.
What a massive transformation this has been a pleasant one at that.
And as I mentioned, our country is blessed with millions and millions of the brightest of brains.
The campaign for Cleanliness which was initiated three years ago will be marking its third anniversary on the 2nd of October.
And the positive results are now being seen.
Toilets have increased from 39 to almost 67 of the population
More than two lakh thirty thousand villages have declared themselves open defecation free.
Gujarat saw devastating floods recently.
Many people lost their lives. When the waters receded, there was so much filth everywhere.
That is when, in Dhanera in the Banaskantha District of Gujarat, volunteers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind cleaned twenty-two affected temples and two mosques in a phased manner.
They came together and toiled collectively.
The volunteers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hindset a fine, inspiring example of unity for cleanliness.
If this committed effort towards cleanliness become inherent to us, our country will certainly take our nation to greater heights.
My dear countrymen, I call upon you to begin a campaign, Swachchata Hi Sewa, Cleanliness is Service, at least fifteen-twenty days prior to Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October on the lines of the age-old belief, Jal SevaYahiPrabhuSeva, Service to Water is Service to God.
Lets create an environment of cleanliness in the entire country.
Whenever and wherever possible, lets look for the opportunity.
But we must all come together.
We could look at this as preparations for Diwali, preparations for Navaratri, preparations for Durga Puja.
My friends from the social media can run a few creative campaigns and thus become a source of inspiration in the virtual world, to see results in the real world.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has organized, the Swachch Sankalp se Swachcha Siddhi Pratiyogita, From the resolve of Cleanliness to attaining Cleanliness Competition comprising an essay competition, a short film making competition and a painting competition.
You can write essays in various languages and there is no age limit.
You can make a short film even with your mobile phone.
You can film a two-three-minute movie that inspires cleanliness.
It can be in any language it could be silent too.
You will see how the Gandhi Jayanti of this 2nd October shines.
You can imagine the inner bliss of paying homage to our revered Bapu, with fifteen days of this cleanliness campaign, Swachchata Hi Seva, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on the 2nd of October.
My dear countrymen, I want to specially express my indebtedness to you.
I want to thank you from the core of my heart, not because you have been connected with Mann Ki Baat, for such a long time I want to express my gratitude and indebtedness as millions of people from across the country come together with Mann kiBaat.
The number of listeners are in crores out of which lakhs of people write letters to me, send messages, and get their messages recorded on phone, which is a huge treasure for me.
This has become a great opportunity for me to understand the hearts and minds of one and all.
Much as you wait for Mann ki Baat, I await your messages with greater eagerness.
I always look forward with anticipation, because I find so much to learn from all that you share.
You too would feel that, you wouldve committed the same mistake.
Sometimes certain things become a part of our habits, that we dont even realize that we are doing something wrong.
Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Aparna from Pune.
I want to tell you about a friend of mine.
She always tries to help others, but one habit of hers amazes me.
I went for shopping with her at a mall.
She coolly spent two thousand rupees on a sari, and four hundred and fifty rupees on a pizza. Whereas, she haggled for a long time, over merely five rupees, with the auto driver, who took us to the mall.
On the way back, we stopped to buy vegetables, and again she haggled with the vendors to save 4-5 rupees.
I feel very bad.
Please speak about this on Mann kiBaat.
Now after listening to this phone call, I am certain that you would have been shocked and awakened and would probably have resolved not to repeat such a mistake.
Dont you feel that whenever a vendor comes to your door to sell something, on his rounds, when we come into contact with small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, auto rickshaw drivers - in fact any person who earns through sheer hard work we start bargaining with him, haggling with him: No not so much, make it two rupees less, five rupees less
And it is us, the same people, who go to dine at a fine restaurant, we dont even bother to check the bill, we just go ahead and pay the money, without thinking twice.
Not just this, when we go to a showroom to buy a saree, we dont bargain, but when it comes to someone poor, we just cannot resist bargaining.
Have you ever wondered what a poor man goes through
Two or five rupees make no difference to your life, but have you thought how much heartache this petty habit of yours can cause him.
Madam I am grateful to you for calling me with this touching message.
I am certain that my countrymen, if they are in the habit of behaving in this way with the poor will now stop doing so.
My dear young friends, the country celebrates National Sports Day on the 29th of August.
This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player, hockey wizard, Major Dhyan Chand ji.
His contribution to hockey was unparalleled.
I am reminding you of this because I want the younger generation of our country to take part in sports.
Sports should become a part of our lives.
If we are a young nation, our youth should get manifested in the field sports as well.
Sports means, physical fitness, mental alertness and personality enhancement. What else does one need
Sports, in a way, is a recipe that brings people together.
The young generation of our country should come forward in the world of sports and in todays computer era I would like to alert you to the fact that the playing field is far more important than the play station.
Play FIFA on the computer, but sometimes show your skills with the football out in the field.
You must be playing cricket on the computer but the pleasure of actually playing cricket in an open field under the sky is something else.
There was a time when the children in the family went out to play, the mother would first ask, When will you come back home
Now the times are such that children, when they come home, they either start watching cartoons in a corner, or are glued to mobile games.
The good news for our young friends is that the FIFA Under 17 World Cup is being organized in India, from the 6th to the 28th of October.
Twenty-four teams from all over the world will be making India their home.
Come, lets welcome the young visitors from all across the world with the festival of Sports, lets enjoy the sport, and create a conducive sporting atmosphere in the country.
I speak about sports today, and just last week, a heartwarming incident took place, which I would like to share with my countrymen.
I had the opportunity to meet some young daughters, some of who, were born in the Himalayas, who had absolutely no connection with the sea.
Sometimes they will spend 40 days on the seas in one go
at times, thirty.
Our six daughters riding the waves of the high seas, with courage, is the first instance of its kind in the world.
Each and every Indian would be proud of these daughters.
I salute their valour and I have asked them to share their experiences with the entire country.
I too am making a separate arrangement for their experiences on the NarendraModiApp to ensure that you can read it. For this is a tale of heroism, a tale of personal experiences, and I would be happy to bring you the stories of these daughters.
My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate 5th September as Teachers Day.
It is the birthday of our former President, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was the President, but all through his life, he saw himself as a teacher.
He preferred to live a teachers life.
The great scientist Albert Einstein said, It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.
The most important quality of a teacher, is to awaken in his students, a sense of creativity and the joy of learning.
As we celebrate Teachers Day this year can we come together and take a resolve
Can we run a campaign in mission mode
We will play a big role in the transformation of the nation, if we make a collective effort.
Come, lets move forward with the mantra, Teach to Transform.
Pranam Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Dr.
Ananya Awasthi.
I am a resident of Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre of Harvard University.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, financial inclusion, had been a point of discussion amongst Financial Pundits, not just in India, but all over the world.
On the 28th of August 2014, we had launched this campaign with a dream in our hearts.
Tomorrow on the 28th of August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna will complete three years.
Thirty crore new families have been linked to this scheme, bank accounts have been opened.
This number is larger than the population of many countries of the world.
And today I feel a great sense of fulfilment, that within three years, the last man on the fringes of society has become a part of the mainstream economy of the country. His ways have changed, he has now started going to the bank.
When there is cash in the hand, or in the pocket or at home, one is tempted to indulge in wasteful expenditure.
The money can be used productively in the days to come.
In the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, almost 65 thousand crore rupees have deposited in banks by our underprivileged brethren.
In a way, this is a saving for the poor, this is his empowerment for the future.
And those who opened their accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan DhanYojna, have received the benefit of insurance as well.
Schemes like, Pradhan Mantri Jeewan Jyoti BimaYojna, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojna, with a small premium of one rupee or thirty rupees, are giving a new sense of confidence to the poor.
For many families, in times of adversity, or on the demise of the head of the family, through the one-rupeeinsurance,they received two lakh rupees in a matter of days.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna, Start Up Yojna, Stand Up Yojna for Dalits, Adivasis, women, educated youth, youth who want to stand on their own feet - for millions and millions through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna, they have been able to get loans from banks without any guarantee. They have been able to stand on their own feet and have succeeded in giving employment to one or two other people as well.
There isnt enough time today, but I would certainly like request the bankers to upload these inspiring stories, on MyGov. in, so that people can read them and be inspired by how a scheme can bring about transformation in the life of a person, how it can bring a new energy, a new confidence hundreds of examples have come before me.
I will try my best to bring these to you and the media can also take advantage of these inspiring stories.
They too, can interview such people, and inspire the young generation.
We human beings have a natural inclination to be enchanted by the delights of the rainy season.
Animals, birds, flora nature in its entirety, is filled with the joys of the season.
But sometimes, when the rain unleashes full force of its fury, we come to realise the extent of the destructive might of water.
Mother Nature gives us life and nurtures us, but at times natural catastrophes such as floods and earthquakes wreak havoc on a massive scale.
Climate change, altered weather cycles, and transformations in the environment, are also having a big negative impact.
Recently, in certain parts of India, particularly, Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some areas of Bengal, have had to bear the brunt of natural disasters, caused by excessive rains.
Flood affected areas are being closely monitored.
Relief efforts have been undertaken on an extensive cale.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers are also personally visiting affected areas.
The state governments too are making maximum possible efforts on their part to provide relief to the flood affected people.
Social organisations, cultural organizations and common citizens charged with the spirit of service are also making their utmost efforts to help the affected people in this situation.
The Government of India, Army personnel, Air Force personnel, NDRF personnel, Paramilitary forces everybody does his or her best in providing succour to the disaster stricken people.
A 247 control room helpline number 1078 is functioning continuously to deal with the flood situation.
People are also voicing their difficulties.
Before the monsoons, the entire government machinery was brought into a state of preparedness through mock drills undertaken at most of the places.
NDRF teams were deployed.
We should also gradually make it our nature to set our work patterns according to the weather predictions, which could safeguard us against losses.
Whenever I prepare myself for Mann Ki Baat, I find that the citizens of our country prepare themselves even more.
This time around, there have been innumerable letters and phone calls in regard to GST. People are still expressing their happiness about GST, and are also eager to know more about it.
I would like you to hear one such phone call: Namaskar, Pradhan Mantri ji, this is Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard your speech on the Chartered Accountants Day and was deeply impressed.
In the same manner, Goods and Services Tax, GST, was launched on this very day last month.
Could you please elaborate whether its results after one month are matching the expectations of the Government
I would like to hear your views on this. Thank you.
It has been one month since GST was implemented and its benefits can be seen already.
I feel very happy and satisfied when a poor person writes to say how because of GST prices of various items essential for him have come down, and commodities have become cheaper.
When a person from the North-East, someone living in the remote areas, in the hills or forests, writes a letter to communicate that in the beginning, he used to be apprehensive about GST wondering what it was all about, but now that he has begun to understand it, he feels that things have become much easier than before.
Doing business has become so much easier.
And most important of all, the trust of customers for the traders is increasing.
I have been observing how GST has impacted the transport and logistics sector
how the movement of trucks has increased.
The time required to cover distances has come down drastically.
Highways have become clutter-free.
Pollution levels have come down with the increased speeds of the trucks.
Goods are also being transported much faster.
This indeed is a convenience, but at the same time it is also bolstering the economic progress.
Earlier, because of the multiple tax structures, maximum resources of the transport and logistics sector were expended in maintaining paperwork and that also led to the need for construction of new warehouses in each state.
I call GST, Good and Simple Tax. Indeed, it has produced a big positive effect on our economy in a very short time span.
The speed at which the smooth transition has taken place, along with rapid migration and new registrations, has instilled a new sense of confidence in the entire country.
And some day, the Pundits of Economics, Pundits of Management and Pundits of Technology, will certainly undertake researches and write about Indias GST experiment as a model for the world.
It will become a case study for universities across the world.
The implementation and furtherance of such a phenomenal change on such a monumental scale, with the involvement of so many tens of millions of people in such a vast country, is in itself a pinnacle of success.
The world will definitely make a study of it.
And this implementation has had all the states participating in it and sharing the responsibility.
All decisions have been taken unanimously by the states and the Centre together.
And as a result, one overriding priority for every government has been to ensure that there is no burden on the plate of the poor on account of GST.
I extend my heartiest felicitations to each and every ministry, every department and all employees of the Central and State governments involved with this process.
GST is a fine example of the collective strength of the people of India.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform it is a new economic order that will strengthen a new culture of honesty.
In a way, it is also a campaign for social reformation.
I would like to once again express my deep gratitude to the millions of my countrymen who have contributed to the successful achievement of this great feat with such felicity.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of Revolution.
We have been hearing this as a natural fact right from our childhood and the reason is, the Non-Cooperation Movement was launched on the 1st of August 1920
the uit India Movement, which is also known as Agast Kranti began on the 9th of August 1942 and on 15thAugust 1947 India became independent.
In a way, there are many events in the month of August that are closely associated with the history of our freedom movement.
But very few people know the fact that the slogan, uit India was coined by Dr. Yusuf Meher Ali.
Our young generation must know what had happened on the 9th of August 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of India, with their ardent desire for freedom, came together, fought together, and suffered hardships
these pages of history are an inspiration to us for building a glorious India.
The uit India Movement was an important milestone in the Indian Freedom Movement.
It was this movement that had made the entire nation determined to attain freedom from the British Rule.
This was the time when the people of India, in every part of the country be it a village or city, the educated or illiterate, the rich or poor, everyone came together shoulder to shoulder and became a part of the uit India Movement.
Peoples anger was at its peak.
Millions of Indians responded to Mahatma Gandhis clarion call and the mantra of Do or Die they flung themselves into the struggle.
Millions of the youth of the country renounced their studies, gave up their books.
In the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1920 and the uit India Movement of 1942, two different personas of Mahatma Gandhi can be seen.
The whole scenario of the uit India Movement was different and in 1942 things rose to such a point, there was such a heightened sense of intensity, that a Mahapurush like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of Do or Die.
The reason for this entire success was the peoples support, peoples resolve, and peoples struggle.
The entire country had come together as one to fight for the cause.
And I sometimes think that if we link the pages of history, it is seen that the First War of Independence took place in 1857.
The freedom struggle which began in 1857, continued to be manifested in one or the other corner of the country till 1942.
This long time period ignited the intense longing for freedom in the hearts of the people.
Each one became committed to do something.
The determination did not diminish with each passing generation.
New people kept coming forward each time in place of those who departed and the country kept on every moment endeavouring tirelessly to uproot the British Rule.
This perseverance, this struggle from 1857 to 1942 created a situation which reached its climax in 1942 the clarion call of uit India was such that within five years, in 1947 the British were compelled to leave India.
1857 to 1942 the yearning for freedom had reached the grassroots, had reached everybody.
And 1942 to 1947 these decisive five years became integral for the masses to successfully attain through resolve, freedom for the country.
These five years were indeed decisive.
I would now like to connect you with its mathematical manifestation.
We became free in 1947.
This is 2017.
It has been almost 70 years.
Governments have come and gone.
Systems have been made, changed, nurtured, and expanded.
Everyone has tried to rid the country of its problems in ones own way.
There have been successes.
Expectations have also risen.
The way, the years from 1942 to 1947 were the decisive years for attainment through resolve.
I can see that 2017 to 2022 presents itself as a new time segment of five years for attainment through resolve.
We should celebrate 15th August 2017 as the Sankalp Parva or the Day of Resolve, and in 2022 marking 75 years of Freedom, we will certainly transform that resolve into Siddhi or attainment.
let there be millions and millions of resolves
let there be strivings for the realisation of these millions and millions of resolves.
Just as the five years from 1942 to 1947 were decisive for the countrys Independence, these five years from 2017 to 2022 can and must play a decisive role for the future of India.
Five years from now, we will celebrate 75 years of Indias Independence.
Therefore, we must take a firm resolve today.
We must make 2017 our Year of Resolve.
In this month of August, we have to come together and resolve: Filth uit India
Come lets launch a mega campaign Sankalp se Siddhi Attainment through Resolve, from the 9th of this August.
A resolve that we will positively fulfil in the next five years.
Youth organisations, student organisations, NGOs, etc.
can organise group discussions, to bring forth new ideas.
Where do we want to reach as a nation
What can be my contribution for this as an individual
Let us come together and make this a Festival of Resolve.
They can use technology videos, posts, blogs, scripts, novel ideas to put forward all these.
Transform this campaign into a peoples movement.
This quiz is an attempt to familiarise the youth with Indias glorious history and the heroes of the freedom movement.
It is my belief that you will surely publicise and spread awareness about this quiz.
My dear countrymen, on August 15, as the nations Pradhan Sewak, I get an opportunity to communicate with the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
It is not one single person who makes that address, but it is the collective voice of 1.
25 billion of my countrymen that resounds from the Red Fort.
I try to give words to their dreams, and I am glad that for the past 3 years, I get suggestions from every corner of the country for August 15, as to what I should speak on the 15th August and which issues should I include in my address on the occasion.
This time too, I invite you to share your thoughts either on MyGov or on NarendraModiApp.
I read these myself and shall try to express them in whatever time I have with me on 15th August.
For the previous three 15th August speeches, one consistent complaint has been that my speeches tend to be a little lengthy.
I have planned to keep my speech short this time not more than 40-45-50 minutes.
I have tried to draw these rules for myself, but I dont know whether Ill be able to stick to them.
But I do intend to try this time to shorten my speech.
Lets see whether I succeed or not.
My countrymen, I would like to say one more thing to you.
Indias economy has in itself an element of social economics.
And we should never underestimate its value.
Our festivals, our celebrations are not merely occasions of joy and merriment.
Our festivals are in themselves campaigns of social reform too.
And this is also the time when the poor get an opportunity to earn an income and of course this adds a spontaneous joy to the festivities.
Festivals lend a sweetness to our relationships, bring a warmth of togetherness in the family and foster brotherhood in society.
They connect the individual with society.
It is a natural journey from the self to the collective.
And the I gets an opportunity to transform into a We.
As far as the economy is concerned, hundreds of families start making Rakhis in small household units, many months before the festival of Rakhi.
A variety of Rakhis are made in a whole range of materials, from khadi to silken threads. People prefer homemade Rakhis these days.
Rakhi makers and their sellers, sweets shops vendors the professions of hundreds, thousands flourish on the occasion of a festival.
The households of our poor brethren and their families are dependent in a way on these activities.
When we light a diya, an earthen lamp on Deepawali, it is not merely a festival of lights, a festival that illuminates the entire house
it is directly connected with those poor families who make small diyas or earthen lamps.
Today as I speak about festivals and how they are linked to the economy of the poor, I want to touch upon the subject of environment as well.
I have observed and sometimes think that the citizens of our country are more aware and active than me.
For the last one month, environmentally conscious citizens have constantly written letters to me.
And they have requested that I talk about eco-friendly Ganesha idols, well in time for people to plan for clay Ganesha idols during the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi.
Firstly, I am most grateful to such conscientious citizens.
They have urged me to speak on this subject well before the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi.
This time around, there is a special significance to the observance of community Ganesh festival as a public celebration.
25 billion countrymen Lokmanya Tilak ji started the Sarvjanik Ganeshotsav with the basic aim to inculcate the spirit of unity, enhance awareness in society, and promote the culture of togetherness.
So this year we should again, during the Ganesh festival, organise essay competitions, have open discussions and remember the contributions of Lokmanya Tilak.
And this time I have spoken about it well in time.
I am sure that all of you will join me. This will surely benefit our poor artisans, and artists, and provide employment to those who make idols.
I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen for the various upcoming festivals and celebrations.
My dear countrymen, we are continually seeing that our daughters are bringing laurels to the country in all the fields be it education, economic activities, social spheres or in sports they are scaling new heights.
We as a nation take great pride in our daughters.
Recently our daughters performed brilliantly in the Womens Cricket World Cup.
This week I had the opportunity to meet our daughters, the members of our Womens Cricket team.
I felt happy talking to them, but I had a feeling that they felt burdened by the fact that they could not win the World Cup.
This stress, this tension was evident on their faces also.
So while speaking to these daughters, I put forth a different viewpoint before them.
I said, Look, this is the age of the media. So expectations get hyped up to such an extent that if corresponding success is not achieved, these turn into despair and even resentment.
We have seen during many such events where if the Indian players fail, the anger of the country is vented towards the players.
Some people cross all limits of decency and say and write things that inflict pain and hurt.
But it happened for the first time that when our daughters did not succeed in winning the World Cup, the hundred and twenty-five million people took this defeat on their own shoulders, never letting the burden weigh down these daughters of ours.
Not only this, they lauded them and showered them with high praise for their brilliant performance.
I view this as a healthy and pleasant change and I told these daughters that only they were blessed with such good fortune, and hence they should banish any thought of not having been successful.
You may not have won the final match but you have won the hearts of 1.
My dear countrymen, I remind you once again of Agast Kranti, of 9th August, I remind you once again of 15th August. And I am reminding you once again of 2022, 75 years of Indias Independence.
Every countryman should make a resolve, every countryman should prepare a 5-year roadmap to realise that resolve.
All of us have to take our nation to newer heights.
Come, lets march together as we do our bit.
The destiny, the future of the country shall be brighter, let us move ahead with this belief.
The weather is changing.
It has been extremely hot this year.
But it is good that the monsoon is moving ahead on schedule on its natural course.
The weather has become pleasant in several parts of the country with abundant showers.
As a result of the rains, the cool breeze has brought about some respite from the oppressive heat of past few days.
One has seen that no matter how hectic the life is, no matter how tense we are, whether its ones personal or public life, the arrival of the rains does lift ones spirits.
The Car festival of Lord Jagannath, the Rath Yatra, is being celebrated in several parts of the country with great piety and fervour.
This festival is now also celebrated in some parts of the world.
The underprivileged of the country are deeply connected to Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
But few would know that in English, there is a word, juggernaut which means, a magnificent chariot, that is unstoppable.
In the dictionary, the etymology of the word juggernaut traces its roots to the chariot of Lord Jagannath.
And therefore, we can observe that the world has in its own way accepted the significance of the Car Festival of Lord Jagannath, The Rath Yatra.
On the occasion of Lord Jagannaths Car Festival, I extend my heartiest greetings to all my fellow countrymen, and offer my obeisance to Lord Jagannath.
Indias diversity is its unique characteristic, and Indias diversity is also its strength.
The holy month of Ramzan is observed all across, in prayer with piety.
And now the festival of Eid is here.
On the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, my heartiest greetings to one and all.
Ramzan is a month of charity, and sharing joy. The more you share joy, the more it multiplies.
Let us come together and take inspiration from these holy festivals and share their joyous treasures, and take the nation forward.
In this holy month of Ramzan, I came across a very inspiring incident at Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brethren reside in that little village and in a way, form a majority of its population.
During this Ramzan the villagers decided to get together and construct toilets.
Now, to construct these household toilets, the government gives financial assistance, under which, they were provided a sum of 17 lakh rupees.
and that this sum of 17 lakh rupees be used for providing other facilities in the village.
I felicitate the residents of Mubarakpur, for transforming the pious occasion of Ramzan into an opportunity for the welfare of society on.
We know that in our country there are three states that have already been declared Open Defecation Free states, that is, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF, this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration, government and especially the people of these five states, for achieving this objective.
We know very well, that tremendous hard work is required to achieve anything worthwhile, whether it is in ones own life or for the society.
If we have bad handwriting, and we want to improve it, we have to consciously practice for a long time.
Only then will the habit of the body and mind will change.
Cleanliness is also similar to this.
These bad habits have become a part of our nature.
Everyones attention will have to be drawn.
We will have to repeatedly remind ourselves of good inspirational incidents.
And Im happy to see that cleanliness is no longer confined to being a government programme.
It is getting transformed into a movement by the society and the people.
And when government functionaries take this initiative forward with the participation of the masses, it becomes even stronger.
Recently I came across a wonderful incident, which I would like to share with you.
This happened in the Vizianagaram District of Andhra Pradesh.
The district administration there undertook a huge task with peoples participation. From 6 a.
A hundred-hour non-stop campaign.
And what was the objective
To construct 10,000 household toilets in 71 gram panchayats in those hundred hours.
And my Dear Countrymen, you will be happy to learn that the administration and the people together did construct 10,000 toilets in hundred hours successfully.
71 villages became ODF.
I congratulate the people in the government, government officials and the citizens of Vizianagaram district on this great accomplishment of achieving this feat through immense hard work and setting a very inspiring example in the process.
These days, people have been regularly sending their suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, on the NarendraModiApp, on MyGov.
Shri Prakash Tripathi reminiscing about the Emergency, has written, presenting 25thof June as a Dark period in the history of Democracy.
Prakash Tripathi jis commitment to democracy is praiseworthy. Not only is Democracy a system, but also a sanskar- a part of our ethos.
One needs to be constantly alert about our Democracy, that is why we must also keep remembering the events that inflicted harm upon our democracy and at the same time move ahead, carrying forward the virtues of democracy.
1975 25th June it was a dark night that no devotee of democracy can ever forget.
No Indian can ever forget.
The country had virtually become a prison.
The voice of the opposition had been smothered.
Several prominent leaders including Jai Prakash Narayan had been jailed.
The judicial system too could not escape the sinister shadows of the Emergency.
The press was completely muffled.
The believers of democracy fought a prolonged war, and the great nation that India is, where the spirit of democracy pervades the very being of all its people, the strength of that spirit was demonstrated when the opportunity of elections came.
We have to further fortify that legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian today, is proud and holds his head high.
21st June 2017 Yoga has permeated the entire world.
From the seashores to the mountains, people welcomed the first rays of the sun, with Yoga.
Which Indian wouldnt be proud of this
It isnt as if Yoga didnt exist before, but now the threads of Yoga have bound everyone together, and have become the means to unite the world.
Almost all the countries in the world made Yoga Day their own.
In China, Yoga was practiced on the Great Wall of China, and on the World Heritage site of Machu Picchu in Peru, at 2400 metres above sea level.
In France, yoga was performed in the vicinity of the Eiffel Tower.
In a small country like Singapore, programs were organised in 70 places, with a week long campaign.
On the occasion of International Day of Yoga, the UN released ten stamps.
A Yoga Session with Yoga Masters was organised at the UN headquarters.
The staff of the UN and diplomats from across the world participated.
Yoga has created a world record again this time also.
In Ahmedabad in Gujarat, around 55 thousand people performed Yoga together and created a new world record.
I too had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga event held in Lucknow.
But I also had the good fortune to practice Yoga in the rain for the first time.
Our soldiers practiced yoga in Siachen where temperatures reach minus 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Whether it is our armed forces, or the BSF, ITBP, CRPF and CISF, each one of them, apart from their duties has made Yoga a part of their lives.
On this Yoga Day, since this was the third International Day of Yoga, I had asked you to share photos of three generations of the family doing yoga together.
Some TV channels also took this idea forward.
Sir, I have a question. Recently in Kerala, we heard you speak about replacing bouquets that we give as gifts, with good books as mementos.
You had started this practice while you were in office in Gujarat, Sir, but in the recent days we have not been seeing much of this.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had set this tradition of welcoming, by not giving bouquets, but books or handkerchiefs instead.
And that too, a Khadi handkerchief, so that it promotes Khadi.
Till the time I was in Gujarat, this habit had been ingrained in us, but after coming here, I had lost that habit.
When I went to Kerala, it was rekindled.
I have already begun to issue instructions in the government.
Here too we can gradually nurture this habit.
And the life span of a bouquet is very short.
You receive it in your hand for a moment and then abandon it.
But when you present a book, it becomes a part of the household, a part of the family.
I say this, thinking of the historical value of such gifts.
During my past UK visit, in London, the ueen of Britain, ueen Elizabeth had invited me to dine with her.
The atmosphere was imbued with maternal warmth, and I was served with great affection.
Afterwards when she showed me a small thread-spun khadi handkerchief, her eyes lit up. With great respect and in an emotion filled voice, she said, that Mahatma Gandhi had sent this handkerchief to her as a wedding gift.
So many years have passed and yet, ueen Elizabeth has treasured the handkerchief gifted by Mahatma Gandhi.
A small gift by Mahatma Gandhi, has become a part of her life and a part of history.
I know that these habits do not change overnight, and when we talk about it, we invite criticism.
Despite that, one should keep talking about it, and keep making the effort.
Now, I cannot say that if I go somewhere and somebody brings a bouquet I will refuse it.
No, I wont do that, but we will talk about it even though there is criticism, and then gradually, the change will happen.
My dear countrymen, as Prime Minister, there are numerous tasks to be handled.
I have to remain deeply absorbed in files, but for my own self, I have developed a habit of reading daily, at least a few of the letters I receive and because of that I get a chance to connect with the common man.
I get a variety of letters, written by all sorts of people.
Recently, I had the opportunity to read a letter, which I feel, I should share with you.
From the far south, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, Arulmozhi Sarvanan, a housewife, sent me a letter. And what was in that letter
She wrote, that she thought about engaging in some economic activity keeping in mind her responsibilities such as childrens education, to lend some financial assistance to her family.
She got some money from the bank, under the Mudra Scheme and commenced working towards procuring some items from the market for sale.
Then she came to know of the Government E-Marketplace system initiated by the government.
Here I want to tell my countrymen, that if you get the opportunity, you should also visit, the E-G-E-M, E-GEM website on the Internet.
This is a great new system.
And then the orders can be placed.
So, when people register in E-GEM, all the government departments become aware of them.
As there are no middlemen, the goods are available at very reasonable rates.
Now whatever goods Arulmozhi Madam could supply, she got all those registered on this government website.
And the best part is, what she has written in this letter is very interesting.
This is empowerment.
This is an opportunity for encouraging entrepreneurship.
Had Arulmozhi not written to me I wouldnt have realised that because of E-GEM, a housewife living far away and running a small business can have the items on her inventory purchased directly by the Prime Ministers Office.
This is the nations strength.
This has transparency, this has empowerment, this has entrepreneurship too.
I would certainly like that whoever wishes to sell their products or business items to the government, should increasingly get connected with this website.
I believe that this is an excellent example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance, and its objective is Minimum Price and Maximum Ease, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, we take pride in Yoga, on the other we can also take pride in our achievements in space science.
And this is the unique attribute of India, that whereas we have our feet firmly on the ground with Yoga, we have our dreams to soar beyond horizons to far away skies.
Recently, India has had many achievements in sports, as well as science.
Today, Indias flag is flying high not only on earth but also in space.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Nano satellites with the Cartosat-2 Series Satellite.
And besides India, these satellites are of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America, nearly 14 such countries.
And with Indias Nano Satellite Mission, we will get a lot of help in the field of agriculture, farming, and dealing with natural disasters.
And of all the satellites launched by India, this was the heaviest satellite.
The newspapers of our country have compared it with elephantine weights. You can well imagine the magnitude of the achievement of our scientists in space.
On the 19th of June, our Mars Mission completed one thousand days.
You may be aware that when we had successfully created a place for the Mars Mission in orbit, this entire mission was planned for a duration of 6 months.
The completion of one thousand days, is an important milestone in our scientific journey, our space odyssey.
These days we see that our youth are getting increasingly inclined to the field of sports.
It is becoming evident that along with studies, our new generations can see a future in sports as well. And our sportspersons, through their prowess, skills and accomplishments win laurels for the country as well.
Recently Indias Badminton player, Kidambi Shrikant has brought glory to the nation by winning Indonesia Open.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to him and his coach for this victory.
I had the opportunity, a few days ago to be associated with the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of the renowned athlete, P. T.
The more we promote sports, the more we see the spirit of sportsmanship.
Sports play an important role in personality development also.
There is a great significance of sports in overall personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in our country.
If the children in our family are interested in sports, they should be given opportunities.
Each one should nurture dreams for the next Olympics.
My dear countrymen, let me mention once again, that this Season of Rains, with its abundance of festivals and festivities, brings with it a unique new feeling of the times.
I extend my heartiest greetings to you all, until the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, when I shall share my thoughts with you once again.
It will perhaps be difficult for us to forget the years summer.
But, we are now awaiting the rains.
As I am talking to you today , the holy month of Ramzan has already commenced .
I convey my hearty greetings to all fellow Indians and everyone across the world, especially the Muslim brethren at the advent of this auspicious month of Ramazan.
idolaters and those loathing idol-worship co-exist. We have adapted ourselves to myriad kinds of ideologies, different ways of worshipping and all types of traditions and imbibed the art of co-existential living .
In the ultimate , any religion, faith, ideology or tradition- give us the message of peace, unity and goodwill.
This holy month of Ramzan will definitely be helpful in further strengthening these values of peace, unity and goodwill.
I, once again convey my best wishes to all.
I am glad that many people have given me feedback.
All of them showed enthusiasm by personally speaking out their minds to me.
I could not read them all nor could listen to all the messages because there were such a large number of messages.
But whatever I could see from a cursory look that while some made efforts to learn music, some tried hands on a new musical instrument, some of them are trying to learn new things by using YouTube, some are trying to learn a new language.
Some are learning cooking, some others are learning dance and drama Some have written that they have now started to write poems.
They are making efforts to know about nature and are learning the art of living and trying to understand the world.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle , it was then I realized that how much struggle was involved in getting India freed, how much sacrifices were given and how so many freedom fighters spent years in prison.
I am particularly inspired by Bhagat Singh, who achieved so much at such a young age. Therefore I request you that you tell something to the younger generation today on this topic.
I am delighted that younger generation is taking interest in knowing about our history, about our freedom fighters and about those who made sacrifices for the country.
Many years ago, I visited Andaman Nicobar Islands.
I went to see the Cellular Jail there.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkarji.
Veer Savarkarji had written a book Majhi Jannmathep while in incarceration .
He used to write poems on the walls of his prison cell.
He was confined to a very small cell.
These seekers freedom must have gone through immense torture.
I was inspired to visit the Cellular Jail only after reading Savarkarjis book Maazi Janmthep.
A light and sound show is also shown there which is very inspiring.
There was hardly any state in India youths from which were not exiled to the dark waters of Andamans and were forced to spend their youth in this Cellular Jail during the freedom movement.
included people of every language, every state and every generation had faced tortures during this struggleToday is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkarjee.
I would definitely want to tell our younger generation that to even perceive what kind of torture and trouble these freedom fighters had suffered to achieve freedom for us one must visit this Cellular Jail.
My dear countrymen, 5th of June is the first Monday of the month.
Connecting with nature means nurturing a better planet.
And, who can explain this in a better way than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi often used to say, One must care about a world one will not see. This means that it is our duty to be concerned about the world which we shall not see and to care for that.
If you return after a tiring days work, just open the windows and doors of the room and take a deep breath of fresh air this will fill you with fresh energy.
Our body is made up of five basic elements and whenever we come in contact with these elements we get fresh energy.
All of us have experienced this but we do not register this, we do not connect this in a single thread of sequence.
Now on, kindly make it a point to notice that whenever you come in contact with a natural condition , a new spirit emerges from within you. So, the global campaign of connecting with nature on 5th June should become our individual campaign as well.
And we are reaping the benefits of the efforts made by our ancestors to save the environment.
And if we shall protect the environment, our future generations will reap the benefits.
Vedas, describe the Earth and the Environment as the basic sources of energy.
And, Atharva Veda, written thousands of years ago, is the most authentic guiding scripture about nature and environment.
In India, it has been said Earth is the mother and I am her son.
According to Vedas, the purity within us is because of the Earth.
The Earth is our mother and we all are her children.
If we recall Lord Buddha, a fact comes to light that his birth, his enlightenment and his Mahaparinirvana, all three happened under a tree.
These days , I keep receiving news from our states.
Almost in every state, a big plantation campaign gets underway with the onset of monsoon.
Millions of trees are planted.
School children, social organizations and NGOs also get connected with the campaign. Even State Governments take an initiative.
Let us also make our contribution in enhancing this campaign.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has become a well known day world over.
The whole world observes this as World Yoga Day.
In a very short time, 21st June has got worldwide recognition as World Yoga day and is connecting people.
At a time when separatist forces are raising their ugly heads this has been Indias great contribution to the world.
We have successfully connected the whole world through Yoga.
Like Yoga connects body, mind, heart and soul: similarly it is connecting the world now.
Because of life style, because of the mad race to achieve success and because of increasing responsibilities, leading a stress- free life has become very difficult.
It is seen, this situation is coming up even at a comparatively younger age.
At a time when People are gobbling up medicines indiscriminately and passing their days, Yoga plays a very vital role in helping people to lead a stress-free life.
Yoga is a guarantee of wellness and fitness both.
Yoga is not merely an exercise.
How to mount on the journey of life with the inter-play of body, mind, thoughts and behavior can be better realized and understood through Yoga.
Just two days back, I have written letters to all governments and all leaders of the world about the Yoga Day.
Last year, I made announcements of some Yoga competitions and some awards as well.
We shall gradually advance in that direction.
He has said since this is the Third International Yoga Day I should make an appeal that on this third international Yoga Day, three generations of the family should do yoga together.
Grand parents, parents and children should together perform Yoga and also upload their photos.
It will be such pleasant blend of Yesterday, today and tomorrow that it will lend a new dimension to Yoga.
I express my gratitude for this suggestion and I feel that as our Selfie with Daughter campaign had proved to be a very inspiring experience.
So will this campaign of posting pictures of three generations together performing yoga will evoke curiosity across the nation as well as across the world.
You should certainly send the pictures of three generations doing yoga together to me on Narendra ModiApp or on Mygov.
This will be the picture of yesterday, today and tomorrow and will be a guarantee of a brighter tomorrow.
I invite all of you.
We are still left with about three weeks for the International Yoga Day.
You too kindly spread the message of Yoga and connect people with it.
This, in a way, is a movement on preventive health care.
I invite you all to get connected to it.
This phone call will also attract your attention. Pranam Modi ji, Im Naina from Mumbai.
Modi ji I watch whether on TV or Social Media, wherever you go, one can see people in that city pay special attention to cleanliness.
Mumbai or Surat, your clarion call has led people to adopt cleanliness as a mission.
Not only the elders but children also have become aware about cleanliness.
Many a time we see them telling elders not to litter on the roads.
You are right, that wherever I go, the government machinery does the cleaning but nowadays cleanliness also turns into a social event.
Five, seven or ten days before my visit a large number of cleanliness drives are held.
Media also prominently highlights such programmes, A few days ago, I went to Kutch in Gujarat.
A big cleanliness drive was conducted there.
I also did not see a connect is in this.
But, after receiving this phone call, I also started thinking that the point made there was pertinent.
You can very well imagine how much pleasure I derive by knowing this fact and also by noticing that the country is also closely monitoring the programme.
There cannot be any bigger pleasure for me than to know that my visit has been connected with the cleanliness campaign.
Besides usual arrangements to welcome the Prime Minister, cleanliness will also be high on the agenda.
This is very pleasing and inspiring for any cleanliness loving person.
I congratulate everyone connected with this Cleanliness programme providing strength to it.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
This is in a way a humorous suggestion.
I do not know whether I would be able to do it or not.
Modi ji, when someone asks for your visit , your stay, you should ask as to what would be the standard of cleanliness, if they wish to invite you.
How many tonnes of waste would you present to me so that I may accordingly decide the duration of stay.
The idea is very good but I will have to think.
This will be a big service to humanity.
One thing I would certainly like to say is that we should always consider these waste as resources and wealth.
Do not see it as just garbage.
Once we start looking at garbage and waste as a wealth, we shall also find newer, techniques of waste management.
The Central Government has along with State Governments and with the cooperation of municipal representatives of cities decided to launch a massive and important campaign of waste management.
On the occasion of World Environment Day on 5th June, there are going to be litter bins made available to collect solid waste and liquid waste in 4000 towns of the country.
Two types of waste bins will be available, one would be of green colour and the other blue.
The waste from our kitchens, be it vegetable peels, leftover food, egg shells or leaves are all part of liquid waste and are to be placed in green litter bins.
This waste can be utilized in fields, and if you will remember that fields are green then you will remember what to place in the green litter bins.
I must admit with pride that if a single individual decides it in his heart then a huge Public campaign can be launched .
Cleanliness is also one such drive.
Afroz Shah gathered the people of the area into a peoples collective and gave it the shape of a Peoples movement in itself an inspiring example.
Brothers and Sisters, it is with great happiness that I wish to tell you, that I am given to understand that under the aegis of Swachch Bharat Campaign, the Riyasi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has become completely free of open defecation.
I congratulate one and all in the state.
I have been told that this movement found maximum leadership amidst women.
The women of that area took out torch rallies to spread awareness, went from house to house, street to street and inspired the people towards this goal.
My dear countrymen, an audit and assessment of the performance of the present government in the last three years is happening all over on newspapers, social media or TV for the last 15 days.
I see this entire process as a very healthy sign.
The works done during these years were tested on every touch stone .
It was analyzed by every segment of society.
And this is a great process in democracy.
I firmly believe that governments must be accountable in democracy and the public at large must be provided with report card of works done.
I wish to congratulate those who took out time for an in depth analysis of our work, there were some praises some support and sometimes shortcomings were also pointed out, I understand the importance of all these things.
Whether something is good, little less effective or bad, whatever it is, one has to learn from it and move ahead in life putting the learning from it into practice.
Constructive criticism strengthens democracy
for an aware nation, an awakened nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I too am an ordinary citizen like you and like any ordinary citizen I too am influenced by good or bad things.
Some people take Mann Ki Baat as a monologue and some criticize it from a political angle but after a long experience, I now feel, that when I had first started Mann Ki Baat, I had not given thought to the fact that Mann Ki Baat would make me a member of every family in India.
Now I feel as if Im conversing with my family while sitting at home.
And there are many families who have written to me these very feelings.
Im grateful to the Honble President, Honble Vice President and Madam Speaker that inspite of their such high stature they took out time and they accorded importance to Mann Ki Baat.
In fact it in itself has given a new dimension to Mann Ki Baat.
Some of our friends, while working on this book had discussed it with me also.
And some time ago, I was pleasantly surprised when this book was in the news again because Akbar Sahab an artist living in Abu Dhabi, proposed that he wishes to sketch the topics on which various episodes of Mann Ki Baat were based, and without taking a single rupee Akbar sahab transformed Mann Ki Baat into art as a gesture of his love.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahab.
My dear countrymen, when we shall meet next time by then monsoon rains would be lashing every corner of the country, the weather would have changed, examination results would have arrived, the journey of education will begin anew and the rains would bring a hope, pleasant fragrance, a new aroma
Come let us move ahead while loving nature in such a pleasant atmosphere.
My many felicitations and best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
S.
Cant a little emphasis be given on this aspect in Skill development
Youre able to ride a bicycle but have you ever tried to operate the three-wheeler cycle or rickshaw which transports people
Parents in most parts of the country must be busy with their childrens examinations.
There would be a sense of relief where the examinations are over, but where the examinations are still on, there certainly would still be some amount of pressure.
However, at a time like this I would only say that students may listen again to what I had said in my Mann Ki Baat last time.
Today is the 26th of March.
26th March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
It was a historic war against injustice, which was fought under the leadership of Banga-Bandhu and led to the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh.
I also assure the citizens of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner, and a good friend, and we will continue to work together shoulder to shoulder to contribute towards the peace, security and development of this entire region.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us that Rabindranath Tagore and his memories are a shared heritage.
The National Anthem of Bangladesh too, has been composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
There is a very interesting fact about Gurudev that in 1913 he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize, but Knighthood was also conferred upon him by the British.
After the Jallianwallah Massacre by the British in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was one of the legendary figures, who raised their voices in protest. And it was at the same time, that this event left a very deep impact on a twelve-year-old boy.
The inhuman massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh, provided a new inspiration and mission in life to that young teenager, who until then had spent his days playing merrily in his fields.
And Bhagat, that 12-year old boy in 1919, evolved to be the martyr Bhagat Singh, our dear hero and inspiration.
On the 23rd of March, Bhagat Singh Ji and his comrades, Sukhdev and Rajguru, were hanged to death by the British, and we are all aware of that. There was a sense of fulfillment on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru for having served Mother India - - there was no fear of death.
They had sublimated all their dreams for the freedom of Mother India.
These three heroes inspire us to this day.
It would be impossible to express in words the story of the supreme sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
And the entire British Empire feared these three young men.
They were in jail, certain to be hanged, but still the British remained anxious about how to deal with them.
That is why, though the scheduled date was the 24th, they were hanged on the 23rd of March.
This was done clandestinely, which is not the usual practice.
And later, their remains were brought to present day Punjab, and were secretly cremated.
Many years ago, when I first got the chance to go there, I could feel a certain vibration in that place.
And I would certainly urge the youth of our country to go to Punjab, whenever they get the chance, and visit the samadhi of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singhs mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
That was the period when the desire for freedom, its intensity, and spread were on the rise.
On the one hand, brave hearts like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, were inspiring the youth towards an armed revolution.
And on the other hand, exactly one hundred years ago on the 10th of April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had launched the Champaran Satyagraha.
This year marks the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha.
In Indias struggle for freedom, Gandhian thought and Gandhian practice became manifest for the first time in Champaran.
This was a turning point in the entire journey of Indias freedom struggle, especially in the context of the methodology of the struggle.
This was the period when, in the Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, and the mill-workers strike in Ahmedabad, the deep impact of Mahatma Gandhis thoughts and practices was amply and clearly visible.
Gandhi returned to India in 1915, and in 1917, he went to a small village in Bihar and gave the country a new inspiration.
We cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi that we cherish in our hearts today.
Just imagine that one man, who came to India in 1915, and had been in the country for barely two years.
The country didnt know of him, he bore no influence then it was just the beginning.
We can only imagine the hardships that he must have endured, how hard he must have had to toil.
And it was the Champaran Satyagraha that brought to the fore, Mahatma Gandhis organisational skills, and his strong ability to gauge the pulse of Indian society. Mahatma Gandhi, through his demeanour and deeds, could inspire the poorest of the poor, the most illiterate, to unite and come together out into the open for the struggle against the British Rule
this was a manifestation of an incredible inner strength, through which we can experience the vastness of Mahatma Gandhis great persona.
But if we reflect upon the Gandhi of a hundred years ago, the Gandhi of the Champaran Satyagraha, that would be a subject of deep study for anyone about to enter public life.
We can all learn from Gandhi Ji what it means to begin a life of public service, how hard one has to work, as Gandhi did.
And that was the period when all the stalwarts, that we hear about today: Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani Ji, and others were all sent to the villages by Gandhi Ji.
To get themselves arrested voluntarily to fill jails, on the one hand, and on the other to immerse themselves in creative work.
Gandhis style of working had an incredible balance.
What the word, Satyagraha means, what disagreement can mean, what Non-Cooperation in the face of such a vast Empire could be Gandhi Ji established a completely new vision of resistance, not through mere words, but through a successful experiment.
Today, as we live in the 21st century, which Indian wouldnt want to see India change, which Indian wouldnt want to be a partner in the transformation of the country
New India is neither a government programme, nor is it the manifesto of a political party, nor is it a project.
New India is the clarion call of 125 crore countrymen.
It is the essence of the emotions of the 125 crore Indians wanting to come together and create a magnificent India.
There are many who regularly go to hospitals to serve patients.
There are many who rush to donate blood, when required.
There are many who try to provide food to the hungry.
Our country is a many splendoured land.
The belief that Service to humanity is service to God, is innate to us.
If we look at it in its collectiveness, in an organised manner, it comes across as a major force.
When there is a talk of New India, its criticism, its analysis, it counter views, are but natural, and that is a fundamental of democracy.
But it is true that if 125 crore countrymen resolve, and decide to walk step by step on a path to realise that resolve, the dream of New India can be fulfilled in our lifetime.
And all these things are not necessarily achieved through the Budget, government projects, or government money.
If every citizen resolves to obey traffic rules, if every citizen resolves that he will discharge his duties honestly, if every citizen resolves that he will not use petrol or diesel one day in a week - - these are not very big things.
But these will contribute to the realisation of the dream of this country, this New India, that is being nurtured by 125 crore countrymen, and this realisation will be achieved before their eyes.
In essence, every citizen must discharge his civic duties and responsibilities.
Why dont we too, be a part of this journey from Swaraj to Suraaj by making our lives disciplined, and filled with resolve.
Come, I invite you.
My dear countrymen, today I want to express my gratitude to all of you.
Over the last few months the country has witnessed a certain atmosphere in which people in large numbers have participated in the digital payment, Digidhan movement.
There has also been an increase in curiosity about cashless transactions. The poorest of the poor are making an attempt to learn, and people are gradually moving towards doing businesses without cash.
There has been a surge in various modes of digital payment after demonetisation.
My dear countrymen, we must take our fight against black money and corruption to the next level.
Can 125 crore countrymen resolve to undertake 2500 crores digital transactions during this year
We have made an announcement in the Budget.
We can do this in our day to day lives.
You cant imagine how you can serve the country in this way and become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
Recently, several Digidhan-mela programmes were organised to educate the people and to increase public awareness.
The resolve was to organise 100 such programmes all over the country.
About 80-85 programmes have already been conducted.
There was also a reward scheme.
Close to 12 and half lakh people have won prizes.
The birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is on the 14th of April.
And as was decided much earlier, the Digimela will be brought to a culmination on the 14th of April, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
On the completion of a hundred days, a grand closing ceremony will be held.
There is a provision of a bumper draw also in that.
We should contribute towards ensuring reducing the use of cash, of currency notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time, I request people for suggestions in Mann Ki Baat, numerous suggestions pour in.
But I have seen that there is always an emphasis on the topic of cleanliness.
Gayatri, a young girl from Dehradun, who is a student of class 11, has phoned in with a message: - Esteemed Principal, Prime Minister Sir, my respectful greetings to you.
To begin with, heartiest congratulations on your victory in the elections, with a huge margin.
I wish to share the issue close to my heart with you.
I want to say that people will have to be made aware about the importance of cleanliness.
Every day I pass by a river, in which people dump a lot of garbage and pollute rivers.
The river flows under the Rispana Bridge before passing by my home.
For the sake of this river we went to settlements on its banks, spoke to people and took out rallies too, but to no avail.
I want to request you to kindly highlight this issue by sending a team there, or through the newspapers. Thank you.
Brothers and sisters, look at the agony of this young daughter, the 11th class student.
How enraged she is by seeing the river strewn with trash.
I consider this to be a good omen.
This is exactly what I want - - that 125 crore countrymen be angered by filth.
Once there is anger, dissatisfaction, rage, we will be compelled to act against this scourge.
The good thing is that Gayatri is expressing her own anger, and giving suggestions to me, but she also goes on to say, that she has made several efforts but could not succeed.
This has now truly taken the form of a movement.
There has been an increase in the disgust towards squalor.
When there is awareness and active participation in the movement, it has its own significance.
But cleanliness is more about a habit than a movement.
It is a difficult task, but we have to do it.
I am sure that this resolve that has arisen in the younger generation, in children, in students, in the youth, augurs well for achieving good results.
I would urge my fellow countrymen, who have heard Gayatris message in my Mann Ki Baat today, that it should be a message to all of us.
My dear Countrymen, right from the beginning since I have started the programme Mann Ki Baat, I have been receiving a lot of suggestions on one issue, and in most of those, people have expressed concern about food wastage.
We cant even finish half of what is on our plates and then leave it uneaten.
Have you ever thought about how much food we waste
Have you ever thought how many poor people can be fed if we dont thus waste our food
This is not something that needs to be taught.
As it is, in our families, mothers always tell their children to take only as much food they can eat.
There is always some effort made in this direction, but still the apathy on this issue is a crime against society.
It is an injustice to the poor.
On the other hand, if we are able to avoid wastage, the family too benefits economically.
So while it is good to care about society, this is beneficial to the family as well.
I am not urging too much on this issue, but I would like this awareness to spread.
You will find such people somewhere in each and every state of India.
The lives of these people can inspire us not to waste food.
We should take only as much as we can eat.
See, these are the pathways leading towards change.
And those who are health conscious always say that, there should always be some space left both in the stomach and on the plate.
Now that we are talking about health, 7th April is World Health Day.
United Nations has resolved to provide universal health coverage for all by 2030.
We are familiar with this word, depression.
According to one estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world suffer from depression.
The problem is that we are unable to fully comprehend it even amongst those around us, and perhaps we also hesitate to talk about it openly, with our family and friends.
The person suffering from depression too doesnt speak out himself as he feels a sense of shame about it.
I want to tell my countrymen, that depression is not incurable.
There is a need to create a psychologically conducive environment to begin with.
The first mantra is the expression of depression instead of its suppression.
Share openly what you are going through, with your colleagues, friends, parents, brothers, and teachers.
Sometimes one is overcome by a sense of loneliness - - - students living in hostels are particularly vulnerable to it.
When the entire family is going on an outing, he just says, No, I dont want to come today. He professes a desire to be alone.
Have you ever wondered why he does so
You can be sure that this the first step towards depression.
If he prefers to stay away from a group, and tends to be all by himself, do make an effort to ensure that this does not happen.
He should be given an opportunity to be amongst people with whom he speaks openly.
Try to encourage him to express himself, to reveal and bring out his insecurities and complexes while engaging him in light-hearted happy conversation.
This is a very good way of dealing with it.
Depression can be the root cause of many mental and physical ailments.
Just as diabetes can be the root cause of all sorts of diseases, depression too, destroys all our abilities to sustain, to fight, to display courage and to take a decision.
Your friends, your family, your surroundings, and environment, all these can prevent you from going into depression and if you unfortunately has gone into it, they can also pull you out of it.
There is another way.
You will find that along with it your own inner sufferings will go on disappearing.
If you try to sympathise with the sufferings of others with a sense of service, a new self-confidence will be born within you.
By connecting with others, serving them and serving them selflessly, you will easily be able to shed the weight oppressing your own heart and mind.
Yoga too is a good means for mental wellbeing.
Yoga helps in relieving tension and stress, and leads one towards a happy state of mind.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga.
This will be the third year of its observance.
If you have any ideas for the Third International Yoga Day, please do send me your suggestions and guidance through my mobile Application.
You could compose as many songs and poems on Yoga, as possible, as these can be easily understood by the masses.
Today I would like to say something especially to mothers and sisters also, since health and wellbeing have been a major part of our conversation today.
Recently, the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The working-class women in our country - their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and this is a welcome trend. But women also shoulder certain special responsibilities.
The Government of India has taken a very important decision.
These working women will now be given maternity leave of 26 weeks, instead of the earlier 12 weeks, for their pregnancy and delivery.
There are now only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this matter.
India has taken a very important decision for these working women sisters of ours.
The basic aim is to ensure proper care of the newborn, the future citizen of India, from the time of birth. The newborn should get the complete love and attention of the mother.
That is how these children will become true assets of the country when they grow up. Mothers too will remain healthy.
And that is why, this is such a landmark decision, and this will benefit 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate the auspicious day of Ram Navami on the 5th of April, Mahavir Jayanti is on the 9th of April, and on the 14th of April is the birth Anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
May the lives of all these great luminaries inspire us, and give us the strength to resolve ourselves to the cause of New India.
My heartiest new year greetings for Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Varsh Pratipada, and Nav Samvatsar, which are two days from now.
After Vasant Ritu or the season of Spring, it is now the time for the ripening of the crops, and the time for the farmers to reap the benefits of their hard work.
The new year is celebrated in different ways in different parts of our country.
New year is Gudi Padva in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, for the Sindhi it is Cheti Chand, Navreh in Kashmir, Samvatsar Pooja in the Awadh Region, Jud-Sheetal in the Mithila region of Bihar and the festival of Satuvani in the Magadh region.
India is a country blessed with rich diversity.
Winter is on its way out.
Vasant, the season of spring has just started to step into our lives.
After the departure of PATJHAD, when old and withered leaves fall, new leaves begin to sprout on the trees.
Flowers bloom.
Gardens and orchards sport a verdant green.
The melodious chirping of birds warms the cockles of our hearts.
Not just flowers, fruits too appear to be shining bathed in the sun rays on tree branches.
The flower heads of the summer fruit mango manifest themselves in the spring season itself.
At the same time bright yellow flowers of mustard swaying in their fields kindle hope in the hearts of the farmers.
Blossoming of bright red Jungle Flame flowers, better known as Tesu or Palash heralds the advent of Holi.
Amir Khusro has portrayed these moments of change of season in a very interesting manner.
The festivals of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivratri and Holi, impart hues of happiness to a persons life.
In an ambience of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are about to bid adieu to the last month of Phalgun and are eagerly awaiting to welcome the arrival of the new month of Chaitra.
The Ritu of Vasant, that is, the season of spring is indeed the confluence of these two months.
At the outset, I express my gratitude to lakhs of citizens of our country for sending in a multitude of suggestions when I ask for them before Mann Ki Baat.
On the NarendraModiApp, on Twitter, on Facebook, by post - I thank all of you for that.
And therefore she wants me to provide some information on the recent launch of 104 satellites and the Interceptor Missile.
Shobha Ji, thank you very much for paying attention to this shining example of Indias pride.
Whether it is eradicating poverty, preventing diseases, connecting with the world, or disseminating knowledge and information, technology and science have made a mark for themselves.
15th February, 2017 is a day of immense pride for India.
Our scientists have brought laurels to the nation, witnessed by the whole world.
In a mega mission, ISRO has successfully launched 104 satellites simultaneously into space. These satellites belonged to various countries such as America, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE and, of course, India.
India has created history by becoming the first country to launch successfully 104 satellites into space at one go.
And what is further heartening is the fact that this was PSLVs 38th successive successful launch.
This is a historic achievement for not just ISRO but for all of India.
Brother sisters, one out of these 104 satellites is extremely important. It is Cartosat 2D, which is Indias satellite and the pictures clicked through it will be of great help in mapping of resources and infrastructure, evaluating development and planning for urban development.
Particularly for my farmer brothers and sisters, our new Satellite Cartosat 2D will be immensely helpful on a whole lot of subjects such as knowing how much water is there in our existing water sources, how this should be best put to use, what things to keep in mind in this regard.
Almost immediately after its launch, our satellite has sent back some pictures.
It has commenced functioning.
It is also a matter of exultation for us that this entire campaign was led and steered by our young scientists, our women scientists.
This tremendous participation of youth and women is a major glorious dimension in ISROs success.
On behalf of our countrymen, I heartily congratulate the scientists at ISRO.
Adhering consistently to the objective of bringing Space Science to the common man, for the service of the nation, they are creating one record after another.
One runs short of words in complimenting and congratulating our scientists, their entire team.
Shobha Ji has asked one more question and that pertains to the security of India.
It is about India having acquired a great capability.
This important matter has not been discussed much, but it has drawn Shobha Jis attention.
During its trial, this missile, based on interceptor technology, destroyed an enemy missile at an altitude of about 100 km above the surface of the earth and thus marked its success.
This is a significant, cutting edge competency in the arena of security.
And you will be happy to know that hardly four or five countries in the world possess this capability.
When we witness new technology, or a new scientific feat, we are left overwhelmed with joy.
Inquisitiveness has played a significant role in the journey of progression of human life and development.
And those gifted with extra-ordinary intelligence do not let inquisitiveness to remain just that they begin further questioning it, look around for newer queries, and try to create new realms in the spirit of enquiry.
This incessant spirit of enquiry leads to new inventions.
They do not rest till they obtain an answer.
If we try to take a birds eye view of thousands of years of the onward march of human life and progress, we can easily say that this great journey has no point of culmination.
A full-stop is impossible.
Attempting to know the universe, the laws of Nature, the inner recesses of the human mind is an unending process.
This is what begets new Science, new technology.
And every technology, every new form of Science gives birth to a new era.
My dear young friends, while we refer to Science and the sheer perseverance of scientists, I have many a time said in Mann Ki Baat, that the attraction of Science for our young generation should increase.
The country needs more and more scientists.
Todays scientist becomes a potent catalyst for enduring change in the lives of our future generations.
Recently, during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, Niti Aayog and Indias Foreign Ministry had organized a unique competition.
Socially useful innovations had been invited.
There are times when a problem portrays the importance of Science for finding its solution.
What Im trying to infer is that in society, in the country, there are many who take on such roles.
And our society is also increasingly turning out to be technology driven.
Systems are getting technology driven.
In a way, technology is becoming an inseparable part of our lives.
In the recent days, one can see a lot of emphasis being laid on Digi-Dhan.
Gradually, people are shedding their hard currency mindset and moving towards digital currency.
Digital transactions in India are witnessing a very rapid surge.
In recent times, Lucky Graahak Yojana and Digi-Dhan Vyapari Yojana have received overwhelming support.
For about two months now, everyday fifteen thousand people have been winning a prize of a thousand rupees each.
It is a delight to learn that till now, under the Digi-Dhan Yojana, ten lakh people have been rewarded, over fifty thousand traders have won prizes and an amount of almost over a hundred fifty crores rupees has been earned as prize money by people who have promoted and carried forward this great campaign.
Under this scheme, there are more than a hundred customers who have received prizes of one lakh rupees each.
There are more than four thousand traders who have got prizes of fifty thousand rupees each.
Be they farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, housewives, students all are enthusiastically participating and also getting benefits from it.
When I wanted to know the analysis, as to whether its only the young people who come forward or there are elders persons too, I was heartened to learn that among the recipients, there were 15 year old young persons, as well as elderly people aged 65-70.
Shriman Santosh Ji from Mysore, expressing joy, has written on the NarendraModiApp that under the Lucky Grahak Yojana, he received a reward of a thousand rupees.
Though he continues to be a driver, in a way, he has now become an ambassador for this scheme.
He keeps imparting knowledge about digital usage to his passengers all the time.
He is extremely enthusiastic and motivates others also to go digital.
I urge my countrymen, especially the youth of our country and those who have won prizes under Lucky Grahak Yojana or Digi-Dhan Vyapar Yojana to become ambassadors of these schemes on their own.
Lead this movement.
Take it further as it has a very major and prominent role in the fight against corruption and black money.
To me, each and every individual involved in this mission constitute a new anti-corruption cadre in the country.
In a way you are a soldier in the cause of cleanliness and purity.
You know that this scheme will complete its 100 days on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar, a truly memorable day.
There is going to be a very big draw of prizes worth crores of rupees on 14th April.
There are still about 40-45 days left for that.
Can you do one thing in the memory of Babasaheb Ambedkar
We have recently celebrated 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Give special importance to Baba Saheb Ambedkars birth anniversary this time and the BHIM App.
For this, I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation laid by Dr. Baba Saheb.
We have to go from door to door associating everybody in order to place the BHIM App in 125 crore hands.
Since its beginning about two-three months ago, this movement has had a clear impact and has been a very big success in many townships, villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture makes a very major contribution to the fundamentals of our countrys economy.
Economic prowess of villages imparts momentum to the nations economic progress.
I wish to share a very happy news with you today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have toiled hard to fill our granaries.
The hard work of the farmers has resulted in a record production of food grains.
All signals indicate that our farmers have broken all previous records.
There has been such bountiful crop this time in the fields of our farmers that every day has appeared to be a celebration of Pongal and Baisakhi.
More than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country this year.
This is 8 percent more than the last record set up by our farmers.
Thus, it is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I want to specially thank the farmers of the country.
I am happy that the farmers of my country heeded the needs of our poor people and cultivated various pulse crops on about 290 lakh hectare land.
This is not merely the production of pulses but a yeoman service rendered by the farmers to the poor of my country.
My farmer brothers and sisters deserve special gratitude for the way they whole-heartedly accepted my request, my prayer and put in their hard labour to get a record production of pulses.
My dear countrymen, the government, society, institutions, organizations, in fact everyone, is making some or the other effort towards greater cleanliness.
In a way, everyone is seen working towards the cause of cleanliness in a conscious manner.
The government is continuously making efforts in this regard.
Recently, an event was organised in Telengana under the leadership of the Secretary of our Ministry of Water and Sanitation of the Government of India, in which senior officers from 23 state governments participated.
And, this was not confined to having just a closed door seminar, but the importance of cleanliness was practically demonstrated at Warangal in Telangana.
Toilet pit emptying exercise was carried out in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February.
Toilet pits in six houses were emptied and cleaned and the officers personally demonstrated that the used up pits of twin pit toilet can be emptied and then re-used.
They also displayed as to how convenient these new technique toilets are and there is absolutely no inconvenience or hesitation in emptying or cleaning these toilets and even the psychological barrier does not come in the way at all.
And, we can ourselves clean these toilet pits just as we do other general cleaning.
And, this exercise showed results, media in the country gave it wide publicity and highlighted its importance.
And it is quite natural also because when people see an IAS officer cleaning a toilet pit himself, the fact is naturally noticed by the country.
And we consider the waste taken out from a toilet pit as sheer useless garbage but if considered from the angle of its use as a fertiliser, this, in a way, is black gold.
We can clearly see the conversion of waste to wealth.
This has been proved too.
For a family of six members, the model of one standard Twin Pit Toilet gets filled in about five years.
After that the waste can easily be redirected to the other pit.
This waste deposited in the pit gets completely decomposed in six to twelve months time.
This decomposed waste can be safely handled quite conveniently and can be used as NPK which is a very useful fertilizer.
Our farmers know NPK very well.
It contains nutritious elements Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium in abundance and is considered a fertiliser of very good quality in the agriculture sector.
Others must also have experimented with initiatives similar to those undertaken by the Government.
Now Doordarshan is broadcasting a special programme of Swachchhta Samachar, that is Cleanliness News.
Highlighting such things in this programme will be very beneficial.
Various government departments regularly observe Cleanliness Fortnight.
During the first fortnight of March, Women and Child Development Ministry along with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs will be laying stress on the Cleanliness Campaign.
And two other ministries, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will take the Cleanliness Campaign forward during the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever an Indian achieves something notable, the whole country feels a new energy and the self-confidence gets a boost.
We all hailed the commendable performance by our Divyang Players at Rio Paralympics.
India defeated Pakistan in the final of the Blind T-20 World Cup held earlier this month to become World Champions for the second consecutive time and thus raised our national prestige to a new height.
I once again congratulate all players of our team.
The country is really proud of these Divyang friends for their achievement.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, strongly determined, courageous and possess tremendous resolve.
We get to learn something each moment from them.
Be it the field of sports or space science, the women of our country lag behind none.
They are moving ahead shoulder to shoulder and are bringing glory to the nation with their commendable achievements.
Our women players won a silver medal at the Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy recently.
My heartiest congratulations to all these players.
The whole world celebrates 8th March as Womens Day.
In India also more importance needs to be given to our daughters along with increased awareness and sensitivity towards them.
Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao movement is moving forward with rapid strides.
This is no longer just a government programme.
It has now become a campaign of societal empathy and public education.
During the last two years this programme involved the common man it has forced people from all corners of the country to think and ponder over this burning issue and brought about a change in peoples thinking about our traditional beliefs and customs which have been prevalent for many years.
It gives us great joy and happiness when we hear the news of festive celebration on the birth of a daughter.
In a way, a positive mindset towards our daughters is leading towards societal acceptance.
I have heard that in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, child marriage has been banned under a special campaign.
About 175 child marriages have been prevented so far.
The district administration has opened bank accounts of over 55-60 thousand daughters under Sukanya Samridhi Yojana.
In Kathua district in Jammu Kashmir, all departments have been connected with Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana under the Convergence Model and in addition to the convening of Gram-Sabhas, all efforts are being made by the district administrations for adoption of orphan baby girls and to ensure their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, under the Har Ghar Dastak programme a campaign is being run to go to every village and every house to encourage education of daughters.
In Rajasthan Apna Bachcha, Apna Vidyalaya campaign is being run to readmit those girls into schools, who had dropped out, in order to encourage and motivate them to start studying again.
I mean to say that Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao movement has also developed in many shapes and forms.
This entire movement has become a peoples movement.
New imagination and new concepts have been linked and connected with it.
This movement has been moulded as per local requirements.
You also connect actively with this programme.
I get to know so many things from you.
I get to know as to what all is happening on the ground, in our villages and in the hearts and minds of the poor.
I am very grateful to you for your contribution.
Yesterday, Krishna- Janma Mahotsav, the festival of the birth of Lord Krishna was celebrated throughout India.
Can anyone even imagine the greatness of his personality, that, even after thousands of years, the festival comes along with renewed novelty, a new inspiration with fresh energy. And the noble being that he was
One feels a sense of newness in whatever he does. And thats why today, as I converse with you, my attention is drawn towards two Mohans.
One is the Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan and the other is the Charkha bearing Mohan.
The Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan left the banks of the Yamuna for the sea beach of Gujarat, establishing himself in the city of Dwarika, while the Mohan born on the sea beach reached the banks of the Yamuna, breathing his last in Delhi.
Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan, thousands of years ago, had amply used his wisdom, his sense of duty, his might, his worldview to avert war, to prevent conflict, a sign of the times then. And spinning-wheel bearing Mohan too chose a similar path, for the sake of Freedom, for preserving human values, for strengthening the basic elements of personality character- for this he lent a certain hue to the Freedom struggle, a turn, that left the whole world awe struck, which it still remains today.
The importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge, or be it marching ahead smilingly, amidst the trials and tribulations of life, we can learn all these from Lord Krishnas lifes message. And that is why Shri Krishna is known as Jagatguru teacher to the world...
Today, as we discuss festivities, preparations are under way for a mega festival in India. Not just in India, it is a part of the discourse in the whole world.
My dear countrymen, Im referring to the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He served millworkers who were being underpaid. He served the poor, the destitute, the weak and the hungry... he took it as lifes prime duty.
Whoever, needed him, and wherever, Gandhiji was present to serve.
He emphasized not only on the spirit of service, but also on the inner happiness it led to.
Service as a virtue is meaningful when it is performed with a sense of joy-Seva Parmo Dharmah.
But simultaneously, deep inner joy, the essence of Swantah Sukhaayah is inbuilt in the spirit of service.
We can understand this from Bapus life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, the individual and society, human beings humanity was everything.
Whether it was the Phoenix Farm or the Tolstoy Farm in Africa, the Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, he laid special emphasis on community mobilization in his own distinct way.
I have been extremely fortunate to have been blessed with the opportunity to visit a number of significant places associated with revered Mahatma Gandhi and pay my homage.
I can say that Gandhi emphasized on the spirit of collectiveness through a sense of service.
Community service and community mobilization are virtues which we have to imbibe into our real lives.
This would be the real way of paying true tributes to Mahatma Gandhi, the Karyanjali, the offering of deeds.
No dear countrymen.
And being collective acquires its own strength.
In all the programmes of Gandhi 150, let there be a sense of collectiveness, let there be a spirit of service.
There could be a Ladies club
Routine tasks of a modern day Ladies club shall be taken up, but besides that, let all members of the Ladies club come together perform an activity of service
We can do a lot.
Collect old books, distribute them amongst the poor, spread the glow of knowledge. And I do believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen are endowed with 130 crore ideas there could be 130 crore endeavours.
There is no limit- whatever that comes to your mind- but only with a genuine wish, a noble intention, within the realms of harmony, and with complete dedication...
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I was in Dandi.
In our Freedom struggle, the salt satyagrah at Dandi was an important turning point.
There Id inaugurated a state of the art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
Emotions that emanate from the core of your heart will be more compelling than any great literary composition. And it is possible that in present times, from your viewpoint, the pen-picture of Gandhi sketched by you, may perhaps appear more relevant.
In the times to come, many programmes, competitions exhibitions have been planned.
In this context I feel like sharing with you something very interesting.
Of special interest were the Haripura Panels.
You may remember that in the Haripura Congress Session in Gujarat, Subhash Chandra Bose being elected as President is recorded in history.
These Art Panels have a beautiful past.
Before the Haripura Session, in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal of Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan, Nandlal Bose.
It was Gandhijis wish that the lifestyle of the people of India be depicted through the medium of art and this artwork may be exhibited during the session.
This is the same Nandlal Bose whose artwork adorns our Constitution
lends to the Constitution a new, unique identity.
The very commitment reverence of Nandlal Bose have made him, along with the Constitution, immortal.
Nandlal Bose toured villages around Haripura, concluding with a few works of art canvas, depicting glimpses of life in rural India.
This invaluable artwork was a high point of discourse at Venice.
Once again, along with greetings on Gandhijis 150th birth anniversary, I express my expectations from every Indian, of one resolve or the other.
One should do something for the sake of the country, society or just for someone else.
This will be a good, true genuine Karyanjali to Bapu, a tribute through a good deed.
O glorious children of Mother India, you may remember that for the last few years, we have been running a countrywide campaign Swachchata Hi Sewa, the quest for cleanliness is service, around a couple of weeks before the 2nd of October.
This time around it will commence on the 11th of September.
During this period, all of us will move out of home, donating toil sweat through Shramdaan, as a Karyanjali to Mahatma Gandhi.
Home or the neighbourhood lane, street circles, crossings, or drains, schools and colleges ...
in a similar manner, we have to join hands in curbing single use plastic.
This will result in monetary savings, as well as one would be able to contribute towards protection of the environment.
This year, on the 2nd of October, when we celebrate Bapus 150th birth anniversary, we shall not only dedicate to him an India that is Open Defecation Free, but also shall lay the foundation of a new revolution against plastic, by people themselves, throughout the country.
Let us celebrate 2nd October as a special day.
I also appeal to the corporate sector to come out with ways means proactively for appropriate disposal of all accumulated plastic.
It can be recycled
it can be transformed into fuel.
This way we can accomplish our task of ensuring safe disposal of plastic waste before this Diwali.
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhashit, epigrammatic verses are, in a way, gems of wisdom.
We can derive from them whatever we need in life.
These days Im not in regular touch with the form...
Imprudent people call stones as gems.
In our culture much glory has been ascribed to food.
We have even converted the knowledge about food into a science.
Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, more so for women and the new-born, since these two categories are the foundation of the future of our society.
Under the Poshan Abhiyaan campaign, nutrition made available with the help of modern scientific methods is being converted into a mass movement all over the country.
People are fighting a battle against malnutrition in innovative and interesting ways.
Once, an interesting fact was brought to my notice.
The Mutthi Bhar Dhaanya initiative has turned into a big movement in Nashik.
In this novel scheme, during the harvest period, Anganwadi workers collect a handful of rice grain from the people.
This grain is used to make piping hot food for children and women.
In this way, the person contributing the handful of grain transmutes into a conscientious civil social worker.
In the process, he gets himself dedicated to this cause and becomes a soldier of that movement.
All of us have heard about the Ann Praashan Sanskar, the first solid morsel ritual for toddlers in families all across India.
This ritual is performed when the toddler starts feeding on solid food for the first time
solid and not liquid food
In 2010, Gujarat embarked upon planning to provide kids complimentary food on the occasion of 'Ann Praashan Sanskar' so that this initiative spreads awareness among the masses.
This is a great initiative that can be adopted anywhere.
In many states, people run meal campaigns on certain dates.
If the family celebrates a birthday, certain auspicious day or observe an in- memoriam day, then the family members with self-prepared nutritious and delicious food, go to the Anganwadis and also to the schools and these family members themselves serve the children and feed them.
They not only share their happiness but in the process receive happiness magnified manifold
There is a wonderful confluence of a sense of service and satisfaction.
My Friends, there are many little things that can be employed in our countrys effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, both poor and affluent families are affected by malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as Poshan Abhiyaan across the country.
You must get connected with it, get information about this initiative, add some new facet to Poshan Abhiyaan by contributing to it.
If you manage to save a few people from malnutrition, it would mean that we can bring the country out of the circle of malnutrition.
This time when I was thinking about 'Mann ki Baat', I was sure that a lot of questions would crop up about this subject and thats what exactly happened. In the last few weeks wherever I went and met people, 'Man vs.
With this one episode, I have not only formed a connect with the youth around the world but I had never thought that I would find a certain place in young hearts in this way.
I had never thought that the youth of our country and the world pay attention to diverse things.
I had never thought that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the hearts of young people around the world.
And look what happens
Just last week I went to Bhutan.
I have seen that whenever I have had the opportunity to go as Prime Minister, and of course credit also goes to International Yoga Day, the situation now is that wherever I go in the world or interact with someone, people invariably spend close to 5-7 minutes asking questions on yoga.
There must hardly be a major world leader who has not discussed yoga with me and this has been my experience all over the world.
But these days Im experiencing something new.
Whoever I meet or wherever there is a chance to talk, the focus is on Wildlife, discussions about the environment, the Tiger, the Asiatic Lion, evolution etc.
and I am amazed how interested people are in nature.
The Discovery Channel plans to broadcast this programme in 165 countries in their respective languages.
Today, when there is a global churning of thought on environment, Global Warming, and Climate Change, I do hope that in such circumstances, this episode of Discovery Channel will help greatly in familiarizing the world with the message from India, the traditions of India and the empathy for nature in India's trail of glorious traditions. It is my firm belief that people want to know the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in India.
But there is another interesting thing, some people ask me one thing albeit with some hesitation -Modi ji, you were speaking in Hindi and Bear Grylls does not know Hindi, so how did you carry on such a fast conversation between the two of you
Was this episode edited later
How many times did the shooting happen for this episode and how it happened
They ask with great curiosity.
Now, there is no secret in this.
The reality is that technology was used extensively in my conversation with Bear Grylls.
So I used to speak in Hindi but he heard it in English and because of that the communication became very easy and this is an amazing aspect about technology.
After the broadcast of this show, a large number of people have been discussing about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also visit sites associated with nature and wild life and animals.
As I have said before, and I emphasize, that you must visit the north-east in your lifetime.
You will be left wonderstruck
Our country is full of diversity and this wide range of diversity will also inculcate variations within you as a teacher.
Last month I had the privilege of releasing the tiger census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers there are in India
The tiger population in India is 2967, two thousand nine hundred sixty seven.
A few years ago, we were with great difficulty at a figure half of what we have at present.
The Tiger summit took place in 2010 at St. Petersburg, Russia.
At this summit, a resolution was taken expressing concern about the dwindling tiger population in the world.
It was resolved to double the number of tigers worldwide by 2022.
We doubled our tiger numbers in 2019 itself.
Not only the tiger population in India was doubled, but the number of protected areas and community reserves has also increased.
At the time I was releasing the data on tigers, I also remembered the Asiatic lion of the Gir in Gujarat.
I had the charge of the Chief Minister of Gujrat at a period of time when the habitat of lions in the forests of Gir was shrinking.
Their number was decreasing.
We took several innovative steps, one after the other in the Gir.
In 2007, it was decided to deploy female guards.
There were improvements in the infrastructure to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about conservation.
But, we now have to move beyond conservation and think about compassion.
Our scriptures have provided great guidance with respect to this subject.
Therefore, we need to not only conserve our forests, flora and fauna, but also create an environment wherein they can flourish properly.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda delivered on September 11, 1893.
This young monk of India, who shook the conscience of the human race of the entire world, imparted onto this world a glorious identity of India.
The enslaved India which was gazed at by the world in a much distorted manner was forced to change its way of looking at India due to the words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893.
Come, let us look anew at India which Swami Vivekananda had seen and let us put in practice the inherent strength of India realized by Swami Vivekananda.
My dear countrymen, all of you will remember that the 29th of August is celebrated as 'National Sports Day'.
It will be a very interesting campaign for everyone - children, the elderly, the young and women and it will be your own movement.
But today I am not going to reveal its specifics
I want to make you aware about fitness and for a fit India, we should unite to set some goals for the country.
My dear countrymen, I will be waiting for your participation on 29th August in 'Fit India Movement', in Poshan Abhiyaan during the month of September and especially in the 'Swachhata Abhiyan' beginning from the 11th of September to the 2nd of October.
Come, let us proceed with a new zeal, new resolve and renewed strength.
My dear countrymen, this is all that this episode of Mann Ki Baat has in store for you today.
I will wait for your say and your suggestions.
Come, let us all march together to make the India which was dreamt of by our freedom fighters and realize Gandhi's dreams - 'Swantah: Sukhayah'.
Let us proceed, enjoying our inner bliss, expressing our spirit of service.
My fellow citizens, my namaskar to all of you
26th January, our Republic Day was celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in every nook and corner of the nation by all of us.
The Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the rights of citizens and our commitment to democracy - these in a way make Republic Day also a festival of sanskaars, which makes our future generations cognizant of democracy and their democratic responsibilities, and also imparts to them the culture, moral values and norms inherent in our democracy.
But still in our country, the duties and rights of citizens are not being debated and discussed as intensively and extensively as it should be done.
I hope that the amount of emphasis that is given to the rights at every level during most of the time, is also given to discussing duties of citizens in an emphatic manner.
The rights and duties of the citizens constitute the railway track, on which the train of democracy in India can move ahead at a fast pace.
Tomorrow is 30th January, the death anniversary of our revered Bapu.
All of us pay tributes to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the motherland, by observing silence for 2 minutes at 11 am on 30th January.
As a society, as a nation, the 2 minute tribute of silence on 30th January at 11 am, should become our instinctive nature.
This 2 minutes silence is an expression of our collective resolve and reverence for the martyrs.
In our country there is an innate respect for the military and the security forces.
I congratulate and felicitate the young heroes and their families who were honoured with various gallantry awards on the eve of this Republic Day.
There are various categories of these gallantry awards like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Vishisht Seva Medal and Param Vishisht Seva Medal.
When we get to know the in depth details of their courage, bravery, valour in detail, we are filled with astonishment and pride and we also get inspired
While we were all delighted with the tidings of enthusiasm and celebration of 26th January, at the same time, some of our army Jawans posted in Kashmir for the defense of the country, achieved martyrdom due to the avalanche.
I respectfully pay my homage to all these brave soldiers, I bow to them.
My young friends, you know very well that I regularly do my Mann Ki Baat.
January, February, March, April all these are for every family, months of most severe test
Normally it is one or two children in a home due to appear at their exams, but the entire family feels the burden of it.
This led me to believe that this is the right time for me to talk to my student friends, their guardians and their teachers, because for many years now, wherever I have gone, whomsoever I have met, examination appeared to be a great source of anxiety.
Troubled families, harassed students, tense teachers one sees a very strange psychological atmosphere prevailing in each home
And I have always felt that we should come out of this situation and, therefore, today I want to talk in some detail with my young friends.
I received a telephonic message from Srishti.
So I just want to ask you this, cant this be transformed into a pleasant atmosphere
Well, the question has been posed by Srishti, but it is a question that must be there in the minds of all of you.
Exams in themselves, should be a joyous occasion.
After a year of hard work, one has the opportunity to display ones capabilities, so this should be a festival of joy and enthusiasm.
But there are very few people for whom there is pleasure in the exam for most people exam means pressure
Now, it is up to you to decide whether you consider the exams pleasure or pressure.
Those who will consider it a pleasure, will have achievements, while those who will consider exams a pressure, will have to repent.
And therefore my opinion is that exams are like a festival and, hence, must be celebrated.
And when there is a festive mood of celebration, the best within us comes out.
The true realisation of the strength of a society also takes place during festivals.
This is the inherent strength of a festival.
Hence, during examinations too, an atmosphere of festivity should be created in the whole family, amongst friends and around the neighbourhood.
And you will see for yourself, that the pressure will be converted into pleasure.
The festive atmosphere will lead to a burden-free environment.
And I especially urge the parents to create a festive atmosphere during these 3-4 months.
Actually from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup and from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these 3-4 months have examinations galore.
It is the responsibility of each one of us that in our own ways, observing our respective traditions and in tune with our respective family surroundings, we should strive to transform every year these 3-4 months into a festival.
And you must have noticed that when you are happy, you are smiling, you become relaxed automatically, and when you relax instinctively, youre able to recollect very old things also quite effortlessly
A year ago, what the teacher had taught in the classroom, the whole scenario reappears in front of you.
And you must know that the power of memory to recall is greatest when we are relaxed.
If you are tense, then all the doors seem to be closed, nothing can enter from outside and nothing can come out from inside.
The thought process comes to a standstill and that in itself becomes a burden.
It was the same you, nobody had now told you the answer
What happened was that whatever was inside, came out immediately and the reason was that you were now relaxed.
And therefore the most effective medicine that exists for memory recall is relaxation.
And it is by my own personal experience that Im telling you that if youre under pressure then you forget even your own things but if you are relaxed, then you cant even imagine the kind of things you are able to remember, and these become extremely useful.
But when there is tension, your knowledge, your wisdom, your information all these buckle under and the tension rides over you.
And therefore it is necessary to remember that 'a happy mind is the secret for a good mark sheet Sometimes it also appears that we are not able to perceive examinations in a proper perspective.
It seems to become a question of life and death.
See, the exam you are going to appear at is the exam of what you have studied during this whole year.
But it is not a test of your life.
It is not a test of what kind of life have you lived, how is the life you are living now and what is the life you aspire to live.
There must have been many occasions in your life, when, besides the examinations that you appeared at inside the classrooms with notebooks, you had to encounter and endure many tests and trials.
And thus success and failure in life is not determined at all by how one has done at the examination
He appeared at the test for recruitment into the Air Force, and failed in that.
Now suppose that this failure had caused him to become dejected, to concede defeat in his life, then would India have found such a great scientist and such a glorious President
Marks have become all important.
As a result, the competition has multiplied leading to a very high increase of stress in the students also.
So I would like to know your views concerning the current direction of education and its future course.
Although she herself has given the answer to her query, but Richa Ji wishes that I too must put forth my views on the matter.
Marks and mark-sheet serve a limited purpose.
Life is not confined to these only.
Life truly means what is the knowledge that you have acquired
Life truly goes on in terms of whether whatever you have learned, you have tried to live that also
Life moves ahead depending upon the condition that whatever the sense of mission you have achieved and whatever is the sense of ambition that you nurture, whether there is any ongoing co-ordination between your sense of mission and your sense of ambition
If you will have faith in these things, then marks will automatically follow you and you will never have to chase marks
It is the knowledge that is going to be of use to you in life, so are skill, self-confidence and determination.
You tell me, you must be having a family doctor to whom all the members of your family must be going whenever needed.
When you have to fight a big law suit and you go to a lawyer to engage his services, do you look at the mark-sheet of that lawyer
You only look at his experience, his knowledge, and the graph of his success.
And therefore this burden of hankering for marks hinders us sometimes from going in the right direction.
But that does not mean that Im implying that you dont have to study at all.
Studies are definitely useful for testing our own mettle
to know where I stood yesterday and where I stand today.
However if you concentrate and focus only on getting marks, then you gradually go on limiting yourself and confine yourself to certain areas for earning more marks.
Thus, you may find that despite becoming brilliant in passing the exams, you have sometimes failed in life.
Richa Ji had also mentioned about PRATISPARDHA, meaning 'competition with others'.
It is a huge psychological battle.
It is a feature in the life of most of the successful players that they compete with themselves.
Let us take the example of Mr. Sachin Tendulkar.
He kept on breaking his own records consecutively and consistently for about twenty years, everytime surpassing and outdoing himself and thus continuously forging ahead.
What a wonderful journey of life he has had, only because he followed the route of competing with himself rather than competing with others
Friends, in every field of life and when taking exams, if you were able to study peacefully for two hours earlier, then are you now able to do so for three hours
That energy is generated from within on its own.
If you are better than your competitor, then you will become complacent,as you will be filled with over-confidence.
If you perform poorly against him, you will become distressed and disappointed, will be filled with envy, that will devour and consume you. And if you are equal to your competitor, then you will never feel the need to improve, life will just go on at its own pace.
You must focus on how to improve upon your past performance and how to perform even better.
And youll witness for yourself the positive change that it will bring about in you.
Shriman S. Sunder Ji has expressed his feelings on the role of parents.
He says that during exams, parents have a vital role to play.
He further writes, My mother was not educated. Yet, she would sit by me and ask me to solve problems in Mathematics.
Once you learn to accept, maximum number of problems will be solved there and then.
Acceptance brings about new avenues in finding solutions to problems.
Expectations make the path difficult.
Accepting a certain state provides us with the opportunity of opening up newer vistas.
You will feel much lighter.
P. Purushottam Mavlankar, son of Indias first Lok Sabha Speaker Ganesh Dada Mavlankar, had come to the hospital to see him.
I was present there and I saw that he did not ask a single question on the state of his health
he just sat down with no reference to the ailment or to the situation. He started cracking jokes and lightened the atmosphere in a matter of just a few minutes.
In a way, we terrify a patient with constant references to his ailment.
I would like to convey to parents that we do exactly the same with our children.
Have you ever thought of creating an atmosphere of joy and laughter for children during exams
See it for yourself, the whole ambience will be transformed.
I have received an incredible phone call.
The gentleman does not wish to reveal his name.
When you listen to the call, you will come to know why he does not want to identify himself
Namaskar, Pradhan Mantriji, I cannot divulge my name because of something that I did in my childhood.
And I started preparing most thoroughly for that. I tried to explore and find out various methods of copying and wasted a lot of time because of that.
I could have very well secured the same marks by devoting that time to studying, which I wasted while pondering how to copy.
Moreover, when I tried to use unfair means to pass the exam, I got caught and a lot of my friends around me also had to undergo distress because of me.
What you say is right.
These shortcut ways become the reason for using unfair means.
Thus unfair means lead us nowhere.
Cheating makes you bad, so stay away from it.
Time and again you must have heard advisories on staying away from unfair means.
I am reiterating the same, once again.
And once you are habituated to using unfair means, you will never feel the desire to actually learn anything in life.
Where will you reach then
If one devotes the same time and the same creativity in addressing issues pertaining to exams, one would never require any unfair means in the first place.
Results that you achieve through your own hard work and diligence will invest you with a phenomenal and extra-ordinary self-confidence.
This notion is basically unfounded. It is the root cause of this problem.
If one has to achieve holistic development, the fact is that there exists a huge world, a life beyond books
and this precisely is the time to learn living that life also.
If someone says, Let me finish with all exams first, I will play and do other things later well, that is impossible.
With so much to do, have you ever thought of spending a couple of moments gazing at the sky, looking with wonder at the flora around you, lightening your spirits a bit You will notice that you will return to your study room and be amongst your books with a renewed freshness.
Whatever you are doing, take a break, have a stroll outside, enter the kitchen, look for something that you relish to eat, munch on your favourite biscuit if possible, tell or listen jokes and laugh for a while.
If only for five minutes, give yourself a break.
You will feel the onset of a certain ease in your work.
I do not know if everyone likes this or not, but I am saying it out of personal experience.
And for deep breathing you do not need to confine yourself to your room.
Just be under the open sky, go to the roof top, do deep breathing for five minutes and return to your studies. You will experience relaxation in your body.
When I address election rallies, sometimes I suffer from a sore throat or a hoarse voice.
Once a folk singer came to meet me.
He asked me, How many hours do you sleep
I asked him if he was a doctor.
He said, No, but it is linked with your voice problem brought on by delivering so many election speeches.
Only when you get adequate sleep, your vocal chords will be able to rest fully.
Well, I had never given a thought to a possible connection between my sleep, my speeches and my voice.
Actually, we should understand the importance of these things, it will surely benefit you.
But this does not mean that you keep sleeping all the time. Some might remark that since the Prime Minister has said so, just keep sleeping, there is no need to wake up and study.
Please, do not do that, else your family members will be displeased with me.
And when your mark sheet arrives, if they are not happy with that, they will not see you but only me.
So, avoid doing that.
And hence I will say, P for prepare and P for play, one who plays blossoms, the person who plays, shines. This is a wonderful remedy for maintaining the vigour of the mind, brain and body.
Anyway, young friends, you are engrossed in preparing for your exams and here I am, engaging you in matters close to my heart.
Of course, it is quite possible that my words this morning will act as a relaxant for you.
If you cannot do it, please do not do it, else this too will weigh heavily on you.
Just as I advise your parents not to be burdensome to you, the same applies to me too.
In order to clear a test, treat the test as a festive occasion.
You will never feel a test, a test again.
Make headway with this Mantra.
On this occasion I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the officers and jawans of Coast Guard for their service to the Nation.
It is a matter of pride and honour that with its indigenously built 126 ships and 62 aircrafts, it has carved a coveted place for itself amongst the 4 biggest Coast Guards of the world.
True in letter and spirit to the motto, securing the countrys maritime borders and maritime environment, the jawans of Coast Guard are relentlessly at work night and day, braving the most adverse conditions.
Not many people would be aware that in our Coast Guard, not just men, but women too are discharging their duties and responsibilities shoulder to shoulder, and most successfully.
Our Coast Guard women officers are pilots, work as Observers, and not just that, they command Hovercrafts as well.
It is considered an occasion to worship Vidya, knowledge.
And not just that, it is a celebration of inspiration for brave hearts.
Mera Rang de Basanti Chola is a perfect example of that.
I extend my best wishes to my countrymen on the pious occasion of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio too infuses myriad novel hues of creativity and imagination.
Last month onwards, they have started broadcasting versions in regional languages, immediately after the broadcast of my Mann Ki Baat.
This has gained wide acceptance.
People are writing in from far and wide.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to be connected with you.
Best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016

Last month, all of us were celebrating Diwali.
Like every year, this Diwali too, I had gone to the border, to the China border, to celebrate the occasion with our soldiers, our jawans.
I do it every time, but this Diwali was an entirely different experience.
The heartening effect of the novel way in which our 1. 25 billion countrymen dedicated this Diwali to soldiers of our army, to our defence forces, was clearly evident on their faces.
They appeared charged with emotions, and not just that, the act of our countrymen of sending greeting messages, including the defence forces of the nation in their rejoicing had elicited a wonderful response.
And it is not that people merely sent messages.
There was an earnest heartfelt connect. Some wrote poems, some drew pictures, a few created cartoons, others made videos
Work is under way on that. Your collective contribution, the sentiments of soldiers, your emotional universe dedicated to our security forces as expressed in your creativity will form the content of this volume.
A soldier wrote to me Mr. Prime Minister, we soldiers have all the festivals like Holi and Diwali on the borders. We are devoted to defending the country every moment.
Bu we do miss our near and dear ones back home during festivals.
But, to tell you the truth, this time we did not feel so.
Never did it appear to us even once that we are not at home for the festivities.
It felt as if we were celebrating Diwali together with a hundred and twenty five crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, this warmth of emotion, this fervour that has been kindled in the hearts of our defence forces, our soldiers this Diwali, should this be confined to only a few occasions
I appeal to you that we should make it our nature, our characteristic as a society, as a Nation that whether it be a celebration of a festival or any joyous occasion, we should keep the soldiers, the jawans of the military of our nation in our hearts and minds.
When the entire nation stands by the armed forces, their might mutiplies a hundred and twenty five crore times.
A few days ago, all Pradhans from the villages of Jammu Kashmir had come to see me.
I got an opportunity to speak to them at length.
they had some demands. But when the deliberations began, issues such as conditions in the valley, the law and order situation, the future of children came up in a natural manner.
These village Pradhans spoke about these topics with such affection and openness that everything touched my heart.
I had urged them to focus on these childrens future, on their return home.
I am feeling happy today that these Pradhans, who had come from the Kashmir valley, kept their word in letter and spirit.
They returned to their villages and made people from far and wide aware on this issue.
Recently, just a few days ago, when the Board examinations were held, 95 of the sons and daughters of Kashmir, the young students appeared in the examinations.
The sheer volume of students, who appeared in the Board Examinations, is a clear indication that our children from Jammu Kashmir are committed to attain newer heights of progress, to build a bright future through the medium of education.
For their resolute zeal I congratulate these students and I also felicitate their parents, their kith and kin, their teachers and all the Gram Pradhans as well from the depths of my heart.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I asked people for suggestions for Mann ki Baat, I can say that almost all the suggestions that were received echoed one theme.
Everyone wanted me to speak in more detail about the 500 1000 rupee notes.
On the 8th of November at 8 in the evening, in my Address to the Nation, I had talked about launching a mega campaign to bring about reforms in the country.
When I had taken this decision and presented it before you, then also I had said openly that it was not an ordinary decision, it was one fraught with difficulties.
It was a very important decision but implementation of that decision is equally important.
And I had also foreseen that this would result in all of us having to face various new difficulties in our day-to-day lives.
And I had stated then also that this decision was so enormous that it would take us at least 50 days to come out of its after effects and only then would we be able to move towards normalcy.
These maladies have been afflicting us for the past 70 years and the campaign for getting rid of these can never be an easy task.
I can very well understand the problems you are going through
But when I see your support, when I look at your co-operation
although numerous efforts are on to misguide you, despite that, and despite witnessing some disturbing incidents, you have whole heartedly comprehended the path of righteousness and truth, you have favourably accepted this step taken in the best national interest.
500 and 1000 rupee notes and such a vast country, wide proliferation of currencies, billions and trillions of bank notes and amidst that, this decision the whole world is minutely observing, every economist is analysing it, evaluating it.
The whole world is watching will hundred and twenty-five crore Indians finally attain success after facing numerous hardships
This question may be there in the world community.
However, India has nothing but faith and faith only and supreme confidence in her hundred and twenty five crore countrymen that they will certainly fulfill their resolve.
And our country will emerge shining like gold does after a test by fire. And the reason for that is you, the citizens of this country.
Across the country, central government, state governments, all units of the local self government institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, over one and a half lakh post offices, over a lakh Bank-Mitras are relentlessly at work, day and night, with complete dedication.
In the midst of immense and varied stress, all these individuals are working hard, maintaining a calm and composed demeanour, taking it as a Yagya of Service to the Nation, an attempt towards a great transformation.
They begin work early in the morning, not knowing when they will wind up at night.
And as a precise consequence of this diligence, there are clear indications that India will succeed handsomely in this endeavour.
And I have seen that in the midst of such difficulties, all personnel of banks and post offices are working very hard.
And when it comes to the practice of humanity, they appear two steps ahead.
Someone told me that in Khandwa, an old gentleman met with an accident.
Money was needed urgently.
This came to the knowledge of local bank personnel, and I was happy to learn that they personally carried and handed over cash at his home, for help in treatment.
Innumerable such incidents come to light everyday through television, media, newspapers and mutual conversations.
Their capabilities were manifested.
Today, once again, they have accepted the challenge and I do believe that the steely resolve of one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen, their collective demonstration of PURUSHARTH will go a long way in investing our nation with a new power and strength on its path of progress.
But vices are so widespread and deep-rooted that even today there are people whose vicious habits refuse to die.
Even now, some people think that they can re-introduce into the system, money from corruption, black money, unaccounted wealth and Benami money (money in unknown persons name), using some route or the other.
They seek illegal means to save their ill-gotten wealth.
The saddest part is that, for this too, they have chosen to misuse the poor, the underprivileged people.
By misguiding the poor, enticing them through the vices of avarice and temptation, wrongfully pumping money into their bank accounts, or getting them to undertake some wrong activities, some people are trying to save their black money.
but, for Gods sake, please do not play with the lives of poor people.
Do not do anything that may bring the names of the poor on record for wrong reasons and land my dear poor people into trouble during the investigation later on account of your foul deeds.
And the law regarding Benami property that has been enacted and is being implemented is very stringent and it is going to be extremely tough on wrong doers.
The government does not wish that our countrymen should face undue hardships.
One Mr. Aashish has called me up and appreciated the fight against corruption and black money through the action on 500 and 1000 Rupee notes: -Sir, Namaste. My name is Aashish Paare.
I am an ordinary citizen of Village Tiraali of Tehsil Tiraali in District Harda of Madhya Pradesh.
Your move to demonetize 1000 and 500 rupee notes is a commendable step.
I have received a similar call from Mr. Yellappa Velankar Ji from Karnataka: -Modi Ji, Namaste. I am calling from a village in Koppal district of Karnataka.
I want to thank you wholeheartedly because you had said that good days will come, but nobody had ever thought that you would take such a big step.
You have taught a lesson to black money mongers and the corrupt through the demonetization of 1000 and 500 rupee notes.
For each and every citizen of India there could be no better days than these.
For this I thank you from the core of my heart.
We get to know certain things through media, through the people and through government sources which add to our enthusiasm for work.
It gives us such a great happiness and a sense of pride to know that the common man in my country has such a wonderful capability.
So people go and eat there and make payments on their next visit after 2, 4 or 6 days.
This is the strength of my country which encompasses the spirit of service, of sacrifice and also of genuineness and honesty.
But, I did not know Chai Par Charcha could be linked to a marriage also.
I learnt that on 17th November, a marriage was solemnised with Chai Par Charcha in Surat.
One daughter at Surat in Gujarat served only tea to all the guests who had come to her wedding. There was no big function, no feast or banquet because there was a shortage of cash due to demonetisation.
Guests from the bridegrooms side also gracefully accepted it as their ceremonial welcome.
Bharat Maaroo and Dakshaa Parmar from Surat, through their marriage, have made a valuable contribution in the ongoing fight against corruption and black money and set up a very inspiring example.
I convey my blessings to the newlyweds Bharat and Dakshaa and profusely compliment them also for having transformed their wedding occasion into an offering for the great task and thereby converting it into a new opportunity.
These tea workers get their wages on weekly basis.
Now, what they did when they received a 2000 rupee note as wages
Four women from the neighborhood got together and jointly made purchases and made the payment with the 2000 Rupee note they did not need small currency as they had jointly made their purchases and had decided that they would settle accounts later when they were to meet next week.
People are themselves finding ways.
See, how the village life is also getting transformed.
Some people are getting instant benefits from this campaign.
The nation will reap these benefits in the days to come but some people have got benefits instantly.
All municipalities receive hardly 50 of their tax revenues.
But, this time after the decision taken on the 8th instant, people rushed to deposit their old currency notes.
47 urban institutions had received about 3 to 3. 5 thousand crore rupees in taxes last year.
You will be surprised and also happy to know that during this one week, these institutions received 13 thousand crore rupees.
5 thousand crores to 13 thousand crores.
And, that too with the self initiative of those making payments.
Now that these municipalities have received 4 times the money, it is quite natural that poor localities and slums will get better drainage facilities, better water supply and better Aanganbari system.
Many such examples are coming to light where direct benefits of this demonetisation can clearly be seen.
Brothers and sisters, our villages and our farmers are strong pillars of our economy.
Every citizen is making requisite adjustments amidst the difficulties as a result of the new changes.
But, I especially wish to compliment the farmers of our country.
I was just gathering data of the sowing of this crop season.
I am glad that be it wheat, be it pulses, be it oilseeds, the data received till 20th November indicates that sowing has increased substantially as compared to sowing during the last year.
Our farmers have discovered new avenues amidst the present difficulties.
The government has also taken many important decisions, wherein priority has been accorded to our farmers and villages.
Despite these measures, some difficulties persist but I am confident that our farmer who bravely faces every difficulty, including natural calamities, is standing firm in the face of present odds also.
Small traders and businessmen of our country provide employment opportunities besides adding to the economic activities.
These small traders were provided loans worth lakhs and crores of rupees under Mudra Yojana because there are crores of such small traders and they impart momentum to the business activities worth billions of rupees.
But naturally they too had to face difficulties due to this decision.
However, I have seen that these small businessmen too have kept providing services to their customers in their own ways through the use of technology such as Mobile App, Mobile Bank and Credit Card and on the basis of mutual trust also.
And, I want to tell our small trader brothers and sisters that this is a ripe opportunity for them too to make their entry into the digital world.
You too download Apps of Banks on your mobile phones.
You too keep a POS machine for transactions in Credit Cards.
You can make a very big contribution in creating a cashless society. You can create a full-fledged banking facility on your mobile phone and there are many ways now to run our business without using paper currency.
There are technological methods which are safe, secure and instantaneous.
I want that you not only extend your cooperation in making this campaign successful but also lead the process of transformation and I have full confidence that you can be the leader for this change.
I want to tell my worker brothers and sisters too that you have faced heavy exploitation.
Wages shown on paper are much higher than the wages actually paid to you.
If sometimes full wages are paid, someone stands outside to forcibly take his cut and the worker is compelled to accept this as his fate.
We want that under this new system you should have a bank account your wages should be deposited directly into your bank so that payment of minimum wages is ensured.
And, once the money is credited into your bank account, you can use your mobile phone as an e-wallet and you do not need any hi-fi smart phone for this, because even with the help of your ordinary mobile phone itself you can make purchases from the neighbourhood shops and make payments as well.
That is why, I specially urge our worker brothers and sisters to participate in this scheme because after all I took such a momentous decision for the benefit of the poor people, the farmers, the workers, the deprived and the suffering people of the country and, hence, these benefits must reach them.
I specially want to talk to our young friends today.
We keep telling with great fanfare the whole world that India is a country where 65 of the population is below the age of 35 years.
I know, dear young men and women of my country, that you have liked my decision.
I also know that you support my decision.
I even know that you are making a big contribution in positively taking this mission forward.
But dear friends, you are my true soldiers, my true partners.
We have got a wonderful chance to serve our mother India and to take our country to new economic heights.
Dear youngsters, can you please help me
You will be with me but that alone is not enough.
The older generation does not have the exposure and experience of the new world which you possess.
Possibly your elder brother and even your parents and uncles and aunts also may not know.
You know what an App is, what online banking is and how online ticket booking is done.
For you these are routine things and you also make use of them.
But, the great task that the country wants to accomplish today is the realisation of our dream of a Cashless Society.
It is true that a hundred percent cashless society is not possible.
And I require your physical help, your own time, your own resolve and I am sure that you will not disappoint me because we are the ones nurturing the desire to change for better the life of the poor people of India.
You know how many opportunities there are today for a cashless society, for digital banking or for mobile banking.
Every bank provides online banking facility.
Wallet simply means an e-purse.
Various types of cards are available.
Cash can be transferred even with a phone with ordinary features.
A washerman, vegetable vendor, milk supplier, newspaper vendor, tea stall owner or a chanaa vendor, everyone can easily use this facility.
I have provided further impetus to simplifying this system even more.
All banks are engaged in this and are doing their best.
My dear young friends, despite all these things, there is an entire generation which is ignorant in these matters.
And I know it very well that all of you are actively contributing in this great task.
The kind of creative messages that you send on WhatsApp - slogans, poems, anecdotes, cartoons, new imagination, jokes I am seeing all these signifying the creative power of our young generation amidst the present challenges. This is the speciality of our Bharat Bhoomi, our motherland where GITA was created on a battlefield.
But, my dear young friends, I once again tell you that I need your help in this task.
Yes, yes, yes I repeat that I NEED YOUR HELP and I am very sure that millions of young people of our country will accomplish this tremendous task.
Also teach the shopkeepers to conduct their business with this technology.
You have to voluntarily lend your leadership to this great campaign, this Maha Abhiyan, to create a cashless society, to eradicate corruption from our country, to abolish the scourge of black money and to help people in overcoming their difficulties and problems.
Once you teach the poor people about the usage of Rupay Card, they will shower their blessings upon you.
When you teach the common citizen these new techniques, he will probably become free from all his worries. And if all the young people of India join in this great endeavour, I dont think it will take much time.
We can emerge and take our place in the world as a new modern India within a period of one month. And you can do this through your mobile phone by going to 10 houses daily and bringing 10 families daily under the ambit of this campaign.
That country has brought about a big revolution.
My dear young friends, I once again earnestly appeal to you to take forward this campaign.
You must have noticed, that Amitabh Ji, the most popular actor of this century, has been whole-heartedly promoting the campaign for cleanliness.
It appears as if the subject of cleanliness has become so dear to him that even on his fathers birth anniversary he remembered the Cleanliness Mission.
He has quoted one line from a poem written by Harivansh Rai Bachchan Ji wherein he said: Mitti Ka Tann, Masti Ka Mann, Kshan Bhar Jeewan, Mera Parichay.
) Harivansh Rai Ji used to give his introduction through this line.
His son Shriman Amitabh Ji, who has the cleanliness mission running in his veins, has written to me Swachchh Tann, Swachchh Mann, Swachchh Bharat, Mera Parichay. LoPN ru] LoPN eu] LoPN Hkkjr] esjk ifjp
I respectfully bow to Harivansh Rai Ji.
I also thank Shriman Amitabh Ji to connect in such a warm manner with Mann Ki Baat and for taking forward the Cleanliness Campaign.
My dear countrymen, now your views and your sentiments on Mann Ki Baat though your letters, on MyGov, on NaarendraModiApp keep me constantly connected with you.
Presently Mann Ki Baat is broadcast at 11 AM but we are going to start its broadcast in regional languages immediately after my Hindi broadcast.
My dear countrymen, my heartiest and best Deepawali wishes to all of you.
Deepawali is celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm throughout our country.
In India almost on all 365 days of the year, one festival or the other is celebrated in some part of the country.
Somebody watching from a distance would genuinely feel that festivity is a synonym for the Indian way of life, and this is natural too.
Right from the vedic period to the present day, there has been a tradition of festivities in India which, of course, has matched the occasions at different periods of time. We have also witnessed the courage to do away with outdated traditions.
However, we can very well discern one characteristic that this entire journey of Indian festivals, its widespread effect, its depth, its reach to each individual are all interlinked with one spirit which exhorts evolution from the self to the whole, the collective existence.
The idea is that there should be a development of individuals and their personalities, the limited scope of thinking must expand and cover not only the whole society but, in fact, the whole universe.
Our ancestors had very scientifically encompassed all these aspects in our festivals.
Today, the whole world is talking about the environment.
Destruction of nature is a matter of great concern.
Indias tradition of celebrating festivals has been one to strengthen our love for nature and to develop each individual, right from childhood, as a cultured person.
Festivals have evoked a sense of responsibility towards everything, be it trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, etc.
Nowadays we observe Sunday as a holiday but in our older generations, labourers, fishermen and others from such sections of society used to observe holidays on New Moon, that is Amavasya and Full Moon, that is Poornima.
Thus we had developed the tradition to observe our holidays also intertwined with the phenomena of the Universe keeping the scientific aspects in focus.
Now when we celebrate Diwali, as I said, each of our festivals carries a message and teaches us something.
The festival of lights Deepawali conveys the message of TAMSO MA JYOTIRGAMAYA, to move from darkness to light.
By lighting lamps on Diwali, we try to overcome the darkness of these social shortcomings and individual blemishes attaining freedom from this darkness is the real essence of the festival of lights Deepawali, which we celebrate by lighting an earthen lamp, a diya.
One thing that all of us know very well is that wherever in India we go, whether to the home of the richest of the rich or to the humble dwelling of the poorest of the poor, during the Diwali festival we can see a cleanliness campaign going on in every household.
Every nook and corner of the house is cleaned.
The less privileged also put in all their efforts to clean their modest earthen utensils because it is Diwali time.
Thus, Diwali also encompasses a campaign of cleanliness.
But the need of the hour is that not only individual houses but the entire premises, all the neighbourhood, the whole village be cleaned. We have to expand and spread this habit and tradition.
Now, the festival of Deepawali is not confined to the borders of India.
In almost all countries of the world, Deepawali is celebrated in one way or the other.
Many Governments in the world, their Parliaments and also their ruling classes are joining Deepawali festivities.
The Prime Minister of Singapore has posted a picture on Instagram and has shared it proudly with the whole world.
And, what is that picture about
It shows 16 women MPs of Singapore Parliament standing outside the Parliament all clad in Indian Sarees and this photo has gone viral.
All this has been done on the occasion of Deepawali.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had recently come to India. He told me that he would have to go back soon as he had to participate in Diwali celebrations there.
What I mean to say is that the festival of lights, Deepawali is becoming a festival of inspiration for the world community also to move from darkness to light.
They unwittingly invite a mishap in trying to create a big blast by joining and bursting many crackers together.
They are not even mindful of their surroundings, which might have incendiary items leading to fire accidents.
News of such mishaps, fire breakouts and even tragic casualties become a cause of big concern on Deepawali.
To add to these woes, there is a situation of even the doctors in big numbers being unavailable as they too are away celebrating Deepawali with their families.
It is not restricted to just one day.
With a string of festive events such as Govardhan Puja, Bhai Dooj, Laabh Panchmi till Kartik Purnima this festival of lights goes on for quite a long period of time.
Alongside the festivities of Deepawali, we also prepare to celebrate Chhathh Pooja.
This Chhathh Pooja is a very important festival in the Eastern parts of our country.
It is a big occasion there which lasts for four days. But this also has a unique significance in that it gives a very special message to society.
But the adage is that people only pray to the rising sun.
However, during the Chhathh Pooja, people worship the setting Sun as well.
There is a very profound social message behind this tradition.
When I speak of the Deepawali festival or about the Chhathh Pooja this is actually an occasion to convey my best wishes to you. But, there is one more thing I have to do.
In the backdrop of the disturbing incidents taking place during the past few months, the soldiers of our defence forces have been sacrificing their all for our peace and happiness.
The sacrifice, devotion and zeal of the Jawans of our security forces occupies my mind and heart, my emotional universe all the time.
And from that emanated my feeling and resolve that this Diwali must be dedicated to our security forces.
I invited my countrymen to join the Sandesh to Soldiers campaign.
And today, in all humility, I wish to proclaim that there would not be a single soul in India who would not have unbounded love for our Jawans, a sense of deep pride in the members of our security forces.
The way these sentiments have been expressed is surely giving strength to each of our countrymen.
Your messages to the Jawans of our security forces have proved to be a great morale booster which cannot be easily imagined.
Schools, colleges, students, villages, the underprivileged, traders, shopkeepers, political leaders, sportspersons, people from the cine world have all lit a lamp for the countrys Jawans, have joined in this campaign of sending a message of greetings and salutation to our Jawans.
The media also made this festival of lights into an opportunity and an occasion to express gratitude towards our armed forces. And why should it not be so
Our Jawans from BSF, CRPF, Indo Tibetan Border Police, Assam Rifles, Navy, Army, Air Force, Coast Guard and many more as I am not able to include all by names are valiantly facing great hardships in the line of duty.
And so if we remember them also while we are in our festive mood, our remembrance gets a new vigour which gets imparted to them also and they feel a new strength.
Just one message can enhance their capability and our country has shown it.
I earnestly express my gratitude to all our countrymen and women for this gesture.
Those who are artistically talented, have expressed themselves through their art.
Many messages and other expression forms have been received on Sandesh to Soldiers hashtag.
As a symbol of these, I would like to read a poem which has been sent by Shriman Ashwani Kumar.
Ashwani ji has written: I celebrate the festival, feel happy and smileI celebrate the festival, fee happy and smileAll this is because you are there,I want to tell you today that you are the guardian of my freedom,My gift of joy is there just because you are thereI sleep peacefully I sleep peacefully, because you are guarding the borders thereThe mountains, the skies and the country bow to youThe mountains, the skies and the country bow to youI too bow in gratitude to you O brave soldier
My dear countrymen, sister Shivani, whose parental side of the family as well as her family on the side of her in- laws is full of army soldiers, has sent me a telephone message.
Lets hear what this representative of a military family says:Hello Mr. Prime Minister, I am Shivani Mohan calling.
The Sandesh to Soldiers campaign has been launched on this Deepawali and is proving to be a morale booster for our brothers.
Im from an Army family.
My husband is an Army officer.
My Father and Father-in-law both served as Army Officers also.
So we are full of soldiers on both sides of the family. Our Soldiers and Officers who are guarding our border have been receiving these affectionate messages and all in the Army circle are getting tremendous inspiration and encouragement.
I would also like to say that along with Army Officers and soldiers their families and their wives also make sacrifices.
My fellow citizens, it is true that military personnel guard not only our borders, but they stand as sentinels and fighters on every front of life.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh as a State is now Open Defecation Free, has attained the status of OFD.
The first state to achieve this was Sikkim, then Himachal Pradesh accomplished it and Kerala is going to be OFD on November 1st.
Well, Ill tell you the reason, one of the security personnel of ITBP called Vikas Thakur is from a small village in Sirmour district of Himachal.
In the village at that time there was supposed to be a meeting of the Gram Sabha, so he went to the meeting where a discussion about construction of toilets was in progress. And he found that some of the families were unable to construct toilets due to lack of funds.
So, Vikas Thakur of our ITBP, brimming with patriotism felt that no
And that is how Himachal Pradesh has been empowered to become an Open Defecation Free state.
And similarly in Kerala, I really want to thank young people.
It came to my attention, that in the remote forests of Kerala where there is no path to tread upon and only after walking an entire day, some villages can be reached with difficulty a tribal village panchayat named Idmalakudi is there.
It is rarely visited by people.
It came to the attention of Engineering students from the nearby urban areas that this village was in dire need of the toilets.
NCC cadets, NSS volunteers, Engineering students all together decided that the toilets will be constructed by them.
The building material needed to construct the toilets whether it was bricks or cement, the entire construction material was carried by the young men on their shoulders, spending an entire day walking in those forests.
Work is progressing at a very rapid pace in all of these states.
I have mentioned the work being carried out in some of the places.
And with the pace at which this job has been undertaken, I believe that the entire state will soon be completely Kerosene free.
Just imagine the change that would be ushered in, theft will stop, the environment would benefit, and we will save our precious foreign exchange and the common folk will get facilities.
The only people feeling uncomfortable would be the dishonest persons and the middle-men.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is our guide forever.
Even today, his words guide us in setting up the standards and determining the direction that our nation must follow.
Your decisions should be based on such a benchmark.
It is the need of the times that weve to address the aspirations that have been arisen in the poor of our nation.
We have to help them in getting freed from their troubles in a stepwise manner.
Whatever the old dogmatic thinking might have been, but the society now must be freed from discrimination between our sons and daughters.
Now our schools are having toilets for girls as well as for boys.
For our daughters this is the opportunity to experience an India free from discrimination.
The government undertakes massive immunization programs for our children and yet millions of children are still left out from being immunized and fall prey to diseases.
Mission Indradhanush is one such operation that involves a vaccination program covering those kids who got left out during previous immunization campaigns and empowers them with immunity against serious diseases.
What will happen to the health of a poor mother how has to inhale smoke equal to that from 400 cigarettes while cooking food on a Chulha which burns wood as fuel.
We are trying to provide a smoke free life to 5 crore such families and we are successfully advancing in that direction.
The small trader, the small businessman, the vegetable vendor, the milk vendor, the one running a hair cutting salon has always been entrapped in the grip of the money lender, repaying interest all his life.
The stand up scheme and Jan Dhan account scheme are aimed at freeing these people from the clutches of notorious moneylenders.
Crediting money directly into bank accounts via Aadhar aims at directly sending money to the beneficiaries.
For the common man this is an opportunity to come out of the grip of middlemen.
A campaign has to be started where the target will not only be limited to bring in reforms and transformation but also to obtain freedom from the problem. And this is happening
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, the 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great son of India who vowed to unite India and made this the sole object of his life.
But a phone call from a gentleman from Punjab and his pain touched me: Pradhan Mantriji namaskar, Sir, I am Jasdeep speaking from Punjab.
Sir, as you know, 31st October is Sardar Patel jis birthday.
And, as we all know, what terrible events took place after her assassination.
Sir, I want to know how we can check such unfortunate events and incidents from taking place.
My dear countrymen, this is not the pain of an individual person.
One Sardar, as history goes, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the second great man after Chanakya who carried on the stupendous job of uniting our country.
Bringing independent India under one banner and accomplishing such a herculean task what a great man he was We bow a hundred times to that great soul.
But the pain remains that Sardar Patel, who lived for Indias unity, strove tirelessly for it, had to even endure some unpleasantness on account of it, but never ever abandoned the path of unity
These atrocities against Sardars on the birth anniversary of that great personality who lived for unity, that SARDAR, is a page of history, which causes pain to all of us.
But amidst all these turmoils, we have to march forward chanting the Mantra of Unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of our country.
We should keep away from the idea of separatism or the attitude of separatism and also guard the country from any such ideology.
Sardar Saheb gave us one India, now this is our collective responsibility to develop a Great India, a Shreshtha Bharat.
The Mantra of national unity is the very foundation of a strong and great India.
Sardar Sahebs journey started with a struggle for farmers.
He was the son of a farmer.
Sardar Saheb had a big role in taking the Freedom movement to the farmers.
Making the freedom movement a source of strength in the villages was Sardar Sahebs big achievement, a result of his organizational capacity and capability.
But, Sardar Saheb was not just a man of struggle but also a man who created great things.
Today, we often hear the name AMUL.
People of India and even those in other countries are familiar with every product of AMUL.
But, only a few people would know that it was only through his farsightedness that Sardar Saheb envisioned the creation of a Cooperative Milk Producers Union in Khera district, which was at that time called Kaira district.
My dear countrymen, during Diwali festivities, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of lights called PRAKASH UTSAV.
Guru Nanak Dev, his teachings and blessings are very relevant even now and are a source of inspiration for humanity as a whole.
Service, truth and everybodys well-being was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and harmony were his principal teachings.
Every teaching of Guru Nanak Dev preached that a campaign should be carried on to abolish superstitions, social disparities and social evils from the society.
It was then an era when evils such as untouchability, casteism and the chasm between the rich and the poor were at their peak. Guru Nanak Dev picked Bhai Laalo, as his co-worker at that crucial juncture.
Let us also follow the light of knowledge bestowed upon us by Guru Nanak Dev which inspires us to end social disparities, exhorts us to do our bit to fight against the evil of disparity.
I pay my deeply felt respectful homage to Guru Nanak Dev on the occasion of the forthcoming Prakashotsav.
My dear countrymen, once again let us dedicate this Diwali to our Jawans. My best wishes and greetings on Diwali to all of you.
I wish that all your dreams and resolves get fulfilled in every possible way
May your lives be blessed with success and happiness.
Many, many thanks.
We recently lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Uri Sector in Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute these valiant soldiers and pay my tributes to them.
And, therefore, I will just reiterate to you, my countrymen, what I had said that very day, that the guilty will certainly be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our armed forces.
We are proud of our army.
I also wish today to specially talk to those living in Kashmir.
Kashmiris are now beginning to recognize well the true face of the anti-national forces.
And as they understand the truth better, they are now separating themselves from such elements and have started moving on the path of peace.
Every parent wants the schools and colleges to be functioning properly at the earliest.
Farmers also feel that their ripened crops and fruits should reach markets across the country.
Economic activities too should be back on track.
And during the last few days there has been a movement towards restoration of trading activities.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the only way to solve our problems and also the way to our progress and development.
We have to scale greater heights of development for the sake of our future generations.
I am very sure that by sitting together we shall definitely find solutions to our problems, find ways to move ahead and also pave a better path for future generations in Kashmir.
Providing security to people in Kashmir is the responsibility of the administration.
The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
At times, people thinking differently from us also provide new ideas.
These days I get to learn quite a lot through social media.
I get an opportunity to know and understand views of different people from all corners of the country and this actually adds to the strength of our democracy.
Recently, Harshvardhan, a young student of Eleventh Class has put before me a different type of thought.
He has written I was very much distressed after the Uri attack and strongly felt like doing something.
But, I did not know how to go about it as what could a young student like me possibly do.
So, I was trying to find some way to be of some service to the nation.
And I have resolved that I would devote three more hours daily towards my studies.
I shall become a capable citizen so that I can serve the country well.
Brother Harshvardhan, I am happy to know that despite this atmosphere charged with anger, you are able to think in a healthy manner at such a young age.
But, dear Harshvardhan, I shall also like to add that the anger in the hearts of our countrymen is of a very high value.
It symbolises our national consciousness.
Then, Lal Bahadur Shashtri Ji had very aptly tried to touch the emotional universe of the country.
He gave the mantra-Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan which inspired the common people of the country to work for the nation.
Lal Bahadur Shashtri Ji showed that even amidst the deafening sounds of gunfire and bombardment, there existed an alternative way for every citizen for expressing patriotism.
During the freedom movement, Mahatma Gandhi also used to mount highly successful experiments to divert the strong energy of that movement towards constructive social work, whenever a lull was needed amidst the extreme intensity in that movement.
Now, if all of us, that is, our armed forces, people in the government, fulfill our respective responsibilities sincerely, and all of us countrymen, each citizen make some constructive contribution imbued with the feeling of patriotism, our country will most definitely scale greater heights.
S. Kartik has written on NarendraModiApp that our athletes who participated in the Paralympics have created a new history and their performance is a triumph of the human spirit.
Shri Varun Vishwanathan has also written on NarendraModiApp that our athletes did a commendable job and that I should talk about this in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only the two of you but each one of our countrymen has felt an emotional attachment with our athletes who participated at the Paralympics.
Perhaps going beyond sporting achievements, these Paralympics and the performance by our athletes have transformed our attitude towards humanity, towards specially-abled, DIVYANG people.
And, I shall never be able to forget what our victorious sister Deepa Malik had to say.
When the medal was awarded to her, she said Through this medal I have actually defeated the disability itself.
There is great strength in this remark.
This time 19 athletes, including three women, took part in Paralympics from our country.
Compared to normal sporting activities, when the DIVYANG play, in addition to physical ability and sporting skills, what are needed even more are will power and resolve.
You will be pleasantly surprised to learn that our sportspersons put up their best ever performance this time and won 4 medals including two gold, one silver and one bronze.
Brother Devendra Jhajharia won the gold medal in Javelin throw and repeated his gold winning performance after 12 years.
And, he was not born a DIVYANG.
He lost one of his hands due to suffering electric current shock.
Just think about the perseverance and the huge effort put in by him in repeating the feat of winning a second gold medal at 35 years of age 12 years after winning the first one at 23.
Mariyappan Thangavelu won a gold medal in High Jump.
Thangavelu had lost his right leg when he was just 5.
Even poverty could not come in the way of his resolve.
He is not from a big city, he does not come from a middle class or rich family.
Yet despite facing all sorts of difficulties and physical challenges, at the age of 21, through his unwavering determination he won the medal for the country.
As far as Athlete Deepa Malik is concerned, she has won laurels many a times by emerging victorious repeatedly.
Varun C. Bhati won a bronze medal in High Jump.
Medals in Paralympics have a significance of their own, but going beyond that these medals have made a very big contribution in transforming the attitude towards our DIVYANG brothers and sisters in our country, our society and our neighborhoods.
These have not only inspired our empathy but also changed the way of looking at the DIVYANG people.
Only very few people might be knowing as to what stupendous feats were performed by these DIVYANG people in the Paralympics this time.
Olympic Games were held at the same venue only a few days ago.
Can anyone ever imagine the DIVYANG athletes breaking a record set during the general Olympic Games
It happened this time.
In the 1500 meter race, Abdellatif Baka of Algeria set a new record by completing the 1500 meters race taking 1. 7 seconds less than the time taken by the gold medalist in the same event at the general Olympics.
Not only this, what really surprised me was the fact that the athlete, who finished fourth in this event amongst DIVYANG persons and thus missed winning any medal, actually took less time than the gold medalist of general category in completing the race.
I once again congratulate all our Paralympic athletes and India is progressing in the direction of preparing an effective plan for developing our athletes and also the facilities for the Paralympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had many wonderful experiences in Navsari, Gujarat.
She rendered certain portions before me and when I presented her performance before other persons there, everyone was amazed.
I got an opportunity to publicly release a book that day wherein success stories from the lives of some DIVYANG persons had been compiled.
These were very inspiring incidents.
Government of India created a world record in Navsari which I believe to be very important.
The task of fitting hearing aids to 600 hearing impaired DIVYANG people in just eight hours was completed successfully.
This deed found a mention in Guinness Book of World Records.
Three world records in a single day by DIVYANG people is a matter of great pride for our countrymen.
My dear countrymen, we had launched Swachha Bharat Mission two years ago on 2nd October, the birth anniversary of our revered Bapu.
That day too I had said that cleanliness should become our nature, a duty for every citizen and there should be an atmosphere harbouring a sense of revulsion against filth.
Now it is going to be nearly two years on 2nd October and I can confidently say that one hundred and twenty five crore people of the country have now become more aware about cleanliness.
I had said one step towards cleanliness and today we can say that each one of us has definitely tried to take one step further.
This means that the country has taken 125 crore steps in the direction of achieving cleanliness.
It has also been seen as to how much can be achieved through making small efforts. Everyone, be it a common citizen, an administrator, in Government offices or roads, bus stops or railways, schools or colleges, religious places, hospitals, from children to old persons, rural poor, farming women- everyone is contributing something in achieving cleanliness.
Friends in the media have also played a constructive role.
Whole-hearted efforts have been made and a conviction has now set in that we shall indeed succeed.
This conviction is important. If we talk of rural India, so far 2 crore 48 lakh or say about two and a half crore toilets have been constructed and we intend to build another one and a half crore toilets in the coming one year.
I visited Gujarat recently and the officers there informed me that Porbandar, the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi, will achieve the target of total ODF on 2nd October, 2016.
My congratulations to those who have made it possible, and best wishes to those who are trying to reach the target. I appeal to all of my countrymen that to maintain the dignity of our mothers and sisters and for the sake of health of our children, our country needs to get rid of this scourge.
I specially want to suggest a scheme to my young friends who are currently technology savvy.
Every citizen has a right to know about the status of the cleanliness mission in his city and the Government of India has provided a dedicated telephone number 1969 for this purpose.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated his birth centenary and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
By dialing this number 1-9-6-9 you will be able to know the progress of construction of toilets in your city and will also be able to submit an application for construction of a toilet.
Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward in this endeavour.
They can sponsor young professionals willing to work for Swachchhata Mission.
They can also be sent to various districts as Swachchha Bharat Fellows.
It will not be sufficient to keep this Cleanliness Campaign confined to beliefs and habits.
Imbibing cleanliness as a nature is not enough.
In this age, just as cleanliness is related to health, connecting cleanliness to a revenue model is also equally necessary.
Waste to wealth should also be one of its components. It is, therefore, imperative that we need to move towards Waste to Compost along with the Cleanliness Mission.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the Compost made out of waste.
They should supply this to the farmers who are willing to adopt organic farming.
This should also be supplied to those farmers who care about the health of their soil and are willing to improve its quality and also to those farmers whose soil quality has deteriorated because of over use of chemical fertilizers.
And for this, Shrimaan Amitabh Bachchan Ji is making a significant contribution as a brand ambassador.
This is a task worth doing.
Ministers, Chief Ministers as also Mayors and Commissioners of metropolitan cities will participate in brainstorming sessions on the sole issue of cleanliness.
What can be achieved with technology
How can employment opportunities be increased in this sphere
All these topics will be discussed.
And I see clearly that the news about cleanliness keeps pouring in.
I recently read in a newspaper that students of Gujarat Technological University launched a Jagran Abhiyan (Awereness Campaign) to build toilets in 107 villages.
They themselves put in physical labour and contributed significantly in constructing around 9000 toilets.
It might have come to your notice some time ago that under the leadership of Wing Commander Param Veer Singh, a team covered a distance of 2800 kilometres by swimming in Ganga from Dev Prayag to Ganga Sagar to spread the message of cleanliness.
Government of India has also chalked out an annual calendar for its departments.
Each department is to focus exclusively on cleanliness for a period of 15 days.
In the coming October month, from 1st October to 15th October, Drinking Water and Sanitation Department, Panchayati Raj Department and Rural Development Department these three are going to work under a designated roadmap in their respective areas.
Then during last two weeks of October from 16th October to 31st October, three more departments, namely Agriculture and Farmer Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs are going to take up cleanliness campaigns in the concerned areas.
I request the citizens also to get involved, wherever they feel that they too can pitch in these programmes.
You might have seen that a cleanliness survey campaign is also carried out these days.
Earlier, the cleanliness status was presented before the countrymen after conducting a survey of 73 cities.
Now, this survey will be conducted in about 500 cities with a population of more than 1 lakh. Each city will imbibe a sense of confidence that, well, we have lagged behind but we will surely perform better next time.
In this manner an atmosphere of competition for cleanliness has been created.
I expect that all of us citizens should contribute as much as we can in the cleanliness mission.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
Swachchh Bharat Mission is completing two years on this day.
I keep on urging everyone to buy some khadi items between Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This year also I request that each family should buy one or the other khadi item so that the poor may also be able to light an earthen lamp and celebrate Diwali.
This year 2nd October is a Sunday so can we involve ourselves in the cleanliness mission in some way
You involve yourself physically for 2 hours, 4 hours with cleaning work and I request you to share your cleanliness drive photo on NarendraModiApp.
If it is a video, then share the video.
You will see that with our joint efforts, this movement will get a fresh boost, a new dynamism.
Let us all remember Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and take a pledge to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, one gets a special pleasure in giving, one may not realize it, but the pleasure of giving is divine.
Under this campaign, food items and clothes will be collected and supplied to the needy persons.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to walk the streets seeking donations of old toys from families and then presented these toys to Anganwadis in poor neighbourhoods.
This is a kind of a Donation Festival, a Daan Utsav.
I convey my best wishes to all those young persons who are undertaking this mission.
My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Ji and his birth centenary year commences from today.
Sarvajan Hitay Sarvajan Sukhay, the principle of ANTYODAY these are his gifts to us.
Mahatma Gandhi also talked about the last man standing in the queue.
How can the poorest of the poor avail of benefits of development
Work for every hand, water to every field through only these two words he presented his entire economic agenda.
The country should celebrate his centenary year as GARIB KALYAN VARSH, Year for Welfare of the Poor.
We can alleviate poverty when everyone including society and governments focuses attention on measures to provide benefits of development to the poor.
This is a symbolic representation of the Year for the Welfare of the Poor, the centenary year of Pt.
I respectfully pay my homage to revered Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, who has been a source of inspiration to all of us, and an embodiment of our intellectual heritage.
My dear countrymen, I had started Mann Ki Baat on Vijayadashmi two years ago.
My sincere effort was that Mann Ki Baat should not become a programme of praising and highlighting only governments achievements
How the common man of this country keeps on inspring me all the time
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man in the country
On completion of two years of Mann Ki Baat this week, I wish to express my sincere gratitude from the core of my heart to all you listeners who appreciated it, who contributed to improving it and thus blessed me.
I am grateful to All India Radio also which not only broadcast my views but also put in their best efforts to transmit it in all languages.
I am also thankful to those countrymen who knocked on the doors of the government by writing letters and by sending in suggestions and highlighting shortcomings of the government and All India Radio mounted special programmes on these letters by inviting concerned government functionaries and thus provided a platform to address the problems.
Thus, Mann Ki Baat became a new opportunity of social transformation rather than just remaining a mere talk show of 15-20 minutes.
What can be more satisfying than this for any one And therefore, I thank everyone and express my gratitude to all who contributed in making it a successful programme.
My dear countrymen, from next week festive season will be ushered in with Navratri and Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi, preparations for Deepavali and all such activities.
This is an occasion for praying to SHAKTI, Unity in society is the power or SHAKTI of the country.
Be it Navratri or Durga Puja how can this SHAKTI-UPASANA become the festival of celebrating social unity
How to make it a festival of social bonding
And that would be the true prayer to Shakti, only then can we celebrate together the festival of victory.
Let us bow before Shakti, nurture it, march forward with the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar,Tomorrow, 29th August is the birth anniversary of hockey wizard Dhyan Chand.
This occasion is celebrated as National Sports Day throughout the country.
I offer my tributes to Dhyan Chand ji and wish to remind you all about his invaluable contribution.
He played a pivotal role in helping India win Hockey Gold Medals in Olympic Games of 1928, 1932 and 1936.
All of us cricket lovers know Bradmans name very well.
He had complimented Dhyan Chand ji by saying that he scores goals like runs. Dhyan Chand ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and nationalism.
During a match in Kolkata one player from the opposite team hit him on the head with the hockey stick.
At that point, only 10 minutes were left in the game.
And, Dhyan Chand ji scored three goals in just those ten minutes and said I avenged the hit by scoring goals.
Dear countrymen, as the time of Mann Ki Baat draws near, a very large number of suggestions are received on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
I find it a very positive sign that our common people have such attachment and awareness about Rio Olympics and they are insisting that the Prime Minister of the country says something on this matter.
It shows that besides Cricket, our people have so much involvement in and awareness and knowledge about other sports and games also.
For me, even reading these messages proved to be a source of inspiration.
One Shri Ajit Singh ji has written on NarendraModiApp Please, this time in Mann Ki Baat do talk about the education of our daughters, our Betis and their participation in sports because they have brought laurels for the country by winning medals at the Rio Olympics.
One Shri Sachin has written to urge that in Mann Ki Baat this time a mention may please be made about Sindhu, Saakshi and Deepa Karmakar.
Whatever medals we got have been earned by our daughters.
These Betis have once again proved that they are second to none in any respect.
It seems that our daughters in the whole of India have decided to take up the responsibility of bringing glory to the nation.
Shikhar Thakur has written on MyGov that we could have performed better at the Olympics.
He has written Respected Modi Sir, first of all, congratulations on our winning two medals at Rio.
However, I want to draw your attention to the question was our performance really good
And, the answer is No.
We have to go a long way in the field of sports.
Our parents, even today, insist on focusing on studies and academics.
Sports are considered a waste of time in our society.
We need to change this mindset.
Society needs motivation for this.
And, no one can do this better than you.
Similarly, one Shri Satya Prakash Mehra ji has written on NarednraModiApp In Mann Ki Baat, there is a need to focus on extra-curricular activities, especially on encouraging children and youth to play.
Thousands of people have expressed similar sentiments.
There is no denying the fact that we could not perform up to the expectations.
Some of our players could not even touch during these Games their own performance level which they had achieved during the domestic events in India. In the medals chart, our tally was only two medals.
However, it is also a fact that if we look closely, we shall find that despite missing medals, Indian players gave a very good account of themselves for the first time in some of the events.
See, our Abhinav Bindra very narrowly missed the medal and got fourth place in Shooting.
Dipa Karmakar produced a superb performance in Gymnastics, although she remained at the fourth place and missed a Bronze by a very narrow margin.
But, how can we forget that she is Indias first daughter to qualify in Gymnastics for the Olympics and also to reach the final round.
The pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna met almost a similar fate in Tennis.
Our athletes this time gave a creditable performance.
T. Ushas feat, Lalita babar qualified for the finals in track and field.
Our Womens Hockey Team qualified for the Olympic Games after a space of 36 long years.
Vikas Krishna Yadav reached the quarter finals in Boxing but could not win Bronze.
Many players like Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das gave a very good performance.
But my dear countrymen, we do have to go a long way.
And if we stick to the same routine, we may perhaps keep facing the same disappointment.
I have announced setting up of a committee.
The Government of India will make an in depth in-house analysis and will study the practices being followed around the world.
We shall prepare a roadmap on how we can do better.
We have to prepare a far reaching plan keeping in view the Olympics in 2020, 2024, 2028.
I urge the State Governments also to set up similar committees to find out as to what we can do in sports. What can each state do
And, I also request all citizens of the country who have interest in this matter to mail their suggestions on NarendraModiApp.
They may write to the government associations may discuss these issues and submit their memoranda to the government.
State governments too should deliberate on this matter and provide their suggestions.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is Teachers Day.
I used to learn quite a lot from those young children.
For me, 5th September was Teachers Day as well as an Education Day.
But, this time I have to leave for G-20 Summit and so felt in my heart that I should express my feelings in this regard in Mann Ki Baat today.
In our life, a teacher holds the same place which a mother does.
We have also seen such teachers who care more for their pupils than for themselves.
They devote their lives for their disciples, their students.
These days, after Rio Olympics, Pulela Gopi Chand ji is being talked about everywhere.
He is a player first but he has set up a glorious example of what a good coach, that is, a teacher should be.
I see Gopi Chand ji today as an excellent teacher besides being a very accomplished player.
And, on Teachers Day, I salute Pulela Gopi Chand ji for his hard work, his dedication towards sports and his manner of finding happiness in the success of his disciples.
We always feel the contribution of our teachers in our lives.
5th September happens to be the birthday of Indias former President Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji and the country celebrates this as Teachers Day.
Whatever post he held in his life, he always tried to live like a teacher, an educator.
Some times when I think of it, I remember so many incidents related with my teachers because they were our heroes in our small village.
However, I can happily say that even now I receive a hand written letter every month from one of my teachers, who has turned 90 now.
And, about his handwriting even at the age of 90, I marvel that he writes so beautifully whereas my own handwriting is very poor. That is why, whenever I look at somebodys good handwriting, I have a great respect for it.
If you have a photograph with your teacher or an incident connected with your teacher or an inspirational thing associated with your teacher, please do share the same on NarendraModiApp.
Looking at the contribution of teachers in the country from the point of view of students is also immensely valuable in itself.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Utsav is drawing near.
Ganesh ji removes all obstacles and let us all wish that our country, our society, our families, and each one of us may lead a life free of obstacles.
But, when we mention Ganesh Utsav, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public celebration of Ganesh Utsav is Lokmanya Tilaks gift to us.
By publicly celebrating Ganesh Utsav, he turned this religious occasion into a festival of national awakening and social refinement.
These Ganesh festivities included holding wide-ranging discussions on the issues that touched our lives and society, and comprised such programmes which provided a new vigour and vitality to our social fabric.
Now, not in Maharashtra alone but in each corner of India, Ganesh Utsav is celebrated publicly.
Young people make elaborate preparations, they are full of vigour.
Some people even now try to follow the path shown by Lokmanya Tilak ji.
They organise debates on topics of public interest, and hold essay competitions and rangoli competitions.
Tableus depict the issues of social concern in a very artistic manner.
In a way, a mass campaign of public education gets underway through these Ganesh festivities.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us the inspirational mantra Swaraj, that is, freedom is our birthright.
can we not recite this mantra and give a message for it in the public Ganesh festival celebrations
Come on, I invite you all.
It is true that festivals express the vitality of a society.
Festivals infuse new life into individuals as well as the society.
Life seems to be impossible without festivals but these have to be moulded according to the needs of the changing times.
I have seen that this time, many people have written to me mentioning Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
They are worried about environment.
One Shri Shankar Narayan Prashant has strongly urged Modi ji, kindly tell the people through your Mann Ki Baat that they should not use Ganesh idols made of Plaster of Paris.
Why should we not use Ganeshji idols made of the clay from the village pond.
POP idols are not environment friendly.
He has expressed a great pain, others have also.
I request you all as to why should we not use clay in making Ganesh and Durga idols and revert to our old tradition.
This will help in environment preservation, prevent pollution of our rivers and ponds and also provide protection to small creatures living in water. This is also the service of God.
Ganesh ji removes obstacles.
So, we should not make such Ganeshji idols, which create problems.
I do not know how you will take my suggestions but it is not just me but many other people saying the same thing.
Many such institutions work hard to promote Ganesh idols made from clay and they also propagate it.
Eco-friendly Ganeshotsav is also social service.
There is still time left before the start of Durga Pooja festivities.
If we resolve now, our efforts will lead to employment generation for those families which traditionally used to make clay idols in the past. Also the clay will go back and get dissolved in the pond or the river and will thus help in protecting the environment.
I offer my best wishes to you all for Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be canonized, that is, accorded sainthood on 4th September.
Mother Teresa devoted her entire life to the service of the poor in India.
When Mother Teresa, who served the poor in India all through her life, is accorded Sainthood, it is quite natural for we Indians to feel proud.
Indian government will send an official delegation under the leadership of our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to represent 125 crore Indians at the canonization ceremony to be held on 4th September.
We keep learning something or the other from great men and women, saints, sages, holy people.
We shall continue to receive something, learn something from them and keep on doing some good things.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement, a big transformation takes place.
Peoples power is, in a way, considered to be a divine incarnation.
Government of India has made a successful effort to clean the Ganga and involve the people for this project with the cooperation of five State governments.
Pradhans of villages situated on the banks of the river Ganga were invited to Allahabad on the 20th of this month.
They included men as well as women.
They came to Allahabad and took an oath before Mother Ganga that they will make all out efforts to immediately stop the practice of open defecation in their villages situated on the banks of Ganga, start a campaign of building toilets and also that these villages will make their full contribution in cleaning up Ganga and will ensure that Ganga is not polluted now.
I congratulate all the Pradhans who had assembled in Allahabad with this resolve from different States they had come from Uttrakhand, from Uttar Pradesh, from Bihar, from Jharkhand and from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all those Ministries of the Government of India and also those ministers who turned this vision into reality.
I also want to thank the Chief Ministers of these five States for taking the vital step in the direction of making Ganga clean by involving peoples power.
My dear countrymen, certain things touch me very deeply and my heart bows in respect to those who visualize such heartwarming initiatives.
In Kabirdham district of Chhatisgarh more than 1. 25 lakh students from about 1700 schools collectively wrote letters to their parents.
Some students wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi and some in Chhatisgarhi to their parents telling them that there should be toilets in their houses.
Students of age between seven to seventeen took up this task.
And this had such an impact, such an emotional impact that while the students were going to school the next day, their parents handed over reply letters to them addressed to the teacher in which they promised to build toilets by a certain date positively.
My compliments to those who visualized this idea, compliments to these students and special compliments to those parents who took their childrens letters so seriously and also took a decision to construct a toilet.
This is what inspires us.
In Koppal district of Karnataka, a sixteen year old girl Mallamma started a Satyagrah against her own family.
She launched the Satyagrah and stopped eating and she did that not to ask something for herself, not to demand good clothes or have sweets. This daughter Mallamma was adamant to have a toilet built in her house.
But, the family was not in a good position economically. The daughter stuck to her demand and was not prepared to end her Satyagrah.
He was told that Mallamma had protested to press for her demand for getting a toilet built in her house. Now, look at the gesture of village Pradhan Mohammad Shafi, he arranged eighteen thousand rupees and got a toilet built within a week.
Just see the power and strength in Mallammas protest, and also consider the grand gesture of a village Pradhan like Mohammad Shafi.
Look how the solutions to problems are found, this is the power of the people.
My dear countrymen, Swachha Bharat has become the dream of each Indian.
Some Indians have made it their resolve.
Some Indians have made it their aim and purpose.
But, each one is connected to it in one or the other way and everyone is making a contribution.
A competition will be held and the winners will be awarded prizes on Gandhi Jayanti Day on 2nd October.
You can even shoot a film these days using your mobile phone camera.
I call upon you all to come forward and participate.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried its best to have close, cordial and vibrant relations with its neighbours.
A very important event took place recently. The Honourable President of India Shri Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated a new radio channel named Akashvani Maitree Channel at Kolkata.
Now, some people may wonder whether Honourable President should inaugurate a Radio Channel
But this is no ordinary Radio Channel, it is a very big and very important step.
We have Bangladesh as our neighbour.
We know that both Bangladesh and West Bengal continue to have a common cultural heritage.
So, Akashvani Maitree on this side and Bangladesh Betaar on that side will mutually share the content and Bengali speaking people on both sides will enjoy the programmes of Akashvani, that is, All India Radio.
This people to people contact is a big contribution of Akashvani.
The President launched this radio channel.
I extend my thanks to Bangladesh also for collaborating with us in this initiative.
I congratulate the friends in All India Radio too for making their contribution in our foreign policy also.
My dear countrymen, although you have entrusted me with the responsibilities of Prime Minister but I also am a human being just like you.
At times, sensitive events touch me a little too deeply.
Such sentimental incidents generate new energy, give new inspiration and this is what motivates us Indians to do some remarkable things.
I received a letter recently which touched my heart.
A motherly lady of about 84 years of age who is a retired teacher wrote that letter to me.
If she had not forbidden me from revealing her name, I from the core of my heart wanted to announce her name while talking to you. She wrote in her letter that after my appeal to the people to forego their cooking gas subsidy, she had given up her subsidy and then she even forgot about it.
And, she has said that a letter from the Prime Minister was no less than a Padma Shree honour for her.
Dear countrymen, you may be knowing that I have tried to send a letter, to be delivered personally through my representatives, to all those who surrendered their cooking gas subsidy on my appeal.
My effort is to send letters to more than one crore people.
Under this plan my letter had reached this mother who wrote back to me saying that I was doing a good work under the campaign of providing relief to those poor ladies who are getting freedom from the smoke of a Chulha.
I am a retired teacher and will cross the age of 90 years within a few years and I am sending you a donation of fifty thousand rupees which you can use in this mission of providing relief from the Chulha smoke to the poor women.
You may well imagine the missionary spirit of this retired teacher living on pension and donating an amount of fifty thousand rupees for the sake of provision of gas connection to the other poor mothers and sisters, in order to save them from the ill effects of Chulha smoke.
It is not a question of 50 thousand rupees but the basic question is of the empathy in this old lady and it is because of the blessings of this lady and of crores of our other mothers and sisters which strengthens my confidence in the future of the country.
And, she did not write to me this letter as a Prime Minister but she straightforwardly wrote Modi Bhaiya
I salute this wonderful mother and I also salute crores of similar mothers in India who keep doing something or the other all the time for the benefit of others despite facing many difficulties themselves.
My dear countrymen, we were struggling with drought-like conditions last year but this August we have been facing the fury of floods all through.
In some parts of the country, there have been repetitive floods.
State governments, Union government, local self-government bodies, social organisations and the citizens did whatever best could be done.
Yet, even amidst the reports of these floods, some such events happened which should be remembered.
Which show the power of unity, and how big results can be achieved by working together
The month of August this year has become memorable.
In August 2016, about 90 political parties in the country, many of these parties in the Parliament, which were staunch opponents of each other and which do not miss the slightest opportunity against each other, all these parties got united and passed the GST Act.
The credit for this goes to all the parties.
And, this is an example which shows that great tasks can be accomplished by working in unison to move ahead.
Similarly, about the incidents that took place in Kashmir and all that happened in Kashmir, all political parties in the country collectively expressed their views in one voice.
A massage was sent to the whole world, a massage also went to the separatist forces and our sympathy was expressed towards the people of Kashmir.
And, we all are of the view, and this is the view of all 125 crore Indians, right from the village Pradhan to the Prime Minister that every loss of life in Kashmir whether it is of a young man or of a security personnel it is our own loss, a loss of our people, a loss for the nation
Those trying to disturb peace in Kashmir by putting small children in the front and hiding behind them will have to be answerable to these very innocent children some day.
My dear countrymen, ours is a vast nation, full of diversities.
To keep this country of manifold diversities united, we all as citizens, as society and as the government, have a responsibility to encourage things which strengthen our national unity and highlight these with full vigour, only then we can make our countrys future bright, and, of course, this will be achieved.
I have full faith in the power of my 125 crore countrymen.
That is all for today, many many thanks.
Early this morning, I had an opportunity to spend some time with some young people from Delhi. And I believe, in the days to come, the spirit and fervor of sports will envelop every young person in the country.
All of us know that in a few days time, the worlds largest sports event, the biggest sports carnival will take place.
RIO is going to resound in our ears time and again.
All of us harbour a lot of hopes and expectations, but keeping the morale of our sports contingent at RIO high is also the solemn duty of us 1. 25 billion countrymen.
In Delhi this morning, the Government of India had organised a very good event, Run for RIO, Play and Live, Play and Blossom.
In the days to come, wherever we are, let us do our bit to encourage our sportspersons.
However much one cherishes all kinds of food, one has to sacrifice that.
Im also ready to do this on your behalf
the prime minister of the country is ready to be a postman to convey your good wishes to these players.
In the absence of research and innovation, technology will become a burden, just as still water stagnates and even stinks.
And if we go on just using old technology without recourse to research and innovation, we will become outdated in this rapidly changing world and age. And that is why the government too has taken steps to attract the new generation toward science and research innovation in the field of technology.
And when I say let us aim to innovate my AIM stands for Atal Innovation Mission.
If we have to develop the next generation innovators, we shall have to link our children with it. And that is why the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
Wherever such Tinkering Labs are established in schools, those would be given 10 Lakh rupees and further 10 Lakh rupees will be provided for maintenance during the period of five years.
If we have strong and well-equipped Incubation Centres, a system comes into place for innovations, for start-ups, for experimentation and to bring these efforts to a certain level.
India is grappling with diverse challenges.
We see problems in daily life.
We shall now have to look for technological solutions for these.
Through the Atal Grand Challenges we have exhorted the young generation of the country that if they see problems, they should search for solutions taking the path of technology, doing research, applying innovations and bring those on board.
The Government of India wants to specially reward technology developed to find solutions to our problems.
My dear countrymen, while some time ago, we were concerned about a drought like situation, these days, on the one hand, we are enjoying the rains, but on the other, reports of floods are also coming in.
Central government and State Governments are working hand in hand with their utmost efforts to provide relief and assistance to the flood-affected.
Despite causing some hardships, rains make every human heart rejoice since rains, and agriculture, are the focal point of our entire sphere of economic activities.
There are times when one has to face an illness that leaves a scar for a lifetime.
It is preventable.
Pay attention to cleanliness, be alert, try and be safe and take special care of children. And the mindset that such diseases strike poor neighborhoods only, is not valid in the case of Dengue.
Dengue first enters affluent localities and we should try and understand it.
You must be watching advertisements on TV but there are times when we neglect taking proactive and informed action on it.
The government, hospitals, doctors will of course do their job, but I urge that we should also be alert in ensuring that Dengue doesnt enter our homes, locality, family, for that matter, any illness connected with stagnant water.
I would like to draw the attention of my dear countrymen to another menace.
In todays fast paced, rat race of life, at times we dont have time to think about ourselves.
When we fall sick, we want to get well as soon as possible and as a result pop in just any antibiotic that we can lay our hands on.
It may give you instant relief, but my dear countrymen, this random pill popping habit can land you in deep trouble.
It may give you temporary succor, but we should completely stop taking antibiotics without the advice of a doctor.
I urge you to complete the entire course of medication as prescribed by the doctor.
Microbes spreading TB and malaria are bringing about rapid mutations in themselves, rendering medicines ineffective.
In medical parlance it is called antibiotic resistance. Hence it is indeed necessary to follow rules in the administration of antibiotics.
While we are on the subject of health, I would like to talk about one more issue.
I feel very concerned about the lives of pregnant women of our country.
In our country, close to 3 crore women become pregnant every year but some of these mothers die during childbirth. Sometimes the mother loses her life, at times the infant does.
It is true that in the last decade there has been a decline in maternal mortality rates but even now, we are not able to save the lives of a large number of pregnant women.
Anemia during or after pregnancy, pregnancy related infections, high BP, any such complication can have devastating effect.
Keeping in view these issues, in the last few months, the Government of India has launched a new campaign Prime Minister Safe Motherhood Campaign.
Under this, on the 9th of every month, all pregnant women will get a check-up at government health centers free of cost.
I have specially asked the gynecologists whether they could offer their services free on the 9th of every month, for the sake of under privileged mothers
Cant my doctor brothers and sisters spare just 12 days in a year for this service to the under privileged
I do believe that you will indeed do so.
My dear countrymen, today, the whole world is concerned deeply about climate change, global warming and the environment.
These are discussed collectively in the country and across the world.
In India, this has been accorded great importance for centuries.
In the battlefield of Kurukshetra too, Bhagwan Shri Krishna talks of trees. Showing concern towards trees even in the midst of a battle, underlines how much importance was attached to trees.
In the Gita, Bhagwan Shri Krishna says, ashwatth sarvvrikshanam which means amongst all trees, I am the Peepal Tree.
It is proclaimed in Shukracharya Neeti that naastimulam anaushadham meaning that there is no plant that does not have medicinal values
He who donates a tree, that tree in return becomes a ladder to salvation just like children.
Therefore it is appropriate that parents desiring their well-being should plant tree and rear them like their own children.
Our scriptures like Gita, Shukracharya Niti and Anushasan Parv of the Mahabharta contain such lofty ideals. However, there are certain individuals in the present generation also, who live up to these ideals.
A few days ago, I came across a mention of Sonal, a young daughter from Pune. It touched my heart.
It is mentioned in Anushasan Parv in Mahabharata that a tree is like an offspring and becomes means of salvation in after life, Sonal has not only taken it upon herself to fulfill her parents wishes but societys expectations also.
Shri Khandu Maruti Mhatre, a farmer of Narayanpur village of of Junner Taluka of Pune got his granddaughter Sonal married in a very inspiring manner.
That picture really touches ones heart.
I think that Sonal, who herself is an agriculture graduate, came upon this idea. And to present Mango saplings in the marriage, just think, reflects the love for nature in a brilliant manner.
In a way, Sonals marriage in an everlasting story of love for nature, I congratulate Sonal and Shriman Mhatre Ji for this innovative effort.
And such experiments are done by many people.
I remember, when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat the temple of Ambaji there is visited in the month of Bhadrapad by lakhs of devotees travelling by foot. A certain NGO decided to distribute saplings as Prasad to the devotees, and the devotees were told that Mata Ambaji will keep on showering her grace, if they took care of the saplings, till their maturity into trees in their homes and villages.
I repeatedly tell my farmer brethren that instead of wasting our land in building fences around our fields, why dont we start planting timber trees there.
Today India has to spend billions and trillions of rupees to import timber wood from abroad for construction of houses and furniture.
If we plant on the boundaries of our fields timber trees that can be utilised for construction of homes and furniture and which can also be cut and sold after 15 to 20 years with the permission of the government. This way, not only can these become a new source of your income, but can also save India from importing timber.
Some days ago, a few states taking advantage of this weather have started many campaigns in this direction and the Government of India has also passed CAMPA law, under which about 40 thousand crores rupees will go to the states for planting trees.
I have been told that the Maharashtra government planted about 2 crores sapling in the entire state on 1st July and next year they have taken a pledge to plant about 3 crores trees.
The Maharashtra government has transformed this activity into a peoples movement.
Rajasthan, desert area, has celebrated Van Mahotsav in a very big way and pledged to plant 25 lakhs trees.
To plant 25 lakhs of sapling in Rajasthan is not a small matter
Those who know the soil conditions of Rajasthan would know how mammoth this task is going to be.
Andhra Pradesh, too has decided to increase its green cover by 50 by the year 2029.
Gujarat too has an illustrious tradition of observing Van Mahotsav.
This year Gujarat has undertaken many projects like Aamra Van, Ekata Van and Shaheed Van as a part of Van Mahotsav and launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I am not able to mention every state but all deserve to be appreciated.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa for the first time some time back.
During a foreign visit, diplomacy is practiced, there are trade deliberations, discussions about security and as is customary, many MoUs are concluded.
But for me the visit to South Africa was more like a pilgrimage.
When we think of South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever we hear the words non-violence, love and forgiveness, the inspiring faces of Gandhi and Mandela appear before us.
During my South Africa tour, I visited Phoenix settlement where Mahatma Gandhis home is known as Sarvodaya.
I also had the good fortune of traveling from Pietermaritzburg station in the train in which Mahatma Gandhi had travelled, and which was the site of the incidence that sowed the seed of the transformation of a Mohandas into Mahatma Gandhi.
But what I want to tell you is the fact that this time I had an opportunity to meet those great men who had devoted their young lives for society fighting shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela for the ideals of equality and equal opportunity
who had spent 20 to 22 years of their lives in prison with Nelson Mandela, effectively sacrificing the entire period of their youth for the society.
I had the privilege of meeting these grat personalities, these close associates of Nelson Mandela such as Shriman Ahmed Kathrada, Shriman Laloo Chiba, Shriman George Bizos and Ronnie Kasrils.
All were Indian by origin but dedicated themselves to wherever they settled and decided to offer their lives for those amidst whom they lived.
There was not a single trace of desire, to get something, to become somebody even after living such a great life of Tapasaya.
The essence of performing ones duty as explained in Gita was embodied in their persona.
I will remember that meeting forever.
Equality and equal opportunity are the two biggest mantras for any society and government.
Equality and equal opportunity, compassion and fraternity, these are the paths leading us to a bright future.
We all want a good future for our children.
Everybody has different needs and different priorities but there is one common path of development, equality, compassion and fraternity.
Come, let us be proud about these Indians who have lived their lives in South Africa embodying our highest and fundamental ideals.
Being a woman, I feel an empathy with her family.
And just as technology plays an increasingly bigger role in our economic system, it also invites those who misuse it.
And in very little time, he understood that he had been looted You too must be getting similarly confused sometimes These people write a letter in such style that it seems perfect.
They use fake letter pads while sending these letters. They obtain your credit card number and debit card number and empty your bank account through technology.
And this new means of fraud is digital fraud.
I believe that we must be aware against such lure, must remain cautious and if such false communications come to our notice, then we must share them with our friends and make them aware also.
Shilpi Varma has brought this important thing to my notice, which although even you must have encountered, but may be you did not take it that seriously, but I feel there is need to look at it seriously.
My dear countrymen these days, the Parliament Session is going on, and during the Parliament Session, I get to meet many people from across our nation.
But recently I had a pleasant experience, real pleasant experience
Student from Aligarh had come to meet me.
These were artistic painting done on the station.
What is more, they had searched for and collected the plastic bottles and oil cans lying in the garbage in the villages and by filling those with soil and planting saplings, they have transformed those pots into a vertical garden.
And by creating this vertical garden on the site of railway station, they have given it a new look.
If you go to Aligarh, do visit the railway station.
I am receiving news from many railway stations in the country where the local populace has taken to depicting on the walls of the railway stations, their areas identity, through means of their arts.
They have brought about a refreshing feeling.
This is a prime example of the great transformation, which can be brought about through peoples participation.
I felicitate all such citizens involved in these kinds of activities and especially congratulate friends from Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, with the onset of rainy season, there is also an onset of festival season in our country.
There would be fairs everywhere, festivities would be observed in temples and places of worship.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a festival of special significance.
Just like last year, cant you gift on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojna to mothers and sisters of our country.
Think about it, we should gift such a present to our sisters, which really provides her security in future.
And I am the first Prime Minister of this nation who was born in free India.
The 75th year of uit India and 70th year of Independence can be source of new inspiration, source of new enthusiasm and an occasion to take a pledge to do something for our nation.
The whole nation should be imbued with the spirit of those great patriots and we should once again experience anew the fragrance of freedom.
Let us all create such an atmosphere. Independence Day should not be a government event, it should be the celebration of the entire people.
Just like Diwali, it should be our own festival.
I hope that you too become inspired with the spirit of patriotism and do something good in that vein.
Do send a picture of it on Narendra Modi app.
Let us create such an atmosphere in the nation.
Dear countrymen, I have the good fortune to talk to the nation from ramparts of Red Fort on 15thAugust, it is a tradition.
You too must be having certain thoughts that you wish were proclaimed from Red Fort.
I invite you to write to me about your thoughts that I, as your representative, as your Pradhan Sevak should talk about from the Red Fort.
I do not wish that whatever I speak from the ramparts of Red Fort should just be the opinion of the Prime Minister
I invite you once again, come, let us remember and salute our great freedom fighters, who sacrificed their lives for India and let us move ahead with the pledge to do something for our nation.
it should be the collective voice of 125 crores countrymen.
My dear countrymen, namaskar
I am grateful to All India Radio that they have also been successfully broadcasting Mann Ki Baat in regional languages at 8 pm.
I am also very happy that the people who listen to me, later communicate their feelings to me through letters, telephone calls, the website MyGov. in and also through the NarendraModiApp.
A lot of what you say is of great help to me in the functioning of the government.
How much priority should be given to public welfare activities In terms of these matters, this dialogue, this link that I have with you all, is of great use.
I hope that you will now be even more actively and enthusiastically involved in ensuring that our democracy should function with peoples participation.
The summer heat is increasing day by day.
Almost the entire country is reeling under the scorching impact of severe heat.
The mercury continues to soar.
These problems have been getting increasingly worse due to environmental degradation.
In a way, the human race itself has paved the way for self-annihilation by destroying the environment.
5th June is World Environment Day.
On this day, discussions expressing concern on the issue are held all over the world for saving the environment.
This time on the occasion of World Environment Day, the United Nations has given the theme ero Tolerance for Illegal Wildlife Trade.
This topic will, of course, be discussed, but we also must talk about saving our flora and fauna, conserving water, and how to expand our forest cover.
You must have seen in the last few days how forest fires raged in the lap of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.
Recently, I convered at length with the Chief Ministers of eleven states, reeling under severe drought- Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and, Odisha.
I carefully heard what each state had to say.
Usually such talks do not go beyond discussion on how much money was granted by the Central Government state-wise, and how much money was actually spent by each state.
Thus, it came as a surprise even to the officers of the Central Government that some states have indeed made some very commendable efforts related to water, environment, tackling drought, caring for animals as well as affected human beings. Based on inputs from all corners of the country, irrespective of the ruling party there, we found that we had to give a thought to finding not only permanent solutions but also devising practical ways and means to deal with this long-standing problem.
In a way, It was a kind of a learning experience too for me. And I have told the Niti Aayog that they should work on how to incorporate the best practices across all the states.
Some states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have made full use of technology.
I would like that in future, through the Niti Aayog, the exceptionally successful efforts of these states should be applied to other states also.
Peoples participation is a strong base for solving such problems.
When we go to a temple, we are given an offering of Prasad and even if a small bit of that spills, we feel bad in our hearts.
We not only pick it up but also pray five times for Gods forgiveness.
Water is also an offering form the God.
Even if a drop of water is wasted, then we should feel remorse and pain.
And so water storage, water conservation and proper water irrigation are all of equal importance. And so there is need for implementing the maxim Per Drop More Crop through Micro-Irrigation and cultivating crops that require minimal water intake.
At present, it is indeed good news that in many states, even sugarcane farmers are using micro irrigation, some are using drip irrigation and some are using sprinklers.
When I discussed with the eleven states, I noticed that even for cultivating paddy for production of rice, some of them had employed drip irrigation successfully and got higher yields, thereby also reducing the requirement for water as well as for labour.
I also found that there were many states which had taken on very big targets, especially, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat- these three states have done massive work in the field of drip irrigation.
And they are striving to bring every year 2 to 3 lakh hectares additional land under micro- irrigation.
If this campaign gets underway in all the states, then not only will it benefit cultivation, but more water will also be conserved.
Our farmer brothers in Telangana, through Mission Bhagirathi have made a commendable effort to optimally use the waters of Godavari and Krishna rivers.
In Andhra Pradesh, Neeru Pragati Mission has been using technology for ground water recharging.
People are devoting hard work and contributing financially as well to the mass movement that has been started in Maharashtra,.
Jal Yukt Shivir is one such peoples movement which is really going to be of great help in saving Maharashtra from water crisis in the future- this is what I feel.
Chhattisgarh has started the Lok-Suraj, Jal-Suraj campaign.
Madhya Pradesh has started the Balram Talaab Yojana- and dug nearly 22,000 ponds, which is no small figure, work is also being carried out on their Kapil Dhara Koop Yojana.
These states are making a very big effort to revive these as water temples.
Rajasthan has started the Chief Ministers Jal Swawalamban Abhiyan Water Self Sufficiency Campaign.
Jharkhand, although being a predominantly forest area, still has some parts which face water problem.
They have launched a very big campaign for building Check Dams.
They have started an exercise to check and stop the flow of water.
Some states have started a campaign and made a number of small dams at distances of 10 to 20 kilometres in the rivers themselves to check the flow of water.
This is a wonderful experience.
I urge the people of India that during this June, July, August September, we should resolve that we shall not let a single drop of water be wasted.
And the issue of water is not just for the farmers.
And for this reason, now that the rainy season is approaching, saving water should be our priority. And when we celebrate Diwali this time, then we should also revel in how much water did we save how much water we stopped from flowing out.
You will see for yourselves that our joy will increase manifold.
What a priceless treasure it is bestowed upon us by the Almighty
Recently the Media reported about the water crisis in great detail.
I hope that the Media will show the path to the people on how to save water, start a campaign, and also share the responsibility to free us from the water crisis forever I invite then as well.
My dear Countrymen, we have to build a modern India.
We have to make a transparent India.
We have to make many services uniformly available across the entire country from one corner to another. So we will have to change some of our old habits as well.
Today I want to touch upon one topic in which if you can be of help to me, then we can together achieve progress in that direction.
If you wanted salt, you could give vegetables in exchange.
Business was carried out only through the barter system.
But now times have changed.
The whole world is moving towards a cashless society.
Through the facility of electronic technology, we can get money and also give money
we can buy things and pay our bills too.
And with this there is no question of our wallets getting stolen from our pocket.
We need not worry about keeping an account the account will be maintained automatically.
In the beginning it may appear to be a bit difficult, but once we get used to it, then this arrangement will seem very easy for us.
And this possibility is there because under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana that we have started recently, nearly all the families in the country have had their bank accounts opened.
M. Synchronising these three, we can move ahead towards a cashless society.
You must have seen that along with the Jan Dhan account people have been given a RuPay card.
In the coming days this card is going to be useful as both- a credit and a debit card.
There is no need to take out any money from your pocket and count it
there is no need to carry around any cash with you.
One of the initiatives in this regard taken by the Government of India is about how to make payments through Pos, how to receive money.
It will become very easy to do money transactions through your mobile phone. And Im happy to tell you that the N.
In a way we have worked towards providing the bank at your door step.
Post offices have also been geared up for banking services.
If we learn and adapt ourselves to use these services, then we will not require the currency, we will not need notes, we will not need coins. Businesses will function automatically, resulting in a certain transparency.
Once we start, we will move ahead with great ease.
Twenty years ago who would have thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands.
Slowly we cultivated a habit and now we cant do without those.
Maybe this cashless society assumes a similar form. But the sooner this happens, the better it will be.
My dear countrymen, whenever the Olympic games come around, and when these begin, we sit and clutch our heads and sigh, we were left so far behind in the tally of gold medals... did we get a silver or not...
To encourage the sportspersons who are leaving for the Rio Olympics, to boost their morale, everyone should try in ones own way.
Someone could write a song, someone could draw cartoons, someone could send messages with good wishes, somebody could cheer a particular sport, but on the whole a very positive environment should be created in the entire country for these sportspersons.
Whatever may be the result, a game is a game, one can win or lose, medals are won sometimes and sometimes not
This becomes a source of strength in itself, when the sportsperson feels that his 125 crore countrymen are with him, his morale gets boosted.
And these days I have noticed that a conducive atmosphere for Football can be seen in the whole country.
Many people are taking an initiative to form their own teams.
I have received thousands of suggestions on the NarendraModi Mobile App.
Maybe many people dont play the game themselves, but hundreds of thousands of young Indians have displayed such keen interest in the sport, this by itself was a very delightful experience for me.
We all know the bond that India has with Cricket, but I saw the same passion for Football as well, and this by itself heralds a very positive signal for the future.
For all the selected candidates for the Rio Olympics, and for our favourite sportspersons, we should create a cheerful and positive atmosphere.
We should not judge everything in terms of victory and defeat.
India should be known in the world for its spirit of sportsmanship.
I appeal to my countrymen to contribute their bit in creating an atmosphere that boosts the spirits and enthusiasm of our athletes.
In the last week or so, results have been pouring in from all over the country...
I am talking about those students who slogged for the entire year, those of 10th and 12th Class.
It is clear that our daughters are marching ahead triumphantly.
It is a matter of joy.
To those who have succeeded in these exams, I extend my congratulations and felicitations.
And those who were not able to succeed, I would like to tell them once again that there is a lot to do in life.
Life does not get stuck if we do not get results according to our expectations.
We should live with hope, we should move ahead with confidence.
But I have been confronted with a new type of question, about which earlier I had never given a thought.
But I was amazed when everybody in the house, friends and my teachers said the same thing, Oh Dear, if your had secured just 4 more marks, you would have made it to 90.
So it seems that my family, my friends, my teachers, nobody was pleased with my 89. 33 marks.
Everyone was lamenting that I missed my 90 by four marks.
Now Im perplexed and dont know how to handle the situation.
Is this all to life.
Was what I did not good enough
Did I not prove myself
I dont know but I feel a burden on my heart and mind.
like you there are many lakhs and crores of other students who share the same pain. Because nowadays there is a trend that instead of finding satisfaction in what we have achieved, we tend to express our dissatisfaction in not achieving unrealistic goals. This is another form of negativity.
We can never guide society towards the path of satisfaction if we always find dissatisfaction in everything.
It would have been better if your family members, your class mates and your friends had appreciated your 89. 33.
Santosh Giri Goswami has written to me from Jodhpur something similar, almost along the same lines.
He says that the people around him just dont accept the results.
I dont remember the complete poem. The poet had written something like this I painted a picture of my anguish on the canvas of life.
I wish some odd visitor had also shed a tear or two over the picture of my anguish.
I dont remember if these were the exact words of the poem, as I read this poem way back.
You have the burden on yourself of fulfilling the expectations of millions of others.
All that I would like to say to you is that in such a situation, dont lose your balance.
Everyone expresses their expectations just keep listening, but stick to your point and make an effort to do something even better.
But if you are not satisfied over what you have got, you will never be able to create something new.
The strong foundation of one success becomes the foundation for another greater success.
The dissatisfaction arising out of success never becomes a ladder to success it guarantees failure.
I would like to appeal to parents, friends and neighbours that please dont impose your expectations upon your children.
And friends, does our life come to a standstill if we meet with failure sometimes.
Sometimes one is not able to score good marks in exams, but he or she surges ahead in sports, or does well in music, or excels in the fine arts, or forges ahead in business.
God has gifted each one of us with a unique talent.
Please recognize your internal strength, build upon it and you will be able to march ahead.
And this happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard of the musical instrument called santoor.
There was a time when the santoor was associated with the folk music of the Kashmir valley.
But it was Pandit Shiv Kumar (Sharma) whose magical touch transformed it into one of the prime musical instruments of the world.
Shehnai once had a limited space in the world of music.
It was mostly played at the threshold of the courts of emperors and kings.
But Ustad Bismillah Khans mastery over the Shehnai made it one of the finest musical instruments in the world
My dear countrymen, sometimes I notice that the money that our poor families have to spend on their healthcare, throws their life off the track.
It is true that while one has to spend little on preventing illness, the expenditure incurred on regaining health after you have fallen ill, is a lot more.
Why cant we lead life in such a way that we dont ever fall sick and no financial burden falls upon the family.
Cleanliness is one of the strongest protections from disease.
The greatest service that can be rendered to the poor is by maintaining cleanliness.
And the second thing that I constantly urge you to do is Yog.
Some people also call it Yoga.
21st June is the International Day for Yog.
People are not only attracted to Yog the world over, they have implicit faith in it and the whole world has embraced it.
This is a priceless gift handed over to us by our ancestors, which we have given to the world.
To the world which is filled with stress, Yog gives the power to lead a balanced life.
Prevention is better than cure. A person practicing Yog, can easily have the achievements of staying healthy, maintaining balance, being richly endowed with a strong will power, nurturing supreme self confidence and to have concentration in every task one does.
It should spread wide, it should find a place in every persons life. Each person should take 20-25-30 minutes out from his daily routine and spend it on practicing Yog.
And for this, the International Yog day on 21st June gives us the inspiration.
These collective occasions do become a reason for effecting positive change in an individuals life.
Have a look at it. Do get these followed in your village, in your mohallas, in your city, in your school, in your institution, even in offices.
Start it from now, one month in advance and you will be a participating partner on 21st June.
I have read it several times that there are offices where on a regular basis, when they first meet in the morning, they begin with Yog and Pranayam and the efficiency of the entire office increases. The whole culture of the office gets transformed and the environment also undergoes a positive change.
You too must connect yourself with it when the whole world will be doing Yog on that day.
I urge you all not to get left behind.
Your staying healthy is very important to make India healthy.
My dear country men, through Mann Ki Baat, I connect with you regularly.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you once again
Okay
Thank You.
Namaste
Mann Ki Baat, April 2016
Please change this situation. Ravi ji has expressed his anger but I think he is not venting his anger on me but on the prevailing conditions.
P.
J.
He used to continuously repeat that. Some days back a newspaper had written a letter to me saying that they had decided that on Mondays they would not give any negative news but only positive news. These days I have noticed that some T.
As usual, you and I eagerly keep waiting for Mann Ki Baat. This time too, numerous letters, comments phone calls have poured in full of stories, suggestions inspiration everybody wants to do something or the other also wanting to say it out.
It must be part of your recent memory that in the earlier episode, I had referred to a collection of short stories by Premchand ji, We had decided that on reading any book, some of its facets should be shared with all through the Narendra Modi App.
I have seen that people in large numbers have shared a lot of information on a variety of books.
It is heartwarming to see them discuss books published on subjects such as Science, Technology, innovation, history, culture, business, life-sketches and so on.
Some have advised me to dwell upon many other books.
But I must candidly admit here that I am not able to devote much time to reading books these days.
But I have gained a lot, in the sense that based on your correspondence here, I got opportunities to know about the themes of many kinds of books.
But the experience over the last one month makes me feel that we need to take it forward.
Why dont we create a permanent book corner on the Narendra Modi App, so that, whenever we read a book, we write about it and discuss it on this platform And you can even suggest an apt name for our book corner.
Friends, I touched upon the subject of water conservation in Mann Ki Baat and today I feel that it was an issue close to your heart even before I referred to it, a matter of universal human interest.
I have experienced the fact that this topic has stirred the nations heart strings collectively.
Many an informed, effective endeavour is afoot across the country.
People have shared information on traditional methods.
The media has embarked upon quite a few innovative campaigns.
Be it the Government or NGOs, something or the other is being carried out on a war footing.
Witnessing the might of the collective is in itself heartwarming satisfying.
The rural folk donated sweat, toiling collectively, to change the course of a mountain spring.
It was a purely indigenous, home grown method.
This has led to not only stopping soil erosion prevention of crop damage, but also facilitated effective irrigation of fields.
And you will be happy to know that the beautiful North Eastern State of Meghalaya has become the first state to have formulated its own water-policy.
I congratulate the Government of Meghalaya.
In Haryana, crops that require meagre water are being encouraged. Farmers thus are saved from suffering losses.
I specially congratulate the Haryana Government for establishing a connect with the farmers to wean them away from conventional modes of farming towards crops that do not require much water.
It is the season of festivals.
Many fairs are held on these occasions.
Why dont we use these fairs to spread the message of water conservation
All sections of society turn up in fairs in large numbers.
Here, we can effectively spread awareness on the need to save water through forums such as exhibitions and street plays, thus using the festive fervour to convey the message of water conservation with ease.
And that is why today, I feel like mentioning about a few children. They are Nidhi Baipotu, Monish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aronyatesh Ganguli Hrithik Alaamandaa.
What I tell you about them will fill your hearts with pride verve as well.
All of us know that just the word CANCER is more than enough to scare the world.
It conjures images of Death waiting at the doorstep. But each of these Ten children, not only fought against the dreaded disease cancer in their battle of life, but also brought glory laurels to the country.
In sports and games, we often get to see a player becoming a champion after winning a tournament or bagging a medal this was a rare occasion when the participants were champions BEFORE they entered the contest...
Actually, this month, the World Childrens Winners Games were held in Moscow.
It is a unique sports tournament meant for young cancer survivors only they who have emerged fighting cancer, can take part.
In this tournament, sports games such as shooting, chess, swimming, running, football table-tennis are organized.
All Ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament.
Out of these, some players even won more than one medal.
In fact, in the realms of Space, 2019 has been a very fruitful year for India.
Our scientists launched the A-Sat in March. After that, amidst the hectic engagements during Elections, an important development such as the A-Sat could not be a prominent part of the discourse.
Whereas the fact is, through the A-Sat, we have acquired the capability of destroying a satellite three hundred Kilometres away in a mere three minutes.
India became the fourth country in the world, possessing this capacity. And now, on the 22nd of July, the nation watched with pride Chandrayaan II taking strides into space from Sriharikota.
Visuals of Chandrayaan II lifting off filled our countrymens hearts with glory, zest and joy.
Chandrayaan II is a mission that is special on many counts.
It will lead to a better understanding of the Moon on our part.
We will be able to gather detailed information knowledge. But if you ask me what the two greatest lessons I have received from Chandrayaan II, I shall say they are Faith Fearlessness.
We should trust our talents capacities we should have faith in them.
You will be glad to know that Chandrayaan II is INDIAN to the core.
It is thoroughly Indian in heart spirit.
It is completely a swadeshi, home grown mission.
This mission has proved beyond doubt, once again, that when it comes to attempting an endeavour in new age, cutting edge areas, with innovative zeal, our scientists are second to none.
The way our scientists rectified Technical issues in record time, burning the midnight oil, is in itself an exemplary, unparalleled task.
The world watched the Tapasya, the awesome perseverance of our scientists.
We should also feel proud of the fact that despite hindrances, there is no change in the arrival time... many are amazed at that.
We have to face temporary setbacks in life... but always remember- the capacity to overcome them resides within us.
Through Mann Ki Baat today, I wish to share with students, my young friends, information on a very interesting competition ... I invite young boys girls to a quiz Competition.
I urge my young friends, students to participate in this competition and make it interesting and memorable through their participation.
I specially call upon schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers mentors to strive hard to ensure victory for their respective schools.
For these winners, it will be a historic event of their life. But for that, you will have to participate in the uiz competition, score the highest be a winner.
My dear countrymen, you must have observed one thing.
Our chain of Mann Ki Baat has lent pace to the cleanliness campaign from time to time. Similarly, efforts towards ensuring cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
A journey that began five years ago gathered momentum with mass participation is now setting up newer benchmarks in cleanliness sanitation.
It is not that we have reached the ideal yet, but the way we have achieved success in ODF clean public spaces, it displays the collective will strength of the resolve of a hundred thirty crore countrymen. But we are not stopping at that.
This movement has now advanced from cleanliness towards beautification.
Just a few days ago, I was watching the story of Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team on the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who left his job in America and returned to serve Mother India.
Recently, he has picked up the gauntlet to not just clean up Delhi, but to beautify it.
With his team, he began with the garbage bins of Lodi Garden.
Through the medium of street art, he has decorated many localities of Delhi with aesthetically appealing paintings.
From over bridges to school walls to hutments he gave a free hand to his talent, garnering huge public support on the way, on the lines of an effective campaign.
Remember how, during the Kumbh, Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings
Colours lines may be mute, but when they merge to form a picture, the rainbow that emanates speaks louder than a thousand words. We experience this in the beauty, the aesthetics of the Swachchata Abhiyan.
It is imperative that the culture of transforming waste to wealth develops in our society.
In a way, we have to move ahead on the path of converting garbage to gold.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very interesting comment on My gov.
This comment came from Brother Muhammad Aslam who stays in Shopian, Jammu Kashmir.
He wrote, I like listening to the programme Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy to let you know that I played a positive active role in organizing the community mobilisation programme- Back to Village in my state Jammu Kashmir.
This programme was organized in the month of June.
I feel such programmes should be organized every quarter.
Simultaneously, there should be a provision for online monitoring too.
According to me, this was a one of a kind programme where the public directly entered into a dialogue with the Government.
Brother Mohd Aslam ji had sent me a message upon reading which I felt curious to know more about the Back to village programme and when I got to knew it at length, I felt that the entire nation should get to know about this programme.
The people of Kashmir are eager to join the national main stream, their enthusiasm is reflected in the mechanism of this programme.
For the first time, senior officials reached the villages, directly, even those officials who had never visited a village were available to the villagers at their doorsteps, to judge for themselves to gauge the obstacles in the path of progress and to remove the hurdles.
officials briefing the villagers about the schemes and programmes implemented by the Government and also inquired whether these facilities were available to them or not.
How to impart more might to the Panchayats
How to increase their income
And how the facilities rendered by panchayats can affect the day to day life, were topics that were discussed and people too interacted in a participatory fashion telling about their problems.
Friends, this programme was not a mere Government formality that officials roam around the village and return to base, instead of this the officials spent two days and a night at the panchayat, enabling them to spend time in the village and meet almost every denizen of the village and to reach across to every establishment in the village.
To make this programme even more interesting many other means were employed.
Many sports competitions for kids were organized under the aegis of Khelo India.
Sports Kits, MNREGA job cards and SCST certificates were distributed.
. The people of Kashmir open heartedly became equal stakeholders in this festival.
The most heartening aspect of Back to village programme is the fact, that it was organized in such remote villages, where even officials had to traverse difficult terrain and climb mountains while walking on foot over a period of day or day and a half.
Some officers were so overwhelmed by the reception they received, that they decided to extend their stay upto two days in these villages.
The organizing of Gram Sabhas in these villages, wherein the people participated in large numbers and chalked out schemes for themselves is something that is an extremely pleasant experience.
A new resolve, a new fervor and grand results.
It is clear that those who wish to spread hatred en route to development, pose hurdles will never succeed in their sinister plans.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatraya Ramchandra Bendre, gyanpith laureate and poet has described the significance of the month of Sawan in this manner- in his poem.
In entire India, people of different cultures and languages, celebrate the onset of rainy season in their own fashion.
Whenever we look around us in this season it appears as if earth has draped itself in a sheet of greenery
There is generation of renewed energy all around us.
In this pious season many devotees perform the Kanwad Yatra and many proceed on the Amarnath pilgrimage, many observe fasts and eagerly wait for festivals like Janamasthmi and Nag Panchmi.
It is during this season that the festival of Raksha Bandhan symbolizing the bond between a brother and sister also falls.
While we are talking of the month of sawan, you will be glad to learn that the number of pilgrims in the Amarnath Yatra this year has been the greatest in the past 4 years.
A total of 3 lakh pilgrims have had the darshan of the holy Amarnath shrine from 1st July till now.
In 2015, the number of devotees who performed this pilgrimage over 60 days has been crossed over by the number of pilgrims in mere 28 days this year
I would especially like to thank the hospitality of the people of Jammu- Kashmir while referring to successful organization of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return after performing this pilgrimage become imbued with the feelings of warmth and kinship displayed by the people of the state.
These are portents of booming tourism in the future.
I have been told that within a span of a month- and- a half of the commencement of Chardham Yatra in Uttarakhand this year, more than 8 lakh devotees have had the darshan of Kedarnath Shrine.
This is a record number of pilgrims post the apocalyptic events of 2013.
I appeal to all of you to visit those tourist spots within our country whose scenic beauty is to behold during the monsoon.
There are no better ways to witness this nations beauty and peoples sentiments and no better teachers than tourism and pilgrimage.
I extend my felicitation to you all, that may this beauteous and lively month of Sawan fill all of us with new energy, new hopes and new expectations.
The month of August also brings the memories of uit India movement.
I wish that all of us celebrate 15th August with special preparations and find out new ways to observe this festival of freedom with greater participation of masses.
On the other hand, heavy rainfall in many parts of the country has resulted in countrymen suffering due to floods.
On television, we witness just one aspect of monsoon- floods everywhere, water logging and traffic jam
The other picture of monsoon- the overjoyed farmer, chirping birds, gurgling waterfalls and earth wrapped under a green cover, to witness this you will have to step out along with your family.
Rains bring freshness and happiness with them, my heartiest wish is that the monsoon keep on bringing happiness to you and you all enjoy best of health.
My Dear Fellow Citizens,Let me begin by wishing Namaskar to all of you.
Today, the world over, Christians are observing Easter.
I extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of Easter.
Some of them must have gotten over with their examinations by now. For those of you who still have examinations, it must be a testing time with exams on one hand and T-20 Cricket World Cup on the other.
Some days ago India won two fine matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
We are seeing a fine momentum building up in this T-20 Cricket World Cup.
Today, as India and Australia get ready to play, I convey my best wishes to both the teams.
With the young comprising 65 of our population, there should be no reason why we should be absent from the world of sports.
We need to usher revolutionary changes in sports.
Twenty-four teams from all over the world are coming to play in our country.
The Indian Football team won the gold medal at the Asian Games in 1951 and 1962, and came fourth in the 1956 Olympics.
Unfortunately, over the decades we have slipped from there to the lowest rungs.
Can you send me your suggestions on how best to use that opportunity
I view the FIFA event as a great opportunity to establish India as a brand at a global level.
I consider this to be an opportunity to let the world know of Indias youth power not in the sense of winning or losing a match.
In the run-up to and preparation for the 2017 FIFA event, we can harness and display our many strengths while doing so, we can do image-branding for India as well.
I look forward to your suggestions on the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup which you can send me through NarendraModiApp.
My dear students, you must have thought of travelling to places during your holidays.
Some people also go outside their states.
Last time too, I had requested all of you to upload photographs of the places you visit.
We get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit we learn about people, their languages, foods and lifestyles.
India is full of diversities.
Once you set out to see the country, for the rest of your life you will keep seeing new things and still never get enough of it.
I have been fortunate that I had a lot of opportunities to travel.
When I was neither Chief Minister nor Prime Minster, and I was young like you, I travelled a lot.
I see this as a good sign.
This in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new.
I hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too.
Maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way, but it is being done.
Can you too, being a tourist, lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations
I am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task.
India lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world.
But if we, 125 crore Indians, decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector, we can attract the world.
We can draw a very large number of tourists to our side. Through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in India.
Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens we all have to come together to make this happen.
Come, lets make an endeavour in this direction.
My dear young friends, I dont like it when holidays are just frittered away.
You too should think along these lines.
Will you let your holidays during the most important years of your life slip away just like that
I will give you something to ponder upon.
Can you resolve to add one skill, one special attribute to your personality, during your holidays
If you dont know how to swim, can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays If you dont know how to cycle, can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays
Or you could tell yourself, I type with just two fingers on the keyboard, so shouldnt I learn proper way of typing
There are so many skills to develop our personality.
Why not learn them
Why not overcome some of our shortcomings
Why not add to our strengths
Do give it a thought. It is not like you need lots of classes, a great trainer, hefty fees or a big budget for this.
You can find something around you. Lets say you decide to make the best out of waste.
Just look for some waste material and start creating something from it.
Namaste dear Prime Minister, you had said during the last summer holidays that even birds feel the summer heat so we should fill a bowl with water and place it in the balcony or the terrace so that the birds can come to have water.
I did this and enjoyed it and in this way I made friends with a lot of birds.
I request you to repeat this task in Mann Ki Baat.
And I did not have it in my mind that I would say something on this topic, but Abhi has reminded me that last year I had asked you to put an earthen bowl filled with water for the birds.
Friends, I want to thank this boy Abhi Chaturvedi.
He has reminded me of a good deed by calling me.
Abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends.
The great Hindi poetess Mahadevi Verma used to love birds.
She wrote this in one of her poems, We shall not let you fly far way, we shall fill the courtyard with grains and fill the tank with sweet and cool water...
Come, let us also do what Mahadevi Ji used to do.
I greet Abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing.
Shilpa Kukke from Mysore has raised a very humane issue.
She says milkmen, newspaper vendors, postmen come close to our homes.
Sometimes utensil hawkers and cloth sellers too pass by our homes.
Have we ever offered them some drinking water during the summer days
Have we ever given them water to drink
Shilpa, I am very grateful to you that you have articulated something so sensitive in so simple a manner.
It is a small gesture but when the postman comes and we offer him water, he will feel good.
Of course, it is a part of our nature in India.
But I am glad, Shilpa, that you have observed these things.
There are many topics on this App, such as what is the state of the market, what is the position of the wholesale market, which crops are doing well these days, which are the appropriate pesticides.
Not just this. There is a button on the App which will connect you directly with agricultural scientists and link you with the experts.
If you pose a question to them, they will reply to it they will explain things to you.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
Why dont you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you
If you feel it lacks in anything then you can complain to me also.
We will have to give a thought to what will happen if theres no water.
Can we utilise this time to visit ponds, check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing, because of which reservoirs get depleted.
Can we not remove the blockage and clean the inlets so that more water gets collected
If we manage to save and collect more water during the first rainfall and fill up our ponds, rivers and streams, then even if the rains fail later, our losses will be reduced.
You must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs.
Under MNREGA also a stress has been given to create assets for water conservation.
There must be many such villages in the country, many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work.
But we still need to do much more in this direction.
I welcome this.
Excessive use of fertilisers has made our Mother Earth unwell. We are the children of our soil, so how can we watch our Mother Earth suffering
The same thing happens with fertilisers as well. No matter how good fertilisers may be, if we use them beyond a limit they will become the cause of ruination.
Do remember, the more we save water, the more the farmers will benefit and more lives will be saved.
My dear fellow citizens, the World Health Day is on 7th April. This year the theme of the World Health Day is Beat Diabetes.
I call upon all of you to defeat Diabetes which plays host to so many diseases.
Once it enters yours body, a whole lot of undesirable guests in the form of illnesses follow it.
It is said that in 2014 India had about six and a half crore Diabetics.
Diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths.
Diabetes is of two types Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is hereditary
Type 2 is due to your habits, age and obesity.
The world is worried about Diabetes and so it has been chosen as the theme for World Health Day on 7th April.
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for Diabetes.
Physical labour is getting reduced.
There is not a trace of sweat there is just no walking around.
Can we not, drawing inspiration from this years World Health Day and its theme, do something to defeat Diabetes in our personal life
If every citizen of my country is healthy, then my country will be healthy.
Sometimes we are reluctant to get our medical check-up done.
When the condition worsens then only does it come to our notice that it is Diabetes to blame.
On March 24th, the world observed Tuberculosis Day.
When I was a child we would be scared by the very mention of the word TB.
Compared to the world, we still have a large number of TB patients.
This shows TB is one illness that can be detected fast.
My dear fellow citizens, there is a lot of work being done in this direction.
And all these services are free. Please go and get a check-up done.
This disease can be got rid of.
All one needs is the correct treatment and the treatment must continue till the illness is gone completely.
I would like to appeal to you all, whether it is TB or Diabetes, we have to conquer these.
We have to eradicate these diseases from India.
But this cannot happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you dont do something about it.
So I call upon all of you today to defeat Diabetes and free ourselves from Tuberculosis.
My dear fellow citizens, a number of important occasions are coming up in April, especially on 14th of April which happens to be the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country.
We are making a constant effort to develop these five pilgrimage spots.
I am fortunate to get the chance to visit Mhow, the birthplace of our revered Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on 14th April this year.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot to help shape us into ideal citizens.
We can pay our best homage to him by following the path set by him and becoming good citizens.
In a few days from now, the new year of Vikram Samvat will begin.
It is celebrated in different states in different forms.
My greetings to everybody on this auspicious occasion of New Year.
You can choose your own convenient time to listen to it.
You can listen to it on your own mobile handset.
My dear fellow citizens, my heartiest best wishes to you all.
Young Indians take time out to get the latest information on these matches and watch them on television.
Perhaps there isnt a district in India which I have not visited.
Unlike before, they dont want to go to the same old places or tread the oft beaten track. They want to do something new, see something new.
There are many employment opportunities created by tourism.
This will help you in carving out your own identity and raising your self-confidence tremendously.
This will perhaps become a big thing among friends.
in: Sound Byte- My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
If you download this Kisan Suvidha App on your mobile phone, you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, summer is holiday time for the rest of the people, but for you it is the time to sweat it out even more.
A farmer waits for the rains. Before that, he puts in his life and soul to get his field ready so that not even a single drop of rain water goes waste.
For farmers, the season just before onset of farming is of utmost importance.
The same food would taste so bad, isnt it
Please do be concerned about this.
Paradoxically, when TB was linked to death we used to be duly afraid of it but now that it is curable, we have become almost careless about it.
My dear fellow citizens, Namaskar.
While listening to this months Mann Ki Baat, my inner thoughts, your mind must also be on your childrens exams which begin soon. Some of them have their 10th and 12th board exams starting from the 1st of March.
That must be playing on your mind.
I wish to be a part of this journey along with you.
I am concerned about your childrens exams as much as you are, but I am not worried.
If we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension-free.
When I shared my inner thoughts with you during last months Mann ki Baat, I had requested everybody to send their experiences and suggestions to me on Narendra Modi App.
It makes me immensely happy that teachers and students who have had successful careers, as also parents and social thinkers, have shared their experiences and suggestions with me.
and, second, the sheer volume of the response to my request shows dealing with exams is an extremely important matter.
Usually the issue of exams has largely remained confined to schools, teachers, students and their families.
But the way suggestions have come pouring in through my App, it seems this should be a subject of constant discussion for the entire nation.
Today, during my Mann ki Baat, I would like to share my inner thoughts on exams with parents, students and teachers.
I will share some of the things that I have heard, what I have read, and what I have been told.
I will add my views on some exam-related issues about which I feel strongly.
I am confident that students who will be appearing for exams will find what I have to say immensely useful to them.
He is someone the young generation is proud of and inspired by Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar. He has sent a message that I will read out to you:Namaskar, I am Sachin Tendulkar speaking.
I know that the 10th Board Exams are going to commence in a few days from now.
Many of you are going to be tense about them.
I have only one message for you all. Your parents, your teachers, your family members and your friends have a lot of expectations from you.
Wherever you go, you will be asked How are the preparations going How many marks are you likely to score
I would like to say that you should set a target for yourself. Dont come under the pressure of someone elses expectations.
You should definitely work hard but set a realistic and achievable target for yourself, and then try to achieve that target.
So it was necessary for me to find a solution to this.
And those were the targets that I would always try to achieve for myself.
My focus would be on the ball, and slowly-slowly targets were achieved on their own.
I would like to tell all of you that you must have a positive thinking.
Positive results will follow.
So you must be positive and God will surely give you good results. I am hopeful of that.
Friends, you heard what Tendulkar-ji had to say.
Dont buckle under the pressure of expectations.
It is you who have to shape your own future.
So set your own targets for yourselves. Keep an open mind, think freely, and assess your own abilities.
Why not healthy competition
Why do we waste our time competing with others
Why dont we compete with ourselves
Why dont we decide to break our own previous record
If you were to do that, none would be able to stop you from moving ahead. When you break your own record, you will not have to depend on others for happiness and satisfaction.
There will be a sense of inner satisfaction.
Friends, dont look at exams as a game of numbers.
How much did I score, where did I score
dont get trapped in this score-keeping.
You should think of a greater purpose in life.
You should have a dream to realise and a goal that you are committed to.
Exams are there to only gauge whether we are going the right way or not, whether we are moving at the right speed or not.
So, if our dreams are big and magnificent, exams will become a joyful experience.
Each exam will then become just one more step towards realizing that dream
each success will turn into a key of realizing that goal.
Once you do that, even if you achieve less than what you had expected, you will not be disappointed.
Rather, it will give you the strength and confidence to try harder and better the next time.
Thousands of people have used their mobile phones to post small messages on my app.
Shrey Gupta has stressed the point that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body only.
Students should care for their health along with their studies so that they are able to write their exams well, in good health and spirit.
On the last day before exams begin, I would not really urge you to start doing push-ups, get down on the field, or go for a 3 to 5 km walk.
But one thing is for sure, especially during the days when examinations are held.
In any case, our daily schedule for all the 365 days in a year should be in line with achieving our dreams and goals.
I agree with the message posted by Shri Prabhakar Reddy he has specially urged that one should go to sleep at a proper time and get up early in the morning to revise ones preparation.
One should arrive at the examination centre equipped with the admit-card and other things well before time.
This is what Prabhakar Reddy has said, something which I would have perhaps dared not to say because I am not very particular when it comes to sleeping. My friends complain to me often that I sleep very little.
This is my shortcoming which I will try to overcome.
I do agree that a fixed time to go to sleep and a sound sleep are as important as other activities during the day. This is possible.
There are some who are in the habit of chatting over the phone for long hours before going to sleep.
When I talk of sleep, please dont think I am asking you to sleep at the cost of your preparation for the exams.
At the time of exams, you should get a good sleep so that you are free from stress and tension.
I am not saying that you should keep on sleeping.
It should not be that you score low marks and when your mother asks you why you have fared so badly, you reply that its because Modiji had asked us to sleep, so I dozed off.
I hope you will not do that.
I am sure you wont do anything like that.
You must have experienced that when one part of your body feels a little bit of pain, the entire body doesnt feel well.
Not just that, our entire routine collapses.
So we should not view anything as trivial or unimportant.
Please see to it that you dont compromise on the time you have set for things. Dont get into this mess.
Do things the way you have planned them.
You must have noticed this too.
Those who are tense and worry about what kind of questions will be asked, end up having a negative impact on their results as well.
Hello, this is Viswanathan Anand.
You must have seen his eyes dont wander off the chess board.
We have all heard of how Arjun focussed his attention on the eye of the bird.
In the same way, when we watch Vishwanathan playing chess we see his eyes set on the target, focussed on the game very attentively, and that is a reflection of his inner tranquillity.
It is difficult to bring that inner peace within you just by someone merely asking you to do so, but one should try.
If you dont speak to your friends, walk alone, and your face droops flipping through the pages of so many books at the last moment, then you cannot have peace of mind.
Just imagine yourself standing at the edge of a pond and you can see beautiful things at its bottom.
Suddenly someone throws a stone into the water and there are ripples on the surface.
If the water is still, then no matter how deep it is, everything at the bottom can be seen.
But if the water is agitated, we can see nothing through it.
There is a lot within you, the treasure as a result of the hard work of a whole year is filled inside you, but if your mind is troubled, you will not be able to discover that wealth.
If you have a peaceful mind, then that treasure of yours is going to surface to the top and your exam will turn so very simple for you.
There are occasions when if I have to strain myself to concentrate, I feel an inner stress building up.
Then I realize that if I relax a bit, I will feel better.
So here is a technique I have developed for myself.
I do deep-breathing.
I breathe deeply three to five times.
Not more than 50 seconds are spent on this but my mind is at rest and ready to be focused on matters at hand.
This is my experience and it might be of help to you as well.
Rajat Agarwal has told us something good.
And if we have educated parents, on top of it parents who are teachers themselves, then they almost end up making us re-write the entire paper.
I made a mistake there...
Oh dear, I knew the answer to that question but I couldnt remember it then...
We just get caught in all that.
Please chat about otherthings with your family, talk of other topics, refresh your mind with some light banter.
If you have gone on holidays with your parents, then try and remember what you saw.
Just come out of that exam mindset and spend half an hour with your parents.
What Rajat ji has said is worth pondering over.
From giving interpretations of the Ram Charit Manas in the present day context, he is now involved with trying to spread its values in the country and to the whole world.
I am also grateful to our revered Murari Bapu for such a nice message.
Friends I want to tell you about another thing today.
I see that in the experiences that people have shared with me, they have spoken a lot about Yoga.
And this is a matter of joy to me. Everybody I meet, no matter for how short a time, has something to say about Yoga.
Friends, if I ask you to start doing Yoga from tomorrow morning then that would be unfair.
But those who are already practising Yoga should not stop it during exam time.
If you do Yoga, keep doing it.
One thing is for sure, whether it is your student days or any other phase of your life, Yoga is a major key to the development of your inner mind.
It is one of the simplest keys
you must pay more attention to it.
Yes, if you have someone nearby who knows Yoga, and if you ask them during your exams, and even if you have never done Yoga before, they will surely be able to tell you a few things to do in Yoga that can very easily be done in a few minutes.
See if you can do it.
I have a lot of faith in Yoga.
My dear young friends, you are in a great hurry to enter the examination hall, you are in a rush to quickly be seated in your place.
But why should you do these things in a hurry.
Why cant you manage your time in such a way that even if you are held up in traffic, you can still reach in time for your exam.
Otherwise such hurdles can cause new stress.
One more thing: With the limited time that we have, we feel that going through the question paper with all the instructions is going to consume a lot of our time.
It is not like that dear friends.
You must read those instructions very carefully, at most five minutes will be spent in that, but it will not cause any loss.
Yash Nagar writes on my mobile App that when he read a question paper for the first time he found it quite difficult, but when he read the same paper with self-confidence telling himself, this is the only paper I have got and no other questions are going to be given, I have to deal with just these many questions, and so when I started thinking over them again, he writes, I was able to understand this paper quite easily...
It is very important to understand the questions.
When we dont understand the questions, thats when we sometimes find them difficult.
You must read the questions twice, thrice, four times over and try to match them with the things that you know and you will find that answering them becomes simple even before you have actually answered them.
It gives me great joy to share with you a message from Bharat Ratna C N R Rao, our most esteemed scientist. He has emphasized the virtue of patience.
He has given a brief but very beautiful message to all students.
What I take half an hour to say, he says in a few minutes.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses.
I am grateful to Shri Raofor inspiring the children of the country.
The things that he mentioned about dedication, determination, diligence... just keep at it my friends.
If you keep going, then even fear will be afraid.
And a golden future awaits you for doing well.
Ruchika Dabas has sent a message on my App and shared her experience.
She writes that in her family during exams there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere. This is true for the neighbouring families as well.
All contributed to a positive environment.
This is the way it should be. Sachin ji also talked of a positive approach, a positive frame of mind.
No matter at which point of life you are at, fine examples and true stories give great inspiration, great strength, and pave a new path in times of trouble.
We have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb, Thomas Alva Edison.
But today that electric bulb illuminates our lives.
This is what is called the seeds of success inherent in failures.
K. Rowling is a fine example to show that success can come in anyones life at any time.
The Harry Potter series is now popular worldwide.
But it was not like that from the start.
She had to face many difficulties, many problems.
Rowling has herself said that in times of trouble she would channelize all her energies into tasks that had real significance for her.
Exams are not just for the students, they also put the students families, schools and teachers to test.
Without the support system of parents and teachers, the students would not stand a good chance.
If teachers, parents and even senior students all combine to form a team, a unit with a common thinking, and in a planned way move forward, then exams become a lot easier.
Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on my App, complaining that parents should never put pressure on their children to score more marks.
They should only motivate them to prepare well for their exams.
They should think about the need for their child to stay relaxed.
Vijay Jindal writes that parents should not burden their children with their own expectations.
And this is so right.
Today, I dont want to say much to the parents.
Please dont create any pressure for your children.
If they are talking to any friend of theirs, please dont stop them.
Build a light-hearted environment for them, a positive environment, and see for yourself, be it your son or daughter, what confidence they are infused with.
we all want to link ourselves to science and technology.
We also want to move ahead with the speed of science.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
all these things should be a part of our journey to development. This year the theme for National Science Day is Make in India Science and Technology-driven Innovations.
Friends, sometimes success comes very late and when it does come to us, our way of looking at life changes completely.
As you have been kept very busy with the coming exams, it might be possible that many news stories may not have registered on your minds.
But I want to repeat this for all fellow citizens as well.
You must have heard recently there has been a major and important discovery in the world of science.
Scientists have labored hard, generations of them have persevered, and after nearly 100 years they have gained a huge success.
Gravitational Wave has been brought to light with the efforts of our scientists.
This is a success for science which was very difficult to achieve.
This discovery not only proves the theory of our greatest scientist of the previous century, Albert Einstein, but is also considered a great discovery for the world of physics.
It is going to be of use for the whole of humankind. But being Indians, we should all feel happy that in the entire process of this discovery, the sons of our country, our worthy Indian scientists, were also a part of it.
I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to all those scientists.
Our scientists will be involved in the future as well to take this discovery forward
This kind of a facility exists only in two places in the world. India is going to be the third.
This process is going to gain fresh momentum and strength with India joining hands with others.
India, with its reputed resources, will surely be an active participant in this superior science discovery which is for the welfare of humankind.
I once again congratulate all scientists and send them my best wishes.
My dear fellow citizens, I would like you to note down one number. From tomorrow, you can give a missed call on this number and listen to Mann ki Baat. You can even listen to it in your mother tongue.
I have to take an exam tomorrow.
125 crore people of this country are going to take my exam.
But, you must have noticed and felt it while you heard me speak how fit and brimming with confidence I am.
My exam gets over tomorrow and yours begin the dayafter.
Let us hope we all are successful, then the country will surely succeed.
So friends lots of good wishes to you all.
Free from all tension of success and failure, move ahead with a free mind.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2015
I keep a watchful eye on my portal My Gov. Mr.
This is not true at all, we need to modify it according to the needs of India. For example, when a poor person works somewhere as a labourer and there is a lot of physical effort involved but if a young man innovates something which can reduce the physical effort and help the labourer- I will call it as a Start-up. I will ask the bank to help such an individual and I will tell him to move ahead with courage.
So I thought why not use the term Divyang instead of viklang in our country. They are those people who have one or more such organs which have divinity, where divine power flows which we normal bodied people do not have. I like this term.
On 26th January we celebrate Republic Day. Can we citizens and school and college students take up the initiative of cleaning the statue of any great men installed in our city, of cleaning the premises, we can do best of cleanliness and best of decoration on the occasion of 26th January. And I am not saying this on government lines.
My dear countrymen, Namaste
I believe you must have had a great time during your Diwali vacations amidst all festivities.
You must have had the opportunity to visit some other places.
The new trades and jobs would have commenced with renewed vigour.
On the other hand Christmas preparations must have started too.
Festivals have their own significance in social life.
Sometimes festivities help to heal wounds and sometimes they are source of renewed energy.
But sometimes when a calamity strikes during festivities then it is very painful and it feels even more.
There is continuous news of natural calamities from various parts of the world.
And sometimes the news is very bizarre, never seen or never heard of.
We are now realizing the effects of climate change very rapidly.
In our country itself, we have experienced torrential rains, that too without season and for a very long duration. Tamil Nadu has suffered heavy losses and other states suffered too.
Many people lost their lives.
My heart goes out to all those people in this hour of crisis.
The state governments have braced themselves up for rescue and relief work.
The Central government too has joined them in their efforts.
Right now, a team of the Central government officials are in Tamil Nadu.
But I have full faith in Tamil Nadus potential and know that post this crisis it will rise again and speedily move forward and will continue to deliver in its role of taking the country forward.
Now when there are talks of such crisis all around, we feel the need to bring in a lot of change.
About 15 years back natural calamity was a part of the Agricultural Ministrys realm because most of the calamities were limited to famine.
But today, its form and format has changed.
After the Nepal earthquake I talked to Pakistans Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
This is a good beginning.
Today, I received a phone call from Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar, Punjab.
I am Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar, Punjab.
We do organic farming in our fields and also guide a lot of others regarding it.
I have a question how to guide people that burning of farm remains or straw not only destroys the micro organisms of the soil but also contributes to the pollution in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana.
Lakhwinder Singh ji, I am happy to hear your message.
I am happy that, you are a farmer engaged in organic farming.
And not just that, you also understand the problems of the farmers really well.
Your concerns are right but this just does not happen in Punjab and Haryana alone.
It is a practice in the entire country and traditionally we follow this method of burning off the remains of the crops or the straw.
Secondly, people are not aware of the available solutions.
And now we are hearing more about it because it is affecting the city life too.
But the concern you have expressed is genuine.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are themselves very valuable.
They are organic fertilizer themselves.
Secondly because of burning this the top soil gets burnt.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, just think that if we have strong bones, strong heart, strong kidney, an overall good system but our upper skin gets burnt then what will happen
So burning the stump of crops not only burns them, it burns the skin of our motherland.
The top soil of our land is burnt which pushes our fertile soil to death.
Hence, some positive efforts need to be made.
If these remains are once again buried inside the soil, then it will turn into fertilizers.
If they are put in a pit and left with earth worms and little water, good quality organic fertilizer can be made.
Once I had the opportunity of talking to farmers involved in Banana cultivation.
And they shared a very good experience.
Earlier as they cultivated banana, when the crop was over, the stumps of the tree would remain. To clear the stumps from the fields they had to spend 5,000, 10,000 or 15,000 rupees per hectare.
And till the time the people who would clear these stumps would not come with tractors, the stumps would remain standing for long.
But some farmers chopped those stumps into 6-6, 8-8 inch pieces and buried them inside the soil.
They experienced that the banana stumps held so much water in them that no external water supply was needed for three months. Any plant or any crop sown over those stumps could flourish without water.
Earlier they had to spend money on clearing those stumps, now those very stumps are a source of revenue.
A small experiment can turn lucrative, our farmers are no less than scientists.
Dear countrymen, the entire world will remember 3rd December as International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Last time in Mann ki Baat I talked about organ donation.
I talked about the NOTO helpline for Organ donation. I have been told that after that session the number of phone calls increased 7 times and the number of hits on the website increased 2.
Many famous personalities including actress Raveena Tandon became a part of it.
Organ Donation can save many valuable lives.
Organ donation can bring about immortality.
When an organ moves from one body to another it gets a new life but the person receiving it gets a new lease of life.
There can be no greater donation than this.
It is my faith that awareness in this field will increase and the needful will receive the best of help in true sense. This help cannot be obtained till someone donates their organs.
Like I said earlier, 3rd December is being celebrated as International Day of People with Disability.
People with physical and mental disabilities are capable of unparalleled courage and capability.
Sometimes it hurts when they are laughed at.
Sometimes someone expresses pity and sympathy.
But if we change our outlook and our perspective towards them, then these people can inspire us to live.
They can inspire us to do a lot.
We start crying even when small misfortune befalls us.
Then we realize, our problem is so small but how does he survive
And hence all of them are a source of inspiration to us.
Their will power, their struggle with life and their zeal to transform crisis into opportunity is worth lot of praise.
Today, I want to talk about Javed Ahmed.
He is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, the terrorists had shot Jawed Ahmed in Kashmir.
But the bullet damaged his kidney and a part of the intestine was lost.
He suffered serious spinal injury.
He lost the ability to stand on his own feet, but Jawed Ahmed did not concede defeat.
The grave injury caused by terrorism could not deter him.
His zeal is commendable, but above all is the fact that an innocent man had to face such a predicament, his youth is in danger yet he harbors no grudge and no anger.
He turned this crisis into compassion and dedicated his life to social work.
The body does not support him but for the past 20 years he has devoted himself to child education.
How to improve the infrastructure for the physically challenged
How to develop systems for the disabled in government offices and public spaces
He is working on those issues.
Is his life not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember the life of Jawed Ahmed, his dedication and devotion especially on every 3rd December.
I am mentioning just the case of Jawed because of lack of time but such lights of inspiration are prevalent in every corner of the country.
They are giving a new lease of life and illuminating the path for others.
3rd December is a day to remember all such people and get inspired by them.
Our country is very large.
There are many things for which we are dependent on the government.
Be it someone from middle class, lower middle class, dalit, exploited, victim or deprived, they have to continuously be in touch with the government or its various organizations.
And as a citizen we surely have a bad experience with a government official in our lifetime.
And that one experience shapes our perception of the government system for a lifetime.
There is some truth to it. But at the same time within this governmental system there are lakhs of people who by their sense of duty, their dedication do some amazing work which does not get recognized.
Sometimes it happens so naturally, it is so organic that one does not realize some government employee has done it.
In our country there is a network of ASHA workers.
We have never discussed them in our country and I too have neither heard about them nor would you have.
The success of the works of the entrepreneur couple Bill and Melinda Gates through their foundation has become an inspiration.
Last year we honoured them with a joint Padma Vibhushan.
They do a lot of social work in India.
They are spending their entire retirement time and whatever they have earned on working for the poor.
They are so full of praise for the ASHA workers they work with.
They talk about their dedication and hard work and their zeal to learn about new things.
In the past, the Orissa government especially facilitated an ASHA worker on Independence Day.
She hails from a small village Tenda Gaon in Balasore district where most of the population is scheduled tribe.
There the people are poor and the area is malaria infested.
The ASHA worker Jamuna Manisingh decided that she will not let anyone die of malaria.
She would go to each household and would be the first one to reach if there was news of fever in any household.
She would put to use the primary training she received and give treatment accordingly.
She would reach out to every household to use mosquito repellent and mosquito nets.
The way we care for our kids and their sound sleep, Jamuna Manisingh would work with the same dedication for the entire village.
She fought with Malaria and prepared the entire village to fight against it.
There might be so many Jamuna Mani.
There might be lakhs and lakhs of people around us.
Let us show respect to such individuals.
Such individuals lend power to our nation.
They are partners to the joys and sorrows of others.
I applaud all such ASHA workers through the story of Jamuna Mani.
I request you to see it.
Just dont see it, show it to others too. Read it and may be you may find something to connect with it.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
Share these e-books, discuss these books and some enthusiastic young man can narrate these to the students of VIII, I or standard in the nearby schools.
So you can become a social teacher in the truest sense.
I invite you to come and become a part of nation building.
My dear countryman, the entire world is worried about climate change.
Climate change, global warming is being discussed at every nook and corner and now it has become an accepted standard for embarking on any new task.
The earths temperature should not rise anymore.
This is everyones concern and responsibility too.
I had once mentioned to switch off the street lights on a full moon night and enjoy the moonlight for an hour.
One should enjoy the moonlight.
Some friend of mine had sent me a link and I had the opportunity to see it. I really wanted to share it with you.
There is a woman Noor Jahan in Kanpur. Watching her on television it seemed that she did not have much of a chance to get education.
But she is doing something which no one would have thought of.
She is utilizing the Solar Energy of the Sun to illuminate the houses of the poor.
She is fighting darkness and bringing light to her own name.
She has formed a Samiti (committee) of women who manufacture lanterns that run on Solar Energy. They rent the lantern for Rs.
3-4 per day the entire house is illuminated. Noor Jehan works the entire day to recharge the lanterns in the solar energy plant.
See what the big people of the world do for climate change. Maybe Noor Jehan can act as an inspiration to many for the kind of work she is doing.
And actually, Noor Jehan means the light of the world.
She is spreading light through her work.
I congratulate Noor Jehan and ee TV that they presented this effort which was going on in a remote corner of Kanpur to the country and the world.
Many congratulations to you.
Thank you, Abhishek ji.
You sent me a message from Gorakhpur.
The Prime Minister MUDRA fund is about funding the unfunded.
Those who do not get funds may get funds.
This initiative is yet to achieve the speed that I have aimed for.
But the start has been good. Till now 66 lakh people have received 42,000 crore rupees through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
It can be a washer man, a barber, a newspaper vendor, milkman, just about anybody engaged in small enterprise.
I am happy that out of the 66 lakh recipients 24 lakh were women.
And most of the beneficiaries are from the SC, ST, OBC category who want to work hard and run their families independently.
Abhishek has himself narrated his excitement.
I too keep receiving various news.
Someone just told me that there is one Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He received a loan of 8. 5 lakhs from MUDRA scheme.
He started the sewage dress and cleanliness business.
I had told about my cleanliness campaign that it will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhonsle proved it.
He has purchased a tanker and I have been told that he has already returned 2 lakh rupees in such a short span of time.
This is our intention behind the MUDRA scheme.
I have been told about Mamta Sharma from Bhopal. She received Rs 40,000 from the MUDRA Yojana.
She is into the business of making purses.
But earlier she would borrow money at high rates and barely manage her business.
Now that she has a large sum of money in her hand, her work is going on smoothly.
Earlier the money that was lost in paying high interest and for other reasons could now be saved. She was able to save around 1000 rupees every month.
The familys new enterprise started developing.
But I want that this scheme is promoted more.
Our banks should become more sensitized and should help more and more people.
Actually, it is this people who run the economy.
The people engaged in small enterprises give strength to the nations economy.
We want to strengthen these people.
Whatever has happened is good, but more good needs to be done.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October on the Anniversary of Sardar Patel I had discussed about Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (One India, Best India).
Conducting such events creates continuous awareness in social life.
Rashtram Jagryam Vyayam: means internal vigilance is the prize of liberty.
I want to give Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (One India, Best India) the form of a specific scheme.
Mygov had invited suggestions about it.
What should the structure of the programme be like
What should be the logo
How to increase public participation
What should be its structure
I have been told that many suggestions have been received.
But I am expecting more suggestions.
Many big prizes have been announced.
You also utilize your creative mind.
How can we make this mantra of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat (One India, Best India) that connects each and every Indian
What should be the programme and what should be the plan.
It should be grand and full of life. It should be simple and effective to be able to connect everyone.
What should the government do
What should be done by the Civil Society
There can be many ideas.
But it is also the season to enjoy eating and enjoy dressing.
But I would request you to do exercises. I request you to utilize this good season for some kind of physical activity and exercise.
Create this type of mood in the family, make it a celebration, all should get together for an hour to do these exercises.
So make a good habit in this good season.
Once again I have the opportunity of connecting with you through Mann ki Baat.
Today the fifth one day cricket match is being played between India and South Africa in Mumbai.
This series has been named as the Gandhi-Mandela series.
So the last game is significantly important.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today I would like to congratulate the friends at the Kannur centre of Akashwani.
I started the Mann ki Baat and people started connecting with it.
One of them was Shraddha Thamban from Kerala a grade 12 student.
I would like to talk about Kerala again.
The girl students from Saint Mary Upper primary School from Chittoor in Kerala have sent me a letter.
This letter is special in many ways.
Firstly, these girls have created an image of Mother India by thumb prints on a huge piece of cloth.
They have sent me the image of mother India.
Initially I was surprised to see why they created a map of India using thumb prints.
But when I read their letter, I realized how beautifully a symbolic message was given.
It is not as if these girls have tried to just awaken the Prime Minister alone.
They are trying to create awareness among the people in their region and their mission is organ donation.
They are organizing a public awareness campaign for organ donation.
They have organized plays for creating an understanding about organ donation.
Organ donation should become a habit as well as an instinct.
They have asked me in their letter to appeal to people about Organ Donation in Mann ki Baat.
He says that organ donation should be a celebrated as a festival.
These days I get a lot of messages on phone calls also.
Devesh from Delhi gas also sent me a similar message.
Each year about one lakh eyes are in need of a vision.
We should also know that if someone is killed in a road accident, then also the organs can be donated.
There are some legal hassles involved.
And efforts have been made to guide the states in this direction.
By reducing the paper work, some of the states have made a good effort in speeding up the process involved in organ donation.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu today ranks first in the field of organ donation.
Many social organizations and NGOs are doing commendable job in this direction.
National Organ and Tissue transplant Organization (NOTO) has been established to encourage organ transplant.
A 24x7 helpline facility is also available. Its number is 1800 114 770.
The joy of sacrifice is beautifully described in this mantra Tain Tyakten Bhunjhita.
In the past few days we saw on television that the wife of a poor hawker in Delhi received a transplant in Delhis G. B.
This liver was brought from Lucknow by making special arrangements.
The transplant was successful.
A life was saved.
Organ donation is the biggest donation.
Let us all realize the mantra of Tain Tyakten Bhunjhita .
Dear countrymen, we recently celebrated the festival of Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after some days we will celebrate Diwali too.
We celebrated Eid and Ganesh Chaturthi too.
For the first time a program of this scale is being organized on the Indian soil.
Leaders of 54 African countries and unions have been invited.
This is the biggest conference of African countries outside Africa.
India-Africa ties are deep.
The African nations have a population equal to that of India.
If both are combined together they make for a third of the world population.
And it is said that lakhs of years ago it was all one landmass.
Later from the Indian Ocean two parts got separated.
There are a lot of similarities amongst us.
And almost 27 lakh Indians have settled in these nations from a long time.
India shares a lot of economic, cultural and political ties with the African Nations. But India plays the largest role in training the youth of the African countries.
More than 25,000 African youths have studied human resource development and capacity building in India.
And many leaders from Africa have studied in India.
So you can understand the depth of our relationship.
And from that perspective this summit is very important.
Generally when there is a summit, leaders of various countries meet.
Similarly, in this summit the leaders will be meeting.
We are making efforts that the people should also meet.
And this time, the Government of India, especially the HRD ministry has done something really commendable.
An essay competition was organized among all the CBSE affiliated schools. A poetry competition was organized to increase their participation.
Almost 1600 schools participated in the event.
It included schools within and outside India.
And thousands of children wrote on topics about strengthening the Indo Africa ties.
On the other hand, a mobile exhibition called Memories of Mahatma starting from his birth place Porbander and travelling through North is about to reach Delhi on 29th October.
Lakhs of school children enjoyed this exhibition.
Some excellent creations were received in this competition.
One of the creations drew my attention and I want to share it with you.
Though it is an Indo Africa summit but how this too can become an opportunity to connect people is clearly evident here.
I heartily congratulate Garima, the students and more than 1600 schools who participated and HRD Ministry for this initiative.
Last time on 15th August I had proposed the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Since then, many parliamentarian friends have adopted it.
They were deeply involved.
Last month a workshop was organized in Bhopal.
All the pradhans, collectors, parliamentarians of villages adopted under Adarsh Gram, the representatives of Indian government and state government, all had an in-depth discussion on this program.
Many regions in the state have been ruined by these communist terrorists.
But the MP from that place, a senior member who has also been our Deputy S peaker, Shri Karia Munda has dedicated his life for the tribals.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat from Khunti district to be adopted for Adarsh Gram.
I would like to congratulate our Honourable parliamentarian Sri Karia Munda ji for the same.
I got similar information from Andhra too.
The MP from Andhra Sri Ashok Gajapati Raju became involved in this plan and chose Dwarapudi Gram Panchayat from Vijaynagram district for the same.
Other arrangements are in progress, but he did something really innovative.
Sri Ruwala ji started a Sugarcane Festival on 11th March.
All the people from the region came together for it.
They discussed how the village could be made the centre of economic activities and how it could market for its produce.
I congratulate Ruwala ji for his efforts to make this village not only an Adarsh gram but self dependent village too.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is not possible that there be an episode of Mann ki Baat and we do not discuss cleanliness.
Savita Rai from Mumbai has sent me a telephonic message - each year on Diwali we clean our houses.
This Diwali let us clean our environment along with our homes and maintain that cleanliness even after Diwali.
She has drawn attention to this issue.
I want to remind you my dear countrymen that last year in our country, the media ran a special campaign and showed all the places where crackers were lying and told that it was not the right thing.
So what you are saying is true that our concern before and after the festival should be the same.
And we should express this concern on every public platform.
And today, I especially congratulate all the members of the Indian media fraternity.
They gave away the Clean India Awards and I could see several initiatives being carried out.
Different people were working as One Like, One Mission.
There are so many places in our country that have been kept so clean.
All these things were brought to light and I offered my heartfelt appreciation to India Today group for their commendable efforts.
Since the inception of the cleanliness drive I have seen that from Andhra and Telangana, ETV, Eanadu have participated whole heartedly and specially Sri Ramoji Rao who is very aged but beats any youth in his enthusiasm.
He has been successful in bringing together around 51 lakh children from 55-56 thousand schools of Andhra and Telangana to this mission.
Be it public places, stations, religious places, hospitals, parks or other places, he ran a cleanliness drive.
All these news exhibit the power to realize the dream of a Clean India.
ABP news has started a program called Ye Bharat Desh Hai Mera. In this program they have shown how people have become aware towards cleanliness and through this they are trying to train people about keeping their surroundings clean.
Thousands of channels and newspapers in our country, I am unable to name them all due to time constraints, but they all have helped run this campaign.
This is why, Savita Rai ji, the suggestion that you have given us the whole nation has taken it upon them to do this work and taking it forward.
The Governor of Meghalaya, Mr. Shanmuganthan, wrote me a letter and talked about a village in Meghalaya called Mavalyannong.
He has written that from last many years, this village has set out on a mission for cleanliness and more or less every generation is completely dedicated towards this cause.
He has also mentioned that a few years ago they also got the award for the cleanest village of Asia.
This is what reinforces our belief that our nation will be clean one day, for sure.
This will be possible because of the efforts of the people, and by the time we celebrate the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the 125 crore people of the country should be able to proudly proclaim that we have made India clean.
My dear countrymen, I said this from the Red Fort on the 15th of August that there are few places where corruption is deep rooted.
When a poor man goes for an ordinary job, he faces so many problems to get a decent reference and has to go through through a team of agents who take money from him in exchange for the position he is applying for.
I have never heard of any psychologist in the world who can analyze a person completely in a 1-2 minute long interview.
With this thought I decided to do away with the tradition of interviews for small positions.
My dear young friends, I feel very proud to tell you all that the government has completed all the formalities and now there will not be any interview for the non-gazetted posts of group D, group C, and group B in the Central Government.
This will come into effect from January 1st 2016.
We will not interrupt the ongoing procedures now but from January 1st, 2016, this will come into play.
So, let me congratulate all my young friends for the same.
We had, anyways, declared an important scheme in the last budget.
In our country, gold has become a part of our social life.
Gold is considered the medium of financial security.
Gold is considered to be the solution for difficult times.
Gold can become the financial property of the nation and every Indian must contribute to this.
I am happy that the promise that we made of introducing important schemes, we will do so around Diwali and Dhanteras when people buy specially buy gold.
We have introduced a Gold Monetization Scheme.
Under this scheme, you can deposit your gold in a bank and the bank will give you interest, same as you deposit your money and get interest from the bank.
Earlier, we used to keep our gold in the lockers and paid for the lockers ourselves.
Now, when you keep your gold in the bank, the bank will give you money as interest.
Now, tell me countrymen, can gold become a property or not
Can gold be converted from dead-money to a live strength or not
This is exactly what we have to do and you must stand with me.
Do not keep your gold in your homes.
Another thing is, in Sovereign Gold Bonds, you do not really get a physical gold in your hand.
2500 in exchange of that bond.
So, we are introducing this scheme now.
We will not have to worry about where to put the gold and no one will come to steal the papers.
In the coming week, I will certainly put forward this scheme that guarantees security to the people of this country.
I feel very glad to tell you that we are also introducing Gold Coin, a gold coin with Ashok Chakra.
It has been around 70 years of independence but we are still using a foreign gold coin only or the Gold Bullion Bars, these are also used by the foreigners.
Along with it a 20 gm Gold Gunion will also be available for the people.
I have full faith that this new scheme will usher a new change in the financial development of the country and I will get your support in this.
My dear countrymen, 31st October is the birth anniversary of the Iron-Man of India, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.
A complete layout of India unfolds in front of us when we talk about Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
This great man has contributed a lot in building the unity of India.
He has proven his capabilities as the Iron-Man of India.
We will certainly pay tribute to Sardar Sahab but along with that his dream of seeing India integrated, he made it possible geographically.
But this mantra of unity should be a continuously present in our thoughts in our minds, behaviour and our expressions.
Many sects, communities, languages, castes, attires, and it is this diversity that adds to its charm.
If it was not for this diversity, we wouldnt have been this proud of our country.
This is why diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, social harmony, unity, these are essential elements of a society.
Since last many years, Run for Unity programs have been organized in various parts of the country on the 31st of October.
I have heard this year also, this race is being planned at many places. People are excited to be preparing for this race.
In the true sense Ekta ki Daud is the true race for development.
In other words, the guarantee for the race of development lies in the race of unity.
Come, let us pay tribute to Sardar Sahab.
Let us take forward the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, you must all be busy in the preparations for Diwali, houses must be getting cleaned.
You must be shopping for new things.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in various ways all over the country.
I extend my good wishes to you on this pious festival.
We also get to hear of a few accidents around the time of Diwali.
My dear countrymen, I have to leave for a trip to Britain on the next day of Diwali.
I am very excited about my Britain trip this time.
The Indian government and the government of different Indian states give scholarships to such promising students who go abroad to study and who belong to the dalit community, the tribal community or any other under privileged community.
I believe that when these kids go to Britain to study, this memorial of Babasaheb will become a pilgrimage for them, it will become a source of inspiration. Whatever you learn in life, you must use it later for the nation and live for your nation, Babasaheb gave this message and even lived it himself.
This is why I am saying that I am very excited about my Britain trip this time. This issue has been lying entangled since many years, now it has become the property of 125 crore countrymen and if the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar is attached, you can imagine how happy it makes me.
I am going to get another opportunity in London, the unveiling of the statue of Lord Vishweshwara.
Many years ago, what Lord Vishweshwara had done for democracy and empowerment of women can make for a very good subject to study in the world.
The unveiling of the statue of Lord Vishweshwara on the land of London is in itself a perfect example of the fact that the great men of India were very far-sighted.
Now you see, when such incidents are connected, how excited we get.
My dear countrymen, you are connected with us through Mann ki Baat.
I keep getting your suggestions through telephone and mygov. in.
Your letters are also discussed on Akashvani.
Government officials are called in and discussions are held.
Some people write down their grievances, there are efforts to solve their problems as well.
We should learn more than one language in a country like India.
I am fortunate enough to have learned a few languages, but still there are so many languages that I could not learn.
I am indebted to Akashvani because they broadcast this program of Mann ki Baat by 8 Oclock in every state in their regional languages.
Even though a different voice is used but the thoughts are mine.
Last time I had completed a year in power. This year we are entering a new year.
A heartfelt congratulations to all my countrymen once again
Jai Hind.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2015
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
I look at the positive side of it, which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in India. Look at the other side, on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country, both are talking about cleanliness, a country cannot be more fortunate than this. This ongoing movement of thoughts, the environment thats building against filth, there has been an awareness towards cleanliness.
The self-governing regional bodies, be it Panchayats, municipal corporations, municipalities, municipal corporations of metropolitan cities, central government or state government - everybody will have to work on this. We will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in India in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream. Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Her family is very poor. I was surprised that the girl had memorized the Bhagvada Geeta completely but the most interesting thing was that she kept reciting the shlokas along with its English interpretation and its definition in English as well as Hindi. When I asked, her father told me that she started reciting these shlokas since she was only five years old.
They said, we do not have any idea. Then I asked if she only reads Geetha or does she read something else as well
I have the opportunity to be amongst you to share my Mann Ki Baat once again.
Far south, the people are engrossed in Onam festivities and yesterday the entire nation celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The government of India has launched various schemes of social security for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short span of time all these schemes have been accepted in large numbers.
I had made a humble request that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan we give our sisters these insurance schemes as a gift.
The preliminary information that I have, notifies me that from launch till date around 11 crore families have joined this scheme.
And I have been told that almost half the beneficiaries are women, the mothers and the daughters.
I consider this as a positive sign.
I offer my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on this blessed occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today when I talk to you, I want to mention that around a year back the Jan Dhan Yojana was started at a large scale.
I saw the richness of the poor.
They had to open zero balance accounts. But these poor people saved money and deposited a sum of 22,000 crores.
Banks are the mainstream of the economy and to reach this facility to the homes of the poor, the programme of Bank Mitra is being strengthened.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh Bank Mitras are serving in the country.
The youth have got employment this way.
Thousands of people under the Jan Dhan Yojana are now eligible to take an overdraft and they have availed it too.
Now the poor have this faith that they too can get money from the bank.
I would again like to congratulate all the people associated with this initiative and I would like to request the poor brethren who have opened an account to never severe this relationship.
These are your banks and now you should never leave them.
I have brought them to you, now it is your job to keep them going.
All of our accounts should be kept active.
But in a very short span of time, the intelligent brothers and sisters of mine in Gujarat brought the entire situation under control.
They played an important role in preventing the situation form worsening further and once again Gujarat started its peaceful march.
Peace, unity and brotherhood is the right way forward. We have to walk together towards the path of development.
Development is the key to our problems.
Sometime back, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
I had the opportunity to hear them speak.
And truly speaking of the experience and the manner in which they presented their views sounded as if some music was being played.
Their choice of words, their way of talking, the generosity of the Sufi tradition, its sublimity, its lyricism, I could experience it all.
I felt very nice.
I think it has become imperative to present Islam in its true form to the world.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition which is associated with love and generosity will take this message far and wide and will thus benefit not only the humanity but also benefit Islam.
And I would like to tell all that whatever faith one follows, we should definitely experience Sufism once.
I am about to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider myself fortunate to receive this invitation.
Various Buddhist scholars from across the globe are coming together at Bodh Gaya and will discuss issues relating to humanity at a global level. I have been extended an invitation to be a part of this event and I am glad to be invited at Bodh Gaya.
Pandit Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India visited Bodh Gaya.
And now, I will be going there with these scholars, this gives me immense happiness.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, today I would again like to especially share my Mann Ki Baat with you.
I have already mentioned this in the previous sessions of Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard me speak in the parliament, in public forums or Mann Ki Baat about it.
I have always said that the government is open to all views and suggestions on the issue of Land Acquisition Act, on which a debate is going on.
I have reiterated again and again that I am open to any suggestion in the interest of the farmers.
This means that now same situation exists as it was prior to the formation of my government.
But in the same act, there was a job which was incomplete. This job was related to 13 points which were to be completed within a year and so we brought the ordinance, but due to these disputes the issue got stuck.
The ordinance is coming to an end but those 13 points which were to benefit farmers which is directly connected to the monetary issues of the farmers will be made into a law and will be implemented today itself so that the farmers do not suffer any losses, especially monetary losses. And hence the task of implementing the 13 points which was left incomplete in the earlier act is being accomplished today.
Two days back we completed the 50 years of the 1965 war. And whenever we talk of the 65 war it is natural that we remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is also but natural that we remember his slogan Jai Jawan Jai Kisan.
It is also natural that we remember our Jawans who sacrificed their lives to maintain the pride and honour of our Tricolor Flag.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 1965 war.
I pay my tribute to the brave soldiers.
May we continue to be inspired by such incidents of our history.
Like I had the chance of meeting the Sufi scholars similarly I had another great experience.
I had the opportunity to interact for hours with the distinguished scientists of the country.
I had the opportunity to hear them and I was very happy to know that India is doing commendable research in the field of science.
Our scientists are doing some excellent work.
Now the challenge is to take these researches to the common man.
How to convert these theories into machineries
How to connect laboratory to the land
We have to take this forward as an opportunity.
I got a lot of new information.
I can say that it was both inspiring and educative experience for me.
And I saw how the young scientists were eager to explain their work and their eyes were full of dreams.
In the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat I had expressed the view that our students should be drawn towards science.
After this meeting I felt that there are numerous options and endless possibilities.
I receive many letters from the citizens.
Mr. Parimal Shah from Thane talks about educational reforms on my portal MyGov. in.
They have emphasized on reforms in the educational set ups.
I especially want to make a point to my young friends. I had mentioned from the Red Fort that why should there be interviews for the lower posts.
Every one rushes and that seems to be one reason for corruption at the lower levels.
I had mentioned in my speech on 15th August 2015 that this tradition of interview should at least end at some level.
I am happy that in such a short span of time, it has just been 15 days but the government is moving at a very fast pace.
Information is being disseminated and soon the decision will be enforced and small jobs will be made free of interviews.
Now the poor will not have to run for recommendation.
This will end exploitation and corruption.
These days many guests from foreign countries have arrived in India.
24 countries from across the globe discussed on the Indian soil a Call to Action to reduce Maternal Mortality and Infant Mortality rates.
It was the first time that this programme was organized in any other country outside America.
And it is true that in our country about 50,000 mothers and almost 13 lakh children die during delivery or immediately after it every year.
This is a cause of worry and these figures are scary.
Although a lot of improvement has taken place.
India is being appreciated at the International level for its efforts but this statistics is not low.
Like we became polio free similarly we became free from tetanus as a cause of maternal and child mortality.
The world has accepted this.
But we still have to work to save our mothers and our children.
Dear countrymen, there is news of dengue everywhere.
It is true that dengue is dangerous but prevention of dengue is easier.
It is directly related to the Swatch Bharat Campaign that I talk about.
We watch the advertisement on TV but do not pay attention.
There are advertisements in the newspapers but it escapes our attention.
There are several ways of keeping the smallest thing in the household clean by using pure water.
A lot of Public Education Programmes are being conducted but we do not pay attention. We feel that we live in very good houses with proper arrangements being totally unaware that water is collecting at some location in the house and that we are inviting dengue.
I would request you all that do not make death so cheap.
Life is very precious.
A little carelessness about cleanliness and accumulated water can cause death, which I believe is not right.
In the entire country about 514 centers have facilities for testing dengue cases absolutely free of cost.
It is necessary to get ourselves tested on time to save precious lives. Cooperation from all of you is very important for this menace.
And cleanliness should be given great importance.
From Raksha Bandhan to Diwali there will be many festivals.
Why dont we associate each festival with cleaniness
You will see how a tradition becomes your habit.
My dear countrymen I want to share good news with you. Like I said we may not get a chance to die for our nation, but we can be fortunate to live for the country.
These two brothers have brought pride to the nation.
In America a difficult cycle race of about 4800 kms known as Race Across America is organized.
This year both these brothers have won this race.
See everyone is doing their bit for taking the country forward.
And this it, when you hear such things the heart swells with pride.
Sometimes we do injustice to our youth guided by a certain perception.
The old generation feels that the new generation does not understand anything and I understand that this has been going on for ages.
My experience regarding youth is different.
Sometimes when we talk to the youth we learn so many things.
I have met so many youth who have taken the pledge Sunday on Cycle.
Some say that I keep one day a week as Cycle-Day as it is good for my health.
It is good for the environment.
And I enjoy my youth too.
Nowadays many cities in our country are witnessing cycle use and there are many people promoting its use.
But this is a good initiative both for improving health and saving the environment.
And today when two youths of my country made India proud in the US, I thought of it worth mentioning.
Today I especially want to congratulate the Maharashtra government.
It makes me happy.
The task for erecting a memorial for Baba Sahib Ambedkar in the Indu Mill compounds had been stuck for long.
The new government in Maharashtra completed this task and now a grand memorial will be erected which will inspire us to work for the dalits, exploited and the marginalized.
But along with this, the house in UK where Baba Saheb lived 10 King Henry Road has been purchased too.
The globetrotting Indians on their trip to UK can visit the memorial being erected by the Maharashtra government. It will be inspirational to many.
I congratulate the Maharashtra government on the accomplishment of both these tasks.
My dear brothers and sisters do share your views before the next Mann Ki Baat for I believe that democracy runs through public participation.
We can take the nation forward when we work together.
I send my best wishes to you.
This year the rains have started on a good note.
This will definitely prove beneficial to our farmer brothers and sisters in sowing of kharif crops.
I am very pleased to share an immensely good news with you all.
We have always faced scarcity of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
Poor people require pulses and some amount of oil to prepare vegetables for their food.
I would especially like to congratulate and compliment all my farmer brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The intensity with which the farmers are connected with their land, our soldiers too are connected with the land in the same degree.
During the Kargil war, each one of our soldier proved mightier than hundreds of soldiers of our enemies.
I would like to salute all our brave soldiers who thwarted the attempts by our enemies without caring for their lives.
Kargil war was not limited to just our borders, but each of our cities, villages contributed in this war.
This war was fought by those mothers and sisters whose sons and brothers were fighting against the enemies at the border.
This war was also fought by the daughters of our country, who were newly married and their henna were still fresh on their hands.
Hence, I would like to salute all these valiant warriors on this occasion of Kargil Vijay Diwas.
There is another reason why I consider 26th July quite important because MyGov. in was launched a few months after our government was formed.
Our pledge was to promote citizen participation in democracy and connect every citizen in the development work. And today I am pleased to share this after one year that nearly two crore people have visited MyGov website.
We have received comments from five and a half lac people and I am extremely glad to mention that more than fifty thousand people took out time from their precious schedule to apply their mind and provide their suggestions on PMO applications as they considered this work important.
Though this is a very minor issue but the government never took note of it or thought about the same previously.
But on the suggestion of our brother Akhilesh Vajpayee, our government looked into this suggestion seriously and we have implemented this facility in our system for our disabled brothers and sisters.
We are receiving quite positive suggestions on MyGov, it is helping in getting assistance in creating logos, tag-lines and formulating policies by yourselves.
We are experiencing fresh air in the administrative system.
We are experiencing a new sense of consciousness.
I am even receiving suggestion on MyGov that what should be my speech on 15th of August.
We have received quite a few suggestions from Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai in this regard.
She has suggested me to speak on the topics like Save our Daughters, Educate a Girl Child, Clean Ganges, Swachh Bharat.
With this I got an idea and I am requesting you all to send suggestions about what should be the topics for my 15th August speech.
You can send in your suggestions through MyGov, letters to Radio or write letters to the PMs office.
Look, I believe that this will be a great initiative to include peoples suggestion in framing my speech for 15th August.
I believe that you will send your good suggestions.
I would like to talk about an issue which is a matter of great concern.
I neither want to sermonize nor I am trying to find an escape route towards my responsibilities pertaining to state government, central government or units of local self-government institutions.
Two days ago a visual of an accident in Delhi caught my attention, wherein the victim on scooter was fighting for his life for ten minutes post the accident.
He did not receive any help from the passers-by.
In general also I have noticed that I have been receiving suggestions to speak on road safety and make the people aware of this.
Be it Hoshakote Akshay from Bengaluru, Ameya Joshi from Pune or Prasanna Kakunje from Mudbidri, Karnataka - all these all people have written to me...
My heart shivers when I look at the statistics of accidents.
We are witnessing an accident every minute in our country.
Due to these road accidents we are witnessing one death every four minutes in our country.
It is a matter of huge concern that out of these deaths, nearly one third of the victims comprise the youth ranging from 15 to 25 years of age group, and such death shakes the very foundation of an entire family.
The government system will continue to work towards this but I would like to request all the parents to make their children aware of all the Safety Rules pertaining to driving a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler the families should encourage discussion of road safety at home and create an atmosphere about the same to promote road safety.
We have undertaken another project called Cashless Treatment in Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mundiya national highway and it will be further extended. The Cashless Treatment refers to the policy for the first fifty hours post-accident one need worry if one has money or not, who will pay the bills, leaving all this worry one has to give primary importance to the road accident victim who is injured so that he is treated and provided the best hospital facilities at the earliest.
We have started a toll-free number 1033 for providing information about incidents across the country and ambulance service but all these are services are for post accidents.
One must strive to avoid accidents first but it is also important for us to see from the perspective that each and every soul, each and every life is precious.
Sometimes I say that the government employees to be Karma Yogis or selfless workers.
I recalled a few incidents in the last few days which I liked and hence would like to share with you. Sometimes people get tired of their continuous jobs.
Using his example, we can learn how to bring more life to our own jobs.
Vijay Biswal has shown us how we can connect our jobs with our hobbies, interests or skills.
Who knows, Vijay Biswals work may get recognised by his paintings across the nation in the near future.
I have come to know about a very inspiring work started by the entire team of government officials in Harda district, Madhya Pradesh.
These bunch of officials with their entire team have started such a work which has touched me immensely and I really liked it and the work they have started is Operation Malyuddh, and upon hearing this you will feel that this subject will go in a certain direction.
This operation has given a new meaning to Raksha Bandhan and I would like to congratulate the entire government team of Harda district for this initiative.
I came across a news a few days back and these small news really gives me immense pleasure and I would like to share the same with you.
There exists a small village called Keshla in Rajnandgaon, Chhattisgarh.
The inhabitants of this village from last few months tried and lead a campaign for building toilets in the village.
Now, nobody from this village has to go to toilet in the open.
After the completion of this campaign, the entire village celebrated this accomplishment just like a mega festival.
These finest examples coming up to me show how our society is bringing change in human values and human mind and how the citizens of this country are taking the nation forward.
Bhavesh Deka from Guwahati has written to me on the North-East related issues and problems.
I must say that North-East people are quite active.
I really appreciate that they write about a lot of issues.
I would like to tell them with great pleasure that we have a separate ministry for North-Eastern region.
These officials would visit the districts, villages and meet the local government officials and talk to peoples representatives and the citizens of those regions.
They will listen to their problems and direct the government in taking appropriate measures in solving those problems.
This initiative will bring a fruitful result in the near future.
The officials who will visit these states would realize the beauty of these states and will feel very determined to work for the development of these states and to fix the problems of these states.
When they return with this pledge, they can easily understand the problems of these states even when they reach Delhi.
This is a great initiative to go far-off from Delhi to East, and this act is called Act East Policy.
My dear countrymen, we are extremely delighted and proud of the Mars Mission success.
I am often worried by this thought that we speak to the youth of our nation and ask about their dream job, only one out of 100 would express their interest in becoming a scientist.
Youth is losing their interest in science, which is a matter of great concern.
Their capabilities should be monitored and must be assisted in the right direction to achieve success in this field.
I always press upon the IAS officers of our government, who have reached such heights with their vast intellect and education that they should visit the nearby schools and colleges and share their knowledge for just two to four hours in a week.
Your experience and intellect would certainly help the new generation to some extent.
This work is difficult but it must be done.
We have auspiciously inaugurated this scheme and the villages will get a supply of 24 hours electricity in the coming years.
The students of the villages should not be affected with the shortage of electricity during their exams.
There should be enough electricity for starting a small industry.
Today, the villagers have to go to other villagers for charging their mobile phones.
The villages should be provided with all the facilities that are available in the cities.
For this purpose, we have launched Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Programme.
I am aware that this country is quite vast and we have to reach the villages and far off corners of the country.
We have to run for the development of the Poor.
Today, through Mann ki Baat, I felt like expressing these myriad of thoughts.
In a way, in our country the months of August and September are the months for celebration of festivals.
There are lots of festivals in these months.
My greetings to all of you for the same.
Please do send your suggestions for 15th August.
Your opinions will really help me.
Last time in Mann ki Baat I had requested you to send me memorable pictures if you go out on a vacation anywhere in India and if you happen to find them, kindly post them under the Incredible India hashtag.
When Isaid that, I had never imagined that it would get such an immense response.
Lakhs of people have posted photos on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
I can say that India is full of diversities and I was able to witness so many magnificent scenes in those pictures
be it of architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers or seas.
Government of India had never thought that in terms of tourism you all could contribute in such a massive way.
I liked some pictures so much that I re-tweeted them.
We will promote and also continue doing such work and the entire world will watch it, entire nation will watch it and our new generation will also watch it.
My beloved countrymen, though you have elected me as the Prime Minister of the country but at times, the human in me shuns all posts and prestige associated with it and submerges oneself within it.
I can say that 21st June, the International Yoga Day affected me in the same manner. At that time, when I proposed the International Yoga Day, it was just an idea.
We can say with conviction that the sun never sets in the world of Yoga practitioners.
The way Yoga was received and was welcomed with open arms around the world, there would not be any Indian who would not be proud of it.
I too got delighted.
And when the people of France chose River Seine and Eiffel Tower in which they take pride to do Yoga, they gave an equal status to it as River Siene and Eifel Tower.
In New York people did yoga at Times Square.
If we think about Sydney, Australia then the picture of Opera House comes to our mind.
The citizens of Australia gave equal respect to yoga and did yoga at the Opera House.
Whether it is North America, Silicon Valley or Milans Duomo Cathedral it is a matter of great pride for us.
Similarly, UN Peace Keeping Force did a spectacular display of Yoga.
In India, our soldiers too were doing yoga in Siachen on white sheet of snow and on sea too, wherever our naval ships are posted, the yoga program was being carried out by Indian Navy.
Delhi made it to the Guinness Book of World Records .
Rajpath turned into the Yogpath that day.
I am thankful to India and the rest of the world and can say that the International Yoga Day was not for namesake.
It seemed as if that from every corner of the world, there was a new inquisitiveness, new joy, new hope and new connection.
Few days back, when I tweeted a photo of a Vietnamese child doing yoga, it was such a sweet photo that it got a lot of attention from the entire world.
Everybody, be it men-women, old-young, village-city, developed or developing countries, everybody got connected with it.
Yoga in true terms, became the core reason to connect the entire world.
But I can feel and every Indian can experience that the whole world is very curious to know more about India.
Curiosity towards India has increased.
The world wants to know about the values, the rituals and the heritage of India.
It is our responsibility that without any artificiality we share our legacy and introduce ourselves to the world.
We can only do this when we ourselves are proud of our traditions.
At times, we are so familiar with our values that we dont feel there is anything new in them but we ourselves do not know that our family values are considered to be a big thing in the entire world.
I am sure, they would be intrigued.
There are many things that our forefathers have given to us which are the best and the entire world also has the right on those things.
The success of International Yoga day has brought in a new responsibility along with it.
It is our responsibility that we gift supreme Yoga teachers to the world.
It is our responsibility that we can see the entire tradition of Yoga on one platform from the Universe.
We all should come to know about all the Yoga organizations, Yoga teachers and all the necessary information about the Yoga from this online program.
One database must be prepared and I believe you can do it.
One must start from somewhere and it would surely turn out to be a great power.
I have seen and learnt from the perspective of recent occurrences that a government that works and the government that is action-oriented can bring in results if the targets are set.
We should not forget that the only voice that could be heard one year ago was that nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens.
Can you imagine that there is a department under Government named Ayush. Nobody has paid attention towards this department.
The only mention Ayush in some corner of the newspaper being a small department is once in 2 to 5 years. But it led on the International Yoga Day.
It was this small department that organized this event in the entire world.
Therefore, this is an example that if there is an aim then even a small department can do a supreme job.
In the last few days, the world saw how we saved people from Yemen to Afghanistan.
In a few hours-, we reached Nepal and helped people over there. When people wanted to open an bank account under the Governments new scheme of Jan Dhan Yojana, how the people working in bank helped them to do so and connected millions of Indians to the bank.
On 15th August last year, when I appealed from the Red Fort for toilets in schools, I had said that by next 15th August we have to complete this task.
The promise was really daring. Almost four and half lakh toilets were to be built but I can say it with satisfaction that though 15th August is still far off, the work of constructing toilets by the people is on the verge of completion.
This means that the Government, people and Government workers, all want to work for the country.
Last month, we had launched three Insurance schemes.
I had launched them from Kolkata and it has received such a commendable response in such a short span of time.
There have been very few steps which have been taken from the perspective of social security but by way of these three schemes we are taking a big leap.
In such a short time span more than 10 crore people have become a part of these schemes but we have to take it further.
Rakshabandhan comes in the month of August.
330 scheme on Rakshabandhan for their entire life. This can be a big gift for a sister from their brother.
Lets come together and try to work together towards the completion of this pledge.
Whenever I hold a Mann ki Baat session, many people send me suggestions.
This time many people have suggested that I say something about the monsoons.
Yogesh Dandekar from Nagpur, Harshvardhan ji from Mysore, Praveen Nadkarni ji, Divyanshu Gupta ji have all asked me to say something about the monsoon in this session of Mann ki Baat.
They have sent in some really good suggestions.
I am sure, you too might be enjoying the rains with bhajiyas, pakoras, corn and a hot cup of tea.
Just as the rays of the sun give us life, similarly rainfall provide us life and sustenance.
It should be our pledge that water from the villages stays in the villages and water for the cities remains available for them.
If the rain water does not flow away, it goes into the earth , then the aquifers get recharged and the year long water woes get resolved.
I always tell people, that if you go to Porbander, the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi, you will be able to see a two hundred year old underground water tank which got directly recharged with the rain water. You can still see it.
Porbander is a coastal city, so potable water was collected through the rains for the entire year. Even in those times such a lot of care was taken.
We can too do the same.
This monsoon season, there should be mass plant sowing campaigns conducted by youth and social organizations.
And I can take a leaf from my personal experience and offer you a suggestion which has been very successful.
This is an intensely rural technology.
Whenever you sow a plant, place an earthen pot near it.
You just need to fill it once or twice in a month.
I have even been telling the farmers to plant trees on the boundaries of their fields instead of putting barricades.
These will become your biggest asset in the long run.
We all know that rains cause many water borne diseases.
Increased moisture in the environment leads to bacterial growth and so, keeping the environment clean becomes important. Cleanliness is very important in monsoons.
It is often requested to consume safe drinking water.
And this is true that the more care we take, healthier we would be.
We need monsoons and we need water but we also need to stay healthy.
Dear citizens, we have recently launched three schemes for the people in the cities.
We have around 500 small cities.
In the Amrut scheme, we have launched a massive campaign and taken up initiatives to improve the quality of life in our cities.
We should become a country which is able to match the living standards of the world.
We should have smart cities, comparable to world standards. And yet at the same time, the poorest of poor person should have an accommodation of his own and that too complete with water, electricity, sanitation and access to a school.
In 2022 when India celebrates its 75 years of Independence, we wish that every Indian has a house of his own.
Keeping all this in mind, we have launched three major schemes.
I am positive that these schemes will bring about a qualitative difference in the lives of the urban people.
I am myself connected to you via the social media. I keep getting many new suggestions and new ideas and also good and bad information about our government.
And sometimes it so happens that a small comment from an individual in some remote village in India conveys something that just touches our hearts.
You are aware that the government has launched Beti Bachao Beti Padhao programme.
But you cant imagine the force that is lent to the programme when a village or a society adopts it.
A few days back a Sarpanch in a small remote village of Haryana, Sri Sunil Jaglan ji launched Selfie with Daughter campaign.
In Haryana, the number of girls in comparison to boys is dismally low.
Around another 100 districts in the country have a similar dismal situation of skewed sex ratio.
But it is the worst in Haryana.
In that very same Haryana, if a Sarpanch of a small indistinct village lends this meaning to the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao programme, then I certainly get overwhelmed.
It makes me so happy and it gives me a new hope and I do express my happiness.
I request you all to take a selfie with your daughter and post it on selfie with daughter.
And do not forget to post a tagline around the theme of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao with it, whatever be the language it can be in Hindi, English, your mother tongue or your native language.
And I promise to re-tweet the most inspirational tagline with you and your daughters selfie.
We can turn Beti Bachao Beti Padhao into a mass movement.
I urge you all to take forward the programme launched by Sri Sunil in Bibipur village of Haryana. I request you all to post on selfie with daughter.
So my best wishes to you for the coming monsoon season. May all of you enjoy the rains.
Make our country clean and green.
And remember, the International Yoga day was not a single day initiative.
Continue practicing Yoga, then see what difference it makes to you and your life.
Make Yoga a part of your life.
And that initiative regarding Incredible India, do keep posting a picture of whichever part of the country you go to.
The country and the world will awaken to our diversity.
I felt that the handicrafts did not receive due attention.
We have to expand our reach to the world and make India known to the world.
We have an easy medium at our disposal and so we will all do it.
My dear countrymen, that is all for today.
It used to be a chat in a genial atmosphere amidst the warmth of ones own family of 130 crore countrymen we would listen, we would re-iterate
You can imagine how this period must have made one feel.
Perhaps, this was not a lifeless programme.
And that is why, for me the intervening period was very difficult to bear. I used to miss something every moment
when I express myself through Mann Ki Baat, the one speaking is me, the words are mine, the voice is mine, but the story is yours, the Purusharth pertaining to your pursuits and goals is yours, the Parakram, the achievement is yours.
I was undergoing a bout of emptiness.
But this Sunday has made one wait endlessly
Anyway, finally the opportunity has dawned.
Over the last few months, many messages have poured in, with people stating that they have been missing Mann Ki Baat.
There are times when I feel that this is my journey from the self to the unabridged whole
my journey from I to We.
For me, this nonvocal conversation with you was a part of my feelings during my spiritual journey.
Amidst hectic Election engagements, many people asked me a flurry of questions on why I had gone up to Kedarnath.
Most people have derived political conclusions out of that.
For me, it was an opportunity to meet myself.
In a way, I undertook the journey to meet my inner self.
I shall not reveal other things today, but I certainly want to tell you that perhaps in that solitary cave, I got an opportunity to fill up the vacuum caused due to the long pause that Mann Ki Baat had to go through.
The rest is your inquisitiveness... I think, someday Ill talk about that too.
The way people have expressed their wish to know about Kedar, I feel a similar effort on your part to lay emphasis on positive things, which I get to know through your expressions.
The letters which steadily pour in for Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are received are entirely different from routine Government matters.
One way, a letter from you can act as a source of inspiration for me on the other it may turn out to be a source of energy for me.
There are times when some of your words act as a catalyst in sharpening my thought process.
People bring to the fore challenges facing the country and society they also come out with solutions for the same.
If someone refers to sanitation and cleanliness, he or she invariably voices angst against filth dirt, but on the same page appreciates efforts being under way to ensure cleanliness.
When somebody talks about the environment, one can easily sense his or her crucial concerns on the matter at the same time, experiments that the person has attempted or seen also come to the surface, with vivid descriptions of new ideas on the issue.
It conveys to us that there is no dearth of inner fortitude, strength talent within our countrymen.
The need of the hour is to synergise those strengths and talents, to provide opportunities, to implement them.
Mann Ki Baat also tells us that a 130 crore countrymen wish to be, strongly and actively, a part of the nations progress. I receive a lot of letters and phone calls in Mann Ki Baat, but the element of complaint is negligible and I would like to tell you that in the last five years, I have not come across a single instance where somebody has asked for something for personal gain.
When I analyse this, you can visualise how heartening it must be for me, what a source of energy it is for me.
Actually speaking, I have not RETURNED you brought me back, you positioned me here and gave me the opportunity to speak once again.
With this sentiment, come, lets take Mann Ki Baat forward.
When Emergency was imposed on the country, resistance against it was not limited to the political arena or politicians the movement was not curtailed to the confines of prison cells.
During Emergency, every citizen of the country had started getting the feeling that something that belonged to him had been snatched away.
Just recently, our country celebrated a mega festival of democracy, a mammoth Election Campaign, from the rich to the poor, all were happily eager in this festival to decide the fate of their country.
When something is in close proximity of us, we tend to underestimate its importance we ignore even amazing facts about it.
In the 2019 Loksabha Election, India saw over 61 crore voters exercising their franchise...
We can think of this figure as one ordinary but if I place it in a global perspective, if you exclude China, the number of people who voted in India exceeds the population of any other country in the world.
The number of people who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha Election is more than the entire population of America, close to double the figure.
The total number of voters in India exceeds the entire population of Europe.
This stands for the sheer size spread of our Democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha Election in history by far, was the largest democratic Election ever held in the world.
You can imagine the kind of resources and manpower that was required for such a mammoth exercise.
Lakhs of teachers, officers staff strived day night to make it possible.
In order to successfully conclude this Mahayagya, on the one hand, whereas close to three lakh paramilitary personnel discharged their duty on the other, 20 lakh Police personnel of various states too, persevered with due diligence.
It is on account of these people that this time voting took place on a larger scale compared to the previous Election.
For the voting, there were around 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, over 17 lakh VVPAT machines... you can imagine the gargantuan task
All this was done, just to ensure that no voter was deprived of his or her voting rights.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, just for a lone woman voter, a polling station was created.
The worlds highest located polling station too, is in India.
At an altitude of 15,000 feet, it is located in the Lahaul Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides this, there is another fact pertaining to these Elections, that swells our hearts with pride.
Perhaps, this is the first time ever, that women have enthusiastically voted, as much as men did.
This time the ratio of men women who voted was almost the same.
Another encouraging fact is that, today, there are a record 78 women Members of Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person connected with the electioneering process and salute the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you may often have heard me say No bouquet, just a book I had urged all to choose books over flowers in welcome or felicitation ceremonies.
Since then, people have been offering books at many a place.
Of course, I couldnt get much time, but during my travelling, I got an opportunity to read some of his short stories once again.
His stories embody the collective psyche, the cumulative being of the country, of the land.
While reading one of his stories Nashaa, I couldnt help but notice the scourge of economic disparity plaguing society.
The moral of this story featuring the landholders son Eeshwari and Beer from a poor family is that if you are not careful enough, you will never know when the bane of bad company engulfs you.
The other story that touched the core of my heart was Eidgah... the sensitivity of a young lad, his unsullied love for his grandmother, such maturity at that early age
When 4-5 years old Hamid comes back to his grandma with a pair of tongs, indeed, it stirs human emotions to their supreme pinnacle.
The concluding line of this story makes one very emotional since it holds a vital truth about life, Young Hamid played the role of aged Hamid aged Ameena had turned into child Ameena.
Another such poignant story is 'Poos Ki Raat'.
In this story, the living depiction of the paradoxes in a poor farmer's life is seen.
Halku the farmer is happy even after his crops are destroyed by frost, because now he will not be forced to sleep in his fields in the cold winter.
Though these stories were written about a century ago but remain relevant all the same even today.
After reading these stories, I felt myself to be empathetic.
Now that we are conversing about reading, then in some extension of media, I had read about the Akshara Library in Kerala.
You will be surprised to learn that this library lies in a village nestling within the dense forests of Idukki.
V. Chinnathampi who runs a small tea shop, have between them worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when the books were brought here stuffed in sacks and carried on the back.
Today this library is a beacon guiding tribal children on a new path.
The Vaanche Gujarat campaign carried out in Gujarat was a successful experiment.
Participants hailing from every age group in lakhs, participated in this campaign to read books.
I will still urge you in today's digital world and in the time of Google Guru, to take some time out from your daily routine and devote it to the book.
You will really enjoy it a lot and do write about whichever book you read on the NarendraModi App so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat' also get to know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about issues, which are posing a challenge not only at the present but also the future.
I was reading your comments on NarendraModi App and Mygov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the prevailing water problem.
Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about the challenges related with water.
Water is of great importance in our culture.
Please bless us like a mother and may your blessings continue on to be showered upon us.
Water scarcity affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised that only 8 of the water received from rains in the entire year is harvested in our country.
I believe, like the other problems on hand, we can also solve this predicament by the participation of the people, Janbhagidari and their power, Janshakti we are bound to find a solution through the strength, cooperation and resolution of one hundred and thirty crore citizens.
Therefore keeping the importance of water in mind, a new Jalashakti ministry has been created in the country.
This will allow faster decision-making on all subjects related to water.
A few days ago I tried to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanchs and Gram Pradhans across the country.
That in order to save water, to collect water, to save the very drops of the rainwater, they should convene a meeting of the Gram Sabha and sit and discuss the resolution to this problem with the villagers.
I am happy that they have shown exemplary enthusiasm on this front and on 22nd of this month crores of people contributed free labour, Shramdaan across thousands of panchayats.
People in village after village resolved to accumulate every single drop of rainwater.
Today, I want to narrate the story of a sarpanch in the 'Mann Ki Baat' programme.
Come lets listen to what the Sarpanch of Lupung Panchayat of Katakmasandi block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has to say to all of us through this message:DILIP KUMAR RAVIDASThis is Birsa Munda's land, where cohabiting in harmony with nature is a part of the culture.
The people here, once again, are ready to play their active role in water conservation.
For my part I wish good luck to all the village heads and all the sarpanchs for their dynamism.
There are several Sarpanchs across the country who have taken the lead in water conservation.
In a way, entire villages have grasped this opportunity as collective responsibility.
And it seems that the denizens of the villages have become involved in the competition for raising a water temple, in their respective villages.
As Ive said, a collective effort begets massive positive results.
There cannot be a single formula for dealing with water crisis across the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country, in diverse ways.
But the goal remains the same, and that is to save water and adopt water conservation.
The drainage lines are being fixed in Punjab.
This effort would rid of the problem of water logging.
The construction of the water-tank in Telangana's Thimmaipalli is changing the lives of the people of the village.
There has been a major change through construction of small ponds in the fields at Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
I was reading about the collective endeavour in Vellore of Tamilnadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river.
I have also read about those women of Garhwal, who are working together on the good work of implementing rainwater harvesting.
I believe that many such attempts are being made and we can turn impossible in to possible when we are together and strive with collective resolve.
When people will join hands, water will be conserved.
Today, through the 'Mann Ki Baat' programme, I am entreating 3 requests to the fellow countrymen.
My first request is that just like cleanliness drive has been given the shape of a mass movement by the countrymen, let's also start a mass movement for water conservation.
We together should all resolve to save every drop of water and I believe that water is God's prasad to us, water is like philosopher's stone
Earlier it was said that by the touch of philosopher's stone, iron could be transmuted in to gold.
I tell you, water is philosopher's stone and its mere touch creates and regenerates life
Let us start an awareness campaign to save even a single drop of water.
In this campaign not only should we focus on water related problems but propagate ways to save water as well.
I specifically urge the luminaries belonging to different walks of life to lead promotion of water conservation through innovative campaigns.
Whether it be from the world of films, sports, our friends in the media, people belonging to social organizations, people associated with cultural organizations or people involved in conducting devotional congregations such as Katha - Kirtan, everyone should lead this movement in their own fashion.
We must wake up the society, unite the society and join the society in this endeavour.
Youll see, we will find change occurring in front of our own eyes.
My second request to the countrymen is to share many traditional methods that have been in use over the centuries in our country for the conservation of water.
I urge all of you to share these traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you gets an opportunity to go to Porbandar, the place of birth of revered Bapu, then there is a house behind the house of revered Bapu, where a 200-year old water tank still exists. It is still capable of storing water and has a mechanism to harvest rain water
Come let us join water conservation, and involve ourselves in making a list of more and more innovative methods to motivate people to conserve water.
You can all share your content using the JanShakti4JalShakti hashtag.
My dear countrymen, I must express my gratitude to you and to the people of the world for one more thing
On 21st June, once again, Yoga Day was celebrated together with fervor and enthusiasm, there were instances of three-four generations of each family coming together to participate on Yoga Day.
The awareness about Holistic Health Care has enhanced the glory of yoga and Yoga day.
In any corner of the world, yoga enthusiast welcomes the sun as soon it rises and then there is the complete journey ending with sunset.
In India, over the Himalayas, across the Indian Ocean, from the lofty heights of Siachen to the depths of a Submarine, from air-force to aircraft carriers, from air-conditioned gyms to hot desert and from villages to cities - wherever possible, yoga was not just practiced everywhere, but was also celebrated collectively.
The Presidents, Prime Ministers, celebrities and ordinary citizens of many countries of the world showed me on the Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their respective nations.
On that day, the world appeared to be like one big happy family.
We all know that healthy and sensitive denizens are required to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures this very principle.
Therefore promotion of Yoga is a great example of social service.
Should we not recognize such service and bestow it with honour
In the year 2019, the announcement of Prime Minister's Awards for excellence in the promotion and development of yoga was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
This award would be bestowed on those organizations around the world, whose significant and unique contributions in the promotion of yoga you cannot even imagine
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan', which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Italy's Ms. Antonietta Rozzi, has started Sarv Yoga International, and popularized Yoga throughout Europe.
These are inspirational examples in themselves.
If there is a topic related to yoga, then can Indians lag behind others
The Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya in Munger dedicated to yoga from past many decades was also honoured.
The process of linking with your thoughts through Mann Ki Baat as a medium is a very important and personal journey for myself.
Let us keep on meeting and keep on talking.
Let me keep on listening to your thoughts, let me keep on understanding and cherish them.
Let me sometimes try to live those very emotions.
May your blessings remain there for me
You are my inspiration and you are my energy
Let's sit together and while enjoying Mann Ki Baat try to fulfill the responsibilities of life.
Once again next month we will meet again for another episode of Mann Ki Baat.
I Thank all of you once again.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2015
Mann Ki Baat, April 2015
Mann Ki Baat, December 2014
There is a question I want to ask these youth caught in the drug trap. I want to ask these youth that when for three or four hours they are in a state of intoxication, they might be feeling free of all concerns, free of all tensions and in a different world altogether. But have you ever lent a thought to the fact that when you buy drugs where does this money go to
Have you ever thought about it
Just make a guess.
What if this drug money goes to the terrorists
What if this money is spent by the terrorists to procure weapons
And with this weapon the very same terrorist might be pumping bullets in the heart of my soldiers.
The soldier of my country gets martyred.
Have you ever thought about our soldiers- a soldier who is so dear to his mother, the treasured son of Mother India, the brave son of the soil is hit by a bullet probably funded by the money spent on purchasing drugs.
Do we ever work for our kids spiritual progress and discuss it with them, rather we discuss only material progress.
Sometimes people ask Modi ji dont you get tired
A month is quite a long time.
Lots of things keep happening in the world.
You all have recently celebrated the festival of Diwali with great fervour and joy.
It is these festivals which bring happiness in our daily lives from time to time. Be it poor or rich, people from village or from urban areas, festivals hold a different significance in everyones lives.
Sometimes we think leave it... nothing is going to change, people are indifferent, they will not do anything, our country is like this.
From my last conversation in Mann Ki Baat to this one, I would urge you all to change this mindset. Neither is our country is like this nor our people indifferent.
Sometimes I feel the Nation is way ahead and the government is lacking behind.
And from my personal experience I will say that the governments too needs to change their mindsets.
They are very eager to do their bit and are just seeking an opportunity where they can do their bit.
And they are making efforts at their own end.
Last time I had asked them to buy at least one khadi outfit.
I had not asked anyone to be Khadidhari, But the feedback I got from Khadi stores was that in a weeks time the sales had jumped up by 125.
In this way, as compared to last year the sales this year is more than double in the week following 2nd Oct.
This means, the people of our country is many times more than we think of.
I salute all my fellow Indians.
. Can anyone imagine that cleanliness will become a such a huge public movement.
The expectations are high and they should be so.
I can see some good results, cleanliness can now be witnessed in two parts.
One is those huge garbage piles which keep lying in the city well the people in the government will work to remove those.
It is a big challenge but you cannot run away from your responsibilities.
All state governments and all municipalities will now have to take concrete actions due to the rising public pressure.
Media is playing a very positive role in this.
But there is the second aspect which gives me immense pleasure, happiness and a sense of satisfaction that the general public has started feeling that leave what happened in the past, now they will not dirty their surroundings.
We will not add to the existing dirt.
A gentleman Mr Bharat Gupta has sent me a mail on mygov. in from Satna, Madhya Pradesh.
He said that people eat on trains and usually litter around. He continues to say that he has been touring from the past many years but it is this time around no one was littering, rather they were looking for dustbins to throw their trash.
When they could not see any arrangements they collected all their litter in a corner.
He says that it was a very gratifying experience for me.
I thank Bharat ji for sharing this experience with me.
What I am seeing is that this campaign has had a great influence on kids.
Many families mention that now whenever kids eat a chocolate they themselves pick the wrapper and disposes it.
I was seeing a message on the social media. Someone had posted a picture with the Title My hero of the Day.
Just see... people now feel it is their country and they will not make it dirty.
We will not add to the existing dirt pile.
And those do litter feel ashamed for someone is around to point it out to them.
I consider all these to be good omens.
Another thing is that many people come to meet me who are from all the sections of the society.
Someone talks about cleanliness, while some others talk about education, while someone talks about social reforms.
Some people discuss the ruining of family life.
I initially thought if a businessman comes, he will definitely talk of things of his personal interest.
But I am seeing a major change.
They talk less about their interest and more about taking on some or the other social responsibility.
When I add up all these small incidents I see a larger picture and I realize that we are moving in the right direction.
If the poor families are saved from diseases, then they will be saved from a lot of financial problems.
If a person is healthy, then he will work hard, earn for the family and help in running the family smoothly.
And so this cleanliness drive is directly related to the health and welfare of my poor brethren.
We may not be able to do something to help the poor, but even keeping the environs clean helps the poor in a big way.
I see that people who work in this field are sending me their success stories.
But I came to know about two things from my people in the government.
The people from the HRD ministry after hearing my talk, felt the need to do something.
And the officers came together to work out an action plan.
This is an example of how changes are coming about in governance.
One they have decided that those specially abled who want to pursue technical education, a thousand of them who are good will be selected for Special Scholarships, and a plan has been made.
I congratulate the officials who could think in those lines.
I had the chance to visit Siachin a few days back.
I spent Diwali with the Jawans who are ready to lay down their lives for the nation.
When the nation was celebrating Diwali I was at Siachin.
It is because of them that we were able to celebrate Diwali, so I wanted to be with them.
I experienced the difficulties in which they spent their time there.
I salute all my Jawans.
But I want to share another matter of great pride with you.
Our Jawans work in the field of security.
In calamities, they risk their lives to save our life.
I offer these Jawans my heartiest congratulations.
I also got an opportunity to meet, the young and dynamic students, boys and girls over tea who had won medals in Sports.
They give me renewed energy.
I was seeing their zeal and enthusiasm. The facilities in our country are quite less as compared to other nations, but instead of complaining they were just sharing their joy and excitement.
For me, this tea programme for these players was very inspiring, and I felt really good.
I would like to tell you something more and that too from my heart.
I truly believe that people of my country trust my words and my intentions.
But, today one more time, I want to reiterate my commitment.
As far as black money is concerned, my people, please trust your Prime Servant, for me this is the Article of Faith.
This is my commitment that the hard-earned money of the poor people stashed abroad, every penny of that should be brought back.
The ways and means to be followed can be different.
And this is very obvious in a democratic country, but on the basis of as much I understand and as much I know, I assure you that we are on the right track.
Today, nobody, neither me, nor the government, nor you, nor even the previous government knew how much money is stashed abroad.
Everyone gives estimate calculated in hisher own way.
I dont want to get lost in some such figures and estimates, Its my commitment that, be it 2 rupees, or 5 rupees, or millions or even billions, this is the hard-earned money of the poor people of my country and it has to come back.
And I assure you that I will keep trying till the end.
No efforts will be spared.
I want your blessings to be always with me.
I assure you that I will do whatever and whenever something is required to be done for you.
I give my commitment to you.
I have received a letter.
It has been sent by Sri Abhishek Pareekh.
The same sentiments were expressed to me by many mothers and sisters when I was not even the Prime Minister.
He has asked me to discuss this topic in Mann ki Baat.
I agree with his concern and I will definitely include this topic, in my next edition of Mann Ki Baat.
I will discuss the topic of drugs, drug addiction and drug mafia and how they are a threat to our countrys youth.
If you have some experience, any information in this regard, if you have ever rescued any child from this drug addiction, if you know of any ways and means to help, if any government official has played a good role, if you give me any such information, I will convey such efforts to the public and together we will try to create an environment in each family that no child ever thinks of choosing this vice out of sheer frustration.
I know I am choosing those topics which put the government in the dock.
But how long will we keep these things hiding
I am mustering the courage to do so because your love inspires me to do so.
And I will continue to do such things because of your love.
Some people told me Modi ji you asked us to send you suggestions on Facebook, twitter or email.
But a large section of the social class does not have access to these facilities, so what can they do.
Your point is very valid.
Everyone does not have this facility.
Well then, if you have something to say related to Mann Ki Baat, that you hear on the radio even in the villages then do write into me on the following addressMann Ki BaatAkashvaniSansad MargNew Delhi. Even if you send some suggestions through letters they will definitely reach me.
And I will take them seriously as active citizens are the biggest asset for development.
You write one letter, it indicates that you are very active.
For my Mann Ki Baat, your mann ki baat sould also reach me.
Maybe you will definitely write a letter.
I will try and interact with you again next month.
I will try, that whenever I talk, it is Sunday, around 11 am.
So I am getting closer to you.
Winters are slowly setting in.
This is a good month for health.
Besides food and clothes it is a good season for health.
Dont let it go waste.
Make the most of it.
My Dear Countrymen, Today is the holy festival of Vijay Dashami.
My heartiest greetings on this occasion of Vijay Dashami to one and all.
I will try my best, if possible, to take out time twice a month or even once to speak with you.
In future, I have also decided that whenever I will speak to you, it would be on Sunday morning at 11am. It would be convenient for you too and I will be content to have shared my thoughts with you.
We are celebrating the festival of Vijaya Dashami today, which is a symbol of victory of Good over Evil.
A gentleman named Ganesh Venkatadari, a native of Mumbai, has sent me a mail writing that we must take a vow to eliminate ten bad habits from within ourselves on the occasion of Vijaya Dashami.
I express my gratitude to him for this suggestion.
For the sake of our nation, I believe all of us should come together and take a vow in getting rid of the dirt and filth from our country. On the occasion of Vijaya Dashami, we must take a vow to eliminate dirt and filth and we can do so.
I had shared one thought yesterday that I will nominate nine people and they need to upload their videos of cleaning the nation on social media websites, and nominating nine more people to do the same.
Whenever we think of Mahatma Gandhi, we are reminded of Khaadi.
You all know that our own scientists have been successful in reaching Mars, with least expenditure.
We do not lack in our strengths, but have forgotten our fortes.
We have forgotten ourselves.
I always remember one of the sayings by Swami Vivekananda Ji as he always used to emphasize on one thought and possibly, he might have shared this thought with many others.
The cub who went with the lioness, was a grown-up now.
He said, What are you doing, brother
You are a lion.
They have brought me up.
Listen to my voice and the way I talk.
He said, Come, I will show you, who you really are.
He took his brother to a well and told him to look in the water his own reflection, and asked him, if both of them had similar faces.
His brothers self-esteem got awakened he attained self-realization through this and even a lion brought up among sheep started roaring like a lion.
His inner soul was awakened.
Swami Vivekananda Ji used to say the same.
My countrymen, 1. 25 crore Indians have infinite strength and capabilities.
We need to understand ourselves.
We need to identify our inner strengths and like Swami Ji always used to say, we need to carry our self-respect, identify ourselves and move forward in life and be successful, which in turn, make our nation a winning and successful country.
I spent two hours with them, and it was the most emotional and inspiring incident in my life.
God has chosen this family to support a specially abled child, but a child is a responsibility of the entire nation.
After this incident, I got so emotionally attached with them, that I started organizing separate Olympics for them in Gujarat.
Thousands of children with their parents used to come and attend, I, too, used to attend the Olympics.
There was an atmosphere of trust and, this is the reason, I liked the suggestion given by Mr. Gautam Pal and felt like sharing it with you.
It reminds me of another story.
If you knew the route, why didnt you tell me before
My countrymen, till the time we do not decide to walk, stand on our own, we will also not get the guidance from others in our journey.
We will not get the people to hold our fingers and help us in walking.
We need to take the initiative in walking and I trust all my 1. 25 crore Indians, who are capable of walking on their own and will keep moving.
For the past few days, I have been getting very interesting suggestions from people.
Some of you have suggested simplifying the registration process for Small Scale Industries.
I will definitely put this under governments notice.
Some of you have written to me to incorporate skills development courses in the school curriculum from 5th standard.
One of the suggestions given was to keep a dustbin at every 100 meters and a putting in place a cleaning system.
Some of you have written to me, to abolish the use of plastic bags.
I am receiving numerous suggestions from people.
I have always been telling you, to write to me and narrate a true incident, which is positive and inspiring to me and our Countrymen, along with the evidence. If you do this, I can promise this to you, that I will share all those heartfelt thoughts or suggestions with all our Countrymen, through Mann ki Baat.
I have only one intention in speaking with you all, Come, let us serve our Mother India.
Let us all take our nation to the new heights.
I will be sharing my heartfelt thoughts with one and all.
Today, I have shared all the thoughts coming directly from my heart.
I will meet you all next at 11 am on Sundays, but I trust our journey shall never end and will continue receiving love and suggestions from you.
After listening to my thoughts, please do not hesitate in sharing your thoughts or advice to me, I will appreciate that your suggestions keep flowing coming.
I am glad to talk with you through this simple medium of Radio, which serves each and every corner of the nation.
I can reach the poorest homes, as mine, my nations strength lies within the hut of Poor, within the villages my nations strength lies with the Mothers, Sisters and Youths
Nation will only progress, if you believe in it.
I am expressing my trust towards the nation.
I believe in your strength, hence, I believe in our nations future.
I begin Mann Ki Baat today with a heavy heart.
10 days ago, Mother India had to bear the loss of many of her valiant sons.
These brave hearts made the supreme sacrifice in securing the lives of a hundred twenty five crore Indians.
In order to ensure that their fellow countrymen could sleep peacefully, these brave sons toiled relentlessly, day or night.
As a consequence of the Pulwama terror attack and the sacrifice of the brave jawans, people across the country are agonized and enraged.
All around, there is a deluge of strong feelings of sympathy for the martyrs their family members.
I respectfully bow to all the brave sons of the country, who laid down their lives, protecting the honour of their motherland, India.
We shall have to take up this challenge facing our country, forgetting all barriers of casteism, communalism, regionalism and other difference, so that, our steps against terror are firmer, stronger and more decisive.
Our armed forces have consistently displayed unparalleled courage and valour.
on the other, they have retaliated in equal measure, in a language the attackers understand.
You must have seen how within a hundred hours of the attack, retributive action was accomplished.
The Army has resolved to wipe out terrorists and their harbourers.
The martyrdom of these brave soldiers brought to the fore, through the media, touching, inspiring stories of their kin, which give hope and strength to the entire country.
The fortitude displayed by Ram Niranjan ji, father of Martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, in this moment of tribulation is truly inspiring.
He has expressed the wish of sending his second son too, to take on the enemy if need be, he himself would go and fight.
The country salutes the indomitable courage of Meena ji, wife of Martyr Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
She has vowed to send her only son to join the CRPF.
When the mortal remains of Martyr Vijay Soren, draped in the tricolor reached Gumla, Jharkhand, his innocent son iterated that he too would join the armed forces.
The mettle of this innocent lad is a representative sample of the feelings of each every child of the Nation today.
Similar sentiments are coming to the fore in the households of our brave heart martyrs.
No martyr, no family is an exception to that.
Whether it be the family of Martyr Vijay Maurya of Devariya, the parents of Martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six year old son of Martyr Hemraj of Kota the story of every family of martyrs is full of inspiration.
I urge the young generation to know and understand the fortitude and the sentiment displayed by these families.
To understand the virtues of patriotism, sacrifice and perseverance, one doesnt need to revert to historical events.
These are but living examples before your eyes... these very examples are a source of inspiration for the future of a rising glowing India.
My dear countrymen, the rather long wait after Independence for a War Memorial is about to be over.
It is natural for our countrymen to be curious about it.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Onkar Shetty ji of Udupi, Karnataka has expressed his happiness on the completion of the National War Memorial.
India not having a National War Memorial used to surprise me, pain me...
a Memorial that would house the valour saga series of our brave soldiers who laid down their lives, safe guarding their nations security.
And I took a resolve that the country must have such a Memorial.
We decided to erect the National War Memorial and I am contented to see it attaining completion in so little a time.
Tomorrow, that is on the 25th of February, crores of we Indians will dedicate this National Soldiers Memorial to our Armed Forces.
On part of the nation, this will be a small step towards repaying a great debt.
This new memorial has been instituted in the heart of Delhi, in close vicinity of India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I do believe that for our countrymen a visit to the National War Memorial will be akin to a pilgrimage to a holy place.
The National Soldiers Memorial is a symbol of the nations gratitude to those men who made the supreme sacrifice after we gained Independence.
The Memorials design symbolises the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The concept of the National Soldiers Memorial is based on the notion of four concentric circles, which depicts the journey of a soldier from coming into being, culminating in his martyrdom.
The flame of the Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier.
The second circle, Veerta Chakra, depicts the courage and bravery of our soldiers.
It is a gallery whose walls are inscribed with soldiers tales of valour.
This is followed by the Tyag Chakra. This circle stands for the sacrifice of our soldiers.
This bears the names of soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice, in letters of gold.
Following that is the Rakshak Chakra which depicts the spirit of security.
This circle houses a row of dense trees.
These trees represent soldiers and send a reassuring message to the countrys citizens that our soldiers vigilantly guard borders round the clock and that they, the citizens are safe.
If you take a holistic view, the National Soldiers Memorial is sure to turn out to be a sacred site, where people will throng, to get information on our great martyrs, to express their gratitude, to conduct further research on them.
This place stands testimony to a series of sacrifices of men who laid down their lives for the sake of their country, so that we could live, so that the country could be safe secure, paving the way for development.
One falls short of words in assessing the enormous contribution of our Armed Forces, Police and Para Military Forces in the strides of progress achieved by the country.
In the month of October last year, I was blessed with the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
That too echoed the same sentiment, and we believe that we should be ever grateful to those policemen police women, who relentlessly ensure our safety security.
I do hope that you will pay a visit to the National Soldiers Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you are there, do capture images and share them on social media so that others get inspired to come visit this sacred site with eagerness.
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, I keep getting thousands of letters and comments from your side, on various platforms.
Once while I was going through your comments, I came across an interesting point by Atish Mukhopadhyay ji.
He has written that on the 3rd of March, 1900, the British arrested Birsa Munda, when he was just 25 years old. Coincidentally, the 3rd of March is also the birth anniversary of Jamsetji Tata.
He further states that despite both personalities hailing from diverse family backgrounds, they enriched the legacy and the history of Jharkhand.
Paying tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamsetji Tata is, in a way, salutation to the glorious legacy and history of Jharkhand.
These two distinguished personalities brought glory honour not just to Jharkhand, but the entire country.
The country is indeed grateful for their contribution.
Today, if an inspiring personality is required for ably guiding our youth, it certainly is that of Bhagwan Birsa Munda.
The British tree treacherously arrested him when he was asleep, in a covert manner.
Do you know why they had to resort to such a cowardly operation
Because even the British who raised a mighty empire used to be terrified of him.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda took on the might of the guns cannons of the British, using traditional bows and arrows, to shake them apart.
The fact is, when people are blessed with exemplary leadership, the might of arms pales in comparison to the collective will power of the people.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda not only waged a struggle against the British for political freedom he also actively fought for the social economic rights of the tribal folk.
And he accomplished all this in his rather short life.
He let sunshine peep into the darkened lives of the deprived and the oppressed.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the tender age of twenty five.
Illustrious sons of Mother India, such as Birsa Munda have come into being in each every part of the country.
There mustve been hardly any part of India, which did not produce someone who contributed in the long freedom struggle, that spanned centuries.
But its a misfortune that these tales of valour and sacrifice did not reach the new generations.
If the valourous Bhagwan Birsa Munda made us aware of our existence identity, far-sighted Jamsetji Tata created great institutions for the country.
Jamsetji Tata was a true visionary, who not only foresaw Indias future, but also duly laid strong foundations.
He knew very well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry was imperative for her future.
Not just that, he also established world renowned institutions and industries such as Tata Steel.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was born on the 29th of February.
All of you know that this day comes just once in four years.
A simple, peace loving personality, Morarji bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders.
In Independent India, the record of presenting the budget the maximum number of times is held by Morarji bhai Desai.
Morarji Desai steered the course of the country through some difficult times, when the very democratic fabric of the country was under a threat.
To save democracy, Morarji Desai flung himself in the movement against imposition of Emergency.
For this, he had to pay a heavy price in his old age.
The government of that time arrested and incarcerated him.
But when the Janata Party won the general elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his tenure, the 44th constitutional amendment was introduced.
This was important because the 42nd amendment which was brought during the emergency, curtailed the powers of the Supreme Court and implemented provisions which stood to violate our democratic values, was struck down.
The 44th amendment, made it mandatory that the proceedings of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies were made public through the newspapers.
This amendment, restored certain powers of Supreme Court and declared that the fundamental rights granted under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution could not be abrogated during the Emergency.
For the first time constitutional safeguards guaranteed that the President could only announce the emergency upon the written recommendation of the Cabinet, and that the period of emergency could not be extended more than six months at any stretch of time.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the way democracy was assassinated in 1975 by imposition of emergency, could never be repeated again in the future.
The upcoming generations of our nation will always remember his priceless contribution in maintaining the sanctity of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my homage to a great leader like him.
My beloved countrymen, this year too, there was a great buzz about the Padma award.
Today as we head towards a new India, in which we want to honour those who are doing their work at the grass-root level without any care for a reward.
They, by their diligence, are powering positive changes in the lives of others in myriad ways.
In reality they are true Karmyogis, who are selflessly engaged in public service, social service and, above all, in the service to the nation.
You must have been a witness yourself to the curiosity in the air when the Padma awards are announced, and people are inquisitive about the awardees.
In a way, I consider this to be a huge pat on the back because these are people who are not on the front page of a Magazine or Newspaper or on our TV screens.
They are far removed from the world of glitter and glare, and are people who do not care about name or fame but simply believe in toiling at the proletarian level.
They believe in living in the manner as preached by the shloka of Srimadbhagvad Gita 'Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', or excellence in action is yoga.
I would like to tell you about some of these people.
You must have heard about Odisha's Daitari Nayak, who is not nicknamed the 'Canal Man of Odisha' for nothing, Daitari Nayak chiselled through the mountain literally with his hands and carved a three kilometers long canal in his village, and put to rest forever the problem of irrigation and water by the sheer dint of his labour.
Take the case of Abdul Ghafoor Khatri of Gujarat, who has done an amazing job of reviving the traditional Rogan painting form of Kutch.
He is doing a great job of extending this rare painting art form to the present generation.
I had gifted a Rogan painting titled 'Tree of Life' done by Abdul Gafoor, to the former President of USA, Mr. Barack Obama.
Among the recipients of the Padma award, Shabbir Sayyed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gau-Mata.
The manner he has spent his entire life in the service of Gau-mata, is unique in itself.
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who at first tried to empower the downtrodden and the exploited through the Kalanjiyam movement in Tamil Nadu and initiated community based micro financing.
Even at the age of 100, she is training yoga to people from all over the world and till now has trained 1500 as yoga teachers.
Jamuna Tudu, famous nicknamed 'Lady Tarzan' in Jharkhand, most valiantly took on the Timber Mafia and Naxalites, and not only saved the 50 hectares of forest but also inspired ten thousand women to unite and protect the trees and wildlife.
It is a tribute to Jamuna ji's diligence that today, on the birth of every child, villagers plant 18 trees. Also, 10 trees are planted on the marriage of a girl in the village.
The story of Muktaben Pankajkumar Dagali of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration despite being a divyang herself, it is difficult to find an example than what Muktaben did for the upliftment of divyang women by establishing the institution named Chakshu Mahila Sevakunj, through the medium of which she has been engaged in a virtuous endeavour to make visually challenged children self-reliant.
Farmer Aunty of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, or Rajkumari Devi is very inspiring.
She has established a precedent in the direction of women empowerment and farming.
Rajkumari Devi added 300 women of her area to a 'Self Help Group' and motivated the entire lot become financially self-reliant.
She not only trained the women of the village in pursuing other gainful means of employment, but most importantly she integrated technology with agriculture and my dear countrymen, it has perhaps happened for the first time, that in the roll of Padma awards bestowed this year, 12 farmers have been the recipients.
Generally, very few people associated with the agricultural world or those very few who can be labeled as real farmers have ever found their name in the list of Padmashree awards.
This in itself presents the live and vibrant image of a changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I wish to narrate a heart rending experience with you which Ive been wanting to do past few days.
At present, whenever Im touring, it is my sincere effort to meet people beneficiaries of PMJAY scheme under Ayushman Bharats umbrella.
PMJAY means to some of the beneficiaries, like the single mother whose unable to set her small children treated due to lack of money or the head of the family who was sustaining his family by the sweat of his brow and met with an accident and was unable to work, he too has benefitted due to this scheme, regained his health and is virtually living a new life
Brothers and Sisters, about 12 lakh impoverished families have benefitted from this scheme over a period of last five months.
I have found that it brings about a transformation in the life of the have-nots.
If you know a poor person who is unable to procure treatment due to lack of money, do inform him about this scheme.
In the next few weeks various education boards across the country will initiate the process for the board examinations of the tenth and twelfth standards.
My best wishes to all the students whore going to appear for their examinations, their parents and all the teachers as well.
A few weeks ago, an immense event entitled 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' was organised in Delhi in the format of a Town Hall programme.
One of the focal points of 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' was that there were lively interactions on various topics related with the entire process of examinations.
There are many such aspects which emerged out of these discussions which are definitely going to be beneficial for the students.
All the students, their teachers and parents can watch the recording of this entire event on YouTube, and I take this opportunity to wish all the best to all my exam warriors, for their upcoming examinations.
My dear countrymen, no mention of India can be complete without citing its festivals.
It is just not possible that a day passes without any significance associated with it, or does not herald a festival
Our culture has a continuum spread over many millennia and it is a part of our heritage.
In a few days from now, Mahashivrartri will be celebrated, and that too on a Monday, and when a Shivratri falls on a Monday, it becomes all that special in our heart of our hearts
Many topics were discussed in their company and their confidence was really striking it was inspiring.
During the conversation with one of them, a visually challenged young man, and he mentioned that he happened to be a stage artist, and specialized in mimicry during entertainment programs, so just like that I asked him as to who all he could imitate
And he told me that he could mimic the Prime Minister.
So I requested a demonstration and a pleasant surprise was in store for me. He mimicked the very exact way I converse with you during Mann Ki Baat.
I was very happy to hear that people not only listen to Mann KI Baat but also remember it on many occasions.
I was really impressed with the prowess of that divyang young man.
My dear countrymen, connecting with all of you, courtesy the Mann Ki Baat program has been a really wonderful experience for me.
Through radio I connect every month with millions of families.
Many times while conversing with you, reading your letters or listening to your thoughts sent on the phone, I feel that you have adopted me as part of your family.
This has been a very sublime experience for me.
Friends, elections are the biggest celebration of democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy in the hurly-burly of the general elections.
I myself will also be a candidate during this election.
In maintaining respect for healthy democratic traditions, the next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be broadcast on the last Sunday of the month of May.
This means I shall take up our thoughts and ideas accumulated over the three months of March, April entire May after the Elections, with confidence anew. With the power of your blessings, once again I shall begin this series of conversations through Mann Ki Baat...
Once again, I thank all of you from the core of my heart.
Shri Shri Shri ShivaKumar Swamiji of District Tumukur, Karnataka was no more.
ShivaKumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to Social Service.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us, Kayakave Kailas meaning discahrging ones duties with due dilligence and persevereance is akin to being in the abode of Lord Shiva ie Kailasha Dham.
He was renowned to be a masterly scholar of languages such as English, Sanskrit and Kannada.
He was a social reformer.
He dedicated his life in ensuring that food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge reached out to people.
The welfare of farmers was a priority in his life.
The Siddhganga Mutt regularily used to organise cattle and agricultural fairs.
I have had the fortunate opportunity to be blessed by Swamiji, many a time.
In the year 2007 on the occasion of the Centenary celebration of Sri Sri Sri Shivakumar Swamiji our former President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam had paid a visit to Tumukur.
On this occasion Kalam Saheb had recited a poem dedicated to revered Swamiji.
Kalam Sahebs poem potrays the life of Shri Shri Shri Shivakumar Swamiji and the mission of the Siddhganga Mutt beautifully.
Once again, I pay tribute to this great man.
The 25th of January was the Formation Day of the Election Commission, which is celebrated now as the National Voters Day.
The scale at which elections are held in India is a matter of great awe for the World. It is natural for every Citizen to feel proud of the Election Commission of its meticulous organising abilities.
Our Country leaves, no stone unturned to ensure that every citizen of India who is a registered voter, rightfully avails of the opportunity to cast his vote.
These facts are bound to instil a sense of pride, of the commitment of the Election Commission.
Caring for that lone voter, for ensuring that he or she enjoys full opportunity to exercise the right to vote, personnel of Election Commission travel to distant remote places to make necessary arrangements for the voting. This is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for relentlessly striving to ensure the strengthening of our democracy.
I hold in high esteem, the Election Commissions of all states, security personnel and other staff members who contribute in ensuring strict adherence to free and fair polling.
This year, our Country will undergo Lok Sabha elections. The first time ever, young persons born in the 21st Century will exercise their Right to Vote in the Lok Sabha Elections.
They face the opportunity to shoulder responsibilities pertaining to the Country.
They have embarked upon the journey of being partners in Nation building.
The time has come for a confluence of individual dreams and the Nations dream.
I urge the young generation to register themselves as voters, if they are eligible.
Simultaneously, the sentiment that voting is our sacred duty, should grow within us naturally.
For any reason, if one is not able to vote, it should pain one.
One should be saddened to witness any wrong taking place in the country.
I urge eminent people of the country to come forward and jointly contribute in campaigning for spreading awareness on voter registration and casting ones vote on the day of polling.
I sincerely hope that large numbers of eligible young people will get themselves registered as voters, thus forging a partnership in the quest to further strengthen our democracy.
My Dear Countrymen,This great land, India, has given birth to innumerable great men, men whose deeds for the sake for humanity have been extraordinary, truly unforgettable.
Our country is Bahuratna vasundhara .
On the 23rd of January, the country celebrated the birth anniversary of Netaji in an uncommon, special manner.
On this occasion I was fortunate to get an opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to heroes who fought in Indias freedom struggle.
You may be aware of the fact that inside Red Fort, many chambers and structures lay locked unused for several decades after Independence.
Those very chambers have now been turned into exquisite museums.
A museum dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army
Every inch, every brick of these museums is redolent with the fragrance of our glorious history.
Tales of valour of the heroes of our freedom struggle emanating from every nook corner of these museums inspire us to delve deeper into our history.
Prem Sehgal, Col. Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan had to face a trial under British Rule.
On my visit to Kranti Mandir, Red Fort, as I was reflecting on memories of Netaji, his family members gifted me a special cap.
There was a time when Netaji used to wear it.
I dedicated that cap to the museum itself, for visitors to see and be inspired with the spirit of patriotism.
The fact is, stories of the valour and patriotism of our heroes should be told and re-told to our newer generations in ways more than one.
Just a month ago, on the 30th of December, I had gone to Andaman Nicobar islands.
At an event, our tricolour was unfurled at the very site where Netaji Subhash Bose had unfurled it exactly 75 years ago.
In a similar manner, when the tricolour was hoisted at the Red Fort in October 2018, it surprised everyone, since conventionally, this is done on the 15th of August.
The occasion was the completion of 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and adept organiser
a valiant fighter who played a significant role in our Freedom Struggle.
Through his clarion calls Dilli Chalo, Tum mujhe Khoon do, main tumhe azadi doonga, Netaji secured a special place in every Indians heart.
That files associated with Netaji be declassified has been a long standing demand for years. And I am happy that we could manage to do the same.
I remember the day when Netajis family paid a visit to the Prime Ministers residence.
We dwelt at length on myriad facets of Netaji Subhash Bose, offering him tributes.
It gladdens me to see many places associated with illustrious sons of India being developed in Delhi.
Be it 26, Alipur Road, associated with Babasaheb Ambedkar, or the Sardar Patel museum or the Kranti Mandir
Whenever you come to Delhi, you must pay a visit to these places.
My dear countrymen, today as we refer to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, that too in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share with you an incident from Netajis life.
I have always considered Radio as an effective means of connecting with people. Similarly, Netaji shared a deep bond with the medium of Radio and he chose this very medium to converse with countrymen.
I am told this radio station also used to broadcast weekly news bulletins in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangla, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto Urdu languages.
Programmes broadcast over Azad Hind Radio were very popular amongst the populace. Their programmes were a major source of inspiration strength to our freedom fighters.
In this very Kranti Mandir, a visual arts museum has been established.
Indias art culture has been portrayed here in a very attractive way.
The museum has 4 historical exhibitions which display more than 450 paintings and artworks which are of three centuries vintage.
Exquisite works of great artists such as Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Verma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Roy, Sailoz Mukherjee have been exhibited.
And I also specially request you to visit the place and see for yourself the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji.
Now you must be thinking that we are discussing art and here Im talking about seeing Gurudev Tagore's excellent works of art.
You have probably known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore till date as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
And the most unique aspect was that Gurudev Tagore did not ascribe any name to most of his works.
He believed that the person seeing his painting should comprehend the painting in totality, from his own perspective, understand the message imparted by him in the particularpainting.
His paintings have been on display in European countries, in Russia and in America.
I hope you will go and see his paintings in the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is a land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed the message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and deeds.
One such Saint was - Sant Ravidas.
On 19th February we will observe Ravidas Jayanti.
The couplets or dohas of Sant Ravidas ji are very well-known.
Sant Ravidas used to convey a profound message through the few lines of his couplet or doha.
He had said- , , Which would translate something like this that if you were to peel the stem of the banana tree, there appear leaves underneath which form the psuedostem, one can go peeling the leaves forming the stem till there isnt any tree left at all Similarly man has been divided into castes and the human in him has disappeared.
Sant Ravidas proposed that if God was present in every human being, then it was not fair to categorize him on the basis of caste, creed and other sociological demarcations.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy city of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and the worker throughout his life via his messages.
It would not be wrong to say that he has illustrated to the entire world the real meaning of dignity of labour.
He would say - That is, if your heart is pure, then the Absolute master resides within your heart.
Sant Ravidas ji has influenced people cutting across every segment and class of the social milieu whether it was the Maharana of Chittor or his ueen or Meerabai, everyone was his follower were followers.
I once again bow in reverence to Sant Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on MyGov that I should highlight the aspects of India's space program and its future.
He also wants me to request the students to take interest in the space programs and to think out of the box and inspire them to go beyond the frontiers of the sky- Kiran ji, I appreciate your thoughts and especially the message being imparted to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad, where I got the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Our space program has been possible due to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We take pride in the fact that the satellites developed by our students and Sounding Rockets have reached space.
On 24th January 'KALAM SAT' fashioned by our students had been launched.
The Sounding Rockets made by Odisha university students have also created many records.
The number of successful space missions attempted since the country's independence till 2014 have been equal to those successfully completed in the past four years.
We have also created a world record for launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft.
We will soon register Indias presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 campaign.
Our country is also using Space Technology in devices employed in saving assets and life.
Whether it is cyclone, or rail and road safety, all of these safety measures are being augmented by Space Technology.
Among our fishermen, NAVIC devices are being distributed, which contribute in their economic development as well as ensure their safety.
We are using Space Technology to improve delivery and accountability of government services.
"Housing for all" or the "House for everyone" scheme involves geo-tagging of about 40 lakh homes spread over 23 states.
Along with this scheme, about thirty and a half million properties under MNREGA have also been tagged.
Today our satellites are a symbol of the country's growing might.
It has contributed a great deal in fostering better relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has also gifted hues of development to our neighbouring Allies.
Through its highly competitive launch services, India today not only propels satellites of developing countries but also those of developed nations.
The sky and stars have always enthralled children.
Our Space Program provides an impetus to the children to think big and reach across those boundaries, which were considered impossible till today.
It is a vision to inspire the children to discover new stars, while gazing at them
My dear countrymen, I always say, those who play, also bloom and this time, many young players making their debut have bloomed in Khelo-India.
In January about 6,000 players participated in 18 disciplines in the Khelo India Youth Games held in Pune.
only when our base will be strong, then only our youth will be able to perform their best in the country and across the world. When the player performs his best at the local level,only then, he also shines globally.
This time in 'Khelo India', participants from every state have performed well at their individual level.
The life of many a medal winner is also immensely inspiring.
They live in a parking shed with their family.
The captain of Maharashtra Under-21 Women's Kabaddi team, Sonali Helvi is from Satara.
She lost her father at a very young age, and her brother and mother encouraged the talent and skills of Sonali.
It is often seen that girls are not encouraged much to participate in sports such as Kabaddi.
In spite of the hurdles, Sonali not only chose Kabaddi but excelled in this discipline.
10-year-old Abhinav Shaw hailing from Asansol is the youngest gold medallist in the Khelo India Games.
A farmer's daughter, Akshaya Basavani Kamat, from Karnataka won a gold medal in weightlifting.
She credited her victory to her father, a farmer in Belgaum.
When we talk about the creation of a New India, then determination exhibited by our youth is the veritable example of what is New India
These inspiring stories from the annals of Khelo India, are ample proof , that the building of New India does not only involve contribution from the denizens of big cities but also from the youth, children, young sports talents, hailing from small cities, towns and villages.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about many a prestigious beauty contest.
But have you heard about the Shining Toilet contest
Over the past month, more than 50 lakh toilets have participated in this unique contest.
The name of this unique contest is "Clean beautiful Toilet".
People are making their toilets clean and colourful, by having them painted and other rennovations, you will find lots of photos of such toilets participating in the "Clean beautiful Toilet" contest spread from Kanya Kumari to Kutchh till Kamrup on social media.
I appeal to all the Sarpanchs and village heads to take a lead in this campaign in their respective Panchayats.
And do share your "clean beautiful toilet" photos with me on MylzzatGhar on social media.
Friends together, on October 2, 2014, we had embarked on a memorable journey together to clean our country and to get rid of open defecation.
Due to the unequivocal support from the people of India, today India is moving towards liberation from defecation in the open much prior to October 2, 2019, so that we may pay our homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
In this memorable journey of clean India, listeners have also contributed a lot to the Mann Ki Baat' forum and that is why Im happy to share the fact that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and 600 districts have declared themselves free of open defecation and sanitation coverage has crossed 98 limit in rural India whereas latrines have been provided to nearly nine crore households.
My younger friends, the days of examinations are approaching .
Anshul Sharma, resident of Himachal Pradesh has written on MyGov that I should talk about examinations and Exam Warriors.
Anshul ji, I thank you for raising this issue.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is Exam Season.
Students, their parents and teachers, all are engaged in tasks related to examinations.
I wish all the students, their parents and teachers all the best.
I would have liked to discuss this topic at length in Mann Ki Baat of today, but you will be happy to know that just after a gap of two days ,on January 29, at 11 am, in the 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' program, I am going to interact with students from all over the country, and this time, along with the students, their parents and teachers are also going to be part of this program.
And this time, students from other countries will also participate.
In this 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' program, I will touch upon a lot of things related to all the facets of examinations with my young friends, especially on the topic of stress free exams.
I had urged people to send me thir inputs and ideas with regard to this programme
and I am very happy that a large number of people are sharing their thoughts on MyGov.
Some of these ideas and suggestions I will definitely put in front of you during the Town Hall program.
You must also try to become a part of this program . and through social media and Namo App, you can also see its live telecast.
My dear countrymen 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11am the whole country pays homage to the martyrs.
Wherever we are, we must pay two minutes tribute to our martyrs.
Remember our revered Bapu and take a vow to fulfill the dreams of Pujya Bapu, to build a new India, and to fulfill our duties as a citizen let us move forward with this resolution.
Let us ensure this journey of 2019 remains successful.
Many many felicitations and thanks to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
It was here, That he had displayed a great deal of determination for justice
At times a question arises in the minds of peoples as to what I achieved through Mann Ki Baat. I would like to say today that of the feedback of this programme, one of the points that touches my heart most- is when people tell me that when we sit with all our family members to listen to Mann Ki Baat, we feel that the head of our family is sitting with us and sharing his ideas with us. When I heard this comment in a larger circle, I felt satisfied to know that I am yours, I am one amongst you, I am with you, you elevated me and in a way, and in this way I will continue to remain connected with you as a family member through Man Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
Just as a sea is formed by collection of tiny drops, similarly,a small constructive step, plays a vital role in creating a positive environment. My dear countrymen, it has been told in our epics:- : , , : : : It means- O, Lord, peace should prevail all around in all three Lokas,in water, in air, in space, in fire, in wind, in medicines, in vegetation, in gardens, in sub conscious, in the whole creation. Grant peace to each soul, each heart, in me, in you, in every particle and everywhere in the Universe.
