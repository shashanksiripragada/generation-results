Mann Ki Baat October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaste.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Diwali and my best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion of Diwali.
In the vibrancy of Destruction, in the Diziotin Monastery.
What a beautiful message.
Today, Diwali is celebrated in different countries of the world.
In particular, it is not just the participation of Indians in this festival, but the government of many countries, citizens and social organizations of that country celebrate the festival of Diwali with joy.
A similar India is built there.
Friends, Festivals have a different attraction in the world.
Our India is a country of festivals. There is a huge opportunity for festivals.
We should try to celebrate Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and also involve people from other states and other countries.
We have so many festivals in every state and every region - people of other countries are interested in these festivals.
This is the reason why Indians living outside the country are very important for the development of festive tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had decided to do something different on this occasion of Diwali.
I had said - Come, let us celebrate the strength of Indian women and their achievements in this Diwali - that is, the honour of Lakshmi of India.
Immediately after seeing this, there is a crowd of countless inspiring stories on the social media.
Ramesh from Warrangal, has written My Mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took charge of five sons.
Today we are five brothers in good livelihood.
My mother is my God.
I see everything, she is Lakshmi of India.
Ramesh, I salute your mother.
uoting an active Geetika Swami on Twitter, Major Khusbu Kair is Lakshmi of India, who is the daughter of a bus conductor and led the women force of Assam Rifles.
His daughter, Lakshmi of India, is also a powerful poet to Tiwari.
He's proud that his daughter paints a fine picture, and holds a good place in the Clutter's exam.
On the other hand, Megha Jain has written that a 92 year old woman has been donating water to passengers at Gwalior Railway Station for many years.
Megha Ji, this Lakshmi of India is very inspired by the humble nature and compassion of Lakshmi.
Many of these stories have been shared by people.
You must read, take inspiration and share some of the things around you.
I salute all these Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the famous twentieth century female poet, Sachin Hannamma, wrote a poem in Kannada in the 17th century.
It is the same feeling that all the Lakshmis of India, whom we refer to, probably lived in the 17th century.
How beautiful words and how beautiful words have been expressed and how high thoughts are the poems of Kannada language - Peninida, Permagandanu Himavatanu, Penininda, Bhrigu Perchidananda, Jankaraayanu Jashdanu, Himambattu, That is, the mountain king for his daughter Parvati, Rishi Bhrigu was famous for his daughter Lakshmi and Janak for her daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride and these daughters have a strong identity and a bright future for our society.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Dev Ji is not only in India but all over the world.
In many countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters, who have dedicated their lives completely with the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I can never forget the journey of my gurus in Vancouver and Tehran.
There are so many things about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji that I can share with you, but for this, it will take a lot of time for Mann Ki Baat.
He has always placed service on top of all.
Guru Nanak Devji believed that selfless service is precious.
He fought firmly against the social curses like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Jis message has reached the farthest corners of the world.
He was one of the most visitors of his time.
He had visited many places and had won the hearts of all through his simplicity, humility and purity.
Guru Nanak Devji had travelled a lot in important religious places.
It is said that the famous saint of Assam, Sankardev was also inspired by his ideals.
He also travelled on the holy land of Haridwar.
During his departure to Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water scarcity there.
Badre, Guru Nanak Dev Ji is a famous place called Guru Nanak Jirah Sahib which reminds us of him.
During one Udasi period, Guru Nanak ji travelled north to Kashmir and nearby places.
This established a strong bond between the Sikh faith and the Kashmiri community.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji went to Tibet and there also he was recognized as Guru.
He also traveled to Uzbekistan and is revered there.
On the one hand, he travelled extensively in Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He lives in the hearts of lakhs of people, who have followed his teachings with full respect and still continue to do so.
And this journey was organized to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
There, all the Ambassadors had the opportunity to visit the Golden Temple as well as to know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
He was a great hero who united the country.
Just as Sardar Patel had the amazing ability to unite people, he was able to coordinate with those who showed a difference of opinion.
Sardar Patel was also a keen observer and examiner.
He was a man of detail in its real sense.
He was also a specialist in organizational skills.
He was also a master at planning and designing strategies.
When you read or hear about Sardar Saheb's work, you will find out how wonderful was the planning process.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from across the country were present to attend the Ahmedabad session of Congress.
He assured them that no one will ever suffer from the water crisis.
He also interacted with the farmers and urged them to prepare Khadi bags.
Again, for this, the sale of Khadi also increased significantly.
The country will always remain grateful to Sardar Patel for his significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
He does an important work to ensure our basic rights , so that there is no possibility of discrimination on the basis of caste or community .
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had done the historical and important work of uniting the parts of this country and the states.
There was a special feature of SardarVallabhbhai Patel that he had no eyes on anything, he had no eyes on anything.
On the one hand, his focus was on Hyderabad, Junagadh and other states.
Just as Lakshadweep of the far south has not disappeared .
Indeed, when we mention Sardar Patel's efforts, we discussed his role only in certain regions of the country.
Like Lakshadweep also he played an important role in this .
As soon as the news came to light, Sardar Patel took quick steps without delay.
He had sent the directions of the brother of Mudaliar , architect Ramsammi Mudaliar and architect Laxman Swami Mudaliar to take along with the residents of Travankor and hoist the national flag there immediately .
On the basis of his instruction a straight wave runs , and on the Lakshadweep administration will be able to defeat their neighbors .
After the incident, Sardar Patel asked the brothers and sisters of Mudaliar to personally ensure that all assistance is provided for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today Lakshadweep is making a very important contribution in the progress of India.
This is an attractive tourist spot and an attractive tourist spot .
I hope you will visit this beautiful island and their beaches.
My dear countrymen, on the day of October 31, 2018, the Statue of Unity, built in the memory of Sardar Saheb, was dedicated to the entire country and the world.
This is the longest human statue in the world.
It's twice as long as the Statue of Liberty of America.
The longest statue of the world hypnotises the heart of every Indian -LRB- as an Indian -RRB- .
The head of every Indian gets lifted up in self confidence .
You will be happy to know that in one year 26 lakh tourists had come to see the Statue of Unity .
That is, on an average 8500 people have paid their respects to the Statue of Unity.
For Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel the faith and devotion of his heart had been expressed .
Now several centres of attraction like Cactus Garden , Butterfly Garden , Jungle Safari , Child Nutrition Park , Ekta Nursery are constantly being developed and local economy is improving and people are also getting new employment opportunities.
Professional training is also being provided for hosting facilities at home or at home.
The local people have now started the cultivation of Dragon fruit and I am confident that this will be the main way of earning their livelihood.
Friends, For the country, for every state, for the tourism industry, this Statue of Unity is a subject of study.
How we can become a witness to this that in one year a place can become a world famous tourist spot where people from within country and abroad come .
Transport system, accommodation, guides, eco-friendly systems - each one of them is getting better.
A lot of economic development has begun and the tourists are developing the services of local people as per their needs .
The government is also fulfilling its responsibilities.
Friends , there is such an Indian , who will not be proud to know that a few days back Time magazine has included this Statue of Unity in the top hundred tourist places of the world .
I hope you all go out to see this Statue of Unity with some inspiration from your valuable time but I wish that every Indian , who leaves for tour , goes out with his family to visit at least 15 destinations in the country and lodges there .
Friends, You are aware that every year since 2014, the 31st of October is celebrated as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas.
This day gives a message of unity, integrity and security to our country at any cost.
This time too, 'Run for Unity' will be organised.
This will involve all sections of the society.
Run, both mind and body are beneficial.
I hope that all of you will take part in the 31st of October - the unity of the country and to keep your body healthy.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel integrated the country towards unity.
This mantra of unity is the strength of our life and in a country as diverse as India, one should try to strengthen the mantra of unity at every level, in every field and in every field.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been active and vigilant to strengthen the unity and integrity of the country.
There are many examples around us who are working with this mission.
But sometimes their words are very fast in our memory.
Friends, I remember that September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court gave the verdict on Ram Janm Bhoomi.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the former Prime Minister of our country Smt. Indira Devi was also killed on this day.
My dear countrymen, today, if there is a saying in every house, in every village, from the East to the West, from the North to the South, in every corner of India, then it is cleanliness.
I would like to tell every person, every family, every village to have a pleasant experience of cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is the collective effort of 1.25 billion Indians.
This is the result of the efforts of 1.25 billion Indians.
But there is also a pleasant and exciting experience.
I have heard and I want to hear you too.
In such a difficult situation, being so hostile, is not less heroic.
In such a scenario, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the country's borders with bravery and valour, but they are also conducting a clean Siachen campaign.
There's nothing so cold out there.
In such a situation, de-silting of garbage and arranging for it is an important task.
We all know that Siachen is such a glacier, the source of river and pure water.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is aimed at ensuring clean water for the people living in low lying areas, using the water of rivers like Nubra and Siok.
My dear countrymen, festivals are such a festival that instills a new consciousness in everyone's lives.
And especially in Deepavali, some new purchases are made especially in every family.
I once said we tried to buy local.
If we find the necessary things in our village then we dont have to go to the fund.
If I get it, I don't need to go to the district.
The more we try to buy local, the more Gandhi 150, you will become a grand festival.
And I always pray that we do not touch our wrists, we should buy something that is made by our Khadi workers.
In this Diwali too, even before Diwali, many people have bought a lot, but there are many people who think that if they come after Diwali then things may be cheap.
So there's a lot of people who still have to buy.
Therefore, as I wish you all the very best in Deepavali, I appeal to you all that you please come forward and buy local products.
Look, can we also play an important role in making Mahatma Gandhi's dream come true.
I once again convey my best wishes to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
Like everyone in Deepavali, we use bet.
But there is a lot of fire in the absence of caution.
Sometimes he's hurt.
I request you all to be careful and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
I wish you all the best.
Thank you so much.
What is it, September 2018?
Is there any Indian who doesnt feel proud of our armed forces or our army soldiers
Yesterday, 1.25 billion people of the country celebrated the Parakram Parv.
We remember that the 2016 Surgical Strike carried out when our forces gave a befitting reply to the perpetrators of the terror attack in our country.
Our armed forces organised exhibitions in different parts of the country so that the young generation of the lion population, especially the youth of the country could feel our strength, how capable we are and how our soldiers risk their lives to protect the nation.
On the occasion of Parakram Parv, the Prime Minister said that our Armed Forces have a glorious tradition for the youth of the country.
It inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme at Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of the brave warriors.
It is certain that our soldiers will give a befitting reply to all those who want to destroy the atmosphere of peace and prosperity in our country.
But, with respect, it is not difficult to get rid of the country's sovereignty.
India is always committed to upholding peace.
In the two World Wars of the 20th century, more than a lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace. This was a war with which we had no relation.
Our vision never fell on the land of any other country.
It was our commitment to peace.
A few days ago, on 23 September, on the occasion of the centenary of the Battle of Haifa in Israel, we remembered the brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad Jodhpur Lancer who freed Haifa from the clutches of invaders.
This was also the valour shown by our soldiers for the cause of peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest number of soldiers deployed in UN Peace Keeping Forces.
For decades, our brave soldiers dressed in blue helmets have been playing an important role in shaping the peace process in the entire world.
My dear countrymen, our wind power is not comparable.
The most interesting part of the Republic Day Parade is the Fly Past, which showcases the incredible skills and strengths of our Air Force.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
When the Pakistani invaders started attacking in 1947, the Air Force ensured that the Indian Army and the ceasefire reached the battlefield at the right time to protect Srinagar from the invaders.
Even in the 1965 war, the Air Force responded to the enemy.
In 1971, who doesn't know about the release of Bangladesh?
In 1999, the Air Force played a pivotal role in liberating Kargil from intruders.
The Air Force carried out a continuous bombardment at the base of the enemy in Tiger Hill.
The entire nation is grateful to them for their commendable role in relief and rescue operations and in disaster management.
Air Force contribution is exemplary in dealing with natural disasters like storms, storms, floods, etc. and helping the countrymen.
In order to ensure gender equality in the country, the Air Force has set an example and has opened the doors of every department to the daughters of the country.
Now, the Air Force is giving women the opportunity to choose the option of the Permanent Commission along with the Short Service Commission which I had announced on 15th August this year from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
India can proudly say that in the Indian Armed Forces, there is not only man power but the contribution of women is also increasing day by day.
The entire country was worried about how to save him.
You must be aware that AbhilashTomy of the Navy is a brave, courageous and heroic soldier.
Abhilasha is the first Indian to travel the world with a small boat, without any modern technology.
He was in the midst of a terrible sea storm when he was moving fast after participating in the Golden Globe Race in the South of the Indian Ocean for 80 days.
He told me of his resolve to do something such a brave thing in spite of such a great danger.
I pray for the speedy recovery of Tomy and hope that his courage, bravery and resolve in this fight will inspire the youth of our country.
My dear countrymen, on the 2nd of October, the children too know the importance of the day.
This year, there is a special significance for this day.
We are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi over the next two years.
Today, the thoughts and ideas of Mahatma Gandhi have reached the world.
Everyone like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or Nelson Mandela derived strength from Gandhijis ideology to fight for the rights and dignity of the tribe.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I want to discuss with you another important work of Pujya Bapu, which all the countrymen need to know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi began to define some ideas as a constructive program.
Later, in 1945, when the freedom struggle became strong, Gandhi ji prepared a revised copy of his ideas.
Pujya Bapu presented his ideas to the people of the country on various issues like protecting the rights of the farmers, the villagers and the workers, cleanliness, education etc., which are also called Gandhi Charter.
Pujya Bapu was a peoples association.
Bapu's specialty of connecting people with people is his nature.
This is the most precious feature of Mahatma Gandhis personality.
He made the countrymen realize that they are important and essential for the development of the country.
He made this achievement a mass movement which was his greatest contribution to the freedom struggle.
In the freedom struggle, at the call of Mahatma Gandhi, people from all walks of life, from all walks of life, had sacrificed their lives.
Bapu gave us an inspiring mantra, which we know as 'Gandhiji's Mantra'.
There Gandhi ji had said - "I am talking about one such strategy of yours. Whenever you feel suspicious or arrogant, you can only remember my thoughts.
Mind the face of the poorest and the weakest person that you have seen in your life and ask your questions- the steps you have taken will be of immense use to that person.
That is, will crores of hungry and deprived people get Swaraj due to this
That's when you're gonna see that your suspicion is over and that's the ego-free circle.
My dear countrymen, one of Gandhijis principles is equally important today.
The economic strength and purchasing power of the country's growing middle class is rising.
My happiness will increase manifold if the benefits reach the poorest of the poor.
Keeping this spirit of Gandhiji in mind, whenever we buy anything, as soon as we mark Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary, we must keep in mind that every purchase made by us should benefit some people of our country and those who have lost their sweat, those who have invested in it, those who have invested their talent, those who have worked for it should take care of it.
I believe that a small step of yours can bring about a big change in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
Similarly, today we can feel that through these small things, we can contribute in a big way in the economic progress of our country, in the field of economic empowerment and in the power to fight against poverty for the poor.
And I believe that this is the true patriot of today's times. This is a tribute to revered Bapu's work.
For example, think of buying Khadi and handicraft products on special occasions.
Two days later, along with Pujya Bapu, we will celebrate Shastri ji's birth anniversary.
When Shastri ji's name is pronounced, an unlimited respect is born in our country.
His mild personality always fills the minds of every country with pride.
Lal Bahadur Shastri had a special look from outside and he was very soft, but he was confident in his heart.
The mantra of 'Jai Jawan Jai Kisan' was the identity of his great personality.
In a short span of about one and a half years, he gave a clarion call to the youth and farmers of the country to scale greater heights, which is the result of his selfless service to the nation.
Crores of people have participated in this campaign and I have also got the opportunity to contribute in the cleanliness drive with the children of Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school whose foundation was laid by Pujya Baba Saheb himself.
School children, college students, NCC, NSS, Youth Associations, Media groups, Corporates etc.
I heartily congratulate all the cleanliness-loving countrymen for their efforts.
Let's hear a phone call, "Namaste, my name is Satan Singh.
I especially thank you for your phone call.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a success story not only in India but all over the world.
This time, India is going to organize one of the largest Swachhta Conventions in the world - Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
The officials of the Ministry of Swachhata from around the world and experts from the field will share their experiences on Swachhata.
It is essential to ensure freedom, peace and justice for the oppressed, the deprived and the oppressed.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was constituted on 12th October, 1993.
In a few days, NHRC would complete 25 years of its existence.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also helped in increasing the pride of the soul.
Our beloved leader, former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had clearly stated that human rights are not foreign to us.
The symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, the ideal policy of the Vedic age, Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah, is inscribed on it.
NHRC has generated widespread awareness about human rights and has also played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
During the 25 years of its visit, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and trust among the people of the country.
I think it's very promising for a healthy society, for democratic values.
Now, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been constituted in addition to the work on human rights at the national level.
All these great men have inspired us and we salute them.
Even this year, we are trying to organize 'Run for Unity' in our villages, towns and cities.
Run for Unity - this is the right way to remember Sardar Saheb because he has worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I appeal to all of you that on 31st October, through 'Run for Unity', we strengthen this effort to unite every section of the society and every individual and that is the best tribute to him.
My dear countrymen, Navratri, Durgapuja, Vijayadashmi, I convey my best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion.
Thank you!
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today the entire country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan symbolizes the love and faith of our sisters and brothers.
For centuries, this festival is a great example of social harmony.
There are many such incidents in the history of the country when it has been observed that how a protective barrier could bind the people of both the states and different religions.
A few days later, Janmashtami.
In the air, you can hear the names of 'Hathi Horse Pal' - Ki Jai Kanhai Lal Ki' and 'Govinda - Govinda'.
It's a different pleasure to play with this joy by coloring himself in the color of Krishna.
Children in different parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra, have also started organizing the Dahi-Handi.
I am grateful to Chinmai for keeping this in mind.
Friends, Apart from Raksha Bandhan, this day is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
I also congratulate those who are engaged in the preservation of this great heritage, carrying it forward and delivering it to the people.
Every language has its own importance.
Sanskrit language and literature have a vast treasure of knowledge that works in every sphere of life.
Be it science or be it science or be it agriculture or health or be it science or be it science or be it science or be it science or be it science or be it science or be it architecture or management or be it economics or be it environment, the mantra to fight against the challenges like global warming is also described in detail.
You will be happy to know that all the people of the village of Muttur of Shivamoga district of Karnataka have chosen Sanskrit as a medium of communication today.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language that can produce eternal words.
If we want to weight something then we use English coating, sometimes we say Shayari, etc.
But those who are familiar with the well-known words of Sanskrit know how little the correct explanation of the subject can be made through these well-defined words in Sanskrit.
Meaning, if a teacher imparts even a letter of knowledge to his disciples, then there is no such thing in the world that can repay the loan to the disciples.
We always remember the great philosopher and former President of India, Bharat Ratna Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan on the occasion of Teachers Day.
On his birth anniversary, Teachers Day was celebrated all over the country.
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the occasion of the next Teachers Day and also remember his dedication to science, education and students and his dedication to them.
My dear countrymen, our farmer brothers and sisters, those who work hard, receive the news of rains.
A long time ago, we saw how floods had caused havoc in the lives of Kerala.
In such a difficult situation, the entire country is standing with Kerala.
My thoughts are with all those families who have lost their loved ones due to this calamity.
The damage that may have been caused by it may not have been accomplished at any time but I want to assure the bereaved families that 1.25 billion Indians will stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this hour of grief.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity recover quickly.
I have full faith that the life of Kerala will soon become normal with the help of indomitable spirit and courage.
It is unfortunate that the way disasters wreak havoc on people, it is unfortunate that on this day, we tend to realize the righteousness of humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup, Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everyone is trying their best to ensure that the areas in which the disaster is threatened, whether it is Kerala or in any district or region of India, the lives of those places are naturally lost.
People from all age groups and people from all walks of life are extending their help.
Everyone is wondering that how to share the sufferings of people of Kerala so that it can be minimized.
We all know that the Armed Forces are a hero of Keralas disaster.
They have made all out efforts to save the flood victims.
Air Force, Navy or Army, BSF, CISF, RAF, RAF, all are in the forefront of rescue and relief operations.
I would especially like to mention that the hard work of the forces of NDRF is being done.
The way they have worked to deal with these challenges is commendable.
The strength of the NDR-F has made it a tribute to all the people of the country, with their commitment and ability to take quick and quick decisions.
My dear countrymen, while reading the suggestions of Mann Ki Baat this time, I have seen that most of the people have written about it, it is our favorite, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Bats from Sonepat, brother of Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar, Bihar and many others have requested me to speak on the various aspects of the life of Atalji in the mobile app Narendra Modi and MyGov.
On the 16th of August, the people of the country and the world have come to know about the demise of Atal ji.
He is a national leader who left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago and has gone a long way from active politics in the last 10 years.
He didn't see anything special on the news.
The affection, reverence and compassion shown by everyone for Atalji is an indicator of his great personality.
The country will always be grateful to Atal ji for bringing good governance in the mainstream.
Today, I want to tell you one more example of Atal ji's great personality - that is the political culture in which he has tried to bring about a change in the political culture and the efforts made to provide a systematic infrastructure for political culture, it has benefitted the country and it will also benefit in the future.
India will always remain grateful to Atal ji for the 2003 Second Amendment Act.
This amendment will bring about two major changes in the politics of our country.
The first phase of the Assembly Constituencies is to be restricted to fifteen percent of the total seats.
Atal ji brought about a change in the system which resulted in savings of money and resources, and increased efficiency.
Atal ji was the only person to bring about a change in the situation and introduce a healthy and smooth system of politics.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the budget by 5.00 pm to 11.00 pm.
One more thing that we achieved during the tenure of Atal ji was the creation of Indian Flag Code.
It was commissioned from 2002 to enable the extraction of tricolour at public places.
The common Indian also got the opportunity to unfurl the National Flag.
This way he brought our beloved Tiranga to the people.
You have seen how Atal ji has strengthened the foundation of the country by taking bold steps in the elections of the peoples representatives.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a discussion about the Parliament today, there is a question of disruption, but when there is something good then there is no discussion in this regard.
A few days ago, the Monsoon Session of the Parliament concluded.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and that of Rajya Sabha was 74.
This is the result of the efforts made by all the MPs in the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha passage of 21 and 14 bills.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will be remembered for social justice and youth welfare.
In this session, many important bills have been passed for the development of the youth and the backward classes.
You all know that for decades, there was a demand for a OBC commission like the SC / ST Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has fulfilled the resolution of setting up of OBC Commission this time and has given it a constitutional right.
This step will help in the successful implementation of social justice.
In order to safeguard the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, the Bill has also been amended in this session.
This Act will further protect the interest of SC and ST communities.
At the same time, it will protect them from the atrocities of their criminals and increase their confidence.
There can be no injustice to the women of the country.
The perpetrators of this crime will be punished for 10 years and less than 12 years of rape will be punished.
A few days ago, you might have read in the papers that a court in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh had sentenced two guilty to death for raping a girl after hearing for just two months.
Earlier, a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh had sentenced the guilty to death for just five days.
A court in Rajasthan has also made such a quick decision.
The Act will provide for a constructive role in resolving criminal cases against women and girls.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
The Lok Sabha passed the Triple Talaq Bill even as it could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha.I want to assure the Muslim women that the entire country is with all its might to ensure their justice.
When we come forward to protect the interests of the country, then it is possible to bring about a change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived.
This time in the Monsoon Session, everyone has set an example together.
I heartily thank all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, at this moment, millions and millions of Indians are committed to the Asian Games.
Everyday in the morning, on newspapers, television, news and social media, some Indian player has won medals.
Asian Games are still going on.
I congratulate all those who have won medals for the country.
I convey my best wishes to those who are still out of competition.
India's players, especially those who are shooting and who are doing wonders, are bringing medals in all the games that we have not done well before. Our players are bringing laurels for the country.
These are not just medals, but are a testimony to the courage and dreams of Indian sports and Indian contestants.
This is a positive sign for our daughters in the list of medal winners for the country.
Many of the youngsters who have won medals are from 15-16 years of age.
It is also a good sign that many of the players who have won medals have emerged from the unknown villages and villages and have worked hard to achieve this.
On August 29, 2019, we will celebrate National Sports Day. On this occasion, I congratulate all the sports lovers and also pay my tributes to the great hockey cricketer Shri Dhyan Chand Ji.
I appeal to all the citizens of the country that you should play games and pay attention to your fitness because a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
Only when India is fit will India build a bright future.
Once again, I congratulate the medal winners in the Asian Games, and also the rest of the players for their good results.
But the Brihadisvara temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, is a place where this unique blend of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone was surprised to see the 11th century 'Rani ki Bao' in Patan, Gujarat.
Engineering experiments have always been conducted in India.
There are many engineers in India who have imagined that they have done a commendable job in the engineering world.
There are also gems in the heritage treasures of our great engineers whose work still surprises people.
He is Bharat Ratna Dr.
In that part of the country, he recalled with great respect, the people from other parts of the country.
He was remembered as Engineers Day on September 15th.
Following his footsteps, our engineers have made a mark for themselves in the East.
In 2001, I was reminded of one of the worst earthquakes in Kutch in Gujarat, in terms of the remarkable achievements of the engineering world.
He was joking at me. Look at my house.
Kutch is called Bhonga.
My house saw three earthquakes.
He was saying this thing with great pride and I feel that many years ago our engineers used to build houses by taking into account the local environment and conditions so that the people were protected.
Now that we are celebrating Engineers Day, we have to think of the future and organize workshops at different places.
We have to think about what new things we have to learn in the changing times
You have to teach?
The world is fighting natural disasters.
What will be the new use of structural engineering here?
What's his course?
What should students teach?
With this spirit, I convey my best wishes to you all.
We'll talk again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
It has inspired people's thinking.
You must have seen on TV that a team of 12 teenage footballers and their coach had gone to a cave in Thailand.
It usually takes a few hours to go to the cave and get out of there.
But that day, Bhagyadevi had a different desire.
When they entered the cave, it was raining all of a sudden and there was a lot of water in the mouth of the cave.
Every effort was made to know where those teenagers are in, where they are, how they can be brought out.
But I want to see this whole thing in a different way.
The government there, the parents of the children, the people of the family, the media, the citizens of the country have shown everyone an exemplary attitude of peace and patience.
Everyone joined the mission in a team.
I think it is a matter of learning and self-determination for all.
The parents didn't feel sad or their mother didn't throw the water in their eyes.
Everyone's patience, restraint, peaceful use of the entire society is a matter of learning for us.
A Thai Navy soldier died in this operation.
The world is astonished that despite these trying times, the rescue teams have done a lot of courage and patience in the dark caves.
This shows that when people are united, there are wonders.
It is necessary that we concentrate and work for a peaceful mind while keeping it in mind.
A few days ago, Neeraj ji, the popular poet of our country, had died.
The specialty of poet Neeraj ji was hope, faith, determination and self-confidence.
All the words of poet Neeraj ji can inspire all of us Indians.
He wrote: Darkness will be removed and as soon as the storm surges, darkness will be removed as the lamp of Light will be lit.
The months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth.
This is because this is the time when a pick-up session is being organized for the colleges.
Millions of youngsters, like the truth, left school and went to college.
During the months of February and March, examinations are conducted, Questions and Answers, April and May holidays are celebrated with joy and results are used to determine the quality of life and career choices.
The month of July is the month when the youth take steps on the new path of their lives, when the focus moves away from 'Kochan' and 'Kaat-off'.
The focus of the students goes from home to hostel.
The students enter the umbrella of the parents from the umbrella of the professor.
I believe my young friends are very excited and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time, we have to move out of the house, move out of the village, get out of a safe environment and become our guiding light.
All these youngsters left their homes and went out to take their lives in a new path.
There is no way out of the book, we have to study, but we have to continue our desire to look for new things.
Old friends are very valuable.
Those youngsters who leave their homes and go to study elsewhere, they must find out about the places, the people there, the language, the culture there.
Starting a new chapter, my best wishes to all the youngsters.
His father spent his entire life collecting garbage and feeding his family.
In that situation, I congratulate Asha Ram for this achievement.
There are so many students of such families who have shown their hard work and concentration in a difficult situation that can inspire all of us.
For example, Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father was a bus driver of DTC, or Abhay Gupta of Kolkata who studied on the pavement under the street lights, among them is Afrin Sheikh, the daughter of Ahmedabad, whose father is auto driver, the daughter of a school bus driver of Nagpur, Karthik, the son of a watchman of Haryana or Ramesh Sahu, the son of a brick-kiln labourer of Jharkhand.
The differently abled girl from Gurgaon, Anushka Panda, has been suffering from hereditary diseases called spinal muscular atrophy. They have all achieved great success in showing the world through their determination and willpower.
We will find many such examples when we look around us.
Any good event in any part of the country inspires me.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a news item was published in which he said, Two youngsters made Modis dream come true.
After reading the story, I came to know how our youth is trying to bring about a change in the lives of the common man through technology-driven smart and creative use.
It was like this that once during my interaction with the Indian youth in San Jose, the technology hub of America, I had appealed to them to think about how they can use their talent for India and take time out.
I had requested for the change of brain drain to brain gain.
Two IT professionals from Raebareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Bajpayee ji made a unique effort while accepting my challenge.
A smart village app has been developed by Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji using their professional skills.
This app will not only connect the people of the village with the whole world, but will also be available in their mobile phones.
The app has all the telephone directories of the village, News section, Events List, Health Centres, Information Centres etc.
This app is also very useful for the farmers and the FACT rate among the farmers is working on the market to sell their produce in a manner.
Santosh ji, thank you very much for your phone.
In fact, the pious occasion of Pandharpur is a unique festival.
Friends, The 11th month of Ashadha, which was the 23rd of July this year, is also celebrated with great fervor on this day.
Pandharpur is the holy city of Kolhapur district of Maharashtra.
Saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram were kept in the footsteps of the monks and dancing in the name of Beththal God to Pandharpur.
Devotees will reach there for the darshan of Lord Bittal, which is also known as Beethova or Pandurang.
God protects the poor, the helpless and the oppressed.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense reverence and reverence for God.
You go to Bethova Temple in Pandharpur, there is a different feeling of importance, beauty and spiritual happiness.
My request to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat is that if a chance comes, they will definitely gain experience of the pious journey of Pandharpur.
Many such monks like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram are still teaching the common man in Maharashtra.
We get the teachings of love and brotherhood from the verses of Verud or Awang.
We get this mantra from them that the society can fight against superstition.
They have shown the right path to the society at the right time and have ensured that the old superstitions from the society are removed, they have brought compassion, equality and purity to the people.
One such great personality was Lokmanya Tilak who had made a mark in the hearts of many Indians.
We remember Tilak ji on his birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was brave and confident.
He had the ability and intelligence to mislead the British rulers.
The British were so afraid of Lokmanya Tilak that he had been accused of sedition three times in twenty years.
I would like to tell you a special incident about the statue of Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in the month of October 1916, imagine that 100 years ago, more than 40,000 people had gathered to welcome him.
Later, as Mayor of the City Corporation, he decided to establish the memorial of His Highness Tilak at Victoria Garden, the ueen of the UK.
It is natural that the British rulers are very dissatisfied with this and the Collectors have repeatedly proposed the construction of a memorial called 'Smaru Hala'.
However, Sardar Saheb would resign if he needs to, but he will leave the statue of Lokmanya Tilak.
The statue of Sardar Patel was finally constructed and the statue was inaugurated on 28th February, 1929.
Pujya Bapu had said in the Maha-Inauguration Ceremony, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got one person but it has also got the strength to establish the statue of Tilak.
My dear countrymen, one of the special features of the Statue established by Sardar Patel is that Lokmanya Tilakji is sitting here in the chair and it is written under this statue that Swaraj is my birthright.
I heard it from the English as God's command.
It was on the initiative of Lokmanya Tilak that the first universal Ganesh Festival was started.
Despite the traditional rich tradition of Ganesh Festivals, it has become an effective medium to promote social awakening, unity, equality and equality.
Now one can see the Ganesh Pavilion in the alley of any city.
All the families in the street organized the Ganesh Festival together.
This is a unique opportunity for our youth to acquire special powers like organization and leadership and develop them within themselves.
My dear countrymen, I had also said this last time that in the memory of Lokmanya Tilak ji, I would like to reiterate that you should celebrate Ganesh Utsav with fervor but celebrate 'Environment-friendly' festival.
From the statue of Ganeshji, all his decorations, pooja etc.
Those who sacrificed their lives so that the country can breathe freely in an independent India.
I'm talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
There are some young people in India who will not be inspired to listen to this song - Sarforshi ki tamanna a hamarel me Haidakhna Hai Joro Kitana Baju-e-Katil Me Hai These lines have inspired the likes of Ashfaq Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad and others.
Chandrashekhar Azad's courage and freedom inspired many young people.
Azad risked his life but he never gave up his mind before the foreign rule.
It is my privilege that I got the opportunity to visit the village of Alirajpur in Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I salute the two great sons of Mother India, Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
A few days ago, at the Junior U-20 World Athletics Championships held in Finland, India's brave daughter Hima Das won a gold medal at the 400-meter run.
One more daughter of the country, Ekta Bhyan, in response to my letter, has e-mailed me from Indonesia, now preparing for the Asian Games there.
Unity is written in the e-mail: In the life of an athlete, Mahendra is the time when he or she holds the tricolour and I am proud that I have done it.
Unity, we all are proud of you.
His accomplishments are noteworthy for the fact that he has made his challenge a medium of success.
In 2003, the road accident caused an undercurrent of unity and fear, but the girl did not lose courage and made herself strong and achieved her goal.
I salute Ekta Bhyanji, Yogesh athuniaji, and Sundar Singh Ji for their courage and struggle.
You should move forward, play and develop.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is full of events and festivals but sometimes diseases also keep entering the house due to weather.
I convey my best wishes for the good health of all of you, for the patriotic fervour and for the successful completion of centenary year in the month of August.
We will meet again in Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you so much!
My dear countrymen, today once again I have got the opportunity to be face-to-face with all of you in this episode of Mann Ki Baat.
A few days ago, there was a historic cricket match in Bengaluru.
You might have realized that I am talking about the Test Matches between India and Afghanistan.
This was the first international test match of Afghanistan and it is a matter of pride for all Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
The two sides performed wonderfully during the match.
Rashid Khan had played a very good role in the IPL this year and I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Shri Ashraf Ghani had tagged me on Twitter and wrote on Twitter: The people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I also thank our Indian friends who have created a platform for our players to showcase their sporting talent.
The best, Rashid from Afghanistan represented him.
He is an asset in the world of cricket, and along with it he has written with a lot of fun - No, I don't want to give it to anyone.
This match will be remembered for all of us.
Though it was the first match, it is natural to remember, but I will remember this match for other things as well.
The Indian team has done such a thing which is unprecedented in the whole world.
At the time of the Indian team trophy, the team has shown what the team can do.
At the time of the Indian team trophy, the Afghanistan team extended an invitation to those who are playing the international match for the first time and took a photo together.
We can experience the spirit of sportsmanship and the spirit of sportsmanship here.
Sports is the best way to unite the society and find talent among our youth.
My best wishes to the two teams of India and Afghanistan
My dear countrymen, on the 21st of June, on the 4th of June, a magnificent view has been seen.
Be it the Brussels-Europe Parliament, the headquarters of the United Nations located in New York, or the ships of the Japanese Navy, people have been watching Yoga at all places.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, this historic event has been organized and I am told that women have also performed several seats.
On the high snow peaks of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China have together practiced yoga.
If people from all over the world participate in 'Yoga Day' with so much enthusiasm then why should not the enthusiasm of India go to such an extent
Our Air Warriors have ensured Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the ground in the midst of the skies.
There was a panoramic view, not in the airplane, but in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high homes or playgrounds, yoga has been practiced everywhere.
While one of the sights of Ahmedabad was enchanting, nearly 750 Divyang brothers and sisters have created a record by practicing Yoga at one place.
I believe that today the work of 'Yoga is good for wellness' and 'Revolution' is going on.
One such effort is being made by Yoga, and I hope that it will move forward.
Slowly, many people will choose Yoga as part of their lives.
Thank you for your phone.
You know, had Kabirdas Ji gone to Ameghhar?
He is the one who understands the sadness of others.
Whoever doesn't understand the pain and suffering of others, he's cruel.
Kabirdas Ji gave a special emphasis on social coordination.
"Jgamme bari Koi nehi, Joe Mann Ki Baat.
Give me the pulses, please.
On the other hand, Kabirdas ji has said- , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , , : , : , : , , : , : , , : , : , , : , , : , , : , : , , : , : , , : , : , , : , , : , , : , , : , ,
His invaluable message continues to dominate the world even after so many years. Now, when we are talking about Sant Kabirdas Ji, I am reminded of one of his duplicity.
This is the greatness of Guru and one such guru is the Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev.
Who has shown the path of truth to crores of people, who have been inspiring people for ages.
Guru Nanak Devji's 550th Prakash Parv will be celebrated in 2019.
There is another history that has been associated with Punjab.
The horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh in 2019, which marks the 100th anniversary of the anniversary of the demise of a man of humanity.
On the 13th of April, 1919, someone forgot the black day when all the limits of cruelty were imposed on innocent, innocent and innocent people.
It is going to be a hundred years of this tragedy, but we always remember the eternal message that this incident has given, that there is no solution to any problem through violence and casualties.
Peace, non-violence, sacrifice and renunciation are always won.
My dear countrymen, Shri Raman Kumar from Rohini, Delhi has written on Narendra Modi Mobile App.
First of all, thank you very much
It is a great pleasure to see your interest in the history of India.
You know, yesterday, June 23, Dr.
Maybe even a few people know that, in 1937, Dr.
At the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore spoke in Bengali at the convocation of Kolkata University.
This was the first example when during the British rule, a person addressed the convocation of the University of Kolkata in Bengali.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first industrial minister of India and in a sense, he had laid a strong foundation for India's progress in terms of industrial development and overall development.
In 1948, India's first industrial policy was based on its vision and vision.
Dr.
Mukherjee's dream was that India will become self-reliant, developed and prosperous in every sector of the industry.
He wanted India to build large scale industries and also focus on MSMEs, handicrafts, textiles and cottage industries.
He had a finance and organization set up for the proper development of cottage and crafts, since 1948 to 1950.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had made a great contribution.
He was passionate about the development of West Bengal.
A part of West Bengal has been protected and is still part of India due to his thinking, understanding and activism.
Let us remember the message of unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and continue to strive for Indias progress through harmony and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, in the last few weeks, I had the opportunity to talk to all those who have benefited from the schemes of the government through video conferencing.
I got the opportunity to get out of the files and listen directly to the people and change their lives.
People have said that their resolve, happiness and misery are a matter of concern.
I believe that this was not just a government programme but also a learning experience and what could be more satisfying than what I have seen before the public at this time
When I heard the voice of a common man, his simple words, his words of words and his feelings were always touching the heart.
I had come to know that how women from far-flung villages are helping to create passports for the elderly people from the common service centres.
One of the sisters from Chhattisgarh is engaged in the business of making ice-cream by collecting data from the farmers. Lakhs of youngsters across the country like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and supplying cheap medicines to the nearby villages.
Now he is not only running his own business but also providing employment to 10-15 people and providing employment to them.
School students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working at a young age on key issues like West Management at the Tinkering Lab in the school.
There was not a single place in the country where there was no such place where there was no message of success.
I am glad that with the success of the government in the entire event, I have felt the strength of the people's success, the strength of the country's ten power, the strength of the dream of a New India and the strength of the resolve.
There are few people in the society who do not talk of pessimism, do not talk of despair, do not create faith, do not look for a broken path instead they do not find peace.
In such an environment, when the common man talks of his life with a new hope and enthusiasm then his success will not be of the government but of the people.
The story of a small girl from a small village in far-flung areas also inspires 125 crore people.
I am grateful to the people of our country.
You 40-40, 50-50 lakh people are connected to this video bridge and have given me a new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to you.
I also felt the smell of good.
It is a matter of fact that the corporate professionals and IT engineers from Bengaluru have come together to build a co-ordinated prosperity trust to double the income of the farmers.
He said that through this trust, the farmers are being linked to the scheme, the scheme is being created and efforts are being made to increase the income of the farmers.
Through this trust, these professional, engineers and technicians will be supported by the farmers on how to grow organic farming with new methods of farming and how to grow one crop as well as other crops.
Earlier the farmers who used to depend only on one crop, which didn't benefit either. Today, they are not only growing several crops but also making good profits by selling the produce through this trust.
Seed banks have been set up separately for the use of good varieties of seeds.
Women are engaged in looking after the SE Bank and women are also associated with it.
My dear countrymen, the GST system is going to complete one year.
Today, the dream of one Nation one Tax has come true.
One Nation One Tax Reform If I have to give credit to anyone for this system then I will give credit to the states.
GST is a good example of Co-operative Federalism where all the states had taken decisions keeping in mind the welfare of the country and as a result, such a big tax reform has been introduced in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can take pride in the fact that despite having different political ideologies, different states and different priority states, the decisions taken by the GST Council so far have been unanimously taken.
Before GST, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country, but now after the introduction of this system, there is only one tax system in the country.
After the introduction of GST, check posts have also been shut down and this has led to a sharp increase in movement of goods and other goods, which has not only saved time but has also benefited the logistics sector.
GST is probably the world's largest tax reform system.
In India, such a big tax reform has been successful because the people of the country have adopted this system and this Jan Shakti, Jangraha, has ensured the success of GST.
It is generally believed that such a large size reform takes 5 to 7 years for the proper implementation of such a large country with such a huge population.
But the enthusiasm and zeal of the honest countrymen, the flow of the festival of honesty and the result of the Jan Shakti Abhiyan is that within a year, this new tax system has developed its place and has been reforming itself with the necessary input system.
This is a great achievement that the country has achieved 1.25 billion Indians.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
You must remember that for the past few months, a team of six women commanders of the Navy has been sailing for the past few months.
I would like to say something about the name of Navika Sagar Parikrama.
The team of these six daughters of India travelled the world over for over 250 days through I-N-SV Tarini, who returned to India on 21st May 2020 and received a warm welcome from across the country.
It has crossed 22,000 nautical miles across different oceans and a few seas.
This is an unprecedented event in the world.
Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
I once again congratulate these daughters for their courageous work, for enhancing the prestige of the Navy, for increasing the pride of India, and especially the daughters of India, in no way less than in the world.
You must have seen that in the last few days, new information has been provided about the Everest winners.
On 16th May, 5 tribal students from a Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra - Manish Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madhabi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soam - have won the highest peak in the world.
They were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Leh-Ladakh from August, 2017.
They were selected in Mission Shaurya.
And with the name, they won the Everest and made the country proud.
I heartily congratulate these small students of Chandrapur School.
Recently, 16-year-old Shivangi reader has won Everest from Nepal as the youngest Indian woman.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter De Everest.
Not only has the younger generation won the Everest, but on 19th May, 2019, more than 500 women Smt. Sangeeta Bahal won the Everest.
There are some of the Everest climbers who are not only skilled but also experienced.
This is not only commendable but also a reflection of their responsibilities towards cleanliness and the environment.
I heartily congratulate all those brave hearts, especially the daughters.
A large number of people from different sectors will come forward to support this.
On Fit India, I will say that I believe that the more we play, the more the country will play.
In social media, people are sharing videos of their fitness challenges, tagging others and challenging them.
I believe that this is a very good process and such a challenge encourages us to stay fit and fit.
My dear countrymen, many times in Mann Ki Baat, you have heard something from me about sports and sports persons.
"Chhabi Jadhav ji, thank you very much for your phone
These games were part of the summer vacation.
There are two types of traditional sports.
There's an Outdoor and Indore.
There may be unity in diversity of our country in these games.
The same game is known by various names in various places.
This is a game played at the Square board on the 8th and 8th.
In Madhya Pradesh, it is known as Pakykakali, Champal in Maharashtra, Dayam in Tamil Nadu and Changpa in Rajasthan.
Even if the residents of different states do not know each other's languages, they will see each other properly during the game.
It's a game that's all over the city.
It is also known by various names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Gotibilla or Karyabila.
In Odisha, it is called 'Balbari' in Maharashtra.
Traditional sports are built not only in physical fitness but also in physical fitness, concentration, alertness and sports.
It is not just sports, it teaches us the values of life, it teaches us the goals, it can achieve strength, it can help each other in creating team spirit.
Just a few days ago, I saw that our traditional sports have been included in the training programs of Business Management for the development of personality as well as for improving interpersonal skills.
At the same time, we are also aware of our culture and tradition.
Some games make us aware of our society, environment, etc.
Now schools, neighborhoods, youth should come forward and encourage these games.
Through crowd sourcing, we can build a museum of our traditional sports.
The video of these games can be made to show how to play the game.
An animation film can also be made so that our new generation can learn about these games and can grow and blossom.
This years theme is Beat Plastic Pollution.
Considering the importance of this idea, I request you all to ensure that we do not use polythene, low grade plastic and try to reduce the harmful effects of plastic pollution on our nature, wildlife and our health.
I request you all to look at the data from World Environment Day website www.india.2018 and try your best in your day to day life.
Loss of life, loss of resources.
This is essentially the result of the change that has taken place in Weather Pattern.
This is what Mahatma Gandhi had said throughout his life.
Today, India is talking about climate justice, it has played a key role in the COP 21 and the Paris Agreement. We have brought the world together through the International Solar Alliance.
In this 'Environment Day', we think about what we can do to make the world a cleaner and greener.
How can we move forward on this path, what innovations can we do
Rain is coming.
Now we can plant a record number of trees, not only planting, but also taking care of trees when they grow up.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
Today, on 21st June, all of you remember that not only you, but the whole world remembers you on 21st June.
The 21st of June is celebrated worldwide as the International Day of Yoga (IDY) and it is agreed that the preparations for the event will begin a few months back.
It has been reported that around the world, preparations are going on to celebrate 21st June as International Yoga Day.
Yoga increases courage which always protects us like our father.
My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones and their loved ones.
The Concessionaire said that by doing regular yoga, the truth is our child, mercy is our brother, self- restraint is our brother, the world is our bed and knowledge is our source of hunger.
When someone is so good, then naturally, this yogi overcomes all kinds of fear.
Once again, I appeal to all the countrymen to take forward the great tradition of Yoga and create a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
My dear countrymen, today is the 27th of May, the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, on the 13th of May.
I salute Panditji.
In May 1857, the people of India had given the British their power.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers had fought against injustice.
Unfortunately, over the years, we have termed the 1857 outbreak as a rebellion or a soldier mutiny.
Indeed, this event was not just a small one, it was an attempt to hurt our self-respect.
This Veer Savarkar ji wrote fearlessly that what happened in 1857 was not a rebellion but the first war of independence.
The heroes of London's India House celebrated their 50th birth anniversary along with Savarkar.
He was a worshipper of both arms and weapons.
Veer Savarkar was originally known for his struggle against the Bahuduri and the British Raj.
But apart from this, he was a great poet and social reformer who always emphasized on goodwill and unity.
We have given a unique description of Savarkar ji, our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Savarkar is taking both poetry and revolution.
Apart from being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary.
Our daughters, who were once forced to beg from the slums of garbage and from homes to homes. Today, they are learning the work of sewing and stitching clothes to cover the poor.
I wish these daughters, full of hope and faith, a bright future.
They have shown that if you have the courage to do something and if you are committed to it then you can achieve success in all the difficulties and this is not just the case of Sikar but you can see it in every corner of India.
If you look at the neighbors and neighbors around you, you will be able to see how people are defeating the virus.
You have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we are satisfied with the tea there. Some people are consulted and examined.
This discussion, whether it is political or social, it is about films, it is about sports and players, it is about the problems of the country, it should be done in such a manner that most of the time this discussion is limited only to discussions.
He also arranged for education, health and food for all the children who came to school.
He wiped out the darkness of their lives.
Tamso Ma Jyotirgamaya: Who does not know this proverb, but has shown it by De Prakash Rao.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for the society and the entire country.
There will be many inspiring events around you too.
There must be lots of things.
Let us take a positive attitude forward.
It's so hot in June that people wait for the rains and in hope there's a thunderstorm in the sky.
A few minutes from now, people will wait for the moon.
The meaning of seeing the moon is Eid.
On the occasion of Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a symbol of the beginning of a vibrant festival of Eid.
I believe that everyone will celebrate Eid with happiness, especially on this occasion children will get a good Eid.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of goodwill in our society.
Best wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, many thanks to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Recently, Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April 2019.
71 countries from all over the world including India participated in it.
When such a big event is organized, thousands of players from all over the world will take part in it and imagine how exciting it can be
Our players too displayed great sporting talent in accordance with the expectations of the people of the country and won one medal in each other.

Just a few days ago, I saw that some young children of Delhi, who were working selflessly for the poor, started a commendable job in the direction of education for the street children of Delhi and the slums.
In the beginning, they explained to the beggars and small children on the street that they also took part in the development work.
Starting with 15 children from a slum near Geetha Colony in Delhi, the program has become an attempt to educate 2,000 children at 12 locations in the capital today.
In this campaign, young teachers are making an effort to change the society by taking out two hours free time from their daily routine.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of Uttarakhand have set an example for the farmers of the country.
They have changed the fortune of not only their own but also of their area through teamwork.
Bageshwar in Uttarakhand is mainly cultivated as Chola, Bhutta and Jab.
Due to hilly terrain, the farmers were not able to get the right price for their produce, but the farmers of the Kapkot Fund managed to save their produce directly from the market losses and took the path of value addition.
They have made biscuits from field crops and selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a government company in Munnar and have opened a bakery.
Due to this effort of the farmers, the administration has included it in the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit has spread to about 50 Anganwadi centers and Kosani Almora in Bageshwar district.
Due to this effort of the farmers, the Turnover of the institute has not only reached from 10 to 15 lakh and at the same time, more than 900 families have been provided with food grains.
My dear countrymen, I often hear that the battle against water will begin in the coming days.
That's what everyone says, but we have no responsibility?
Water conservation is not a new thing for Indians.
It is not about reading books but there is no need to learn a particular language.
Our ancestors have done it in the past.
They emphasized the importance of every drop of water.
They have come up with new ways to save every drop of water.
If you go to Tamil Nadu, you will see that in many temples of Tamil Nadu, you will find sculptures related to water harvesting, water conservation, water harvesting, construction of Dighi etc.
Large inscriptions can be seen in the temples of Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi Kobilpatti and Pudukottai.
Even today many step wells are known as tourism sector, but they are a living proof of the efforts of our ancestors to save water.
You will definitely go to Rajasthan to see Chand Bauri of Jodhpur.
It is India's largest and most beautiful Bauri.We have to keep in mind that this is the largest Bauri area where there is an acute water crisis.
In April, May, June-July, 2020, the better the time for water conservation, the better the better the system will have, the more will the water conservation work be done.
Manrega can be used for water conservation.
In the last three years, several efforts have been made for water conservation and water harvesting.
32,000 crore has been spent on water conservation and construction of dams in the MNREGA budget every year.
In 2017-18, I can say that out of Rs 64 thousand crore, 55 has been spent on water conservation projects worth Rs 35,000 crore.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefited by this water conservation and water harvesting system.
This has been possible due to hard work of people in about 40-45 villages.
I would like to say that April, May, June and July are coming and we can take a lot of responsibility for water conservation and water harvesting, some planning and some work to be done.
My dear countrymen, when Mann Ki Baat falls, there are many stories, letters and phone calls from all around the country.
But the people do not know about the philosophy that life with Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore's special, beautifully and intangible.
Please tell the people about this in Mann Ki Baat.
In his writings, Rabindranath was a talented personality and a multifaceted personality, but one of them was always a teacher.
He wrote in Gita - He who has the knowledge as the responsibility to impact it with the students - That is, he has the knowledge as well as the responsibility to share it with the students.
The collective meaning of fasting is that when a person enters, he can feel the hunger of others.
When he feels thirsty, he can feel the thirst of others.
This is the time to remember the teachings and message of Prophet Muhammad.
His teachings of life inspire us to follow the path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a question was asked by a prophet: What is the best work in Islam
The Prime Minister said, Feeding of the poor and needy is one of the best practices in the world and one of the best practices is being followed by other countries.
His Majesty the King of Bhutan and His Highness the King of Bhutan His Excellency Mr.
He was not proud of anything.
He used to say that arrogance dominates knowledge.
His Majesty had the opinion that if someone has something in excess of the requirement, then give it to someone who needs it. Therefore, donation in Ramzan is also very important.
In this holy month, everyone donated blood to the needy.
His Majesty believed that a person's own pious soul enriches him not wealth.
My dear countrymen, Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is a land of compassion, service and sacrifice, a land of Lord Buddha, who has guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of the great responsibility of walking, resolution and walking on the path shown by Lord Buddha.
Lord Buddha is an inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
This is the kind of human values that the world needs today.
Baba Saheb Dr.
Ambedkar used to say that there was a great inspiration for Lord Buddha in his social philosophy.
He said, "My social philosophy may be said to be shared in three words
Be it the people of the country, be it the oppressed or the deprived sections of the society, Baba Saheb has strengthened the people of this marginal level through the Constitution.
There can be no greater example of compassion.
Lord Buddhas compassion for human suffering was one of his greatest qualities.
We, the people of Asia, have inherited the teachings of Lord Buddha.
In many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, etc, this tradition of Buddha is also connected to the roots of Buddhism and this is the reason why we are building infrastructure for Buddhist tourism that connects important places of South-East Asia with the Buddhist regions of India.
I pray for the blessings of those great souls for the entire world that we can discharge our duties in building a peaceful and compassionate world with his ideals.
Today, we are remembering Lord Buddha, and will also listen to the statue of Laughing Buddha, about whom it is said that 'Laughing Buddha' brought good luck, but very few people know that this Sahasya Buddha is also associated with an important event in the history of India's security.
You might be wondering that what could be the connection between the 'Lafing Buddha' and the Indian army
You must remember that on the 11th of May 1998, 20 years ago, on the evening of 11th May 1998, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had delivered an address to the nation, which filled the whole country with pride, valour and happiness.
Due to the global spread of COVID-19, there was a new confidence among the Indians.
It was a day of wisdom.
On 11th May, 1998, a nuclear test was conducted at Pokhran in Rajasthan in the western part of India.
It marks the 20th anniversary of the birth of Lord Buddha, and marks the 20th anniversary of the birth of Lord Buddha.
Indias experiment was successful. In a way, India demonstrated its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that this day is an occasion to showcase Indias military prowess.
Lord Buddha has shown the world that inner strength is essential for peace.
Thus, when you become strong as a nation, you will be able to live peacefully with all.
The month of May 1998 is not just important because the nuclear test was conducted in that month, but the way it was possible, it is more important.
This event has shown the whole world that India has the potential to scale new goals and heights with the help of great scientists and a strong leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra, "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan - Jai Vigyan".
Today, on the 11th of May 1998, when we are celebrating 20th year, we have to take a pledge that every youth of the country will have to take part in the mantra of 'Jai Vigyan' given by Atal ji for the strength of India and to build a modern India.
We have to make our own strength a part of India's strength.
And it is only then that we will be able to achieve a new happiness and a new satisfaction for taking forward the journey of Atal ji.
My dear countrymen, if we talk about Mann Ki Baat again, we will talk about it more.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
On January 26, 2019, representatives from ASEAN countries came and accompanied by cultural groups.
It is a matter of great pride that most of them presented 'Ramayana' to us.
That is, Ramayan and Ramayan are equally inspiring and impacting not only in India but also in this region of the world.
My dear countrymen, every time I have received a lot of letters, emails, phone calls and suggestions from all of you.
I have read what Komal Thakkar has written on mygov for the launch of online course on Sanskrit.
I am glad to see your love for Sanskrit as well as being an IT worker.
I have asked the concerned departments to inform you about this.
I also request all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat who are working on Sanskrit to deliberate on how to take this proposal forward.
Shri Ghanshyam Kumar from Barkar village of Nalanda district of Bihar on Narendra Modi App.
The concern you have expressed about the decline in groundwater levels is really important.
And the 'Ayushman Bhoomi' can happen only when we take care of every single person living in this land.
You requested for water harvesting for animals and birds during summer.
Shawl-ji, your thoughts have brought me to all the listeners.
In his remarks, Shri Yogesh Bhadesh said, I would like to say something about the health of the youth.
He said that the youth of our country are physically weak compared to other Asian countries.
A few days ago, the Hon'ble President of France visited Kashi and Shri Prashant Kumar from Varanasi wrote that all the scenes of that journey have touched his heart and inspired him.
He expressed interest that all those photos should be telecast on video social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India has shared all the photos on social media and the Narendra Modi App on the same day.
I would like to tell every child like Agha, Jaiss, that with all these letters sent by them, my whole day's work and hard work is done away with.
There are so many letters, so many phone calls, opinions and suggestions that I have heard, and many of these things have touched my heart.
They wrote about their tests, shared the holiday plans, and also thought about the loss of animals and birds in this summer.
Farmers brothers and sisters have also written to me about the 'Kisan Mela' and the efforts being made in the country.
Some conscious citizens have given me advice on water conservation.
In the festive season, many letters are coming from our festivals, our culture and traditions.
When I read your letter, I came to know that Ahmad Ali, a rickshaw driver of Karimganj in Assam, had built nine schools for the poor by his will.
When I hear the story of a doctor from Kanpur, Ajit Mohan Chaudhary, who travelled from the pavement to the pavement, he used to get the treatment of the pavements for the brothers and sisters and also offered free medicines, it is a matter of pride for the harmony and humanism of this country.
The sister of a taxi driver, Saidul Lakskar, died due to lack of medical treatment in the previous year.
There are many such inspiring stories that convey the identity of our country.
Today, the whole world has seen India in a different way.
Today, when the name of India is mentioned with great respect, then the enthusiasm of the children and the children of this country is hidden behind it.
My dear countrymen, the next few months will become very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
This is because there is a lot of letters related to farming.
This time, I have seen the video of the conversation with farmers friends on DD Kisan from Doordarshan and I have felt that all the farmers should watch DD Kisan from Doordarshan and use it in their fields.
Whether it is Mahatma Gandhi or Shastri Ji or Chaudhary Charan Singh Ji or Chaudhary Devi Lal Ji, all of them considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and public life of this country.
Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri stressed on the need to preserve trees, plants, forests and improved agro-processing.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia spoke about the need for better income for our farmers, better irrigation system and collective awareness to ensure food and milk production.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh stressed on the need for farmers to adopt new technology and innovate.
Our farmers in Meghalaya have a record production of 2015-16 over the last five years.
They have shown that if the goal is fixed, there is complete self-confidence and if there is a commitment in the mind then everything can be made possible.
Today, technology is being combined with the hard work of the farmers.
This will give a boost to the agricultural producers.
In the letter that has come to me, I have seen that many farmer friends have written about the MSP and they want that I discuss it in detail with them.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to provide the right price to the farmers.
It has been decided that MSP for certain crops will be increased by at least one and a half times of the investment.
Further, detailed work is being done on Agriculture Marketing Reforms to ensure remunerative prices to farmers.
Efforts are being made to ensure that local markets in the villages are connected to the global market.
In order to ensure that the farmers do not have to go too far to sell their produce, the 22,000 rural haats of the country will be upgraded to the APMC and e-NAM platform.
This means, in a way, a system is being created that connects the fields to any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year, the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi is being celebrated.
How the country will celebrate this festival
I request you to share your thoughts with everyone through mygov.
What can be the logo of 'Gandhi 150'
All the work related to health was done by the Health Ministry earlier.
Preventive Health Care is very cheap and easy.
The more we become aware about Preventive Health Care, the more it will be beneficial for individual, family and society.
The first condition of keeping life healthy is cleanliness.
Besides, work is underway to set up a Health Wellness Centre across the country.
In the form of Preventive Health Care, Yoga has created a new identity in the world.
Yoga promises to be both healthy and capable.
It is the result of our commitment that today Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
This year, the 'International Yoga Day' on June 21st, is no more than 100 days.
The last three International Yoga Day was celebrated with great enthusiasm across the country and abroad.
This time also, we have to ensure that we join ourselves and motivate our family and friends to join together.
New and innovative forms of Yoga must be popularized among children, young and old, whether male or female.
The country's TV and electronic media perform different programmes on Yoga.
But from now on, can you create awareness about Yoga as a campaign till Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of yoga but I am a Yoga teacher.
Some people have made me a teacher of Yoga through their own ideas and have created a 3D animated video of my yoga practice.
I would like to share this video with you so that we can practice Asanas and Pranayama simultaneously.
Adequate efforts are being made to ensure that healthcare is affordable and accessible to all.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines have been sold at lower prices.
New centres are being set up.
The cost of heart stent has been reduced to 85 for heart patients.
Artificial knee costs have also been brought down to 50-70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore families i.e.
The total number of MBBS seats in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand.
One new Medical College will be opened in each of the three districts.
You need your help to reach this awareness to every person.
We all have to work together to get rid of TB.
Several years ago, Dr. Ambedkar spoke of industrialization in India.
In his thinking, entrepreneurship is a powerful medium which will help in the income of the poorest of the poor in the country.
Dr. Ambedkar dreamt that India will once become a powerful hub of labour.
Today, when the 'Make in India' project is progressing successfully in the entire country, then the vision of his vision is our inspiration.
India's position in the world economy is like a shining star and the highest foreign investment is being made in India.
Global trade is now looking towards India because we are now becoming the hub of investment and innovation.
Dr Ambedkar firmly believed in self-reliance and self-reliance.
Dr. Ambedkar wanted a person of the country not to live in poverty.
He firmly believed that poverty cannot be quenched by the contribution of the poor.
Today, schemes like MUDRA Yojana, Start-up India and Stand-up India are creating young entrepreneurs in our country.
The visionary leaders like him had always said that governance of rivers and valleys was the idea of the Parliament, and it was the vision of the Executive Committee to ensure water conservation and use.
Today, historic steps have been taken for the expansion of waterways and ports in the country.
New ports and old ports are being built on different coasts of India.
In the decade of 1940, when the World War II, cold war between two powerful powers and the tension of the territory, Dr. Ambedkar envisioned Team India or the soul of India at the same time.
He understood the importance of federalism and therefore felt that the Centre and the States must work together for the development of the country.
Today, we have seen cooperative federalism at every level of the country and governance, and have seen the spirit of competitive federalism at every level.
And most importantly, Dr. Ambedkar is an inspiration for so many people like me in the country's backward community.
It is a unique Indian film: It is an India of Ambedkar, the poor and the underprivileged.
The Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organised across the country from 14th April to 5th May on the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.
This nation-wide campaign will include programmes for rural development, for the welfare of the poor and for social justice.
I request you all to take part in this national campaign voluntarily.
My dear countrymen, in a few days, there are many festivals and festivals coming next to us: Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi.
On Mahavir Jayanti, let us remember the sacrifice and penance of Lord Mahavira.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavira's preacher of non-violence is an inspiration for us.
I convey my best wishes to all fellow citizens on Mahavir Jayanti.
When Easter comes, we think that Jesus Christ, who desired peace, harmony, justice, mercy, and compassion, was heard.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2018
We have seen that the color of the sea is blue, but we know from our daily experience that there is no color of water.
Have we ever thought whether the sea, the water becomes colorful?
This question came to the mind of a young man in the decade of 1920.
This question was given by a great scientist in modern India.
When we talk of science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work in the field of light skating.
His discovery is known as the Raman Effect.
We celebrated National Science Day on 28th February every year, as it was said that he had discovered the Light Skating on this day, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargobind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose have brought glory to India.
The name of the famous Kana Boson named Satyendra Nath Bose has also been named.
Recently, I had the opportunity to attend a function in Mumbai, to inaugurate the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It is interesting to know about the extraordinary work being done in the field of science.
Artificial intelligence helps in the development of robot, boat and fixed working machines.
Nowadays, through self-learning, machines are making their intelligence smart.
This technology can help improve the lives of the poor, the deprived and the helpless.
On this occasion of Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientists that what kind of Artificial Intelligence can be used to ease the lives of our brothers and sisters
Can we have a better understanding of the natural disasters through Artificial Intelligence
Can Artificial Intelligence help us make the delivery of healthcare easier
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate the iCreate in Ahmedabad, Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel.
There was a young man saying that he has made such a digital instrument where if a person does not talk, then it changes into the mind by writing it in the instrument. And you can talk in such a way that you can talk to a person who is capable of speaking.
I think we can use Artificial Intelligence in many such things.
Science and Technology is a value addition.
You people are not involved in this thing.
Any machine that we want will do.
But it depends on us what we need to do with the machine.
Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, failed many times in his work.
When asked about this, he said, "I have searched 10,000 ways of not getting a light bulb," meaning editions made their failures even more powerful.
In fact, it is a privilege that today I am in the workplace of Maharshi Aravind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British administration, fought them, put their rule in question.
In this way, he questioned every aspect of life like a great sage, he sought answers, and guided humanity.
It's important to ask the truth again and again.
On National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, in times of crisis, I get a lot of messages about safety and disaster.People should write to me something or the other.
Shri Ravindra Singh from Pune has made a comment on the unhindered safety in the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He wrote that safety standards are not good at the place of factories and construction in our country.
If we are not aware of the safety issues in our daily lives, if we are not able to optimize the safety, then it is more difficult to ensure safety in times of any major crisis or crisis.
Except for natural disasters, most of the accidents are as a result of our mistakes.
If we are careful and follow the necessary rules, we will not only be able to save our lives but will also be able to protect the society from major accidents.
Sometimes we have noticed that there are several guidelines regarding safety in workplaces but those rules are not followed at all.
I request all the municipalities that have fire brigades, not once in a week, to perform mock drills for students at least once in a month in different schools.
It will be of two advantages - be it the habit of being vigilant and the new generation will learn a lot.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has taken the lead in dealing with disasters across the country.
A scheme called "Upda-Mitra" has been launched to impart training to volunteers in cyclone-affected districts.
Training and awareness is very important.
Two-three years ago, in Lu or Hit Wave, thousands of people lost their lives every year.
Since then, NDMA has organized workshops on Heat Wave to increase public awareness.
We get a good result of the collective efforts of all.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat waves declined unexpectedly in about 220.
By this it becomes clear that if we pay attention to safety then we can stay safe .
I would like to honor all those who are present at the scene in case of an accident and help those who are in need of rescue.
There is no dearth of people who know the names of heroes.
In addition to this, the brave soldiers of the Fire Rescue Services, the National Disaster Response Force, the Para-Military Force and the Armed Forces who have risked their lives and rescued them from the danger of their own lives.
India and other BIMSTEC countries, namely, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal, participated in the Exercise which was led by India a few days ago.
We all heard that many times.
But today if someone asks us about the flight, where is it, where is it, where is the live jacket, how to use it, I am sure no one can answer it.
If we all become aware about our safety then the safety of society is also included in it .
My dear countrymen, in this year's budget, emphasis has been laid on the production of waste to wealth and waste to energy through biogas in the villages to create a Swachh Bharat.
For this an effort has been started and its name has been given GOBAR DHAN i .e . Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources .
The objective of the GOBAR-Dhan Yojana is to make the villages clean and generate income and energy from the waste of animals, animal dung and other farm wastes after cultivation into compost and bio-gas.
The dung and other biological uses of animals and animals of any European country and China are ultimately used for energy production.
But it was not being fully utilized in India.
We are moving forward in this direction by including the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen scheme.
Livestock dung, waste after agriculture, kitchen waste are all set to be used for bio-gas based energy production.
Under the Gobar-Dhan scheme, the farmers of rural India, rural brothers and sisters will be encouraged so that they see dung and waste not only as waste but also as a source of income.
The use of biogas for cooking and power generation will lead to greater self-reliance.
This will help in increasing the income of farmers and livestock rearers.
New employment opportunities will be created in the areas of waste collection, transportation, bio-gas sales etc.
To ensure proper implementation of GobarDhan Scheme, an online trading platform will be created which will connect farmers with buyers so that farmers get fair price for their dung and agricultural waste.
I would like to appeal to the enthusiastic, especially the sisters living in the villages, to come forward and make full use of this opportunity by organizing the Self Help Groups.
I invite you all to join the movement of clean energy and green jobs, to convert the waste of your village into wealth and to create Gobar-Dhan.
But in Raipur of Chhattisgarh , where one has got the status of a unique event , that is the first ' Barza Mahotsav ' organized in this state .
The objective of the festival, organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation, was to increase awareness about cleanliness, create awareness about the various methods of garbage collection and garbage recycling.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, entire Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for showcasing the importance of garbage management and cleanliness in a unique way.
International Womens Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
There are many types of events in the country and the world .
On that day in the country through the award of Nari Shakti Puraskar all the women who have done exemplary work in the field of education in the past few days.
Today, the country is moving towards women led development rather than women development.
Today I am reminded of Swami Vivekanandas words.
150 years ago, Swami ji's ideas reflect the spirit of women power in Indian culture.
It is the responsibility of all of us to ensure the equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
Today, our Nari Shakti has instilled in us self-confidence and self-confidence, self-reliance through her work.
They have not only advanced themselves but have also taken the country and society forward and have worked to take them to a new height .
Finally, this is the dream of our New India where women are strong, strong and equal partners in the development of the country.
A few days ago, a person gave me a great advice.
He suggested that on 8th March, various programmes should be organized to celebrate Women's Day, but what can be done to honor the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village or city
- This number is not small - 15 lakh women organized a cleanliness drive for a month.
Starting from 26th January 2018, in just 20 days, these women have set a new example by constructing 1.70 lakh toilets.
14 lakh women, 2,000 women panchayats, 29,000 water-Sahiya (Water-Mith), 10,000 women Swachhagrahis and 50,000 women masons.
You can imagine how big this is!
These women of Jharkhand have shown that the women power, the power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which will change the cleanliness campaign in the daily life, the culture of cleanliness, in the form of a mass movement.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in the news that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence and how much happiness and enthusiasm was there among the people there.
You are well aware of the fact that Elephanta island is situated 10 kilometers away from Mumbai in the sea.
This is an important tourist destination.
I am surprised to know that despite being such a big centre of tourism in Mumbai, electricity has not reached the Elephanta after so many years of independence.
Till 70 years, the darkness that had descended on the lives of the people of Elephanta Island - the three villages of Rajbandar, Porbandar and Santbandar - has disappeared and their lives have been illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that now the village of Elephanta and the cave of Elephanta will be illuminated through electricity.
It is not just electricity but a new beginning in the direction of development.
My dear brothers and sisters, A few days ago, we celebrated Shivratri.
The importance of Holi is as much as the importance of Holi and because of this, evil is burnt to death and destroyed.
On the occasion of Holi, let us sit together in a pleasant mood, let us share the joys and joys of each other a beautiful moment and a festival of Holi a message of love, unity and harmony.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
And two days back we celebrated Republic Day in Sotoday .
This was the first time in history that leaders of 10 countries were present on this occasion .
My dear countrymen, Shri Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter to me today on the Narendra Modi App. He wished that I touch upon the contents of his letter.
He wrote, 1st February is the death anniversary of the space expedition Kalpana Chawla.
He took us out in the Columbia space shuttle mishap , but it has inspired millions of young people worldwide .
I express my gratitude to Bhai Prakash Ji for starting his long letter with the episode of Kalpana Chawla.
If there is a will and determination, if there is anger to do something, nothing is impossible.
The land of Takshila is completely irrigated by rivers and laden with flowers .
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee - I dont know how many names
Today we talk of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao but hundreds of years ago in our scriptures, it has been said in the Scandal Puranas - - - , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
This is the importance of women in our society.
And that is why women have been given the status of strength in our society.
This woman power binds the entire country, all the societies and families together.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has set many examples of this .
He has written, It will inspire our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to board the Sukhoi-30 fighter planes.
The three brave women have taken the lead in combating COVID-19 like Bhava Kanth, Mohan Singh and Avni Chaturvedi. They are currently undergoing training for flying in Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft.
Today there are several such sectors where women are the first to stay. Our women power is doing something or the other.
It has also been integrated on the Narendra Modi website as e-book.
Today women have an important role in the ongoing positive changes in the country and the society .
Today, when we are discussing about women empowerment, I would like to mention about a railway station.
One railway station and women empowerment. You might be wondering what could be the connection.
Matunga railway station of Mumbai is the first railway station in India which is run by the whole of the country .
Women workers in all categories .
Be it the Commercial Division, Railway Police, Ticketing Exams, Announcement People, Point Persons, more than 40 women personnel are handling the station.
Today our Nari Shakti is leading from the front .
When it comes to tribal women, a picture comes to the mind of everyone. There will be forests, mountains and hills, there will be a glimpse of the girls moving ahead in their minds.
But our tribal women in Chhattisgarh, our Nari Shakti has made a new mark in front of the country.
Dantewara area of Chhattisgarh is located in the Maoist infested region .
Violence , torture , bombs , guns , guns - the Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere there .
In such a scenario, the tribal women are making themselves self-reliant by putting their e-rickshaw .
In a very short span of time , all the women there became partners in this process .
While on the one hand they are empowering themselves through self-employment on the other, on the other hand they are also transforming the image of Maoist infested region.
Along with all this , special emphasis is being given on environment conservation .
I also appreciate the district administration there. From grant-in-aid to training, the district administration is playing an important role in the success of these women.
We have been hearing this again and again that people say: There is something that does not lose our existence.
Elimination of any negative outcome, taking into account reforms that are necessary.
And the speciality of our society is - , the process of self-improvement goes on continuously .
The identity of any living society is linked to the process of its own revision .
Centuries-long efforts against social evils and evils are continuing in our country individually and socially.
Through this campaign an attempt is made to create awareness against social curses like child marriage and love affair .
He was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to fight against the evils of nepotism and child marriage.
Children, aged, enthusiastic and energetic young people, mothers and sisters - all have contributed to this fight.
From the historical Gandhi Maidan of Patna to the border of human chain starting from here is continuously being connected .
This kind of superstitions are very important for the real development of people in the society.
Come, let us together pledge to rid the society of such evils and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I congratulate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration there, and every person involved in the human chain for coming up with such special and comprehensive issues for the welfare of the society.
My dear countrymen, Shri Darshan from Mysore, Karnataka has written in MyGov that every year Rs 6000 was spent for his father's treatment.
He was not aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana earlier.
But when she came to know about Jan Aushadi Kendras then at the time of purchase of medicines at the rate of 75 % less price has come .
He wished that I should talk about Mann Ki Baat while talking about it so that it can reach out to a large number of people.
Many people have written about it since last several years .
I have also seen several videos and social media taking advantage of this scheme.
And when I get to know that kind of thing, I feel very happy.
A lot of satisfaction is obtained .
And I am also very happy that this idea has come into the mind of Shri Darshan ji , that the benefit that he has got is also received by others .
With this people , especially the elderly who have been compelled to take medicines on a daily basis , have got economic benefit .
The life threatening medicine is made from here according to the approved quality of the World Health Organisation .
This is the very reason that quality medicines are available at affordable prices .
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadi Kendras have been established in the country .
These not only provide cheap medicines but also provide employment to the private entrepreneurs .
Medicines are available at cheap rates in the Amrit stores of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendra and hospitals .
The only reason behind this is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country, in order to build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a film on the Narendra Modi App.
That picture was such that my attention was drawn towards that picture .
The film was a grandson of a grandson who joined his grandfather in the Clean Morna River Cleanliness drive.
I am aware that the citizens of Akola had organized a cleanliness campaign to clean the Morna river through the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morna river used to pass through twelve months earlier, but now it is dependent on the season.
The second thing which is sad is that the river was full of jungles and squirrels .
The river and its surroundings were brimful .
This is why an action plan was made and one day before Makar Sankranti from 13 January itself in the first phase of Mission Clean Morna at a distance of fourteen kilometres both the sides of the Morna river were cleaned .
This cleanliness drive was carried out on 20th January as well and I have been told that till the Morna river becomes completely clean, this campaign will continue every Saturday morning.
This means that if people decide to do something then nothing is impossible.
A big change can be brought about in the Jan Andolan .
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and the municipal administration, all the citizens involved in this task of making this work a mass movement, and your efforts are extremely commendable.
My dear countrymen, you have also heard a lot about Padma awards recently.
Discussion of this on newspaper and television has attracted attention .
But if you look at it carefully, you will be proud of it. You will be proud of the fact that what kind of great people are among us and naturally you will be proud of the fact that today the common man of our country is reaching such heights without any recommendation.
There is a tradition of giving Padma awards every year but in the last three years its complete process has changed .
Now any citizen can nominate any person .
For the entire process being online a sanitization has come in it .
The nearest railway station from Todikkulam - Thalassery is at a distance of 34 K . .
Padma awards have been given to all those people in big cities , in news papers , on TV , in shows .
Now there is no identity of an individual in the award process. The importance of his work is increasing.
You might have heard about Mr. Arvind Gupta.
He has been making toys from things left for four decades , which can increase the curiosity of youth towards science .
His efforts are such that the children are inspired in the direction of scientific experiments with unnecessary things .
For this children in all the three thousand schools of the country making an inspiration by showing films made in 18 languages are being encouraged .
One such story is that of Sitaba Jodati of Karnataka .
She is not called ' the goddess of women 's empowerment ' .
For the last three decades in Belagavi , she has done the work of changing the lives of countless women .
He dedicated himself as a slave when he was seven years old but later he contributed his entire life for the welfare of the slave .
Not only this, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You can hear the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh . Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a poor family and tribal family .
He did a little job of living his life but he was fond of producing traditional tribal paintings .
Today, for this happiness, not only in India but all over the world is respected.
His pictures are exhibited in several countries like Netherlands , Germany , England , Italy etc .
The credit of bringing Indian name to foreign countries goes to Bhejhu Shyamji and he has been given the Padma Shri .
You will be surprised to know the stories of the tribal women of Kerala ' Lakshmikutti ' .
There is a park of herbal vegetation near Sahyadri Ayurveda Center where in essential medical herbs have been used .
He made five hundred herbal medicines on the basis of his memory .
He has the ability to make the medicine of snake bite .
Lakshmiji is continuously serving people with her knowledge of this herbal medicine .
He has been honored with Padmashree for his contribution in the society by identifying this unknown person .
Today, I would like to mention one more name, the seventy five year old Subhashini Mistry of West Bengal has also been selected for the award.
Subhashini Mishram is such a woman who sold vegetables to other people for getting hospitalization .
When she was twenty-three years old, her husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired her to build a hospital for the poor.
Today thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost at the hospital built due to his hard work .
I am convinced that there are many such gems and jewellery of our treasures which no one knows or knows.
At times in schools and colleges such people should be brought and acquainted with their experiences .
There should be some effort in the society outside the award .
My dear countrymen, every year we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
This is the day when Pujya Mahatma Gandhi came back to India from South Africa .
Today we celebrate unbreakable bond between Indians and Indians living in different parts of the world .
This year on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Divas we organized a program where all the MPs and Mayors of different countries of the world were invited .
You will be happy to know that in this program, Indian origin Parliamentarians and Mayors from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, UK, Suriname, South Africa, America and many other countries have participated.
Our Indian descendants who live in different countries of Europe - someone working on cyber security, someone in Ayurveda - some are also enjoying the heart of the society through music or poetry .
I would like to thank the European Union for their commendable work, for recognizing the Indian Diaspora and through them, to the people of the entire world.
Pujya Bapu had given a new direction to all of us .
This was not just the original theory .
Even today we can see at every step how accurate the message of Bapu was .
If we take a pledge that we will follow the path shown by Bapu, what can be a greater tribute than what can be done
My dear countrymen, I conclude by conveying my best wishes to all of you on the 2,000-18th of this month.
Namaskar .
Mann Ki Baat, December, 2017
This is the last episode of Mann Ki Baat in the year 2017 and look at the wonderful ending, the last day of the year 2017.
This year, I and you have shared a lot of things.
In Mann Ki Baat, the exchange of your letters, comments and comments fills me with a new zeal.
It's gonna change a few hours later, but this continuity of our communication will continue.
In the coming new year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
My best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018
Just a few days ago, the festival of Holy Christmas was celebrated with great fanfare across the globe.
The festival is celebrated with great fanfare all over India.
In this period of Christmas, we remember the teachings and teachings of Jesus Christ and the emphasis on Jesus Christ was service.
This spirit of service is also reflected in the Sarasvati Bible.
Ramakrishna Paramhansdev had also said that Lord Shiva should serve life in knowledge and every word has human values throughout the world.
My dear countrymen, this year was also the year of Guru Gobind Singh ji's 350th Prakash Parv.
In a way, Gurus, poets, philosophers and great warriors, all these qualities have inspired people with great inspiration.
He has taught us to be vigilant against injustice and atrocities and has shown us the path to freedom from caste and creed.
And in this effort, he had to lose a lot in his personal life, but he never gave up his emotions.
Every moment of his life was full of love, sacrifice and peace.
Let us take inspiration from Guru Gobind Singh ji's teachings and his great philosophy of life and follow his ideals in our lives.
You are surprised to know that the new year comes every time and the pirates also come every time, what can be a special day
The entire India is looking forward to welcoming you in India in the 21st century.
You too are proud of yourselves in the history of the 21st century voters.
The power of reconciliation is the greatest strength of democracy.
You can also play an important role in the construction of the 21st century India and it will start from January 1st.
In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had specially tried to address the strong and determined youth of the age group of 18-25 years with their life-force.
I believe that our dream of a New India will be realised only by the strength and skills of this life-enriched youth.
The New India that we are talking about is an India free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
A free India from filth and poverty.
New India, whose driving force is peace, unity and goodwill.
Make a path for yourselves, connect those who are connected with you, and let the party prosper and move forward.
Think about how we plan before 2022
Mahatma Gandhi transformed the freedom movement into a peoples movement.
My young friends, it is the need of the hour that we should also turn the dream of a beautiful 21st century, a strong India into a mass movement.
Today, a lot of opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and becoming successful.
I would like to think about how the news of these projects can be found anywhere in the New India Youth and develop such a system so that at the age of 80, he can easily know about all these things in this world and he can take advantage of it.
My dear countrymen, in the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had talked about my positiveness with you.
Nothing is impossible for a person full of positivity and enthusiasm.
In English too, people say- "Passsimism Leadstu Wicknesses, Optimism to Power".
In the previous Mann Ki Baat programme, I had appealed to the people of the country to share their positive moments in 2017 and welcome 2018 in a positive atomsphere.
I am happy that a large number of people have shared their experiences and positive feedback on the social media platforms, MyGov and the Narendra Modi App.
Lakhs of tweets have been posted on Positive India hashtag (), which has reached out to more than 1.5 billion people.
The transmission of an economic activity that has started in India has spread all over the world.
There was a real inspection of the tweets and responses.
There was a feeling of happiness.
Some countrymen deliberated on the positive impact of the events of this year on their minds.
Some people shared their personal experiences.
Sound by # My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Phase One, Delhi.
# My name Jyoti Rajendra grew.
And he died in the accident.
We know what happened to us at that time.
We were greatly helped by this government and we were able to take care of the situation.
# I'm glad my name is.
The National Highway was constructed in 2017 from different villages near our village.
Two incidents that have happened to our Indian soldiers - the surgical strike done by the Pakistani soldiers - the launch pad of the radicals - have been carried out in Pakistan and at the same time, the valour shown by our Indian soldiers in Dokalam is unparalleled.
My name is Satish Bewani.
In the last 40 years, there was a water crisis in our region and we were dependent on the pipelines constructed for the army.
Now we've got a pipe line.
So in 2017, we didn't get a bigger one.
There are many people who are working at their own level to bring a positive change in the lives of many people.
In reality, this is the New India that we all are building together.
Come, let us enter 2018 with all these little joys, start a new year and take strong steps towards a positive India.
When we're all talking about the positive, I'm willing to share one thing.
Recently, I came to know about the inspiring story of Kashmir's Administrative Service, Topper Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak.
He left no stone unturned to test Kashmir's Administrative Service.
You will be surprised to know that in 1990, the insurgents burnt his ancestral home.
There was so much prejudice and violence that his family had to leave their families in their ancestral home.
The atmosphere of violence around a small child was enough to create darkness and bitterness in the heart but this was not allowed to happen.
He never gave up hope.
Today he is getting inspiration not only from Jammu and Kashmir but from the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that whatever the situation may be, a positive action can be taken to destroy the cloud of despair.
Just last week, I had a meeting with some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
The more I have spent with those daughters, the more I have inspired them. And this is the strength of the country, this is the strength of our youth, this is the future of our country.
My dear countrymen, whenever a discussion takes place on the famous religious places of the world, it is very natural to have a discussion about the Sabarimala temple in Kerala.
The world famous temple has witnessed the presence of crores of devotees every year on the occasion of the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami.
How big a challenge can be to maintain cleanliness in such a large area where such a large number of devotees come
And especially those places which are situated in the mountains and forests.
P.
A police officer named Vijayan started a program called Punyam Punkavanam and started a cleanliness drive to increase awareness about cleanliness.
It is the rule of this campaign that a pilgrim is not able to complete his pilgrimage, unless he performs some or the other physical work for cleanliness.
There is no distinction between small and big in this campaign.
Every pilgrim is engaged in cleanliness activities as a part of the worship of God, he is engaged in cleaning the garbage.
Every morning, a wonderful sight of this cleanliness is visible, and all the pilgrims participate in it.
Be it a celebrity or rich person, or be a great officer or be it a common pilgrim, all of them should participate in the Punyamban and develop themselves with cleanliness.
There are many such examples for the countrymen.
This cleanliness drive was carried out in Sabarimala and the Punyambanam was successful and all the pilgrims participated in it.
And we have pledged that when Bapu will be the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will do something or the other to give a Swachh Bharat to his dream.
Efforts are being made all over the country for cleanliness.
A large number of people are participating in rural as well as urban areas.
The largest ever Swachh Survekshan-2018 survey in the world will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to assess the progress made in cleanliness at the city level.
The scheme will cover around 400 million people in over 4000 cities.
The Swachhta App will help in streamlining the procedures and improving the services sector.
It will be seen that every citizen of the city gets involved in the process of making the city clean and it changes into the habit of the city.
My dear countrymen, some things seem very small in their eyes, but they go far and wide in the interest of a society.
Today, I am mentioning one such event in Mann Ki Baat.
This injustice has been done to Muslim women for decades
And, Muslim women of our country are not given that right.
I like it. Our government has taken care of it.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken important steps in this direction and has also changed the tradition of 70 years to remove those hurdles.
Today a Muslim woman can go to Haj without Mehram and it is my pleasure that this time around 1300 Muslim women have applied to go for Haj without Mehram and from different parts of the country - from Kerala to North India, Muslim women from all over the country have expressed their desire to go for Haj.
I have suggested to the Minority Affairs Ministry that those women who want to go to Haj alone should get permission in their spirit.
Our efforts will ensure that our women have equal rights, equal opportunities, equal opportunities for them to take on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26th is a historic day in our country.
26th January, 2018.
This has never happened in the history of India.
The year 2017 was significant for ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years and 2017 India completed 25 years of cooperation with ASEAN countries.
It is a matter of great pride for us that on 26 January 2020, ten great leaders of the world met together.
My dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals, in a way our country is a country of festivals.
Probably not a day when there's no food.
Recently, we all celebrated Christmas, and the New Year is on its way.
May the New Year bring happiness, prosperity and happiness to all of you.
Let us move forward with new initiatives, new zeal, new hope and resolve, and let the country move forward.
The solar eclipse took place in January and the Makar Sankranti festival takes place.
It is a festival associated with nature.
On the one hand, every animal is connected to nature in some way or the other, but the way we celebrate these events in our culture is different.
The 13th to 17th January, 2019, was celebrated as the National Guest of Honour.
The names of these Parv are different but there is only one element in it - the combination of nature and agriculture.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the Parv.
New Year 2018 greetings to all of you
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
There may not be a single person in the whole of India who doesnt remember or honor him.
He is a witness to the maturity of all of us and the events of the country.
He completed 90 years on 28 September.
On the eve of my foreign visit, I had the opportunity to speak to my sister on phone.
Just like a young brother spoke to his elder sister with great respect.
Modi ji: Latadi, Namah.
I'm talking to Narendra Modi.
Lata ji: Salute.
Modi ji: I made a call because this time on your birthday, I will be busy traveling in the air.
Modi ji: I will come back on the 28th of this month at night, and on the 29th of this morning, I will pass your birthday.
Okay, okay.
Lata ji: Many people are older in age, but with their work they get the blessings of the elder ones.
Yeah, but I think this is the blessing of my parents and the blessings of all the listeners.
Modi ji:...
I am even happier when you say that your mother was Gujarati...
No, I don't want to hurt you anymore because I can see and know how busy you are and how much you have.
How much to think.
When you brought your mother's feet, I sent someone to her, to seek her blessings.
Modi ji: My mother too was very happy to see your love.
Once again, my best wishes to you on your birthday.
But I was so busy that I couldn't take time.
Yes, yes, of course!
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, the festive season will take place once again with a new zeal and resolve.
It's the festival season!
The celebration of the festival will continue to be celebrated across the country for weeks to come.
The house will be filled with happiness.
But you must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of this joy of festivals.
And this is the name of darkness under the lamp.
Probably this saying is not just a word, it is an instruction for us, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Think, some houses on the one hand are illuminated by the light;
On the other hand, in front of him, there are people in the dark.
In some houses, sweets are spoiled, in some houses children are drunk for sweets.
At least, the excess or runoff of the house can be delivered.
Start-ups are being set up in several cities by the young friends of NGOs.
They collect clothes, sweets, food from the people's homes, then they find the needy and send the things to them quietly.
In this festive season, can we wake up from the darkness of light, with complete awareness and resolution
Lakshmi was welcomed in the traditional tradition.
Women are considered to be the Lakshmi of our culture because they bring happiness and prosperity.
Can we make a universal programme of respecting women in our society, in our villages and cities this year
Can we have a programme to honour all the Lakshmis of India in this Diwali
There are many daughters around us and there are many brides who are doing extraordinary work.
Some are working to educate the poor children, some are creating awareness about cleanliness and health, some are serving the society as a doctor-inginia, some are trying to get justice for others as a lawyer.
Let our society take pride in the honour and respect of these women.
May the scheme of honouring them all over the country.
You can do one more thing, share the credit of these girls on social media as much as possible and use Hashtagbharatkilaxmi.
As we all carried out a massive campaign called Selfie with Daughter which had spread all over the world.
My dear countrymen, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I have said earlier that it is a great privilege that I have had the opportunity to talk to many unknown people directly or indirectly.
A few days ago, a student from far-flung Arunachal Pradesh, Auli has sent a very interesting letter to me.
I am from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
I am very happy to read the book. I felt that it would be of great benefit to me if I read the book before it was examined.
I liked a lot of things in this book, but I also noticed that there are many suggestions for the students in this book, but there is not much for the parents and the teachers in this book.
So see, my young friends too have the confidence that if a servant of the country talks about something, it will happen.
My young student friend, I thank you for writing the letter first.
Thank you for reading Ekazam Warriors two-three times.
If I take time out for the new version, I will definitely try to write something for parents and teachers.
But I'll make an appeal to all of you.
Can you help me?
I will definitely look into it.
I will think about it and I will definitely try to write it in my own language, in my own way.
It may also be that if your suggestions come in large numbers, my new version will also be confirmed.
So I'll wait for your opinion.
I once again thank our young student friend Arunachali Thyung.
My dear countrymen, you are familiar with the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of the country through newspaper, TV and also through news papers.
But you know that I am an ordinary person like you.
I heard the speech and saw the match.
The simplicity and outpouring of the 23-year-old Daniel Medvedev touched the heart of everyone.
I must be impressed.
Just a short while before that speech, he won 19 medals and won the finals at the finals of the Grandslem winner and Lieutenant Raphael Nanda of Tennessee.
In that situation, someone else would have been sad and disappointed.
He has set a shining example of Sportsman Spirit by praising his rivals even after losing the finals.
On the other hand, Champion Nadal also appreciated the game.
The morale of the medal winners and the bravery of the medal winners are both academic and sports.
If you are not listening to the speeches of Daniels, I would like to appeal to everyone, especially the youth to watch the video.
It has a lot to learn for people of all ages and all walks of life.
There are moments that go beyond defeat and those moments that teach us to win and win.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, what I am going to say now is only for your good.
Debate, discussion and dialogue should continue, but should be resolved before any issue has been resolved.
Otherwise, the problem takes a big one and it is difficult to solve it.
If we become aware at the beginning, many things can be saved.
With this feeling, I feel that my young friends should definitely talk about something important.
We all know that tobacco addiction is so harmful for health and it is a difficult task to get rid of this maladies.
Tobacconicotin makes intoxication.
Taking tobacco in childhood causes harm to the brain as well.
All of us are aware of these things, but today I want to inform you about something new.
You are aware that recently restrictions have been imposed on e-cigarettes in India.
These e-cigarettes are different from the common cigarettes.
The e-cigarette heats the nicotine-containing fluids and generates a chemical smoke that causes nicotine to enter the body.
We are aware of the dangers of the common city, but there is a misconception about e-cigarette that it is not harmful.
It uses fragrant chemicals to avoid stinking of ordinary cigarettes.
We generally see that in a family, if a father is a chain smoker, then he should try that no one else in his family smokes.
And the little cigarette in Chanwaris to keep them away from the beads.
Those who are selling, those who are buying or watching, all know that the cigarettes are harmful.
But the e-cigarette issue is very different.
There is little awareness among people about this.
The general public is not aware of the harmful effects of e-cigarette and therefore the e-cigarette has entered the house.
There are times when children are playing magic in front of their parents. Without the fire, I am smoking smoke without the patriots and playing with e-cigarette and elders give applause.
You know, when someone around us ate cigarettes, we can smell it.
Even with a packet of cigarettes in the pocket, it smells like that.
However, in the case of e-cigarette, the young people know that whether it is in ignorance or in a fashion statement, they wander in their own bag, in the middle of books or in the hands of a person, they fall prey to this intoxication.
Youth power is the future of our country.
E-cigarette has been banned so that these new drugs do not destroy our country, do not destroy the family's dreams and do not ruin the lives of the children.
In a way, this disease of intoxication cannot root out in the society.
I appeal to all of you to quit smoking and stop pretending to be confused about the e-cigarette.
You must remember Fit India.
'Fit India' means not just going to gym for two hours in the morning and evening.
To avoid all these misconceptions, the name of Fit India is also called Fit India.
I believe you don't want to be upset about me, but you'll like it.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a great privilege for us that India is the birth place and place of those great personalities who have dedicated their lives for not only themselves but for others.
Our India, our land is a land of many gems.
Many of the gems of the country have been gifted by this country.
It is a matter of pride for all of us that the entire country is going to be honoured on October 13 in Vatican City.
On that day, Pope Francis is going to declare Mariam Thresia a Saint.
Sister Mariam Thresia, who made immense contribution to the welfare of mankind in the short span of 50 years, is an example in the whole world.
I once again pay my tributes to Sister Mariam Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially my Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride for not only India but for the entire world that today when we are celebrating Gandhi 150, at the same time 130 crore Indians have pledged to completely stop the use of single use plastic.
The way India has been at the forefront of protecting the environment in the world, the world is now looking at India.
I am confident that on October 2, you will all be involved in the single-use anti-plastic campaign.
People have contributed to this campaign in their own way.
However, a young man from our country has started a unique campaign.
His work attracts my attention and I talk to him over phone and try to understand and understand his new plan.
Maybe his words will be useful to other people of the country.
When I first heard the word plogging, it was new to me too.
Probably this word is used in foreign countries at a very low level.
Modi ji: Hello Ripudham ji, I am Narendra Modi ji.
With this, we will not only take care of our own health, but will also protect the health of our mother Earth.
I believe that if 130 crore Indians take a pledge in this direction, our country will take 130 crore steps towards creating a single use plastic free India.
Ripu Damanji, thank you once again
My dear countrymen, the preparations for October 2nd are going on all over the country and the world, but we want to take Gandhi 150 to our path of duty.
I want to dedicate my life for the welfare of the nation.
It is our dream of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' and that is why every year on 31st October we have organized 'Run for Unity' in the entire country.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August, I had said from the Red Fort that by 2022, you would visit 15 places in India.
Go to at least 15 places and try to stay there for one night.
Look, understand, feel India.
We have so much diversity.
On the occasion of Diwali, when the festival of Diwali is celebrated, everyone goes on a trip, so I request you all to visit 15 places in India.
You will be glad to know that India has made significant improvements in the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index and this has been possible only because of the cooperation of all of you.
This has been achieved especially due to the understanding of the importance of sailing.
That is, we have come a long way in this period.If we try our best, we will be able to secure a place in the world tourism sector even before 75 years of independence.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of various festivals of India.
It will also be ensured that on the days of Diwali, there is no fire or no harm to the people.
Once again, my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
Six days after Diwali, Chhath is one of the greatest festivals of all time in our country.
From food to clothing, every aspect is traditionally practiced.
The unique nature of Chhath Puja and the worship of nature is completely associated with it.
On the one hand, the sun and water, the worship centres of Mahaparshottam Rupala, on the other hand, utensils made of bamboo and clay, and related items related to its worship.
It also includes the expression of cleanliness in our lives.
Before Chhath, all the people come together to clean the entire house and to clean the river, pond, and place of worship in the neighborhood of Khakhand.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja - is a part of environmental protection, disease prevention and discipline.
This practice of eating prasadam by arguing that it destroys pride and this pride hinders the path of progress of a person.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I am confident that Mann Ki Baat has tied up with the people of the country.
Take the example of Khadi and handlooms.
I am glad to hear that the sale of just one store in Khadi and handloom has increased so much.
The sale of Khadi Gift coupons has gone up by about 600 to 80 during Diwali.
The total sales of Khadi and handicrafts has registered a growth of nearly 90 over the previous year.
It has been observed that today the youth, the elderly, the women, every age group likes Khadi and handloom.
I can imagine the benefits of this scheme to the families of the poor, poor families and the families working in the handloom sector.
And we talked about Khadi for Fashion but in the last few years, I can say this thing from the bottom of my heart that after Khadi for Nation and Khadi for Fashion, now Khadi for Transformation is taking that place.
Khadi has become a powerful tool to transform the lives of the poorest of the poor, and to empower the poorest of the poor.
He has played a crucial role in the development of the country.
Shri Rajan Bhatt has written on the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about my Diwali experience with the Defence Forces and he also wants to know how the Defence Forces observes Diwali.
Shri Tejas Gaikwad has also written on the Narendra Modi App: What can be done to bring our home-made gifts to the Defence Forces
We also think of our brave defence forces.
We also think that we need to reach the soldiers of the country with the sweetness of our homes.
All of you must have spent Diwali in joy.
For me, Diwali has come with a special experience.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with our brave Defence Forces once again in a row.
This time, the festival of Diwali with the security forces in the Gurej Sector in Jammu and Kashmir is an unforgettable experience for me.
On behalf of all the people of the country, I salute every soldier of our defence forces for their dedication and sacrifice, that is why our security forces protect the country from the harsh conditions on the border.
When we get the opportunity, when we get the opportunity, we should know the experiences of our soldiers and listen to them with pride.
Many of us do not know that the soldiers of our defence forces are playing an important role not only in the border but also in bringing peace to the entire world.
They have brought glory to India in the world as a UN Peace Keeping Force.
A few days ago, on the 24th of October, the United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world.
The efforts of the United Nations in bringing peace to the world have a positive role to play.
And we believe in 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' that is, the whole world is our family.
And because of this belief, from the very beginning, India has been actively contributing to various important initiatives of the United Nations.
You must be aware that the proposal of the Constitution of India and the proposal of U.N. Charter, both begin with the words We the People.
India has always emphasized on equal rights of women and is a living example of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
In its opening remarks, it was proposed that All Man and Burn Free and Equivalence, which was replaced by an effort by Indian Representative Hungsa Mehta, was followed by 'All Man and Burn Free and Equivalence'.
Although it seems to be a small change, but we have a vision of a healthy thinking.
India has made one of the most significant contributions to the UN peace keeping efforts.
In the UN peacekeeping Mission, India has always played a major role.
There are many of you who may be aware of this information for the first time.
More than 80,000 defence personnel have contributed to the UN Peacekeeping Operations.
Today, nearly 7000 soldiers of India are associated with United Nations Peacekeeping Operations and this is the third highest in the world.
Till August 2017, about 50 of the world's 71 Peace Keeping efforts have made their contribution.
These efforts are underway in several parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan, etc.
In Congo and South Sudan, more than 20,000 patients have been treated and many have been rescued.
The Indian defence forces have not only protected the people of different countries, but have also won their hearts by striving for peace there.
Indian women have played a leading role in the peace process.
Very few people know that India is the first country to send women police units to Liberia under United Nations Peacekeeping Operations.
And see, this step of India has become an inspiration for all the countries since then.
Since then, all the countries have started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to hear that Indias role is not limited to just peace and security, but it is also training the 85-member Peace Keeping Force.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, the peace-loving forces of our Bahadur Shastri are spreading the message of peace across the world.
The mission of peace and security is not at all easy.
Our security forces have to work in remote and inaccessible areas.
They have to understand different situations and different cultures.
Remembering him, every countryman is proud of him.
He was a member of the United Nations Peace Keeping Force - a man who was honoured with the Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji is a member of the Indian Peace Keeping Force, who has also received recognition at Cyprus.
In 1989, at the age of 72, he was appointed as the Commander of the Armed Forces in an expedition to Namibia and served in order to secure the independence of Namibia.
General Thimayya, former Chief of the Army Staff, led the United Nations Peace Keeping Force in Cyprus and served in peace.
As ambassadors of peace, India has always spread the message of peace, unity and goodwill to the world.
We believe that each one of us can live a peaceful and harmonious life and strive to build a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our sacred land, this India, is firmly rooted to all the great men who have selflessly served humanity.
Sister Nivedita, who is known as our beloved and respected Nivedita, is one of the greatest personalities.
Margaret Elizabeth was born to Nobel in Ireland and later she was named as 'Nivedita' by Swami Vivekananda.
Nivedita means a person who is fully committed.
He later proved his name as real majesty.
Yesterday was Sister Niveditas 150th birth anniversary.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his life for the poor and the downtrodden, by giving up his life for happiness and good health.
Sister Nivedita suffered a lot in the atrocities of the British Raj.
The British tried to force the Indians to be treated not only physically but also mentally as servants and slaves.
There was always an attempt to bring down our culture.
Sister Nivedita took pride in Indian culture.
It inspires, awakens and helps the people to come together.
He went around the world and spoke against the spread of Sanatan Dharma and philosophy.
The famous nationalist Tamil poet Subramaniam Bharti will be immortal for his revolutionary poems Pudumei Penin, New Women and Nari Sashaktikaran.
It is said that Sister Nivedita was the source of inspiration for all these things.
Sister Nivedita had also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose in many ways.
Through his writings and conferences, Shri Bose was instrumental in the publication and dissemination of all the tests.
This is a wonderful coincidence that the spirituality and science of our culture are complementary to each other.
Sister Nivedita and Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose on this occasion.
In 1899, a 100-year-old man died in the clutches of deadly plague in the city of Kolkata.
Sister Nivedita, who neglected her health and well-being, had come forward on the road to clean the river.
This is the woman who gave up the luxury and happiness and gave herself up for the poor and the needy.
Sister Nivedita who gave her everything she gave to India.
Of course, that's the truth.
This will be our tribute to this great personality - if every Indian takes his life away and follows his path of service.
Thank you for your phone.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on the occasion of the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
Children are one of the most important organs of building a New India and are the future heroes.
The diseases that were earlier prevalent in our country are now visible in our childhood.
I wonder if it's true that children are victims of diabetes these days.
But now our lives have changed a lot.
These days, these diseases are called lifestyle disorders.
The main cause of illness in young age is lack of physical labor and change in food habits.
There is a need to focus on both the society and the family.
It may be noted that there is no need for any unusual or serious change.
What is needed is to focus on small things and get them covered under their habits.
I want the family members to be vigilant so that children can play in open fields.
If possible, the elders of the family should also participate in it.
Children should be taught the habit of using stairs instead of lift.
After dinner, the whole family should walk with the kids.
Yoga will help our youth to develop the habit of healthy living and prevent lifestyle disorders.
Yoga is simple because it can be taught in Yoga.
There is no need for special equipment or field.
A number of tests are being conducted on this issue which is effective in controlling diabetes.
There is a lot of work going on in AIIMS as well and the results that have been achieved so far are very promising.
He said that Ayurveda and Yoga should not be treated as merely a means of healing but should also become part of our daily lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, the world of sports has received good news over the past few days.
There is good news for India in badminton like hockey.
Badminton star Kidambi Srikanth won the Grand Finale and made every Indian proud.
After Indonesia Open and Australian Open, it won her third Super Series.
I congratulate these youth for their success and for the pride of India.
Friends, it was in this month that the FIFA U-17 World Cup was organized.
Teams from many countries of the world have come to India to participate in this event and their sporting talent has impressed us.
I had a chance to watch a match.
The audience was very enthusiastic about the game.
World Cup big event, where the world's eyes are on you.
I was surprised to see the enthusiasm, zeal and enthusiasm of the young players.
World Cup has been organized successfully and all teams have shown their best.
Even if India does not win the title, the players of India have won the hearts of all.
India and the entire world have enjoyed this festival of sports and the football tournament for football lovers was also very interesting.
The future of football is very bright and has a glimpse of it.
I once again congratulate all the players, their colleagues and all the sports enthusiasts.
My dear countrymen, if I have to deal with the people who have written to me on the subject of Swachh Bharat, then I have to do Mann Ki Baat every day and discuss about cleanliness.
The success of the team of youngsters is reflected in the efforts being made by some young children.
There is an incident of innovation somewhere about cleanliness. Now there is an enthusiasm for the work of an officer.
A few days ago, I got a report on the renovation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
An NGO called Ecological Protection Organization carried out a cleanliness drive in the Chandrapur Fort.
They sent me two pictures before and after Safai.
I was astonished to see that the young women of Ecological Protection Organization have seen the work of hard work, determination, perseverance and self-reliance in the film.
They're gonna get rid of your depression, your unbelief.
This Bhairotha effort for cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, teamwork and hard work.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of all the people of the country to protect and preserve the historical heritage.
I congratulate all the employees of the Ecological Protection Organization and the people of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of November, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji is not the first Guru of the Sikh community, he is the first Guru of the world.
He spoke of the welfare of the entire human race, and gave the message of equanimity to all communities.
He stressed on the importance of women self-respect and empowerment.
Guru Nanak Dev had travelled 28,000 kms and spread the message of humanity on this journey.
He has joined people, who have guided them on the path of honesty, sacrifice and hard work.
He did not just say that he has done it in his life and work.
He started the lawns and served the people.
Together, eating the food at the lawns creates unity and harmony.
Guru Nanak has said - , , , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : ) : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : ) : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : ) : , : , : , : , : , : ) : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , ) : , : , , :
Guru Nanak used to compose the Gurbani in order to convey his message.
Guru Nanaks 550th birth anniversary will be celebrated in 2019.
Let us try to keep pace with his teachings and teachings.
My dear countrymen, two days later on 31st October, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We all know that he was the architect of unbroken modern India.
We can learn a lot from the extraordinary life of this great son of Mother India.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had done the job of uniting India.
Crores of Indians were ensured by the umbrella of 'One Nation, One Constitution'.
His wisdom gave us the power to overcome all obstacles.
He has set a target and has set that goal on its full swing.
He used to say - , , , , , , , , , That is, a nation that dreams of a nation that has equal rights for all.
I want this message from Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel to continue to inspire us.
He had said that we cannot change the diversity of the caste and community. Every man and woman in India should shape the future of the people who do not have love and goodwill.
Sardar Saheb's words are still a source of inspiration and strength for our New India vision.
That is why his birthday will be celebrated as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas.
His contribution to our country as a unit is unforgettable.
On the occasion of Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary on 31st October, Run for Unity will be organized all over the country, where children, women, youth and elders will be involved.
I request all of you to participate in the Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali, you have returned with a new resolve, with a new dedication to your daily lives.
My best wishes to you all for fulfilling all your dreams.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2017
It completed 3 years to achieve Mann Ki Baat through All India Radio.
Today is the 36th edition.
Most of them encourage me.
And I take half an hour of your time in a month, but people keep reaching out for the 30 days of Mann Ki Baat.
And what has happened is that the government too is sensitive, how strong it is in the far-flung areas of the society.
And that is why this journey of three years of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of the countrymen - their thinking and their feelings.
And perhaps, in such a short span of time, I am extremely grateful to the people of the country for this opportunity.
I always remember Acharya Vinoba Bhave's words in Mann Ki Baat.
Acharya Vinoba Bhave used to say that non-government, effective.
I am sure that after three years, social scientists, universities, researchers and media experts will definitely analyse this.
And I believe that this discussion will be of great use in the future for Mann Ki Baat and it will bring a new consciousness and a new spirit.
And once I had said in Mann Ki Baat, we should think about eating as much as we need and dont waste it.
But then I have seen that there have been so many letters from every corner of the country, many social organizations, many new youths have been doing this work since long ago.
And then I have seen how many people have come forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
Once I see the Selfie with Daughter of a Panchayat in Haryana and I keep this in front of everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
Not just in India, but Selfie with Daughter started a big campaign all over the world.
A few days ago, I was in touch with the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
Click here to see the President's message in Hindi
Lakhs of films from every corner of India have become a great asset for the people who work in the tourism sector.
In Mann Ki Baat, I felt how big a movement was created by small incidents.
Today I want to do this because when I think it has been three years, then how many incidents of the last three years have come to my mind.
The country is moving on the right track at every moment.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the welfare of others, for the welfare of the society and for the development of the country.
In my three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat, I got to know, understand and learn from the countrymen.
It is a great wealth for any country. It is a great strength.
And I have seen that there has been a lot of interest in Khadi and I have naturally said that no one will have to read Khadi only.
But there's a variety of fabrics, why not Khadi?
There can be a sheet of the house, a room, a room, a screen, and it seems that the younger generation is attracted to Khadi.
The sale of Khadi has increased and a direct link has been created with the employment of the poor.
On 2nd October, 2019, there was a lot of relaxation in Khadi.
I will once again say that we will take forward the campaign for Khadi and will further increase it.
We work with the idea of buying Khadi and lighting lamps in the homes of the poor.
The poor of our country will get a boost from this work and we should do it.
In order to increase the interest towards Khadi, the Khadi workers and people associated with the Khadi Government of India have been encouraged to think in a new way.
How to bring new technology, how to increase productivity, how to bring solar energy and hand-held pistols
How can we revive the old tradition which had been closed for nearly 20-25-30 years
The Khadi Ashram at Sewapur in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, which had been closed for 26 years, has now been revived.
A lot of methods have been added.
Many people have got new employment opportunities.
The Khadi and Village Industries Training Centre (KVIC), which was shut down in Pampore, Kashmir, has a lot to offer.
Now, to start this training center, new generation has come forward to provide modern construction work, weaving, new things and I am glad that the gifts that big corporate houses give during Diwali are now offering Khadi products.
People are giving Khadi gifts to each other.
We are all experiencing the ease with which things are moving.
My dear countrymen, in the last month of Mann Ki Baat, all of us made a pledge and we had decided that 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti we will celebrate the Swachhata Festival across the country.
We will connect the public with cleanliness.
Our respected President has started this work and the country has been associated with it.
Old and old, male and female, urban and rural everyone has become a part of the cleanliness drive today.
When I talk about Sankalp, we can clearly see how our Swachhata Abhiyan is moving forward in the direction of Sankalp.
I've noticed some people are working on it.
This time I have seen one more thing - firstly, one thing can be that we clean a place, secondly it could not be that we clean a place in an conscious manner, but if we develop a habit of cleanliness then we need a revolutionary change in our thinking.
This time, several competitions have been organized in the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign.
More than 2.5 crore children participated in the Essay Competition.
Thousands of children have painted.
They drew pictures to express their own vision of cleanliness.
Whenever it comes to cleanliness, I never forget to express my gratitude to the people of the media.
We are witnessing that how much electronic media and print media in our country can serve the nation in the Swachhata Hi Seva movement.
Recently, a few days ago, someone attracted my attention towards the 18-year-old Bilal Dar from Srinagar.
In the last 5-6 years, since the age of 12-13 years, Bilal has been working on cleanliness.
There is one of Asia's largest lakes near Srinagar, where plastic, polythene, used bottles and garbage are cleaned.
I am glad that the Municipal Corporation has not only made Bilal the brand ambassador, they have given Bilal the cars, their uniforms, they are going to other places to teach the cleanliness of the people there, they are inspiring them and they are not able to stop till the expected results are attained.
Bilal Dar is an inspiration for those who are young but have a passion for cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we have to admit that the history of the future is born in the womb of history and when we talk of history, it is natural for us to remember the great men.
The month of October is the month to remember many of our great men.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, in October this month, many great men were born, who led us in the 20th and 21st century, showed us the path to walk and those who suffered for the country.
When former President of India Shri Abdul Kalam Ji used to talk to the youth, he often talked about Nanaji Deshmukhs rural development.
He also spoke of the scheme with deep dedication and went to the village to witness Nanajis work.
When we remember all these great men, we remember them so that we can find a way forward so that we can give the right direction to the future.
In the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely talk about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We can easily say that unity in diversity is the specialty of India.
We are proud of diversity, but do we ever try to experience the diversity that we are proud of
I would like to tell all my countrymen in India, especially to my youth that we are in a state of awakening.
Feel the separation of this India, touch her, and realize her pride.
This diversity of our country plays a great role in the development of your inner personality.
You go abroad, I don't mind, but sometimes you see your home.
People of North India will not know what is in South India
The people of the West will not know what is in eastern India.
Our country is full of diversity.
When Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji and all of them had visited India, they had a new inspiration to see the country, to understand the country and to live for the country.
All these great men have visited this country in a big way.
They tried to understand and understand India in the beginning of their work.
You have tried to make India self-reliant.
Can't we also learn from different states of our country, from different communities or groups, from their traditions, from their clothes, from eating to eating as a student
The value addition in tourism will take place only when we, not just as an audience, but as a student, try to capture, understand and integrate the features of this place.
I have had the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts of my country.
In more than 450 districts, night stay has also been done.
Today, when I take charge of this important task of the country, the experience of that journey is very useful to me.
That's why I've got a lot of things to understand.
I request you too, that in this vast India, the Unity in Diversity is not just a slogan but also a storehouse of our immense strength.
If one type of new food is eaten every day throughout life, then it will not be repeated.
This is the biggest strength of our tourism.
I would like you to come out on this holiday just for a little while and for a little change.
You're gonna be too big.
What else can be a greater teacher than an understanding?
Generally, the period from October to March, 2018 to March, 2019 is also suitable for tourism.
If you meet the people there, send them a photo.
Write not only about the beauty and architecture of that place but also about the life of that place.
You should write a wonderful essay on the journey and send it to MyGov and send it to Narendra Modi App.
I have seen this thing in a way that if you want to know the seven best tourist destinations in your state for the development of tourism in India then every Indian will need to know about these seven things of his own state.
If possible, we'll have to go to the seven places.
Can you give me any information about this?
You see, if all the people of the same state send these information, then I will tell the government to scrutiny those seven common things that have come from every state, to spread the message about them.
That is, how can we improve the tourist destination from the perspective of people.
Similarly, the seven things that you have seen in the entire country that you have liked most, you want someone to see it, someone should go there and know about it, then you must send the names of the seven such places of your choice to MyGov, NarendraModiApp.
The Government of India will work on this.
The government will accept the decision of making films, making videos, creating publicity literature, giving prizes to those places which will be such a good place for watching.
Come, join me.
From October to March this year, you can also be a major driver of growth in tourism.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, being a human being, many things touch my heart and shake my mind.
I have a deep impact.
Because I'm a man like you.
A few days ago, perhaps your attention has drawn the example of women power and patriotism.
The Indian Army received two gallant personnel, namely Lieutenant Swati and Nidhi, who are extremely heroic.
It is extraordinary because Swami Bharati and Swami Nidhi had died in the service of mother India.
We can imagine how the world will be when the world is ruined at a young age.
But the martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadeo's wife Swati Mahadeik made this decision in the fight against this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to realise his husband's dream.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey, his husband Mukesh worked as a hero in the army and when he died for the motherland, his wife Nidhi decided in mind and she too joined the army.
It is natural for every countryman to respect our women power and our heroes.
I congratulate these two sisters from the bottom of my heart.
They have created a new inspiration and a new consciousness for crores of people of the country.
Many congratulations to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, this time between Navratri and Deepavali, there is also a great opportunity for the youth of our country.
The World Cup of the FIFA under-17 is taking us here.
I believe that the echo of football can be heard all around.
Every generation will be attracted to football.
There will not be any school-college ground in India, where our youth will not be able to play football.
Come, when the whole world is coming to play on the soil of India, we will also make this game a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
It's the time of mother Durga's feelings.
The entire environment is filled with a pure fragrance.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to the countrymen and pray to their mother power and may our country scale new heights to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the people of the country.
May the country have the capacity to meet every challenge.
May the country progress rapidly, and by 2022, when India will complete 75 years of its independence, the effort to fulfill the dreams of 1.25 billion Indians, the resolve of 1.25 billion Indians, the effort to build a 5-year roadmap for the realization of many humankind and resolutions, Mother Shakti should bless us.
My best wishes to all of you.
Celebrate the festival and energise the spirit.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2017
My dear countrymen, Sadr Namaskar
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who devoted his life to the unity of the country.
The universal values, non-violence and harmony that our ancestors have nurtured since time immemorial are linked to our lives.
We have been hearing this thing since childhood - Ahimsa Paramo Dharma.
I had also said from the Red Fort that violence will not be tolerated in the name of faith it can be a communal belief, it can be believed on political considerations or any person can believe in a tradition it will not be tolerated.
No one has the right to take law in the name of faith.
Dr.
The constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar gave us is to ensure that every person has the right to justice.
I want to assure the countrymen that no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one.
Everyone must bow down to the law, judge the law and punish the culprit.
Our festivals are full of diversity.
Many of our festivals are directly related to the farmers and fishermen brothers and sisters.
Today I am talking about the festival, so first of all I would like to tell you about 'Michami Dokkadam'.
Yesterday, the festival of Sambatti was celebrated in the Jain community.
The festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra in Jain community.
The festival of Samvad is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
It is also known as the festival of forgiveness and on this day, we have a tradition of congratulating each other as 'Michami Dukkadam'.
Besides, in our scriptures, 'Khamma Virsa Bhushan' i.e.
My dear countrymen, now Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm across India.
And when Ganesh Chaturthi is mentioned, it is natural to have a dialogue between the people.
This great festival of Ganesh Chaturthi lasted for 10 days.
And we know this festival as a symbol of unity, equality and purity.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to the people of our country.
Now the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala.
Among the many festivals of India, Onam is a major festival in Kerala.
This festival is special for its social and cultural significance.
The festival of Onam reminds us of Keralas rich cultural heritage.
And now this festival has become a center of attraction for tourism.
Besides, I would like to tell the countrymen that the festival of Navratri or Durga Festival of West Bengal, like in Gujarat, has become the main attraction of tourism today.
In other festivals of our country, there is a lot of opportunity to attract foreigners.
We have to think about the steps that we can take in the coming days.
Id-ul-uha will be celebrated in a few days on this festive occasion.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Id-ul-uha.
Festivals and cleanliness are integral to our family life.
The preparations for the festival started with cleanliness.
This is not new, but it is important to make cleanliness a social habit.
Cleanliness collectively, not only in our homes but also in every village, every city, every city, every state, every country, this cleanliness and festival must be tied in a thread that is unbreakable.
My dear countrymen, the definition of being modern is constantly changing.
Nowadays this new dimension has become a new parameter.
You will see, these days, the children are building a statue of Lord Ganesha by placing it on the ground.
The Swachhata Campaign that we launched three years ago, will mark the third anniversary of the launch of it on October 2nd.
At such a time, the officials of Jamiat-ulema-e-Hind at Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat took up the task of cleaning and cleaning the flood affected 22 temples and 3 mosques.
If this dedicated effort for cleanliness becomes a permanent part of our nature then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I appeal to you once again, on October 2, 2019, 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti, we should start the campaign of Swachhata Hi Seva. As was said earlier, Jal Seva is Prabhu Seva and Swachhata Hi Seva is the same.
Let us create a clean environment in the entire country.
Let us explore and exploit the opportunities that are available whenever we get an opportunity.
Shramdaan.
On holidays or Sundays, come together and work together.
Go to the nearby habitations and go to the nearby villages and make it a movement.
I appeal to all the NGOs, schools, colleges, social-cultural-political leaders, government officials, collectors and sarpanches to create such an environment just fifteen days before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2, so that the India of Gandhiji's dreams can be fulfilled.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Mygov.
In-A, a department has been created where after the construction of toilets, you can enroll yourself with the family you have helped in this work.
My friends from social media can launch creative campaigns in the virtual world, which can actually be inspiring.
An essay, short film and film drawing competition can be organized by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation under the Swachh Sankalp se Swachh Siddhi campaign.
You can write essays in different languages and do not have any specific age limit for this competition.
Among the participants, 3 at the district level and 3 at the state level will be selected and awarded.
I urge you all to take part in the cleanliness drive as well.
You must take some or the other step for cleanliness.
Millions and millions of listeners through letters, send messages or send messages on phone, which is a great achievement and a rare resource for me.
It is a great opportunity for me to know the feelings and feelings of the people of the country.
The more you wait for Mann Ki Baat, the more I will be able to inform you about it.
I wait very eagerly because I can learn a lot from you.
I try to see, listen, read and know your views as much as possible.
Prime Minister, I am saying Aparna from Pune.
I want to tell you about one of my friends.
He always tries to help people, but he's got a bad habits that make me wonder.
I once went to the dirt with him to buy it.
I saw that he bought a two-thousand sari, spent Rs 450 for the pizza.
But he spent a lot of time with the autorickshaw driver for five rupees to go to the mall.
He did the same thing while buying a vegetable on his way back and saved four or five bucks.
I felt very bad.
We spend a lot of money at the big shops without words, but with our hardworking brothers and sisters, we express our gratitude for their little money.
I believe that after listening to the content of this phone, you people have just decided not to make such mistakes.
Don't you think that when someone comes to our house for sale, if he comes back to the shop, if he comes to a shop, if he comes to work with a vegetable vendor or if he wants to work with an auto rickshaw then whenever he comes to work with a talented person, we make arrangements for that thing or not, reduce two rupees or five rupees.
And when people like us go to a large restaurant to eat, don't watch what the bill says, and immediately get the money out.
Not only this, we do not make any effort to buy saris made from the showrooms, but if we work with the poor, we do not make any arrangements.
There will be no difference in your life for Rs. 2 or Rs. 5 but have you ever seen how deep your normal behavior hurts his mind?
Madam, I'm grateful to you. You called me such a heartbeat and gave me a message.
I believe that if there is a habit of behaving like this with the poor in my country, then they will definitely give up.
My dear young friends, On the 29th of August, the entire country celebrates National Sports Day.
This day is the birth anniversary of great hockey player and hockey wizard Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to hockey is unparalleled.
I remember this because I want the new generation of our country to be associated with sports.
Let sports be a part of our lives.
If we are the youngest nation in the world, then this should also be seen in the field of sports.
Sports means physical fitness, mental alertness, personality enhancement.
In a way, it's an excellent call for a heart-to-heart integration.
The youth of our country should move forward in the field of sports and today in the age of computer, I would like to inform you that the playing field is more important than the play station.
If you play a game in a computer, then you can play a game in a field outside and play a game with football.
But the joy of playing cricket under the sky is different in the open fields.
Today, the situation is such that when children return home, they start watching cartoons in one corner or they get involved in mobile games and then they have to shout out to their mother - when will you go out
Time changes, it was an era when the mother used to tell the boy when you would come and today there is a situation where to tell the mother, father, when will you go out?
Young friends, Ministry of Youth Affairs Sports has created a Sports Talent Search Portal for talent identification and development of sports with talent from across the country and talent from across the country.
The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports will provide training to the selected emergency players and the Ministry will launch the same tomorrow i.e.
It is a matter of great happiness for our youth that on 6th to 28th October, India is going to host a FIFA World Cup in India.
Twenty-four teams of the world are going to make India their home.
Come, let us welcome our young guests from all over the world, let us celebrate sports, let us create a conducive environment for the country.
Today, when I am talking about sports, I am reminded of one episode of Mann Ki Baat last week and I want to share it with my countrymen.
I had the opportunity to meet some young girls from a very young age who were born in the lap of the Himalayas and had never had a connection with the sea.
The passion and enthusiasm of the six daughters of our country who work in the Navy will inspire all of us.
These six daughters, with a small boat, will go across the sea with the I-N-S Tarini.
The expedition has been titled Navika Sagar Parikrama, and is scheduled to arrive in India in a few months later.
You'll have to stay in water forty days.
Sometimes you spend 30 days together in water.
In the midst of the waves of the sea, we have six daughters, and this is the first time in the world.
There are some Indians who will not be proud of our daughters
I salute the feeling of these daughters and I have told them to share their thoughts with the entire country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their ideas on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read them.
It's because it's a matter of courage, a matter of self-realization, and I'll be glad to inform you about these girls.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters and also to them.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we all celebrate Teachers Day.
Radhakrishnan ji's birthday is the birthday of our former President.
He was the President but he spent his entire life as a teacher.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was a life devoted to education.
The qualities of a teacher are to inculcate the spirit of creativity among his students and to inculcate the spirit of wisdom in them.
Can I start a mission on a mission mode?
When we talk of transformation in our country, just like the mother of the family comes to mind, similarly the role of teachers in the society is also remembered.
Teachers play a big role in the transformation.
In every teacher's life, there is an incident of being a transformational agent of a student.We make every effort in a holistic manner.
It will play a big role in the country's transformation.
Come, let us move forward with the mantra of 'Teach to Transform'.
My name is Dr. Anita Awasthi.
I am a resident of Mumbai and associated with I India Research Centre at Howard University.
The scheme was launched on 28th August, 2014 with a dream.
Tomorrow, the 28th of August will mark the completion of three years of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
30 crore Indians have joined this scheme and they have opened their first bank account.
The number of new account holders is more than the population of many countries in the world.
If you have money in your home or in your pocket then you will be able to focus on expenditure.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited to the poor of our country.
Moreover, those who have opened their accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, have also got the facility of insurance.
Today, a new confidence has arisen in the lives of the poor due to the 'Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana' and 'Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, with a premium of just one rupee and three rupees each.
In many families, when the poor is in crisis, when the head of the family dies, the benefit of one premium is getting Rs. 2 lakh.
I was told that the results of the Jan Dhan Yojana, RuPay card, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and the benefits of insurance have been beneficial to the common man.
My dear countrymen, let me tell you, "Michami Dukkadam"
Mann Ki Baat, July 2017
The human mind is such that the rainy season is very pleasant to the people.
Animals, flora and fauna, Nature, all of them rejoice at the arrival of the monsoon.
But sometimes when the rains take a terrible form, it shows how destructive the power of water is.
Nature is our life-giver, our mentors, but at times the flood and earthquake-like natural calamities seem to have devastated our lives.
There is a negative impact of the change in the weather and the environment.
In the last few days, some parts of India including Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal have been affected by heavy to very heavy rains.
Floods are being monitored.
Extensive rescue operations are underway.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers are going to reach there.
The state government is also making every effort to help the flood victims in their own way.
Social organizations, cultural organizations, voluntary citizens are making all efforts to help people in this situation.
It has an impact on agriculture, animal husbandry, infrastructure, roads, electricity, connectivity.
We have recently formulated a scheme to help the insurance companies, especially the agricultural insurance companies, in the case of the crop losses due to which the farmers and the farmers are able to get their produce at the earliest.
People are talking about their own misery.
Before the monsoons, most of the places were covered by mock drills and procedures.
The team of NDRF was deployed.
Slowly we have also created such a scenario in which we will work in a way that we can save ourselves from the harm inflicted by the rains.
Whenever I got ready for Mann Ki Baat, I saw more citizens of my country.
This time, so many letters have come from GST, so many calls have come, and people are still expressing their happiness about GST, asking questions.
I would like to share a phone call with you - Namaste Prime Minister, I am from Gurgaon and a New Garg.
I am extremely impressed to hear your speech on Chartered Accountants Day.
It is for this reason that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been introduced in our country on this day.
I'd like to hear your opinion on this.
Thank you.
It has been almost a month since the introduction of GST and has yielded positive results.
And I am glad that whenever a poor person writes a letter, how the prices of essential commodities have come down for the poor, how things have become cheaper.
In the North-East, in the far-flung areas and in the jungles, people living in the jungles are writing to tell us that earlier there was a fear of not knowing what would happen but now that I have understood and understood this thing, I feel that the work has become very easy from the beginning.
Business has become very easy.
And most importantly, the trust of the customers is also increasing.
Now I see how GST has impacted the transport and logistics sector.
How the truck's coming and going.
As a result, mass transportation is being done so that there is strong immigration, and new registrations are being done so that a new faith can be created in the country.
And sometimes economists, management scholars, technologists, and their research scholars must present GST in India as a model for the world.
This will become a case study for several universities across the world.
This is because the scale at which such a big change has been brought about in the lives of crores of people, its use and success in such a large country is the key to success.
The world will certainly do research on this.
GST has been implemented, every state has participated, every state has its responsibility.
All decisions were taken by the States and the Union Government unanimously.
And as a result, the primary objective of every government is to ensure that the poor do not face any pressure due to GST.
I thank all the Ministries, all the departments, all the Central and State Governments associated with this work from the bottom of my heart.
GST is a perfect example of Indias collective strength.
This is a historic achievement.
This is also a campaign for social reforms.
Once again, I salute crores of Indians for their efforts in such a big way.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of the movement.
Yusuf Meh's Ali.
What happened on the 9th of August 1942, our new generation of piggy bank
From 1857 to 1942, the way the people of India had united themselves with the aspirations of independence, they had to bear the brunt of it and described it in the pages of history as an inspiration for us in the creation of a better India.
This was the time when in every corner of India, every corner of the city, every corner of the village, every corner of the village, every educated, illiterate, poor, everyone came together shoulder to shoulder to become a part of the uit India Movement.
At the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians sacrificed their lives in the battle of 'Karengye Ya Marenghe'.
After Mahatma Gandhis call of uit India Movement on 9th August, the British took all the great leaders to task for the movement.
The leaders of the second generation are Lohia, Jay Prakash Narayan.
The Non-Cooperation Movement of 1920 and the uit India Movement of 1942 had two distinct forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
The face of the Non-Cooperation Movement was similar, then, in 42, the situation was such that the intensity of the movement increased so much that even a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karengye Yamrang'.
This was the result of peoples support, peoples support, peoples resolve and peoples participation.
The entire country fought together that day.
Sometimes I wonder if I gather the pages of history then it is understood that India's first freedom movement was in 1857.
Starting from 1857 till 1942, the war has been going on in some or the other corner of the country and for this long time it has given a strong demand for freedom to the people of the country.
Every person is committed to do something.
Generations have changed, but their resolve has not been reduced.
A large number of people came and fought, and even left, and even new groups came and fought together to exterminate the British Empire.
From 1857 to 1942, it brought the movement to such a level that it reached its peak in 1942 and the poison of 'Bharat Chhodo' fell in such a way that the British could leave in 1947, in five years.
From 1857 to 1942, the freedom struggle reached every Indian and from 1942 to 1947, the five decisive years of the resolve of 1942 had led to Indias independence.
These five years were the key decision makers.
Now I want to connect you with this process.
We became independent in 1947 and today in 2017.
It has been almost 70 years.
The government has come, it's gone.
Policy rules have been framed, changed and changed.
Everyone has made their own efforts to get rid of the problems of the country.
There is a constant effort to increase the income of the common man in the country, to reduce poverty and to develop.
Expectations are on the rise.
On the 15th of August 2017, we will mark the beginning of a solemn pledge, and on the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022, we will certainly achieve that resolve.
From 1942 to 1947, the five years of India's independence were decisive, and the same year from 2017 to 2022, the five years of India's future will be decisive.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of independence.
This is a resolution that we will accomplish in the next five years.
Come, use technology, come up with video posts, blogs, articles, new ideas.
This movement has to be made a mass movement.
In the Narendra Modi App, a uit India uiz competition will also be organized for the young friends.
The quiz is an attempt to familiarize the youth with the glorious history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am glad that in the last three years, on the 15th of August, I have received several suggestions from every corner of the country, from every corner of the country, that what should be said, should be discussed on the 15th of August.
On the 15th of August, I will try to discuss these proposals with you.
I'll finish in 40-45 or 50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I would like to talk about one more thing today.
Social-economics are linked to the economy of India.
It should never be cut off.
Our festivals are not just for happiness and joy.
Our festivals, festivals, campaigns for social reform, and all our festivals, are directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor in the country.
In a few days from now, the festival of Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, Ganesh Utsav, Chauth Chandra, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Diwali etc. will be celebrated.
With this festival, there is a natural joy.
Talking about the economy, a few months before the festival of Raksha Bandhan, a small family business in hundreds of families started getting ready.
Several varieties of cotton, silk etc. are stored in different ways and nowadays people prefer to keep homemade.
Hundreds of thousands of traders are associated with the festival of Rakhi, those engaged in the sale of Rakhi, and those engaged in the sale of sweets.
Deepavali is directly related to the poor families who make small earthen lamps.
Today, when I am talking about the economy of festivals and the people associated with it then I also want to talk about the environment.
Sometimes I feel that the people of the country are more alert and active than me and I also feel that.
Awareness citizens have written to me about the environment for the last one month.
They appealed to me that while on the fourth day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I would like to talk of eco-friendly Ganesh so that people like earth made Ganesh, make plans.
Lokmanya Tilak started this great tradition and this year marks the 125th anniversary of the Sarvajanik Ganesh Utsav.
125 years and 125 crore Indians.
In keeping with the spirit of social harmony, awakened society, and social reform, Lokmanya Tilak started the festival.
Let us also recall his words, during the time of Ganesh festival, where we have organized essay competitions, seminars etc.
Come, let us make this festival a part of the economy of the poor, let the happiness of our festivals be an economic festival for the poor, let us also make it a part of the economic happiness of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the upcoming festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly watching that be it education, financial sector, social sector or sports, our daughters are brightening the country and are scaling new heights of success.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters, we are honoured.
Just a few days ago, our women have excelled in the World Cup.
This week I had the opportunity to meet all these players.
There was a sign of pessimism in their mouth.
I've asked those girls for a different assessment of me.
I have seen such games that if the players of India fail, then the people of the country are angry.
Some people talk about something that breaks arbitrariness. Some people say something that is very difficult.
It's not all this, the girls praised what they did and honored them.
I have seen a great change in this and I have told these girls that if you look at these things then it is only for you and you people that if you have not succeeded then it should be removed from your mind.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won the hearts of 125 crore Indians.
Indeed, the youth of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to make the country proud.
My dear countrymen, once again I would like to remind you of the August movement, once again on 9th August.
May every countryman take a pledge and let every countryman take the path of five years to fulfil their resolutions.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
Let us move forward with this belief that the destiny of the country will continue to be better.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2017
The weather is changing.
It was too hot.
But fortunately, the rainy season has been following its footprints.
Rain has started in some parts of the country.
The cold wind in the aftermath of the rainy season gives some relief from the heat of the past.
We all have seen that the enthusiasm and the zeal with which people live in personal life or public life, the arrival of monsoons, these things change the mood of the people.
Today, Lord Jagannath ji's Rath Yatra is going on in different parts of the country with great enthusiasm and joy.
Nowadays Lord Jagannath Ji is celebrated in some other places of the world as well.
The poor people of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath in a special way.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
Very few people know that there is a word in English, Jugernauth, which means a beautiful chariot whose speed can not be stopped.
It is said that this word has come from Lord Jagannath.
It is evident from the fact that the people of the world have recognized the importance of this journey of Jagannath Ji in their own way.
My best wishes to everyone on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.
Come, let us together take the country forward by giving away the treasure of happiness and inspiration from this holy festival.
In this month of Ramzan, I came to know of a very inspiring incident of Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
In this small village, he had around 1500 Muslim brothers and sisters and said that most of the people here belong to the Muslim family.
In the month of Ramzan, the people of the village decided to together build toilets.
Rs 17 lakh has been provided to them as assistance from the government to build individual toilets.
You will be happy to know that in this holy month of Ramzan, the Muslim brothers and sisters of this place have given back Rs.17 lakh by the government, they have said that our toilet will be built by our hard work and by our money.
These 17 lakh rupees can be spent on other services.
On this auspicious occasion of Ramzan, I thank all the villagers of Mubarakpur for bringing about this change in the opportunities of social development.
Every aspect of them is very inspiring.
The biggest thing is that they have declared Berachpur as Open Defecation Free (ODF).
We are aware that three states of our country - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala - have already declared themselves Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I especially express my gratitude to the administration and the people of these five states for completing this task.
We are very well aware of the fact that there is a lot of hard work to do in a personal life or in a social life.
If my handwriting is bad, you have to make a long-lasting effort to fix it.
This is how the physical and mental conditions change.
That's the same thing as cleanliness.
We've had some bad habits.
Everyone's attention must be drawn.
We will have to remember the inspiring stories again and again.
I am glad that cleanliness is no longer just a government activity.
It takes the form of mass movement in the society.
When the people associated with the administration take this task forward with the participation of the people then the strength of the people increases naturally.
I am reminded of one of the good things I wanted to tell you.
This incident is in the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
In 100 hours, 71 gram panchayats have constructed 10,000 family toilets.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to hear that the work of constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours has been done successfully by the people and the local administration.
71,000 villages have become Open Defecation Free.
In-A, letters and All India Radio receive these suggestions.
It is important to remain alive to democracy and therefore, to recall such incidents of injury to democracy and to encourage the values of democracy.
On the 25th of June 1975, a dark day which no Indian can forget.
The entire country was converted into a prison.
The voices of the opposition were stunned.
Jay Prakash Narayan was taken into custody by eminent leaders of the country.
Even the judicial system has not recovered from an emergency.
The newspaper was made totally unusable.
Todays journalistic field students, those working in the field of democracy, repeatedly remember the dark day and continue to work to increase awareness of democracy and this effort should continue.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was jailed.
On the completion of one year of emergency, Atal ji wrote a poem, describing the emotional state of his time in that poem.
We have to strengthen this tradition.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is proud of himself in the world today.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world joined in.
People from the sea to the mountains welcomed the sun's rays through yoga morning and evening.
Are there any Indians who will not be proud of it
It is not that Yoga was not practiced before, but today when Yoga is linked to it, Yoga has become the reason for the world's integration.
Almost all the countries of the world have made Yoga their mark.
On the one hand, people have practiced yoga on the Great Wall of China in China, while on the other hand, 2400 meters above sea level in Peru's World Heritage Site.
In France, they're in the shadows of the Eiffel Tower.
More than 4000 people have joined the Abu Dhabi in UAE.
They have presented a new dimension of friendship to India by joining India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam, at Herat, Afghanistan.
In a small country like Singapore, 70 places have been organized and they have run a campaign throughout the week.
On the occasion of International Yoga Day, the United Nations has released 10 postal stamps.
Yoga has been organized at the United Nations Headquarters in the presence of Yoga experts.
The UN employees and Diplomats from all over the world participated in it.
Once again, Yoga has created a record in the world.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, around 55,000 people have come together to build a new world record.
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga celebrations in Lucknow.
But for the first time I got the opportunity to join the rain.
Yoga is also practiced in Siachen, where our soldiers live in a temperature of 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Be it our armed forces, BSF, ITBP, CRPF, CRPF, CISF, everyone has participated in Yoga along with their duties.
On Yoga Day, I had said that since it was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that three generations of family members should join together and share their photos.
Some TV channels have taken the matter further.
I got a lot of photos on the same and some of them have been compiled and posted on the Narendra Modi App.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to attend a very dear convention.
In Kerala, good events have been taking place for a few days, P. N. Panicker Foundation has inculcated the habit of reading and reading among the people and is why reading day and reading mantra is being celebrated.
I had a chance to go to the beginning of this and I was also told there that we don't break flowers, we give them books.
I'm good.
This time, I also remembered what left my focus.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I made a tradition in the government that we would not break, we would give it or we would welcome it with a handkerchief.
He will be a handkerchief, so that Khadi will grow up.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this was the habit of everyone, but when I came here, my habits went away.
But he went to Kerala and developed that habit again.
And I've started giving a notice to the government again.
We can gradually develop a habit.
The flower is too short of life.
I've got to take it away once.
But if I give you a book, it becomes a part of the house and becomes a member of the family.
When I went to London, Queen Elizabeth, Queen of Britain, invited me to eat.
ueens Elizabeth has taken care of the room provided by Mahatma Gandhi.
And she was very happy to visit me.
When I was watching, I didn't know if he wanted me to touch it once.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life and became part of his history.
I believe that these habits do not change overnight. Sometimes it becomes critical to talk about something like that.
But despite this, such things should be emphasized, and efforts should be made.
Now I can't tell you that I went somewhere and someone took the flower, so I won't tell him, I can't do it.
But anyway, there will be a discussion, but we should continue to talk and this will change gradually.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of work going on in the direction of becoming the Prime Minister.
I have to sink into the files, but I have developed a habit and I have read some of the letters from the letters that I received and this is an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different people wrote letters.
I read one such letter from you.
A housewife from far south Tamil Nadu, Arulmodhi Saranan has written a letter.
What is being written in the letter is that I thought of doing something to manage my home, to manage the education of the children, so that there is some financial implication in the Parliament.
Similarly, under the MUDRA Yojana, I have been providing some loans from the banks to purchase some goods from the market.
In the meantime the government has come up with a system called Government e-Marketplace.
So I got the information and registered myself in the system.
Whoever wants to supply the goods to the government, whether it is electric bulb, or if he wants to supply the dustbin, whether it is a broom, a chair, a table, you can register whatever he wants to sell.
He wrote, First of all, I got the money from the Mudra Yojana and started my business then I registered my sale in E-GEM and then I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office, PMO.
It was an unknown news to me, and I asked if the PMO wanted to buy it.
She said she bought the drmos and got 1,600 paid.
Yeah, that's the employment.
There is transparency in it, empowerment and enterprise is also increasing.
Government e-Marketplace (GeM)
I want that the number of people who want to sell something to the government should increase like this.
I understand this is a wonderful example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance and its aim is Minimum Price and Maximumness, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga, and on the other hand we are proud of the success that has been achieved in Space Science.
This is the specialty of India and Yoga is connected to the land of our country and our country is also a distant space mission.
In the past, India has done a lot in sports and science.
Today, India is making its mark not only on earth but also in the space.
ISRO also launched 30 Nanosatellites in Cartosat-2 series days earlier.
These satellites include France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America, and almost 14 countries.
These nano satellites of India will also provide useful information in the field of agriculture, farmers, and also in the field of natural gas forecasting.
A few days ago, we all remembered the successful launch of GSAT-19.
Think about how our scientists have established a great deal of space research.
19th June is the 1000th anniversary of the Mars Mission.
You all remember that for this mission, we successfully set up orbit for the Mars mission and its term was fixed for six months.
It was six months in office.
But the extraordinary talent of our scientists has crossed over a thousand days even after six months.
Our scientific journey of this 1000 days is a great achievement in the field of space research.
Our youngsters are making a mark in the fields of education as well as in the fields of sports, their skills and their physical abilities.
This is the day when the Badminton Player of India, Kidambi, became the champion of the nation in Indonesia and Spain.
I congratulate the retired Srikanth and his coach.
T.
Sports person plays an important role in development.
Sports plays an important role in the development of all individuals.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If the family's children are inclined towards sports, they should be encouraged.
Once again, let me tell you, the celebration of the rainy season and the festival of festivals in a way is something special.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2017
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has begun.
In the holy month of Ramadan, I convey my best wishes to all the people of the world, especially the Muslim community.
During the time of Ramzan, emphasis is given on prayer, spirituality and compassion.
We Indians are very fortunate that our ancestors have created such a tradition that the Indians can be proud of.
We 1.25 billion Indians are proud of the fact that India is home to all communities in the world.
It is such a country which has a faith in God, who has worshipped idols or those who have anti idols, who have different ideologies, who have different faiths and tradition of living together.
And, be it religion, community, thought or tradition, we give only one message - peace, unity and goodwill.
This holy month of Ramadan will further strengthen the spirit of peace, togetherness and harmony.
I once again wish you the very best.
Last time when I had talked about Mann Ki Baat, I had specifically told the youngsters to do something new and come out of the comfort zone.
And this is how old it is - taking a little risk and being tough.
I'm glad many people gave me a feedback.
People have encouraged me to speak personally.
There are so many messages that I cannot read and hear the messages sent by everyone.
But I have seen from the fact that some are trying to learn music, some are trying to learn musical instruments, some are showing hands on new musical instruments, some are trying to learn new things using YouTube, some are trying to learn new languages, some are learning cooking, some are learning dance, some are learning drama, some have written poems, some have even started writing poems.
I almost stopped studying.
That's why I tried to read this holiday.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much struggle had to be fought for India's independence and how many freedom fighters had lived in prison for years.
Bhagat Singh, who did a lot at a very young age, was inspired by his life.
It is my request to you all that you should say something about this in today's programme.
I am glad that todays youth are willing to know about our history, our freedom fighters and the people who sacrificed their lives for our country.
I visited Andaman and Nicobar several years ago.
I went to see Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar had written the book Manji Janmth by sitting in a jail.
He used to write poetry on prison walls.
He was locked up in a small house.
How difficult was it to bear for freedom
When I read Savarkar ji's book 'Manji Jayanti', I got the inspiration to see the Cellular Jail.
There's a light and sound show that's very inspiring.
There is no such state in India, there are no speaking people who did not face the punishment of Kalapani for freedom. The Cellular Jail in Andaman had never spent their life in that Cellular Jail.
If you ever get the opportunity, you will definitely go to the pilgrimage centres of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, first Monday of June 5th.
And this year the theme of United Nations is Connecting People to Nature.
In other words, back to basics.
And no one has said that better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi has often said: One must care about one world one will not see. That is, it is our duty to think about the world and take care of it.
After getting tired, the doors of the house open and breathe fresh air bring a new life.
When we talk of the five elements in which our body is formed, then a new life and a new spirit develops in our body.
We all saw it, but we didn't think about it like that.
After that, you will see that whenever you meet with different natural conditions, a new consciousness emerges in you.
Therefore, on 5th June, we should have our own campaign and campaign all over the world to connect with nature.
We are getting some results of the work done by our ancestors to protect the environment.
If we protect the environment, our next generation will reap its benefits.
Vedas are considered to be the source of energy for the world and the environment.
We're here to say: Mother Earth: Son of God.
It is said in the Vedas that the purity that we have among us is for our world.
The earth is our mother and we are her children.
If we think of Lord Buddha, then one thing comes to the fore that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his enlightenment and his Mahaparinirvana were all three on the trees.
But we need to connect him with modern debates.
At this time, news from different states comes to me.
With the onset of monsoon, a massive campaign of planting trees has been started in almost all the states.
Crores of trees are planted.
The entire world celebrates this day as World Yoga Day.
In a short span of time, this World Yoga Day on 21st June has become widespread and people are participating in it.
On the one hand, many forces that divide the world are showing its distorted form, at this time Yoga Day is India's biggest contribution.
Through Yoga, we have connected the whole world with one thread.
Yoga unites the world in the same way as it binds the body, mind, intelligence and soul together.
On the contrary, in these difficult times, Yoga has a major role to play in leading a stress-free life.
Yoga is not just an exercise , it is fitness itself , it is a combination of body , mind , thought and action and it is possible to get this union with yoga only .
Two days ago, I wrote letters to all the leaders of the world on Yoga Day.
Last year, I announced a competition on Yoga and also announced some awards.
Interesting offer.
He said, This is the third International Day of Yoga, I would like to appeal that on this third International Day of Yoga, three generations of the same family should practice Yoga at one place.
Grandfather-Dima, mother-father, son-daughter, all three generations should practice yoga together and upload pictures of it.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow, a very lucky union of yoga will give a new direction to yoga.
I thank you for this proposal and I think that like we have undertaken the mission of Selfie with Daughter and have created a pleasant feeling, the image of yoga of these three generations will illuminate the entire country and the world.
You must send me a picture of three generations of people simultaneously practicing Yoga at MyGov through the Narendra Modi App.
It'll be tomorrow, today and tomorrow, a pretty time guarantee.
I invite you all.
This is almost three weeks away from the International Day of Yoga.
Start the practice from today.
You too, must spread, propagate and include Yoga for three weeks without any hindrance.
This is a movement of Preventive Health Care.
I invite all of you to participate in it.
When I got the opportunity to speak from the Red Fort on 15th August, I had said about cleanliness.
From that day onwards, I have been visiting various parts of India.
Modi ji, on TV and on social media, I see that wherever you are going, people of that place are paying special attention to cleanliness.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, on your call, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission.
With the elders, even the younger generation became aware about cleanliness.
Many times the elders were seen messing up their heads.
The cleanliness drive that you had started from the Ghats of Kashi has taken the shape of a movement with your inspiration.
You are right that wherever I go, there is a governmental process of cleaning but nowadays a festival of cleanliness is also started in the society.
But when this phone call came, I thought and saw that yes, that's right.
The Prime Minister said that the preparations for welcoming the Prime Minister will be in full swing, but the first one will be cleanliness.
It will automatically bring happiness to anyone who is a lover of cleanliness.
I would like to thank everyone for their emphasis on cleanliness.
Someone gave me an offer.
Well, that's an interesting proposition.
I don't know if I can do this.
Modi ji , when you come to an invitation then tell me , if you invite me then what kind of level of cleanliness will be there , how much of garbage you will give me , on that basis I will decide to go .
Dea is very good, but I have to think.
Once again, there is a need for a movement and instead of the other things, you can clean up a few tons of garbage.
How many people will we save from illness
It will be a great humanitarian task.
Once we consider it as a 'welfare', we will come out with a new solution for waste management.
Young people associated with start-ups will come forward with new ideas and new equipment.
It is expected that these 4,000 cities will be covered with dry garbage blue dustbine and wet waste bins.
The waste of kitchens, such as the peel of vegetables, sprouts, eggs, and the leaves of trees - these are the wet garbage - the green dustbins.
If you remember that all these things are in the field of agriculture, if you keep in mind that the color of the food is green, then you will remember what to do with the green dustbin.
And the rest of the garbage, such as waste paper, iron, cardboard, glass, cloth, plastic, polythene, rubber and other metal articles, are dry garbage which are required to be recycled or used in the machine, these are not commonly used in blue dustbins.
I believe that we can develop a habit like this and if we need to take new steps for cleanliness then we can fulfil the dream of Gandhi Ji that he dreamt of cleanliness.
Today, I would like to proudly mention that if a person makes up his mind, then how big a movement can be created.
Cleanliness is one such thing.
You must have heard a news earlier that the stinking Barsoba beach in Mumbai has turned into a clean, clean Barsoba beach today.
It wasn't a sudden move, a citizen who worked hard for 80-90 weeks to change the picture of Barsoba beach and made thousands of tons of dirt off the Barsoba beach clean, beautiful.
And it's been done by Versova ResidenceVolunter.
One person Shriman Afroz Shah joined the task with all his might since October 2015 and gradually many more people joined it and became a mass movement.
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has awarded Afroz Shah for this work.
This is the first Indian to receive the Champion of the Earth award.
I came to know that local women have taken the lead in this work.
They used to mix torches to create awareness among the people, they used to inspire everyone in every street, every house and every house.
I heartily congratulate all these mothers and sisters.
I also congratulate the administrators of Jammu and Kashmir for the beautiful launch of an open defecation free (ODF) block.
My dear countrymen, the work done by the present government for the last three years has been continuously going on in newspapers, on TV and on social media for the last 15 days.
Three years ago, you made me the Chief Servant.
People from all strata of the society have analyzed it.
This is a good tradition for democracy.
I would also like to thank all those who have given critical and important feedback, on the ground of misbehavior, lack of feedback, and on the ground level, for getting corrected.
This criticism is very important for an awakened nation and a conscious state.
My dear countrymen, a common citizen like you, I too have a similar effect on a common citizen because of which there is a similar effect on a common citizen.
There are hundreds of families who have written this to me.
As a small man, it has a special effect on my mind as a common citizen, that has encouraged me.
I'm grateful to Akbar.
Come, let us all move ahead in this environment in love with nature.
I convey my best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaste
And the curiosity of the children, the aspiration of the youth to do something great, the feelings of the elders come to us.
Every time the input received for Mann Ki Baat is analyzed by the government.
What are the types of suggestions, what are the complaints, what are the feelings of the people etc.
It can be seen on the motor that people tend to give advice to others.
In the train, if you want to go to the bus, do the same to others.
But when I tried to look at these things carefully, I got upset.
In most of the cases those people have suggested that they have tried to reach out to me who have really done something in their lives.
They have tried to do some good work according to their intelligence, strength, capability and opportunity.
And when I realized this, I felt that these suggestions were not small.
All this has come from the feeling of your people.
Some people feel that if someone listens to these things while working on these things then it can become a comprehensive form and it can be beneficial for many people.
Not only this, when I mention something, it gives me immense pleasure and happiness.
I have never thought that today our country, especially the younger generation, has been working on this thing for so many years.
For some years, I knew that some social organizations were working on this issue but I came to know that the young generation of my country is also working on this issue.
Some people sent me a video.
There are lots of places where bread banks are being run.
People collect bread from themselves in the Roti Bank, collect it for themselves, collect it for themselves, collect it for themselves.
Those who are giving it, they like it, and those who are not doing it, they do not even think that they are small.
This is an example of how cooperation works in the society.
It's the last day of April.
On 1st May, 2019, the State of Gujarat and Maharashtra were recognized as the States.
On this occasion, my best wishes to the people of both the states.
Both the states have made efforts to achieve new goals of development and are working for the progress of the country.
In both the states, the coming of the great men and their way of life inspires us in every field of the society.
Remembering the great men on the occasion of the beginning of two states, let us resolve to take our states, our countries, our societies, our cities and our families to new heights by 2022 that is, 75 years after Independence.
There should be a plan to implement this resolution, and the cooperation of all citizens should be enhanced.
This time it has come to feel the heat of June and March-April in our country.
When I was asking people about Mann Ki Baat, I asked them to do it more in this summer and people gave it to them.
It's not new, it's not new, but it's good to remember it on time.
And I have seen that the children of the family are doing this work very well.
Once they understand why this water should be filled, they go to see if there is water in the vessel ten times a day.
And they see if there's a bird.
I think there is a game going on, but it is really a wonderful way to spread the feelings of the children.
In our country, we should collectively strive for conservation of animals and birds by blending them with color and color.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I commemorated 100 years of the Guru of the Dawoodi Bohra community, Syedna Sahib.
He lived for 103 years.
And for his hundred years of existence, Bohra community has launched a massive campaign to save the climbers through Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to launch this campaign.
About 1,000 bird feeders spread them to every corner of the world.
This operation took place at the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes I used to get so busy that I forget that those people who are newspapers, those who are milky, those who are vegetarian and those who are postmen who come to my house during the summer days, I forgot to give some water to them.
Young friends, I would like to talk to you too.
Sometimes I feel that some of our young people enjoy living their lives in the comfort zone.
Their parents have brought up a lot in their everyday activities.
Some people go through extreme adversities but most people spend their lives in Comfortone.
Now the exam is over, there are plans to make fun of holidays.
It's a lot of fun when it's hot.
However, as a friend, I would like to talk to you about how to spend your holidays.
I believe some people will definitely follow my words and inform me.
Sometimes there is a slight difference between watching something on TV, reading books or listening to the people who are familiar with it and feeling themselves.
Exams may be positive, like getting out of Comfortzone.
We are the middle class, the happy family.
Friends, There was a time when I used to sit for a second class of trains without reservation of seats. I used to travel for 24 hours.
Sometimes feel it, I'm not saying do it again, but do it once or twice.
In the evening, I played football, playing volleyball and other sports equipment, in a very poor slum.
You will see, you will feel that you have never enjoyed playing with those poor boys before.
When such a living child gets an opportunity to interact with you, do you think that what a big change will happen to those children
You will get a lot of this experience.
Many voluntary organizations are doing this service.
Sometimes there are times when a lot of conventions are organized for personality development, there is a lot of development in it and it can be included in it.
If you take part in the Summer Camp, do a course on personality development and go to those people of the society who have been deprived of these courses free of cost, teach them what you have learnt.
How to do all this work, you can teach.
We are concerned that the technology that has come to reduce the distance, but the result is that there are 6 people in the same house, but the gap between them has increased so much that it is not possible.
Everybody's been busy with new technology.
Staying together is also a reform, unity is strength.
Second, I'd like to say skill, don't you want to learn new things!
We try to do our best, we lose ourselves.We get into some coaching class in the Vacation, we get into the next examination.
Sometimes I'm afraid our young generation is not being a robot.
There can be some emphasis on skill development.
Some have learnt musical instruments some have learnt 5-50 sentences in Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi.
If you don't swim, learn to swim, draw pictures, maybe not a good picture, but try to draw something on the paper.
Do you want to learn how to drive a car?
You see, these are new experiments, their skills are such that will give you happiness and you will be able to get rid of the vicious circle of life.
Get out of the routine life, do something, guys.
This is an opportunity to make life.
You are suddenly wondering if all the exams are over, if we go to new care then we will learn, but there will be no chance.
You're going to get involved in some other problem, so I'll tell you, if you want to learn your magic, then at least learn the magic of it.
Keep the magic of your friends.
Try to know something that you don't know, you'll definitely benefit from it.
Your inner human qualities will be awakened, many steps will be taken to improve.
I'm saying in my own experience, I can't imagine how much we can learn by looking at the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages, new areas.
But before leaving, wherever we are going, we can see the customs, look at them, understand them, discuss them, ask them, but if we try to find a new place then the joy of seeing them will increase further.
Stay in the same place for three or four days.
Go to another place and stay for three-four days.
You can learn a lot from it.
Where did you go?
You can share your experiences using Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you a very good opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from cash transactions.
They need cash.
They're beginning to believe in digital currency.
But if someone is referred to someone else or someone else and the new person does the transaction of money three times, you can earn 100 rupees for doing this.
Ten rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If you get 20 people a day, you'll earn 200 rupees by evening.
Traders can also earn income, students can also earn income.
This scheme, which is in your hands till 14th October, will be a turning point in building a Digital India.
Now that the red light has gone, no one can say that the red light that has entered the mind may have gone out.
I've got an interesting phone call.
He also expressed apprehensions on this phone, but this is evident from the fact that people didn't like it at all, they felt a distance.
Namaste Prime Minister, I am from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh to Shiva Chaube.
I'd like to say something about the government's Red Backon Light Ban.
I don't have to get trapped in traffic jams, and I don't have to wait for anyone.
I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this.
Thank you for the good work done by you people.
Burning of vehicles is a part of Government system.
But we have to try to get this idea out of our minds.
We all have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that we must always remember our history, our culture and our heritage.
We save energy and get inspiration from it.
This year we are showering thousands of blessings of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya.
Centenary celebration in other countries of the world is considered sufficient, but India is such an ancient country that we have the opportunity to cherish and cherish thousands of years of memories.
Thousands of years ago, he took up a movement to enter their temples and succeeded.
We are fortunate to have been born here to refute the sins of every age group.
We can draw inspiration from Sant Ramanujacharya for spreading this idea of power through his collective efforts for social unity.
The Government of India is issuing a postal stamp to commemorate the 1st of May.
I respectfully remember Sant Ramanujacharya and salute him.
My dear countrymen, Tomorrow, 1st May is also an important date.
This day is celebrated as Labour Day in many parts of the world.
And when it comes to Labour Day, when it comes to labour and labour then it is natural for me to remember the story of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Very few people may be aware that today we are grateful to Baba Saheb Ambedkar for the facilities and the facilities provided by the workers.
Baba Sahebs role in the welfare of the workers is extremely important.
Today, when I am talking about Baba Saheb Ambedkar and Saint Shri Ramanujacharya, I am reminded of the great saint and social reformer of Karnataka, Jagatguru Basaveshwara in the 12th century.
In the 12th century, he spoke extensively about labour and workers in Kannada language.
He spoke in Kannada - "Kaay Koye Kailalas".
It means, through hard work, you will be able to reach the Alaknanda of Shiva.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is natural to remember the utopias.
My dear countrymen, a few days later, we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
On that day, all Buddhists from all over the world celebrated the festival of Buddha.
And in India, the journey from war to Buddha is a unique symbol in the life of Mahatma Ashoka.
This is especially applicable to our neighbouring countries.
India's neighboring countries should continue to cooperate and develop.
Several projects are underway at the international level.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May 2020.
Benefits from this satellite will be of great help in the economic and other development of South Asian countries.
This will include mapping of natural resources, tele-medicine, education, IT and human-to-people links and will help boost our overall development journey in South Asia.
This is an important step by India towards enhancing cooperation with the whole of South Asia - a gift which is a fitting tribute to our commitment to South Asia.
I convey my best wishes to all those countries of South Asia who are associated with this South Asia Satellite.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2017
Most of the families in every corner of the country are busy with their kids.
Those who have completed their examination have a relaxed atmosphere and those families who are under examination are still under some pressure.
But at one point of time, I would like to say that listen to the words that I had told the students in Mann Ki Baat last time.
These words will definitely help you when you test them.
Today is March 26th.
Bangladesh Independence Day was celebrated on 26th March.
Historical fight against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
Today, on this great day, I convey my best wishes to the people of Bangladesh, to their brothers and sisters, on the occasion of Independence Day.
I hope that Bangladeshs progress, development and I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner and a good friend and we will stand shoulder to shoulder to contribute towards peace, security and development in the entire region.
We are all proud that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are the heritage of our two countries.
The National Anthem of Bangladesh is also composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
One of the interesting facts about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is that in 1913 he was not only the first person in Asia to receive the Nobel Prize, but also the British named him Knighthood.
When the British killed the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who had spoken against him and this time a 12-year-old child had a profound effect on this incident.
The brutal killing of Jallianwala Bagh has brought a new dimension to the life of that boy who had a smile on his ground.
And in 1919, the 12-year-old boy Bhagat Singh was our dearest, inspiration for all of us - Shaheed Bhagat Singh.
Three days before today, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh and his comrade Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know the events of 23rd March - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru - there was no doubt about the service of Mother India.
They had sacrificed all their dreams for the freedom of Mother India.
And those three heroes are still our inspiration.
We cannot describe the story of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
The entire British administration was afraid of these three young people.
They're locked up in prison, they're fine, but they're worried about what they can do.
And so on March 24, 2019, the hanging was held on 23rd.
It's hiding what's not common.
After that, the British quietly burned their bodies in today's Punjab.
Many years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time then I could feel the vibration of that land.
And I will certainly tell the youth of the country that whenever they get the opportunity to go to Punjab, they must visit the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's Janni and Batukeshwar Datta.
It was during this period that he lost his hand, his intensity, and his madness.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the armed revolution.
On the other hand, just 100 years ago, on the 10th of April 1917, at Champaran, Mahatma Gandhi did Satyagraha.
This year marks 100 years of Champaran Satyagraha.
In India's freedom struggle, the Gandhian thought and Gandhi style were first seen in Champaran.
In the entire movement for freedom, it was a turning point, especially from the point of view of the rules and regulations of the Sangha.
The same episode, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Kheda Satyagraha, the workers of the factory in Ahmedabad, and all these things have had a deep impact on the thinking and working style of Mahatma Gandhi.
Gandhiji returned from abroad in 1915 and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
Imagine a person who returned to India in 1915, who worked only for two years.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such a place where the organized strategy of Mahatma Gandhi, the power of enlightenment of Mahatma Gandhi, the pulse of the Indian society, the conduct of Mahatma Gandhi, the conduct of Mahatma Gandhi, the work of preparing, inspiring, inspiring and bringing the poor to the battle ground against the British administration, and bringing them to the fore.
That is why we can feel the vastness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if we think of Gandhi 100 years ago, the Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of deep study for any person who has just entered the public life.
We can learn from him how to take part in public life, how to work hard and how Gandhi did it.
And there was a time when the leaders of Tabor, whom we heard, Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani Hoon had sent everyone to the village.
On the one hand, jail is to be filled while on the other hand, it is to be put to constructive work.
There was a wonderful balance between Gandhi Ji's work style.
What can be the meaning of Satyagraha, what can be impossible, what can be the meaning of cooperation in the face of such a vast empire
This mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' - this mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', which will help in doing something for the country and the society, will fulfill the dreams of those great men who gave their lives for the freedom of the country.
And there is an Indian in the 21st century who does not want to change, who does not want to be a partner in the progress of the country.
It is the desire of 1.25 billion Indians to sow the seeds of a New India.
There are many people who go to the hospital regularly to serve the patients.
We were born with the idea of service to our nation, Ratnagarva and Janseva Prabhu.
If we look at this idea in an organized manner then it will be understood that how big it is.
In the context of India, it is very natural and inevitable that different opinions and ideas emerge.
But it is also true that if the country decides and takes steps to fulfil it then the dream of a New India will succeed.
It is not necessary that all the work should be done at the budget or at the government cost.
If every citizen resolves to follow the rules of traffic, fulfil his duties with integrity, stop using petrol and diesel at least one day in a week, then we will take this small step to make the New India a reality.
We will see the dream of India come true and we will only say that everyone should follow their own citizenship and perform their duties.
Similarly, a New India is about to start.
The year 2022 will mark 75 years of Indias independence.
I urge you to follow the path of life and resolve and participate in the journey from Swaraj to Suraaj.
My dear countrymen, today I want to express my gratitude to you people.
The BHIM App has been launched two-and-a-half months ago, but more than 1.5 crore people have already downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
You cant imagine that you can become one of the greatest partners in the country and a brave soldier himself against black money and corruption.
A few days ago, DigiDhan Mela was organized for folk education and awareness.
Around 12.5 lakh people have been given specific awards and 70,000 people have been given specific awards.
Let us join these efforts to reduce the use of cash and currency.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that whenever I ask your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, a lot of suggestions are received.
But I have noticed that there is no dearth of interest in cleanliness.
I think the need for cleanliness should be explained to the common man.
I pass by a river every day, where people throw lots of garbage and pollute the river.
This river has come through the Rispana bridge and our house has fallen from the side .
In order to keep this river clean, I had spoken to the people at the places nearby, had met but there was no special benefit.
I request you to send a team or publish it in a newspaper.
Brothers and sisters, You can see how difficult a daughter of class 11 is.
He's so angry to see the dirt in the river!
I think it's a good sign.
I want anger in the minds of 1.25 billion people.
Once there is anger, dissatisfaction, resentment and anger, we will be able to take some steps in the campaign against garbage.
It is a good thing that Gayatri has expressed her anger, she has advised me, and at the same time she has tried very hard, but has failed.
Since the movement for cleanliness has started, awareness has increased.
Everyone is positively related to this.
It took the form of a movement.
The hatred towards garbage is gradually increasing.
Be it people's awareness, participation actively, or be it a movement, this has its own importance.
This movement is possible in a holistic manner.
It's hard to do, but we have to do it.
I believe that the awareness that has come about among the youth, among the children, among the students and among the youth of the country, is collectively indicating a good results.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat, I want to tell the people of the country who are listening to Gayatri, that they are talking to all of us.
The more you put the plate in, the less half goes into the stomach, the more you throw it out there.
Sometimes we have seen how much waste we waste in the food we leave behind.
Have you ever thought about it if you don't waste it, how poor people can feed it?
There is no need to explain it separately.
Normally in our house when mother feeds small children then tell them to eat as much as you can .
In spite of these efforts, apathy and social distancing are expressed in this regard.
It's unfair to the poor.
Second, if there is savings, the family will also get financial benefits.
Ideas for the society are good, but this thing is that families will also benefit from it.
I don't want to say anything about this, but I want to raise awareness.
I know some youngsters who are associated with such movements.
The youth of our country does this kind of hard work.
In every state of the country, such people will be found somewhere or the other.
Their work can inspire us so that we do not waste food.
We'll take as much as we eat.
This is the way to change.
And those who are aware of health , they always say - keep the plate loose , keep the stomach empty .
When we came to know of health only then we said . April is the World Health Day .
The United Nations has set the goal of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) for all by 2030.
This time, on the World Health Day, on 7th April, the United Nations has laid special focus on Depression.
According to a survey, more than 250 million people in the world are victims of mental depression.
The problem is that many people around us are suffering from this disease, but we do not understand it, and perhaps we feel difficult to talk about it openly.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not enough to get rid of it.
When a psychological circle is created, he begins to walk away.
The first thing that needs to be expressed is not the suspension but the person needs to express it.
With your friends, with your parents, with your brothers and sisters, tell the teacher what is happening inside you.
Have you ever thought why that man is doing this?
You must be sure that this is the first sign of depression.
If someone wants to stay alone while keeping himself away from the middle of everyone then be careful not to let him alone.
Let them stay with anyone or anyone they like to live with.
Inspire him to speak freely in a funny manner and find out what is hidden in his mind.
In diseases like diabetes, people are physically weak, depression reduces the morale of people, takes courage and decreases the fighting force, destroys all our life force.
If you start working with the spirit of service and solve your problems then your confidence will return.
If you are able to play with others, if you are able to serve others, and if you do it selflessly, then you will see that your mind is lightened.
The practice of yoga is a good way of keeping the mind healthy.
Yoga is a very effective remedy for prevention of depression, relief from suffocation and happiness.
Each year, the International Day of Yoga is celebrated on 21st June.
If you want to give some suggestions on International Yoga Day, then send them all the ideas and guidance through my mobile app.
Keep writing poems, songs, etc. with yoga, so that there is a lot of enthusiasm among the people.
This time I would like to say something to my mothers and sisters about health care.
A few days ago, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
For this, the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The maternity leave was earlier 12 weeks for working women during pregnancy, childbirth and post-natal care.
Only two or three countries in the world are ahead of us in this regard.
When these children grow up, they become the wealth of the country.
New Year festivals are celebrated in different ways in different parts of our country.
New Year celebrations are held in Gudi Padava, Andhra and Karnataka in New Year, Ugadi, Sindhi Cheti Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Sanskriti Puja at Ayodhya, Juda Sheetal at Mithila in Bihar and Satuwani at Magadha.
India is blessed with diversity.
New Year greetings to all of you
Thank you so much!
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
The clutter of the bird brings joy.
Not only flowers, but fruits also shine on the branches of the trees.
This spring also shows our crown as a result of the summer.
Similarly, there is a need to look at the yellow flowers of mustard in the field of cultivation.
The red flower of Palash marks the arrival of Holi.
Amir gave a very beautiful description of this time of monsoon change.
He writes: The forest is blooming mustard is growing, the squirrel is calling, the kuhuh-kuh.
When the color of happiness and joy in nature touches the heart of a person, then he also feels the same joy.
Spring-Panchami, Maha Shivratri and Holi festival paint people's lives in color.
And that's why he said I'd like to launch 104 satellites and interceptor missiles.
So, I thank you very much. You have remembered India's pride.
Be it fighting poverty, protecting ourselves from diseases, connecting with the world, or being inspired by knowledge or information, technology and science have proved their role.
15th February, 2017 is a proud day in Indias national life.
Our scientists have raised our heads in line with the world.
And we know that in a few years, ISRO has successfully completed a few unprecedented projects.
After the successful launch of Mars Mission on Mars, ISRO has recently established a world record in the field of space missions.
India is the first country in the world to write history by sending 104 satellites at one go.
It is also a matter of great happiness that this is the 38th edition of PSLV.
This is a historic achievement not only for ISRO but also for the entire India.
The cost-effective and cost-effective space program of ISRO has proved to be a wonder for the world, and has appreciated the achievements of Indian scientists in the open mind across the globe.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters will be able to know how much water is available in our country, how to use it, how to pay attention to it. Our new Satellite Cartosat-2D will help us in this matter.
He sent some photos when we arrived in the satellite room.
She started her work.
It is also a matter of great happiness for us that our young scientists, women scientists and they have led this campaign.
The immense cooperation between the youth and women is a matter of great pride for ISRO's success.
On behalf of the people of the country, I would like to congratulate the scientists of ISRO.
For the common man, they have always pursued the objective of using Mahakashvili for the service of the nation and are making new achievements daily.
The less we appreciate these scientists and their entire team, the less it will be.
Shobha ji also raised one more question and it is related to India's security.
In the defence sector, India has successfully tested the Ballistic Interceptor Missile.
On the technology of Interception Technology, the missile has successfully fired a 100-kilometer long test-flight missile from the ground.
This is a significant achievement in the field of defence.
We are delighted to see a new technology, a new scientific achievement.
And asking for the development of human life has played a major role.
And those intellectuals who do not allow him to ask, they also question him, they ask him, they ask him new questions, they ask him new questions.
And that's what makes a new invention.
They don't calm down until the answer is found.
And if we look at the evolution of the human life of thousands of years, then we can say that this stream of development of human life has nothing to do with it.
It's impossible to complete.
The efforts to know the universe, the laws of creation, the human beings continue.
New science, new technology and new technology are born out of it.
And every technology, every new form of science, every new generation of new age.
My dear young friends, when we talk about science, about the hard work done by the scientists, I remember that in this episode of Mann Ki Baat, one day I said that the younger generation should be attracted towards science.
A lot of scientists are needed in the country.
Todays science will usher in a permanent change in the lives of generations to come.
Keeping in mind the needs of the common man, when science discovers, discovers, and helps the common man, science becomes a great human being, then it becomes a great science.
It is here that I have seen an innovative idea in the work of our poor fishermen.
All such innovations were found in this competition.
Many services are also going to be technology driven.
Technology has become an integral part of life.
India's digital transaction rate is rising.
Digital payments are being made by the youth, especially through their mobile phones.
I think it's a good sign.
There has been a huge response to Lucky Grahak Yojana and Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana.
It has been almost two months since then 15,000 people have received an award of Rs. 1,000 per day through these two schemes.
Many people have received a prize of Rs. 1 lakh under this scheme.
50,000 and more than 4,000 traders.
Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said that he was happy to receive the award of Rs.
Then I feel happy to share with you what Shriman Santosh has written.
It gives me great pleasure to know that Santosh ji, your name and work have given us immense pleasure.
On the one hand, he is driving, while on the other, he has become an Ambassador of the Lucky Grahak Yojana.
Passengers are also being sensitized about the digital system and many more are taking part in the digital system to encourage it.
I would like to share with my friends how I feel like using RuPay card and e-wallet among a post graduate family in Namda, a young girl from Maharashtra.
The award of one lakh rupees is very important for him and he is encouraging others to take it as a mission.
This task, in a way, plays an important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
A memorable day.
A few days ago, Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary was celebrated.
Remembering him, you must teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM app.
Learn about how to deal with it.
Therefore, I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation stone laid by Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
The BHIM App will be launched in 125 crore people by visiting their homes.
In the last 2-3 months, this movement has been successful in several villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture has contributed a lot to the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village strengthens the economic momentum of the country.
Today, I want to tell you about the happiness.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked very hard to fill the stocks of food.
Due to the hard work of the farmers of our country, maximum paddy production has been done this year.
All the information is that our farmers have broken all the old records.
Every day, we celebrate Pongal or Baisakhi festival, as the harvest season has been harvested in the field this year.
This year, more than 2.7 billion tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country.
Our farmers were eight percent more than the last cerecard they wrote.
It's an unprecedented achievement.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I am glad that the farmers of the country have listened to the poor people and about 2.95 lakh hectares of land has been brought under cultivation of pulses.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service to the poor of the country by the farmers.
I would like to thank my farmer brothers and sisters of my country for their hard work and record production of pulses.
My dear countrymen, in our country, some programmes are being run by the government, by the society, by various organizations, by the organization, for cleanliness through all means.
In some ways, awareness about cleanliness is also being seen.
In a seminar held at Warangal, Telangana, the importance of direct cleanliness has been highlighted.
Toilet Pit Empowering Exercise was conducted in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February.
The 6-room toilet pits were cleaned and the officials showed themselves how to use it by evacuating the hole made by a twinpit toilet.
They also showed how difficult the toilet is, and there is no other problem or dilemma till it is cleaned and cleaned.
We also do small cleaning, like cleaning toilets.
A Standard Twin Pittoilet for the family of six members is filled in about five to six years.
Our farmers are well familiar with the NPK.
Swachhta Pakhwada is being observed by various Government departments in different ways.
For the first time in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs will be participating in the cleanliness drive.
For the second part of March 2020, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will launch the Swachhta Abhiyan.
We know that when any citizen of our country does a commendable job then the entire country gets a new strength and self-confidence improves.
We all welcomed the performance of our Divyangjan players in the Rio Olympics.
India has enhanced the pride of the country as a World Cup for the second time as India lost Pakistan at the Land T20 World Cup finals this month.
I once again congratulate all the players on this team.
The country is proud of the achievements of our Divyang friends.
I have always believed that the differently-abled brothers and sisters are capable, strong, courageous and determined.
We can always learn new things from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, the daughters of our country are not lagging behind.
They have progressed on foot, and have made the country proud of their achievements.
A few days ago, our women players won silver medals in the 'Asian Ragbiceevs Trophy.
I congratulate all these players.
The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is progressing at a rapid pace.
This is not just a government project now, it has become a mission of social consciousness and public education.
In the last two years, people have also joined this scheme.
The fire that has been emanating from every corner of the country has also compelled the common man to think and to change the mindset of the people about the age-old customs which have been prevalent in the country for years.
It gives me great pleasure to inform you that on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Kanyasanthan, the festival has been celebrated.
This kind of positive attitude towards the girl child shows the way towards social renunciation.
I came to know that the Cuddalore district in Tamil Nadu has been able to stop the child marriage with a special drive.
So far, more than 175 child marriage establishments have been closed.
More than 55-60 thousand bank accounts have been opened under Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.
In Madhya Pradesh, a campaign to educate the girl child in every village is being carried out under the Har Ghar Dacca Yojana.
Through your Child ApnaVidyalaya campaign, Rajasthan is running a campaign to re-enter school dropouts from schools and encourage them to pursue their education.
New ideas are also associated with it.
This has been changed as per local requirement.
You are actively associated with it.
I know a lot from you.
The thoughts of the poor people of the villages are reaching out to me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your cooperation.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Perhaps our ancestors had prepared our weather, economic structure and social system in such a way that there was no relaxation in the society at any cost.
In the last few days, we have celebrated many festivals.
Yesterday, Shree Krishna's birth anniversary was celebrated in entire India.
Shri Krishna was such a personality who, after so many thousands of years, during every festival, instilled a new spirit, a new inspiration, a new energy that is in our minds.
He can become an example and an inspiration to solve any problem even today.
Any person can find a solution to any present problem from the life of Shri Krishna.
On the other hand, despite such a great personality, we may be told to agree to work with Sarathi in the battlefield.
If you raise mountains, sometimes pick up your meal then you can feel the anxiety of all these things.
Today, when I am talking to you, my heart is moving towards both these monasteries.
One handsome Mohan, the other wheeled Mohan.
Mohan Mohan, who left the bank of river Yamuna, went to the coastal city of Dwarka in Gujarat and spent the last days of his life in Delhi on the seashore of Mohan Yamuna.
During that period, thousands of years ago, Mohan, the visionary leader, had helped in his wisdom, duty, courage and wisdom in overcoming this war.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On October 2, 1869, a person was born nine years ago, who had shown a new path to human history, established new excellence in that small house.
The labourers of Milan, who were not paid their due, served them.
He considered serving the poor, the helpless, the hungry and the needy as one of his duties.
He himself served leprosy patients with leprosy as an inspiration to prove false beliefs among the people about leprosy.
Mahatma Gandhi used to leave wherever he was, whenever he was in trouble, to help him.
He not only emphasized the importance of service, but also knew the importance of satisfaction.
The word 'Seva' is meaningful only if it is performed with joy and the word 'Seva Param' becomes.
But immediately the real joy of happiness is happiness, this spirit of service is also inherent in that.
We can easily understand this by observing Gandhi ji's life.
In the life of Mahatma Gandhi, the only thought was that of man and society, man and humanity.
He laid emphasis on community mobilization for social development in a fundamental way in Africa, whether it was Pohnix Farm or Tolstoy Farm or Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to pay homage to the venerable Mahatma Gandhi on his various occasions.
Gandhiji also emphasized the importance of collective strength along with the spirit of service.
We want to put into practice both social service and social integration, community service and community mobilization.
Come and go. A-what can we accept?
There is no hindrance, whatever comes to the mind, whatever comes to it, and if it works with the spirit of dedication, then it will be a unique pleasure.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I visited Dandi in Gujarat.
Several events, competitions, exhibitions etc. are being organized in the coming days.
Let me give you a wonderful news at this juncture.
The Haripura Panels were particularly fascinating.
You remember that there was a Congress session in Haripur in Gujarat, where the history of the Congress presidential election was recorded by Subhas Chandra Bose.
These Art Panels have a very beautiful past.
Earlier, in the year 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited Nandlal Bose, the then president of the Klavwan of Santiniketan, before the Haripura session of Congress.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people living in India through art and this art work session should be exhibited.
This is the same Nandalal Bose whose art of our Constitution was presented to us.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
This discourse of his art gave the Constitution as well as the immortality of Nandalal Bose.
Nandalal Bose studied the villages around Haripur and then created some art canvass for rural India.
There was a lot of discussion about this priceless art in Venice.
Once again, on the 150th anniversary of Gandhiji, I appeal to every Indian to make some or the other pledge.
There is a need to do something for the country, for the society and for the other.
This will be our beautiful, true and true tribute to Bapu.
Indias mother child, you must remember that in the last few years, we have launched the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign in the country for two weeks before October 2.
This year it will start from 11th September.
This time we have to focus on plastic.
There is enthusiasm among all sections of the society towards this mission.
My brothers and sisters, many of my businessmen have placed a plaque in the corner of the shop where it says that buyers will get their dues with them.
It can save money and also contribute to protecting the environment.
On October 2, when Bapu completes 150 years of his life, he will not only dedicate to the nation Open Defecation Free, but will also lay the foundation stone for a new mass movement against plastic.
I appeal to all communities, every village, every village, every townman, and I pray that this year's Gandhi Jayanti may be celebrated in a way to rid the plastic waste.
May 2nd October be a special day.
It's recycle-okra.
It can also be used as a fuel.
There is no need to visit this place for inspiration. No one can be more inspiring than Gandhiji.
My dear countrymen, we are well-versed in Sanskrit, a kind of gem of knowledge.
Today, I want to touch upon an important aspect through a Sanskrit dialect, it has been written a long time ago, but even today it has a great significance.
The fools call the stone a gem.
There is a lot of respect for food in our culture.
We have also converted the knowledge about food grains into science.
We all need healthy and nutritious food, especially for women and new-borns.
People are fighting malnutrition in new and entertaining ways.
On the day of harvesting, Anganwadi workers collected one handful of crops from all.
These foods were used for preparing hot food for children and women.
As a result, he became a conscious citizen and a social worker.
After that, he surrendered himself in this direction and became a soldier in this movement.
Liquid food is not solid food.
In Gujarat in 2010, it was felt that a child should be given a Complementary Food on the occasion of Annaprashan programme so that awareness about it is spread in the minds of people.
This is a great initiative that can be adopted everywhere.
People in many states have celebrated 'Thithi Bhojan' campaign.
If a family has a birthday or a birthday or a memorial, then the family members of the family must prepare a tasty, nutritious meal and go to anganbari, school and the family members should offer their own food to the children and share their happiness with everyone, which increases their happiness.
In this way, a unique blend of service and happiness can be seen.
Friends, There are many small things that can help our country to fight against malnutrition.
Today due to lack of awareness, malnutrition has affected both the poor and the rich families.
Poshan Abhiyan will be organised across the country in September.
You will definitely be associated with this campaign, you will collect information and add some new ideas.
If you can save both the people from malnutrition, it means that our country will also be protected from malnutrition.
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that there would be a lot of questions and that is why.
Wherever I have been and whom I have met for the last few weeks, the issue of 'Man vs Wild' has also been raised.
With this episode, I could not only connect with the youth of India but also with the youth of all the parts of the world.I have never thought that such a place would be built in the minds of the youth.
I have never thought about the diversity that our country and the youth of the world care about.
I went to Bhutan last week.
That's what I felt.
Tiger, lion, creature I wonder how many people can be excited about it.
I am confident that people are now seeking to know about the steps taken in the climate justice environment in India.
Was it edited later?
Look, it's not a mystery.
Some people have a question about it, so I'm exposing this secret.
It's not really a mystery.
I used to say that Hindi but he used to listen in English, that is why the conversation became very easy and this is the skill of technology.
After this show, I have seen that many people are discussing Jim Corbett National Park.
You too must visit nature and wildlife sanctuaries.
I told you earlier, I repeat, you must go to the North East.
Your mind will be expanded.
On 15th August, from the Red Fort, I had requested you all to visit 15 places in India for the next three years, 100 places for tourism, see, discuss, take your families and spend some time there.
Your life, your thoughts will spread.
Last month, we had the opportunity to release the Tiger Census.
Do you know the number of tigers in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
A few years ago, half of it was hard.
The Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010 with regard to tigers.
There was a resolution expressing concern over the decline in the number of tigers in the world.
This resolution was to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India - a New India where we have fulfilled our goal at a rapid pace.
We have doubled our tiger numbers by 2019.
Not only the number of tigers in India, but the number of protected areas and community reserves has also increased.
I also remember the lion of the Gir forest in Gujarat when I was releasing the story of 'Ghasuramirtha'.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the lion's home in the forest of Gir used to shrink.
Their numbers were falling.
We made a lot of experiments in the Gir.
We decided to appoint women guards there in 2007.
The Prime Minister said that infrastructure is a means to boost tourism.
In terms of nature and wildlife, we only focus on conservation or conservation.
This time, we have to think beyond the boundaries of conservation in terms of competition or sympathy.
My dear countrymen, can we forget the historic address of Swami Vivekananda on 11 September 1893
This young Indian monk responded with a lively address among the entire world.
In 1893, the world was blessed with a compassionate India, a new India that was built by the great Swami Vivekananda.
Come, let us build the India that Swami Vivekananda saw, the power that he knew.
On this occasion, we are going to launch a nation-wide Fit India Movement.
We have to keep ourselves fit and make the country fit.
This will be a very interesting campaign for the old and the old.
But today I am not giving a detailed account of this.
Wait, August 29th.
2nd October, 2019 for Totally Dedicated Plastic.
With all our might, we will join the campaign to keep the house and its surroundings plastic free.
I believe that this campaign will stir up social media.
Let us start this campaign with a new zeal, a new resolve and a new energy.
I look forward to your messages and suggestions.
May the spirit of inner joy and service illuminate our path.
Thank you very much, Namaste!
Mann Ki Baat, January 2017
The Constitution of India, the duty of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, should bring about a meaningful reform which makes the coming generations aware of the responsibility of democracy and democracy.
But still, the more debate should be on the duties of citizens and the rights of citizens in our country, the deeper the discussion should be regarding the issue, the more comprehensive the discussion should be done.
I hope that at every level, every moment, the more emphasis is given on rights, the more emphasis is on them.
India's democracy can move forward on both sides of rights and duties.
Tomorrow, January 30, is our Pujya Bapu Punya Tithi.
On 30th January at 11:00 am, we paid homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country by celebrating the 2 minute silence.
We should become a common habit of paying our respects at 11:00 pm on 30th January, 2019 as a nation.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families for the various gallantry awards.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Blessed Seva Medal, and several other categories.
I would especially like to appeal to the young people that if you are very active on social media, can you do one thing
This time, the brave-hearts who have been honored with this award, seek out the internet and write a detailed account of them and send them to their friends.
When we get to know about their courage, valour and bravery in detail then the way we are surprised, we also feel proud and inspired.
On the one hand, when we were all excited and excited about the January 26th, at that time, our soldiers in Kashmir, who are determined to protect the country, who are bravely suffering from snowflakes.
I pay my respects and respect to these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you know very well that I am constantly conveying Mann Ki Baat.
January, February, March, April - all these months are months of testing for every family.
One-and-a-half of the world's children are tested but the entire family is under examination.
Family anxiety, student anxiety, teacher anxiety - a diverse psychological atmosphere can be seen in every world.
And I always believed that we should come out of it and that is why today I want to talk to the young friends in detail in detail.
When I announced this, a lot of teachers, parents and students sent me a message, asked questions, asked questions, asked questions, asked me about pain, mentioned the stress, and after seeing that, I want to share it with you today.
I received a message on the telephone from Creator.
However, the question arises, but the same question is in your minds.
The test must be a fun experience.
It should be a matter of hope and enthusiasm that the work that has been done throughout the year has been done and this time an opportunity has come.
You have to make a decision that you will think of it as a pressure, please.
And when there's a festival, the best thing that comes out of us.
It is on the occasion of festivals that society celebrates its power.
During the examination, a festive atmosphere should be created in the family, friends and neighborhoods.
The entire family, like a team, should celebrate this festival with great enthusiasm and fervour.
The fact is that from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Kutch to Kamrup, Amreli to Arunachal, these three-four months are for testing and testing.
It is the responsibility of every year, every year, for three-four months, keeping in mind the tradition of one's own family, to understand the environment of one's own family, to make it a festival.
And so I would like to tell you, little more than more than more.
And you've seen that when you're happy, you feel relaxed, you're so easily relaxed, and when you're so relaxed, you can easily remember a year old story.
You remember the whole picture of what the teacher said in the classroom a year ago.
At times, it seems that we are not able to see the test in the right direction.
At that time, it seems like testing is a question of life and death.
The test means you've been studying all year.
J.
A shining example of Abdullah Kalam.
He wanted to join the Air Force but failed.
Just imagine If he had been disappointed, had he lost his temper, would he have found such a great scientist in India
This has not only increased the competition amongst the students but also raised the stress.
I would like to seek your views on the current status of the education system and the future.
The essence of your real life is your knowledge, your skills, your self-confidence and the power of determination.
You think he's a good doctor, so you should go to him.
When you go to a lawyer when you file a big case, do you look for his marksheet?
You have seen his experience, his wisdom and success.
This is the reason why sometimes the burden of this number falls on the right path.
If you analyze, you will see that when you just run for the number, you have found the easiest way and have paid attention to certain things, but you are unable to face any problem outside this corridor.
And that is why sometimes it happens that despite being successful in the test, we face failures in life.
Richa raised another issue, that is a competition.
It's a big mental conflict.
We can give the example of Sachin Tendulkar.
Friends, in every aspect of your life and especially when you are going to get the exam done, look at it that if you had given two hours before the exam, have you done it for three hours
Earlier when you used to think of getting up, it used to be late, can you get up on time
Shri S. Jaishankar, Minister of External Affairs, Sh.
That's how he helped me.
My mother could not pass the Class 10 examination but I would not have been able to pass the CBSE exam if she didn't get help.
Well-Yes, you're right.
You must have noticed that the number of women who question me, advise me is more.
If you learn to confess, many problems will be solved there.
If you don't accept it, you'll find a way out of this problem.
Hope makes the road tough.
Recognizing the current situation, there is an opportunity to open a new solution.
So admit to what you have.
Look, you'll be free of burden.
We talk about the weight of the school bag on young children, but sometimes I feel like - the expectations of the parents, the aspiration of the children is more than the school bag.
Many years ago, due to a heart attack, one of our acquaintances was in the hospital.
In fact, we went to a sick person and created a fear in him about the disease.
I would like to tell the parents that sometimes we stay with the kids like this.
Have you ever thought that during these testing days, we will give children an environment of laughter and happiness
You'll see the situation will change.
I've got a very interesting phone.
The gentleman didn't want to mention his name.
On hearing the details of the phone, you will be able to understand why the person does not want to publish his name.
Namaste, Prime Minister, I have done a lot of things in my childhood that I am not going to mention my name.
I tried to copy once when I was a kid.
I have wasted a lot of time thinking about how to fake it and how to deal with it.
I could get the same number if I spent that time studying.
When I tried to duplicate myself, we were caught, and for me, many friends around me were also in trouble.
I'm telling you that again.
So where are you going to reach?
Remember, you're digging your own paths, or creating obstacles.
I have also seen that some people are using all their talent and creativity to replicate some of them.
If I talk about sports during the exam then everyone will say - what is the Prime Minister
The common man believes that students will not be able to study if they focus on sports.
There should be proper activity of the rest of the body besides the brain.
If you take a break for five minutes, you will feel it's too much in your studies.
I don't know if everyone's gonna like that, but I'm telling you about my faith.
Once a folk song singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long did you sleep?
I wanted to know, brother, are you a doctor?
He said, "No, you don't tell me, there's a connection with this speech that you sit around your neck.
If you sleep properly, you're gonna get some rest in your early cord.
I didn't think of my sleep and my voice before.
He gave me a simple trick.
Don't do this at all, so your parents will be dissatisfied with me.
Otherwise, when the marksheet comes, the parents will see my reflection instead of you.
If you sleep, it will work. Don't think about it.
Sports plays an important role in keeping mind, intelligence and body active.
Let us move ahead with this mantra.
Dear fellow citizens, The Indian Coast Guard has completed 40 years since its inception on 1st February 2020.
On this occasion, I congratulate and thank all personnel and soldiers of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
Our Coast Guard, in association with 126 warships and 62 aircraft built in our country, has made its mark as one of the world's first four best Coast Guard forces.
Keeping in mind the commitment of the Coast Guard towards the motto of Ayam Raksham, our Coast Guard remains vigilant against all odds to keep our seas safe and secure.
Last year, on this day, the Coast Guard organised a program to clean the seas of our country with their main functions and thousands of people from across the country also participated in it.
Our women pilot officer is in the Coast Guard, and they are capable of handling the Hovercraft.
Basant Rituraj.
Sarasvati is worshipped in spring-panchami.
To worship Vidya, they are brought up to worship.
It is not only the festival of learning but also the festival of inspiration for valour.
'Mera Rang Devasthi Chola' is the inspiration.
I convey my best wishes to the people of our country on this occasion of Basant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, the Mann Ki Baat programme has been enriched by the All India Radio with many colourful thoughts.
In my Mann Ki Baat address last month, Mann Ki Baat began to be heard in regional languages.
This effort has made a big difference.
The people of India have written letters from far and wide about this.
I offer my best wishes to all of them for this self-realization initiative of All India Radio.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
Greetings to all of you on Christmas.
Today is the day to realize the spirit of service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Jesus said, "It is not good for the poor, it is our recognition for them."
There's a lot of popular stories about this.
Lord Jesus once stood by the Temple Treasurer.
Many rich people came and donated a lot.
Just then, a poor widow came and donated two copper money.
In a way, two copper coins do not carry any money as donation.
On the birth anniversary of Mahatma Madan Mohan Malaviya ji, Malaviya ji showed a new direction to the modern education system, which is a resolve and self-confidence among the people of India.
Tributes to him on his Jayanti.
Just two days ago, I had the opportunity to launch several development projects in Varanasi, the land of Malaviya.
He also laid the foundation stone of the Maha Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University.
This cancer center is being built for the entire region and it will be beneficial not only for the eastern region of Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is also the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister of India, Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country will never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, our country has also made a mark in the field of atomic energy.
Atal ji had set an example in every role of the leader, the MP, the minister or the Prime Minister.
On the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I salute him and pray for his good health.
As a worker, I have got the opportunity to work with Atal ji.
A lot of memories are appearing in front of the eyes.
When I tweeted this morning, I shared an old video on how Atal ji's love for a small worker can be traced to the video.
As a gift on Christmas, the entire country is going to get the benefits of two schemes.
Everyone wants to understand and learn from each other.
In order to encourage this, to enhance the power of mobile banking, and to make e-payment a habit, the Government of India has started a scheme called Encouragement for customers and small businesses today.
The Scheme for Incentive to consumers is the Lucky Grahak Yojana and the Traders' Scheme called the Digi-dhan Vyapar Yojana.
On 25th December, 2019, a sum of Rs. 1,000 each will be deposited in the accounts of 15,000 people through the DDR system as a gift from Christmas.
Today this scheme will continue for the next 100 days, not just for one day.
15,000 people will receive this award every day.
In 100 days, gifts worth more than Rs. Crore will reach lakhs of families, but these gifts are worth more than Rs.
Use the digital payment methods like USSD etc.
The Digi-dhan business scheme is for the traders.
He said that just like the traders themselves will join this scheme, they will also involve their customers in cashless transactions.
The awards will also be given separately to the traders, and thousands of awards will be given to them.
This award will not be available for those who can afford to buy more than Rs. 3000.
The poorest of the poor can get the benefit of this scheme through USSD as well as through common phone calls and payments.
Rural people will be able to win this award through AEPS.
In your family, children of class 10 or 12 will be able to teach you this method well.
It is very easy to send the WhatsApp app with a mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know that the awareness about how to use technology, how to make e-payments and how to make online payments is increasing rapidly in the country.
Cashless business, cashless transactions have increased by 200 to 300 in the last few days.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to encourage this process.
You can easily guess how big this decision is.
The traders who exchange digital transactions will be exempted from the online payment system instead of cash in their business.
I know that Assam Government has announced 10 rebate on property tax and trade license fee digitally.
50,000 will be awarded on behalf of the Government if 75 of its customers are digitized from January to March, 2020.
As on 31.03.2017, the Government of Assam has announced an award of Rs. 5.00 lakh under the Umbrella Panchayat for Digi-Transaction.
For the farmers, the Government of Assam has decided to give Rs 5,000 award to the first 10 farmers under the Digital Farmers Shiromani for following the digital path of procurement of seeds and fertilizers.
I congratulate the Government of Assam and the States which have taken this initiative.
Interesting thing is that GNFCs fertilizer sales have increased by 27 over last year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, in our daily lives, there is an importance of unorganized sector.
Most of these people are paid wages, money for work, and also in cash, and we know that the workers are also deprived of it.
Rs 80 is being paid instead of Rs 100, when Rs 80 is required to be paid, Rs 50 is being paid there and many other facilities are being provided to them like insurance.
But when cashless payment is made, the money gets deposited directly into the bank.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is accessible to us.
A country like India should move forward in these areas.
Our youth have made great strides in start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity for our youth to take new ideas, new technologies and new ways of doing business in this field.
We have to take full advantage of the campaign to make the country free from black money and economic corruption.
My dear countrymen, before every episode of Mann Ki Baat, I request people to send their suggestions, give their suggestions and this time thousands of suggestions have come to mygov and Narendra Modi App.
The authors of the 2nd group, who have focused on all these topics, such good work, work for the good of the country, and such pious work, gave an account of the manner in which fraud is taking place, how new unfair practices are being employed.
Shri Gurumani Keobal has written on MyGov that this step is commendable for drawing money in black money.
As a citizen, it is right, but we are happy to cooperate in the fight against corruption.
We are playing an important role in the fight against corruption, black money etc.
This idea is coming from all parts of the country only through the words written by Gurumani.
We all can feel it.
In fact, these are the agents of change.
I would like to thank all of you for one more reason, not only the difficulties faced by them but also the people who are trying to mislead the people.
Moreover, with their intellect, strength and creativity, some people have even opened up the mask of rumor and rumor and brought truth to the fore.
I salute this power of the people for centuries.
People are blessed with the gift of God, the blessings of the people.
I thank the people of the country, I salute the people of the country for participating in this Mahayagya with full vigour against corruption and black money.
I wanted a detailed discussion on the issue of political parties and political funding in Parliament as well as the fight against black money and corruption.
Those who are running away from the political parties, they have a lot of excuses.
This government is the people's government.
On the other hand, on the 8th of my first day, I had said that this is a great fight.
There is a lot of news coming from the government system, it is from the common citizens.
The success that we are achieving is largely due to public awareness.
Can anyone imagine how much the conscious citizens of our country are risking to open their masks
With the help of you, this fight will become easier.
Out of the letters sent to me, there is a third party, which is a large number.
They say that Modi ji should not stop, he should not be tired, he should take as many steps as possible.
We have to win this war and there is no question of being tired.
We have taken it out and we have strictly framed the Benami Property Act.
The Act will play its part in the coming days.
What is to be done for the welfare of the nation and the common man is our primary duty.
In the past, India has established itself with pride in many sectors of the world economy.
As per UNCTADs World Investment Report, India has climbed to third position in the 2016-18 Top Prospective Host Economy.
India has improved 32 ranks in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
Similarly, Indias ranking in the World Banks Logistics Performance Index 2016 has improved by 19 ranks.
Similarly, in several other reports, India is also showing rapid progress.
My dear countrymen, this time, the session of the Parliament has generated warmth among the countrymen.
They have expressed their anger in various ways with regard to the functioning of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also conveyed their warm greetings on the subject.
But in the midst of all this, sometimes some good things happen, and the heart fills with happiness.
Even in the Parliament House, there was a good work that the people of the country did not see.
Brothers and sisters, Today I am happy to say this thing that it is a matter of pride that a bill related to the welfare of the Divyangjans has been passed in the Parliament by the government.
Our government is responsible for the disabled persons.
My divyang brothers and sisters have added strength to my efforts when they have won four medals at Para Olympics.
This victory is not only about enhancing the pride of the country, but its strength has surprised the people of the country.
Like other citizens of the country, our Divyang brothers and sisters are our invaluable treasure and strength.
I am happy that the passage of this Act will provide more employment opportunities to the Divyangjans.
The limit of reservation in government jobs has been increased to 4.
Special provisions have been made for education, facilitation and complaints of Divyangjan.
In line with the UN's vision, the government has enacted this law.
A number of categories have been created for the Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) for the first time.
The section also covers people with the disease of thalassemia, Parkinsons and Vamanas.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, there have been reports from the playground, that we all feel proud of it.
It is natural for us to be proud of being an Indian.
Indian Cricket Team wins 4-0 series against England.
The performance of some young players is commendable.
Test captain Vir Kohli has not only done good batting, but has also given good leadership.
I convey my best wishes to all of them.
Hockey also got good news after 15 years.
I congratulate these young players for their success.
This success is a good sign for the future of the Indian hockey team.
Last month, our women players too have achieved a great success.
The Indian women hockey team won the Asian Champions Trophy and the Indian women hockey team won the Bronze medal in the 18 Asia Cup a few days ago.
I heartily congratulate all the players in cricket and hockey.
My dear countrymen, may 2017 be a year of new hope and enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
Last month, we all celebrated the festival of Diwali.
Like every year, on the occasion of Deepavali, I went to China border to celebrate Diwali with my army.
I have celebrated Diwali with the jawans of ITBP in the high altitude area of the Himalayas.
Every year I go to the border, but this time the experience of Deepavali is completely different.
They were full of that emotions and not only that, I was also witnessing a wonderful response to the greetings and good wishes of the people of the country.
When I saw these things, I was surprised to see what a wonderful imagination he's made.
But, in fact, we did not feel like this during the festival of Deepavali.
On the contrary, it seemed as if I had participated in the festival of Diwali with 125 crore Indians.
Dear fellow citizens, The affection, joy, love and happiness that has been bestowed upon our armed forces will remain confined to Holi and Diwali alone.
I request you, as a society, as a nation, to take it to be part of nature and nature, be it any festival or festival or be it any joy or be it the soldiers of our Army, in some way or the other.
When the nation is united with the army, the strength of the army will increase by 1.25 billion times.
A few days ago, the heads of all villages of Jammu and Kashmir had met me.
He had come to attend the Panchayat Sammelan in Jammu and Kashmir.
About 40-50 chiefs came from different villages in the Kashmir Valley.
I've been talking for a long time.
Even though they had made some demands for the development and development of the village, the recent situation in the Kashmir Valley, law and order, the future of the children, came up for discussion.
Just a few days ago, the board of Kashmir went out and about 95 per cent of the students were in the exam.
With the participation of these large number of students in the board examinations, I can clearly see that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are committed to the development of a better future through education.
I congratulate not only the students for their commitment but also their parents, parents, teachers and all the heads of the villages.
My dear sisters and brothers, When I asked peoples suggestions on Mann Ki Baat this time, I accept that everyone has made a single proposal.
Everyone has asked me to give you a note of Rs.500 per month in detail.
On the 8th of November at 8 pm, I had mentioned a great campaign for the development of the country and for the development of the country.
When I made this decision and made it clear to you, it was not an ordinary decision, it was a difficult step.
At the time of the announcement, I had warned that the impact of this proposal would be such that at least 50 days would be required to come out of it and only then we would be able to move towards normalcy.
It is not easy to recover from the diseases that have spread over 70 years.
1.25 billion Indians have unwavering faith in our country and are committed to working together for the betterment of the country.
This is the reason why we have been successful and the bank and post office personnel are working in an extremely challenging manner.
And when it comes to humanity, they must become even more active.
When the local bank went to the ears of the employees, they immediately reached the house of the elder brother.
Not only that, he has arranged for his treatment.
I'm impressed with this incident.
They are taking legal measures to save their black money.
There is only one request that you do not play with the poor for your injustice.
Your injustice is being directly linked to the records of the poor, not you after the investigation, but these poor people will be trapped, they will suffer.
We have enacted very strict rules to bring Benami property under the ambit of laws.
I am an ordinary citizen of the district of Madhya Pradesh, of Tahsil and of the village of Tirali.
Your 500-thousand note closure is commendable.
I request you to give a few examples of Mann Ki Baat which have welcomed your efforts for the progress of the nation despite difficulties being faced by the common man.
You said that Sudan is coming, but no one could have imagined that you would be able to take such a big step.
By closing the notes of 500 and 1000, you have taught the corrupt black marketers the right lesson.
Every citizen of India does not have a better day than this.
I once again thank you for this.
When we hear such stories through the media, through the common man and the government, the enthusiasm for working is immense.
People went there and ate it, and after two-four-six days, when you came back from the beach, they're paying the bill.
This is the strength of my country, where service and sacrifice are the main religions.
The news that I used to talk about during the elections had spread all over the world.
Many countries of the world have also learnt the word 'Chai Baithak'.
But I didn't know that there could be any discussion in Vietnam either.
I got the news that on November 17, there was such a wedding in Sura.
In this marriage, the parties had arranged only tea for the invitees, and there were no other food and snacks because they lacked cash due to the closure of the note.
Bharat Maru and Daksha through this marriage have set an example in fighting corruption and black money.
Once there is a crisis, people have come up with a new path, and once there is a news story in the village of Dhakijuli in Assam.
The village labours and tea workers receive weekly wages.
Four women in the neighbourhood bought together and paid a note of Rs 2,000 each.
You are well aware of the fact that even two days ago, the poor had deposited a minimum amount of money.
Only fifty per cent of every municipal tax falls.
However, after the announcement of the 8th of this month, there is an old copy of the old document which reads as follows:
You will be surprised to know that in the last one week, Rs. 13,000 crore was deposited in the bank accounts of 740 cities.
We can see the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of which is evident.
Brothers and sisters, Villages and farmers are the backbone of our economy.
I would like to especially congratulate the farmers of the country, when we are making every citizen aware of the difficulties faced by the economy due to these changes.
I'm counting the seeds of this year's crop.
I am happy to see that all the varieties of wheat, pulses and oilseeds have increased in comparison to last year.
Despite all the odds, the farmers have come out with a new path.
Some important decisions have been taken by the government, while priority is being given to the farmers and the villages.
Small businessmen of our country have created employment opportunities and are also involved in economic development.
For them, in the last year's budget, I had made an important decision that the small shopkeepers in villages like the big malls of the city will also be able to do business for twenty-four hours and no law will stop them.
A lot of enthusiasm is being taken to provide loans under the Mudra scheme.
Lakhs and crores of rupees have been given to these small businessmen under the MUDRA Yojana because those people who are associated with this small business have started trading of crores of rupees.
But due to this decision, it is natural for these small businessmen to get inconvenienced.
You can also download the bank's app on your mobile phone.
Provide POS Machines for credit cards and learn how to do business without notes.
You have seen that big malls are operating on technology.
Similarly, a small businessman can also do business with the help of small user friendly technology.
There is no scope for improvement, there is an opportunity for expansion.
I request you all to join in the creation of a cashless society.
You can take full banking facility on mobile phones to promote business and keep the business open without cash currency transactions.
These are technological solutions that are safe, secure and fast.
I want you not only to help in this mission, but also to give leadership and I believe that you can lead the change.
I am confident that you will be able to complete all the business transactions in the village through technology.
I would also like to tell the workers that a lot of exploitation has been done on you.
The paper says a salary and what is being given in the hand is a different one.
Sometimes it was found that there was a person standing outside, who was forced to share it as a part of his life.
In today's new system, the bank will have your bank accounts, your wages will be deposited in the bank so that the minimum wages are changed.
You get the full money, no one takes it.
Today, I specially want to talk to young friends.
India is a country where 65 of the population is below the age of 25 years.
You, the youth and the youth of my country, I know that my decision has been liked by you people.
I also know that you supported this decision.
I also know that you will make a lot of contribution in taking this matter forward in a positive way.
But friends, you're my real soldier, true friend.
My brave young men, can you help me?
Just stay with me, this won't work.
You are not an old generation of people who know about today's world.
It could be that even the elder brothers in your family are not aware of it. Orma-Baba, Kaka-Kakima, Mama-Mama probably don't know.
You know how to book 'App, Keys, Online Banking' and 'Online Tickets.
It is very common for you and you people use it.
But today the great work that the country wants to do is our dream of a cashless society.
It's true that a hundred percent cashless society is not possible.
But once we start the Les-Cash Society, the goal of cashless society will not be incomplete.
And I want your active cooperation, time and resolve in this regard and I know that you will never let me down because we all are the citizens who wish to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know how many opportunities are there for cashless society, digital banking or mobile banking.
Each bank provides online facility.
Each bank has its own mobile app in India.
Each bank has its own wallet.
The white meaning of the wallet is a money bag.
There's a lot of cards.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, the RuPay card is available to crores of poor families of India, which used to be very rarely used.
There has been an increase of about 300 in the number of poor people who have been using it since 8th of this month.
The pre paid cards are available on mobile phones and bank accounts are also available for the cost of money.
And this is so simple as sending your WhatsApp.
Phones with common features can also lead to cashless transactions.
Whether it is smoking or vegetable, milk, newspaper, tea, selling, everyone can use it without harming it.
And I have also urged to simplify this system.
All banks are involved and doing the job.
My young friends, even after all this, there is a generation that is familiar with all these things.
And you all are well aware of the great work that you have been doing.
The creative message that you give to whatsapp - slogan, poetry, stories, cartoons, new imagination, laughter and laughter - all these things are present here. And on the face of the challenge, this creative energy of the younger generation seems to have been the specialty of this India.
Similarly, when we are going through such a big change today, there is a fundamental change in your mind.
But my dear brothers and sisters, I once again say that you need your help in this thing and I believe that you, crores of youth of the country will do this thing.
Do one thing, from today onwards, I want to assure you that you will become a part of the cashless society.
Use the technology of online printing on your mobile phones.
Not only this, take half an hour, one hour or two hours in a day and explain to at least ten families how to use this technology, how to download the app from your bank, how to spend the money in your account, how to provide it to the buyer.
Teach the shopkeepers how to do business.
You will have to give leadership to the mission of getting rid of the problems of the people of the country from the clutches of this culture and this campaign of corruption freeing the country from the black money and getting rid of the problems.
I invite you - come, not just support, but we will become a soldier of this change and change.
We will take this fight to liberate the country from corruption and black money. There are many countries in the world where the younger generation has changed the lives of those countries and it will be believed that the change that has been brought about by the youth, by the youth, by them they have revolutionized.
With the help of Kenya, a mobile system called M-PESA, used technology, named M-PESA, and today Africa has proposed to be transformed into a pan-India trading hub in the region.
This country has created a big revolution.
My young friends, once again, once again, I would like to urge you to take forward this mission.
I invite each school, college, university, NC-C, NSS, as a group and individual to do the same.
You have seen that the most popular artist of this time, Amitabh ji is taking forward the cleanliness campaign with great effort.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts and your thoughts are reaching out to MyGov, Narendra Modi App and keeping me connected with you.
Now Mann Ki Baat will be broadcast on 11th April, but after the completion of this broadcast, it will be heard in foreign language.
I am grateful to All India Radio for this new initiative that will provide an opportunity to the countrymen to be connected wherever they are in Hindi.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2016
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated with enthusiasm and fervor in every corner of India.
India is such a country where in 365 days some or some other part of the country has witnessed festivals.
With the completion of several traditional festivals, we have simplified the process of changing the way we celebrate the time and the society.
But in all these things, we are able to see that the entire journey of festivals in India, its duration, depth, impact on every person - all these things are connected with the same mantra - moving the person towards a group.
By promoting individuals and individuals, there is an effort to expand the horizon to the universe with limited thinking.
And this is possible only through this festival.
Sometimes in India, there is a festival of eating and drinking, but there is also a feeling of what is the festival of the season and what should be eaten there.
Our ancestors have used scientific methods to incorporate the kind of crops that are being grown by the farmers and the kind of festivals that can be associated with them, and the kind of reforms that should be undertaken in the field of health.
Today the whole world is thinking about the environment.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of concern.
There, in India, this tradition of festivals strengthens the love of nature and makes every person better from boy to boy.
And science has proved that what kind of change comes in the waters of the seas during full moon and moon, something affects the nature and affects the minds of the people.
So far, we have a tradition of providing science to the universe.
Today, when we are celebrating the festival of Diwali, as I have said, every festival of ours is educational and learning.
This festival of Deepavali gives the message of 'Tamsooma Jyotikama' to go out of darkness to light.
Social Distancing: Diwali is the festival of light from darkness to light by lighting the lamp in the shadow of personal guilt.
We all know one thing very well that there is a cleanliness drive in every family during Diwali, be it from the rich to the poor, or from the rich to the poor.
Each corner of the house is cleaned up.
The government of any place in the world, its parliament, ruler and everyone became a part of the festival of Diwali.
The Prime Minister of Singapore shared his photos of the festival of Diwali with the whole world through Instagram.
1616 women members of Singapore Parliament dressed in Indian sarees and photographed outside the Parliament and is spread across the social networking site.
And all this has been done for Diwali.
In Singapore, Diwali is celebrated on every road and in every region.
I am told that the festival of Diwali inspires everyone around the world to go from darkness to light.
The news of the accident, the news of the fire, the news of the death of the deceased is a cause of concern.
And there is a problem that on the occasion of Diwali, Dr. Baba Saheb had gone to the house to celebrate Diwali with his family in Diwali.
It is not just a day, but also a day-long festival of Govardhan Puja, or the festival of Bhai-Panchami to Karthik-Purnima.
It is a festival that has been going on for four days.
But there is a specialty of this festival that gives a great message to the society.
There is a saying that all the people of the world worship the Sun.
Chhath Pooja is a festival where the sun sets.
It has a very big social message.
On this occasion, I would like to convey my best wishes to all of you, especially to the countrymen, to express my gratitude and gratitude to them.
In the last few months, every soldier of our army has given up everything to make us sleepy.
In my mind, sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the Armed Forces have made a special impact.
And that is why I felt that this Diwali should be dedicated to the security forces.
I have urged the people of the country to take part in the Sandesh to Soldiers campaign.
But today, I would like to bow down to the fact that there is no such person in India, who doesnt have immense love for the country's army, who is proud of the army, who is not proud of the defense forces.
The way people have shown this thing, it will give strength to the country.
We can never imagine the strength of the soldiers of the security forces, but a message from you gives them.
Be it the Indo-Tibetan Police, the Assam Rifles, the Navy, the Infantry or the Air Force, or the Coast Guard, I can't tell everyone's names, no matter what kind of difficulties our jawans face.
When we are celebrating Diwali, some of them in the desert, some in the Himalayas, some in the industry, some are protecting the airports, some are fulfilling their responsibilities.
I really want to express my gratitude to the people of our country.
He has written a poem on the artist who has given the message through art, on which he has created a film, Alpana, Cartoon, on whom Saraswati has done the work.
I can imagine how proud it is for the soldiers of my country.
The message in the hashtag Sandesh to Soldiers is truly inspiring.
Shri Ashwini Kumar Chauhan has written a poem and I want to read it.
I celebrate the festival with great pity, today I tell you, it's possible you're here.
My dear countrymen, whose father's house and father-in-law, many of the families in the army, such a sister-in-law, sent a telephone message to me.
He said, "Namaste Prime Minister, I am Shivaji Mohan.
Our army brothers and sisters have received a lot of enthusiasm in the 'Sansad to Soldiers' campaign that started on this Diwali.
My family is a soldier family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father-in-law and father-in-law were army officers.
This message has inspired all the officers of our armed forces on the border, and also the Army Circle.
I would like to say that with the army officers and soldiers, their wives and the entire family had to sacrifice a lot.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers are not only on the border but also on their alertness in various aspects of life.
Be it the natural calamity or the crisis of governance or the crisis of the enemy, or the youth who have been guided by the wrong path, our brave soldiers should be motivated to carry forward the work in every aspect of their lives.
This discussion indicates that some families are not able to build toilets in their homes due to lack of money.
Vikas Thakur has shown that by paying Rs.1000 each to 57 families in their pockets, they have strengthened the Swachhata Abhiyan.
Similarly, Himachal Pradesh is going to become an open defecation free state.
No one goes there easily.
These young men walked all day on their shoulders, carrying bricks, cement and other toilet materials.
In Gujarat too, more than 150 municipalities and corporations have been declared open defecation free.
10 districts have also been included in this list.
My dear countrymen, the government has planned a lot and if there is a better plan after the first plan, then the first one has to be dropped.
But generally no one pays attention to this.
There is no need for kerosene in the houses where there is gas connection and electricity.
But the government's looking for an arrow!
I have heard that so far seven or eight districts of Serajya have been cured of Corona.
The way they have taken up this task, I feel that the entire state will soon become kerosene-free.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always our guiding light.
All his views on what the country will do, how he will do, are still considered as an example.
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you make a plan, you will remember the poor and weaker sections of the country and then you will feel that whatever you are going to do, will not harm them or not
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the problem.
No matter how old our thinking is, we need to bridge the gap between boys and girls in the society.
This is an opportunity for our daughters to be free from discrimination in the Indian society.
Even though vaccination is done by the government, lakhs of children still get rid of vaccination and become victims of diseases.
Mission Indradhanush vaccination is one such mission, which has been launched by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to empower children to get rid of dangerous diseases.
In the 21st century, there will be darkness in the village.
This is the reason why the campaign of providing electricity to the villages and to free the villages from darkness is going on successfully.
Work is going on before the deadline.
Efforts are on to make 5 crore families smoke-free and this campaign is also going on successfully.
Small traders, small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, hawkers, etc., are forced to charge the loan to Mahajan.
MUDRA Yojana, Stand-Up scheme, Jan Dhan Account are all successful campaigns to get rid of the middlemen.
The money is being directly transferred to the bank through Aadhaar card and directly into the bank accounts of the genuine beneficiaries.
It is time to get rid of middlemen in the lives of the common man.
My dear countrymen, on the 31st of October, 2019, the great men of this country who had laid down their lives for the unity and integrity of India, had also shown the way - the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On 31st October, 2019, on the one hand, is the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, on the other, on the other hand, on the one hand is the great leader of the unity of the country and on the other hand is the death anniversary of Smt. Gandhi.
Sir, you know Sardar Patel's birthday on October 31st.
Sardar Patel was such a person who had spent his entire life for the integrity of the country and I think he has succeeded in this direction.
He brought everyone together, and we can say or say the misfortune of the country that was also the death of Gandhi on that day.
And what we all know is what happened in the country after his assassination.
Sir, I want to tell you how we can stop such unfortunate incidents.
Dear fellow citizens, This is not a tragedy.
SardarVallabhbhai Patel is a witness to the events of history and SardarVallabhbhai Patel had done the great work of uniting the country after Chanakya.
But it is also a sad fact that Sardar Saheb had dedicated his life for unity, had fought for the unity of the country and had also suffered many hardships due to this reason but never left the road of unity.
But on the birth anniversary of that Sardar Patel, thousands of Sardars, thousands of Sardars and thousands of Sardars were put on the path of death after the assassination of Smt. Gandhi.
The great men who spent their entire life for the sake of unity, on their birthdays, torture on Sardars, these pages of history hurt us all.
But even in this crisis, the mantra of unity has to be taken forward.
Unity in diversity is the strength of the country.
There are many languages, nations, clothes, food, but there is unity in diversity - this is the strength of India, the specialty of India.
Every generation has a responsibility, every government has a responsibility, every corner of the country has an example of unity and development of the country's unity and integrity.
We should protect ourselves and the country from discrimination based on discrimination.
Sardar Saheb has given us 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' and it is the responsibility of all of us to create 'Shreshtha Bharat'.
The mantra of Unity is the foundation of Make in India.
Sometimes we hear the name of Amul.
Today, the entire India and the people of Indian origin are familiar with every product of Amul.
But few people know that the vision of the visionary Sardar Saheb was to form the Union of Cooperative Producers.
Kheda district, which was known as the district at that time, emphasized this concept in 1942 and in reality today's 'Alam' is a living example of what Sardar Saheb had done for the happiness and prosperity of the farmers.
I pay tribute to Sardar Saheb.
Wherever we live on the occasion of Unity Day on 31st October, we will remember Sardar Saheb and take a pledge of unity.
My dear countrymen, Karthik Poornima is also a part of the festival of lights.
Guru Nanaks teachings are relevant for the entire humanity, for the sake of India and for the entire humanity.
Service, truth and good for everyone, this is the message of Guru Nanak.
His mantra was Peace, Unity and Harmony.
The campaign to free the society from discrimination, superstitions, superstitions and prejudices was in every sense of the word Guru Nanak.
I salute Guru Nanak from the bottom of my heart on the auspicious occasion of Prakash Parv.
My dear countrymen, once again, my best wishes to you all on the occasion of this Diwali, which is dedicated to the soldiers of the country.
Your dream, your resolution may be successful in every way.
May your lives be filled with happiness and peace, the Prime Minister said.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you.
A few days ago, we lost 88 brave sons of the country in the terror attack in Uri sector of Jammu Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay my respects.
And that is why I will tell my countrymen that on that day, I will repeat what I had said that the guilty will be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in the army.
We're proud of our army.
Today I want to talk to the people of Kashmir in a special way.
The citizens of Kashmir are well aware of the anti-national forces.
And those who understand the truth, they have begun to move forward in peace by separating themselves from that power.
Every mother and child should start school and college at a fast and full-fledged pace.
Farmers also want to ensure that their fruits and crops reach every market in the country.
And in the last few days, business has started moving smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and goodwill are our ways of solving all our problems, our path of progress and our path of development.
We have to scale new heights of development for the next generation.
I believe that we will sit together and find solutions to all the problems, find solutions, and at the same time create a better path for the future generations of Kashmir.
It is the responsibility of the administration to protect the citizens of Kashmir.
In order to maintain law and order, the administration has to make arrangements.
I would like to tell the legal fraternity that we have the power, the power, the law and the rules are required to live in law and order and to give the people of Kashmir the life of peace and prosperity.
Sometimes people think differently than we think.
I get a chance to know a lot about social media these days.
Every corner of India provides an opportunity to get a glimpse of the ideas of the people and this enhances the power of democracy.
A few days ago, a student of class 11, Harshavardhan, gave me a different kind of thinking.
He wrote: "I am very disturbed after the terrorist attack in Uri.
I had a question in my mind about what I could do for the welfare of the nation.
I take a pledge that every day I will continue to study for three hours.
We will be able to become a good citizen of the country.
He said, It is my pleasure to be here in this atmosphere of anger and of a healthy mind at such a young age.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had tried to give this feeling to the whole world.
And he inspired the common man with the mantra of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' and showed how to work for the country.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji showed us another way to show patriotism through the bomb and the sound of the gun.
When Mahatma Gandhi too was engaged in the movement, when there was a need for a direction and intensity when the movement reached, he used this intensity of movement to organize more constructive work within the society.
All of us, the army, the administration and the people of our country should perform their duties and we should contribute something or the other in the constructive work with the passion of this nation.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T.
S.
Karthik has written to me through the Narendra Modi App that all the athletes who had gone to the Para-Olympics have written the history and they have won the victory of the Human Spirit.
Not only you two, but every person of the country has created an emotional attachment to the athletes who are participating in the Para Olympics.
Probably the Para Olympics and the performance of our players in the field of sports, from the point of view of humanity, our attitude towards the disabled persons has completely changed.
And I can never forget about Deepa Malik who won us.
When he won the medal, he said, I have lost disability only through this award.
This word has a lot of strength.
This time, in the Para Olympics, 199 athletes, including three women, were present in our country.
If we compare our sports with other games, then it is the strength of will power, the strength of resolve that makes the sports of Divyangjan a big part of our country.
You will be happy to know that our players have won four medals, two gold medals, one silver medal and one bronze.
12 years later, the gold medal winner, Debendra Jhazhariya, took the second time with a gold medal.
12 years of age is too old, once you get a gold medal, you get hungry.
But Devender has shown that the condition of the body has never allowed the age old resolve to go to sleep and he has won the gold medal after twelve years.
He was not a divyang from his birth.
Because of the electric shock, he lost one arm.
You can imagine how a person has done a great job in getting the first gold medal at the age of 23 and the second gold medal at the age of 35 years.
Mariappan has won a gold medal at the Thangavelu High Camp.
Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of five.
Poverty cannot be obstructed by his resolve.
He did not come from a big city, he did not even come from a middle class clean family.
During the twenty-one years of his life, he had brought medals to the country in the strength of his determination, despite his physical as well as mental problems.
The name of the athletedepa master has been associated with many symbols.
Varun C.
Bhati won the Bronze medal at the High Segment.
The importance of Para Olympics is not only in our country, in our society and around us, but also in our approach to change our divyang brothers and sisters.
Very few people are aware about the valour shown by the Divyangjans in this Para Olympics.
A few days ago, there was an Olympic competition in the same place.
Not only this, I was also surprised when I came to know that among the 4th awardees, who have not received any medal, they have run in less time than the medal winners.I once again congratulate all our players.
In the coming days, India is moving towards the development of Para Olympics and a fair scheme for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week, I had a wonderful experience at Navsari in Gujarat.
It was a very sensitive moment for me.
A Mega Camp was organized by the Government of India for the Divyangjans.
I met a little girl, Gaurisardul, who had come from far-flung forest in the district of Dang.
The Government of India has set a world record on the land of Varanasi, which is considered very important.
Within 8 hours, 600 Divyangjans were provided with hearing aids.
This event has taken place at the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for our countrymen that three World Records have been created by the Divyangs in a day.
Dear fellow citizens, Two years ago, on October 2, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission.
And that day also I had said that cleanliness and cleanliness should be our habit and every citizen should have a duty to create an environment of hatred for cleanliness.
On the 2nd of October, when we mark two years, I can say with confidence that there is an increasing awareness of cleanliness in the hearts of 1.25 billion Indians.
I had said - , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , :
That is, the country is moving towards 125 crore steps towards cleanliness.
This is the reason why every citizen, ruler, government department or road bank, bus depot or railway station, school-college, religion, hospital - from the children to the elderly, from the villages to the poor, from the farmers to the women, has made some contribution towards cleanliness.
Friends, The media has also played a positive role in this regard.
I think we still have to go a long way.
In order to stay healthy, for the honour of the citizens, especially the mothers and sisters, we have to stop the practice of open defecation.
And that is why a campaign of Open Defecation Free (ODF) i.e.
I had visited Gujarat recently, where officials have told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will reach the goal of ODF on October 2 this year.
I congratulate all those who have been successful in this direction and convey my best wishes to all those who have been successful.
My thoughts are with the countrymen, for the honour of their mothers and sisters, and for the well-being of the small and marginal children, our country will be liberated from this crisis.
Come, let us move forward with our resolve.
I would like to start a new scheme for the young friends who are accustomed to using technology, especially for them.
You all have the right to know the status of the Swachhata Mission in your city and therefore the Government of India has given a telephone number 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
And in 2019, we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, i.e.
You can call this number in 1969 and not only do you know the statistics about the toilet construction in your city but also apply for the construction of a new toilet.
You, especially the younger generation should take advantage of it.
The Government of India is also calling upon the corporate world to come forward and sponsor professional young professionals who are willing to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent as Swachh Bharat workers in the districts.
And so, along with the cleanliness mission, we have to move towards the 'waste to competition'.
The chemical sarcompanies have been told to buy the compost from the waste.
Farmers who want to go to organic farming should get the necessary ration.
Those who are concerned about the health of their lands, who are concerned about the health of their soil, and whose use of chemical fertilizers has caused a lot of harm, should also be provided with adequate quantity of fertilizers.
Shri Amitabh Bachchan has joined as a brand ambassador for this task.
I have seen that there is a constant new news about cleanliness.
One day I got the news papers - students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and started a campaign to create awareness about the construction of toilets.
The Government of India has also set up one year calendar in various categories.
Every department is emphasising on cleanliness for 15 days.
I appeal to the common citizens that if all these departments of the government work in any way, then you people too join this campaign.
This time around 500 cities with a population of 1 lakh per year.
This is the reason why there is a feeling among the people of every city that we are lagging behind, we are going to do something good next time.
An atmosphere of competition has been created in the field of cleanliness.
I hope that all citizens will join this campaign as much as possible.
On 2nd October, we mark the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
The Swachh Bharat Mission completes two years.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali, I request you to buy some of the Khadi products.
I would also like to appeal to every family to buy Khadi products that light the lamp of Diwali in the homes of the poor.
Sunday, October 2, but as a citizen, can we take part in a cleanliness drive somewhere or the other
You should work for at least 2-4 hours for cleanliness and share one photo of it with the Narendra Modi App.
You can share it if you have a video.
This collective effort of ours will give a new strength and a new momentum to this campaign.
Let us resolve to do something good for the country by remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
Dear fellow citizens, There is a unique pleasure, a unique pleasure, and a joy in getting something recognition done in life.
In the past, I have also seen that when I had appealed for the release of subsidy on gas, the response given by the common man is extremely inspiring in our national life.
Some youth of our country, small organizations, people from the corporate world, students of schools, and members of some voluntary organizations will come together to celebrate the Joy of Living Week in several cities from October 2 to October 8.
The campaign is aimed at mobilizing food and clothing to the needy and poor people.
When I was in Gujarat, I saw that our officers went to different families and collected the old toys that they had in their house and provided the children of those poor people in the slums.
It was really nice to see all these toys and see the happiness of those poor kids.
I believe that in cities where Joy of Living Week is being observed, there is a need to inspire young people and help them.
This festival is a celebration of the festival.
I convey my best wishes to all the youth who are doing this.
Dear fellow citizens, Today is the 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and the 100th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
How can the poorest of the poor get the benefits of development
He spoke of the two words - work on all hands and water on all lands.
The country will celebrate his 100th birth anniversary as Garib Kalyan Varsh.
If the society, the government and others are concerned about how the fruits of development will benefit, then we can free the country from poverty.
Dear fellow citizens, Two years ago, on the occasion of Vijayadashami, I had launched the Mann Ki Baat programme.
My thoughts are with all the citizens of the country, who have always been associated with Mann Ki Baat.
On the completion of two years of the Mann Ki Baat programme, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the listeners for the way you have encouraged and have blessed this programme.
I also express my gratitude to Akashwani that they have not only promoted this event but have also made every effort to reach out to the audience in every language.
I also express my gratitude to the people of the country who have written letters, suggestions and fault lines in the system of Mann Ki Baat and have created a special programme on all these documents and have set up a platform to solve the problems faced by the Government employees in the programme.
This is the reason why Mann Ki Baat has become a new medium of social change and not just a speech of 12-20 minutes.
What else can be a cause of greater satisfaction for any one of us?
Therefore, I thank and express my gratitude to all those associated with this institution for making it a success.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja, the festival of Vijayadashmi, the festival of Diwali is beginning next week.
Navratri or Durgapuja - Shakti is a prayer for the unity of the society.
It will be an occasion to connect with each other.
Only then will we be able to celebrate Vijay Diwas together.
Come, let us worship strength, let us move forward with the mantra of unity.
Tomorrow, August 29th, is the birthday of the hockey magician Dhyanchand.
National Sports Day is celebrated across the country.
I pay my respects to Dhyan Chand Ji and also remind you of his contributions.
He has played an important role in winning the Gold in the Hockey Championship in India in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
We're all cricket lovers, we know the name of Breadman.
He talked about meditation and said, He scores goals like runs.
Dhanchand ji was a living torch-bearer of sportsmanship and patriotism.
Once in a match in Kolkata, a hockey stick hit the head of the opposition party, Dhyanchand ji.
It's only 10 minutes left after the match is over.
In those 10 minutes, Dhyan Chand ji took three rounds and said, "I have taken the revenge of the blow - from the fire".
My dear countrymen, whenever we come to Mann Ki Baat, many suggestions are received on MyGov portal or Narendra Modi App.
Shri Ajit Singh has written on the Narendra Modi App that please do tell about Mann Ki Baat and its participation in sports, because they have made the country proud by winning medals at the Rio Olympics.
Shri Sachin Tendulkar has written to you urging you to include Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa in Mann Ki Baat this time.
One of them is from North India, one from South India, one from East India, and one from other parts of India.
It seems that the daughters of the entire country have brought laurels for India.
In the MyGov portal, Shikha Thakur has written that we could do better in Olympics.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of PMs address in the 15th Episode of Mann Ki Baat 2.0 on 25.03.2020 My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
But in this regard, I would like to draw your attention - was it good to participate in other competitions
The answer is no.
And no one can do it well except you.
Similarly, Shriman Satya Prakash Mehra has written on the Narendra Modi App that we need to emphasize on the extra-curricular activities in Mann Ki Baat, especially on children and youth.
Thousands of people have expressed similar sentiments.
There is no way to deny that we have not been able to produce the results as expected.
In some cases, it has also happened that the meaning of our players who had reached the country has not reached the level of their ability to reach there even in the sporting arena.
And in the list of medals, we had only two medals.
But even if we do not get the real prize, if we observe it properly, then for the first time, the players of India have shown great skill in a lot of things.
Look, in the shooting, our innovation finished fourth and he lost the medal for a very short period of time.
Deepa Karkar also performed very well in the gymnasium and secured the fourth position, and lost her medal at the very least distance.
But how can we forget that he was the first Indian woman to qualify for Olympics and Olympics finals.
This happened in the case of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna Jutti.
This time we have shown good results in the athletes.
After 32 years in the 19th century, Lilyta Babar scored a medal winner in the Track and Field Final.
Boxing-Obekash Krishna Yadav reached the final, but he did not win the bronze medals.
There are many players like Aditya Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das and others who have performed very well.
But my dear fellow citizens, we have a lot more to do.
If you want to do what we've done this time, maybe we'll be disappointed.
I have announced the formation of a committee.
We will go into the depths of the world about how sports is being practiced at home.
We'll prepare a roadmap for how we can do better.
We have prepared a roadmap for the results by 2020, 2024 and 2028.
I would also urge the state governments to prepare such committees and see what we can do in the field of sports.
I would also urge the sports fraternity to do brainstorming without any discrimination.
State Governments should review the situation and send their suggestions.
And I believe that 1.25 billion Indians, 65 percent of the youth of the country will have a lot of good results in the field of sports.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September is the Teacher's Day.
I spent a few years spending time with the students on a teacher's day and spending time like a student.
I've learned a lot from these little boys.
On the 5th of September, Teachers' Day is celebrated as well as Education Day.
But this time I have to go to the G-20 Summit, so I want to express my feelings in Mann Ki Baat today.
The teacher's place is as much as the mother's place in life.
After these days of Rio Olympics, the story of Pullela Gopichand is being discussed again and again.
He's a player, but he's got a good training proof.
Today, I see Gopichand as a better trainer than an player.
On Teachers' Day, let us pay our respects to Pullila Gopichand and his contribution to the cause of her saddening and sports and the success of his disciples.
We always feel the role of a teacher in our lives.
On September 5, the former President of India, Dr.
This day marks the birth anniversary of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan ji and the nation as 'Teacher Day'.
Wherever he reached his life, he always tried to spend his day as a teacher.
Not only this, he always used to say, "Good teachers are those in whom students never get lost.
Even after becoming the President, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji had shown this wonderful life to spend the day as a teacher and to keep the student alive within him.
I sometimes remember a lot of words from my teacher because he was our ideal in our small village.
Today, I can say this thing with happiness that one of my teachers, who is almost 90 years old, is still writing in his own hands every month.
If you have a photo with your teachers, if there is any good news with your teachers, if there is any message sent to your teachers then you must share it with everyone in the Narendra Modi App.
See, it is very important to see teachers in the country from the perspective of students.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Utsav is celebrated a few days later.
Lord Ganesha removes all obstacles and we all want our country, society, family, everyone and their lives to be uninterrupted.
Whenever we talk of Ganesh Utsav, it is very natural to remember the name of Lokmanya Tilak.
It was Lokmanya Tilak who gave a universal appeal to Ganesh Utsav.
Through the Sarvajanik Ganesh Utsav, he converted this religious festival into a national consciousness festival, celebrating the festival of social reform.
There should be a discussion on all the issues that affect the life of the society through the celebration of Ganesh Utsav so that the society becomes new and new with the help of these festivals.
At the same time, Lokmanya Tilak ji's mantra - 'Swaraj is our birthright' - be it the center of discussion.
These days, Ganesh Utsav is celebrated not only in Maharashtra but also all over the country.
The youth, in particular, started preparing for the festival with enthusiasm.
Some people are still trying to follow the idea of Lokmanya Tilak that he had started this festival.
Discussions, Essay Competitions, Essay Competitions were organized on various topics.
The statue symbolizes all those things that affect our society in a grand manner.
On the occasion of Ganesh Utsav, a mass awareness campaign was organized on the subject of folk education.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
But now we live in a free India.
On this occasion of Ganesh Utsav, we will say that Suraj is our right.
We will walk on the path of Su-raj, Su-raj will be our main demand.
Shouldn't we move ahead with this mantra
Come, let me invite you.
Without festivals, our lives are impossible, but we have to change according to the need of the hour.
This time many people have written a lot about Ganesh Utsav and Durga Puja.
They are particularly concerned about the environment.
A person by the name of Shankar Narayan Prashant told me- "Modi Ji, through Mann Ki Baat, tell everyone that they use the Ganesh idol made from the soil of Pushkarni village without using the plastic of Paris.
Protecting the environment, protecting rivers and effluents, and protecting small creatures from pollution, is a way of serving God.
Lord Ganesh-Binghanhari.
That's why we're not gonna make such statues that make obstacles.
I don't know how you people will take these things, but I just don't say that alone, many others are saying that.
Green Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
Durga Puja still has some time left.
Now we have to decide that those old families who make idols will get the opportunity to earn if they make the statue of Pushkarni or the soil from the river.
And after the festival, they will be revived and the environment will be protected.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be conferred with Sant Award on 4th September, 2019.
Mother Teresa spent her entire life in the service of the poor of India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud of the title of Mother Teresa Saints.
A delegation of 1.25 billion Indians and the Government of India led by our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will be present at the event to be held on 4th September.
We can always learn from saints, sages, monks and great men.
I hope we'll learn new things, learn and do good.
Jan Shakti is considered to be a form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to involve people in the Clean Ganga Campaign in association with the five State Governments.
The village heads who are present in Allahabad have taken a pledge to witness the Mother Ganga that they will stop the practice of open defecation in their villages, run a campaign to build a toilet, or participate fully in the cleaning of the Ganga.
I thank all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have made this possible.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of five states who have taken an important step by connecting the people towards the cleanliness of Ganga.
This has been done by boys and girls in the age group of seven to seventeen years.
The emotional impact of this letter is that on the next day after receiving the letter, when students came to school, some parents had written to the school teachers, saying that they will be given toilets at home by a certain date.
A 16-year-old girl from Koppal district of Karnataka is sitting on Satyagraha against her family.
When the Chief Minister of the village, Mohammad Shafi informed that he had constructed toilets in a week at a cost of Rs. 18,000.
The Prime Minister said that the Chief Ministers of the villages, like Malamma, have the strength of their daughters and Mohammad Shafi, are truly remarkable.
This is the strength of the people that how to make roads to solve problems.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has now become the dream of every Indian.
It's a resolution to somebody.
And some Indians have chosen this as their destination.
He said that the Government of India is concerned about creating a film on Swachh Bharat for 2 or 3 minutes and this short film should be sent to the Government of India.
Details of the same will be available on the website.
It will have a competition and will be awarded on October 2, 2019, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti.
I am also telling the TV channels that you should make such a photocopy of the film.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to ensure that our relationship with our neighbours is deep, simple and vibrant.
A few days ago, an important event happened when our President, His Excellency Pranab Mukherjee, greeted the Akashwani Maitri channel in Kolkata.
Now, will many people think that the President will launch a radio channel?
But it's not an ordinary radio channel, it's a big step.
We are in Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are taking forward the same cultural tradition even today.
On the one hand, AkashvaniMitri and Bangladesh Betar will be sharing programmes on the other, while on the other hand, Bengali speaking people from both sides will enjoy the All India Radio.
All India Radio has played a major role in connecting people to people.
The President inaugurated it.
I would also like to thank Bangladesh for being associated with it.
I also convey my best wishes to all the friends of All India Radio who are playing their role in foreign policy.
Such incidents give a new energy, a new inspiration, and this is the source of inspiration for the country.
A few days ago, I got a letter that shook my mind.
He wrote this letter to a nearly twenty-four-year-old mother, a retired teacher.
If he had never prohibited his name from being published in the letter, then I wanted him to tell all of you the name.
He wrote in a letter, "When you applied for subsidy on gas, I gave up the gas subsidy and then forgot it.
People of the country, know your casualties, I tried to send a letter to those who gave up the gas subsidy, and some of my representatives presented the same letter themselves.
I'm trying to write more than one crore letters.
It is not worth 50,000 rupees, it is important for this mother and the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters like her that help in making the future of our country stronger and more confident.
My dear countrymen, last year we were very worried about floods but this month of August we are constantly facing floods.
Many floods have occurred in some parts of the country.
State Governments, Central Governments, local administrations, social organisations and citizens have been made aware of the situation.
However, there are some reports that we need to remember.
Those who are trying to create disturbances in Kashmir by taking forward these little boys, they must never have to answer these innocent boys.
My dear countrymen, this country is blessed with great diversity.
Thank you so much today. Thank you so much.
This morning, I had the opportunity to spend some time with my young friends in Delhi.
I am confident that in the days to come, the entire country will be filled with excitement and enthusiasm among the youth.
We all know that in a few days, the biggest sports event in the world is going to be organized.
Repeatedly, our ears are re-energized.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organized a grand and beautiful run, Run for Rio, Khelo and Live, Play and Prosperity.
Wherever I am, I will do something to encourage our players.
I will be with you as a citizen of the 1.25 billion countrymen, as a citizen, to encourage all these warriors.
Come, let us reward each other as much as we can for our efforts in the times to come.
Today, when I am talking about the Rio Olympics, a poetry-loving student of Punjab Central University, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay wrote a poem.
Maybe there are many other poets who have written many poems, maybe they write poems, or they will do it in every language, but I want to enjoy the poetry written by Surajji to me.
A young man, Shriman Ankit, on his death anniversary, reminded me of President Abdul Kalam.
Last week, the country and the world paid homage to Dr. Kalam on his death anniversary.
When Abdul Kalam ji was named, then only science, technology and missile - the future of a powerful India can be seen in front of our eyes.
And that is why you have written that what is your government doing to the dreams of Abdul Kalam Ji
If we keep pace with the old technology without research and invention, then we will be out of the changing times of this world.
Therefore, the government has taken several steps to attract new generation to science, to develop technology, to develop research and innovation.
So I say Let us aim to innovate. Come on, let's do our research.
And when I call Let us aim to Innovate, AIMM means Atal I.
If we want to make the next generation of efforts, then our children will have to be associated with this work.
And that is why the Government of India is trying to create Atal Tinkering Labs.
If we have a strong and superior laboratory, then an infrastructure is created for invention, for innovation and for working with it, for achieving a certain goal.
There is a need to develop new labs as well as to improve the quality of the old labs.
We need to find technological solutions to these problems in our daily lives.
We have urged the youth of today to take up the Atal Grand Challenges if we look at the problems faced by you people and find the technology to solve them, do research and develop them.
The Government of India is encouraging innovators to come up with such technologies to solve our problems.
I'm glad people have a lot of interest in it.
When we talk of Tinkering Labs, more than 13,000 schools had applied and when we talked about Incubation Centres, more than 4,000 teachers and other institutions had applied.
The State Government and the Central Government are working shoulder to shoulder with each other to help the flood victims.
Even though there are some problems due to the rains, the minds of people are bewildered every year because the entire economic picture of our country is centred on rainfall and farming.
Sometimes there is a disease that makes our lives sad.
However, if we are conscious, alert and vigilant, then it is easy to save our lives.
Try to keep an eye on cleanliness, be careful, try to be safe.
Pay special attention to the children and there is no misconception that dengue is only in poor conditions, but it is not right.
Happy, prosperous areas are the first ones to have dengue.
You must have seen the efforts made by Doordarshan, but sometimes we are indifferent to using it.
My dear countrymen, I would like to draw your attention to the same.
Life is so lifeless, so full of running, so there is no need to worry about oneself.
I got sick and I think I'll get well soon, so I can do any antibiotics.
But my dear countrymen, in such a situation, the habit of eating anti-biotics can be a serious problem.
Maybe you got some relief for a while, but we should stop eating anti-biotics suggested by doctors.
The microbes which cause TB and Malaria are rapidly transforming themselves so that the medicines become functional.
In medical terms, it is called anti-biotic resistance.
Anti-biotics should be used in compliance with the rules.
You must pay attention to it.
When it comes to health, I want to connect with one more thing.
Sometimes we think of the lives of pregnant mothers in our country.
In our country, about three crore women are pregnant every year, but some mothers die during childbirth, some die or some be it the mother or the child, or the mother or the child.
It is true that in the last decade or so, the maternal mortality rate has come down but it is still not possible to save the lives of many pregnant mothers.
No one knows when an unknown crisis like blood loss during pregnancy, infection during childbirth, high blood pressure, famine, etc., will destroy his life.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has started a new campaign in the last few months - 'Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan'.
As per this campaign, on 9th of every month, all pregnant women can be tested at Government Health Centres without any cost.
It will save the lives of both the mothers and the children, and I would like to especially tell the women that one day of the month, cant you take care of the poor mothers and the mothers without treatment
Can't my doctor brothers and sisters devote 12 days a year to this work of the poor
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is concerned about climate change, global warming and the environment.
During the battle of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna had also told the plants that how important it is to think about the trees in the field of war, we can definitely guess that.
In the Gita, Lord Shri Krishna has said- ' i.e. I am immortal among all trees.
There is no plant that has no medicinal properties.
The tree that donates it transcends the tree like the tree.
Therefore, the parents should take care of their own welfare, plant a good tree and take care of them as children.
Be it our scriptures - Geethah, Sukracharya Niti, or Mahabharat's discipline - there are some people of today's generation who have shown this philosophy in their work.
A few days ago, I am reminded of the example of a daughter of Pune, who has touched my heart.
In the discipline of the Mahabharata, it has been said that trees follow the responsibilities of children as well as gold belongs to their mother and father and also to fulfil the needs of society.
The farmers of Narayanpur village of Jannar Taluk, Pune, Maharashtra, Maruti Mahatraye, married his grandfather, Gold, in an exemplary manner.
Other temples can also start plantation of trees in this year instead of prasadam.
At present, in order to build houses in India, we have to import timber worth crores of rupees for making furniture from abroad.
If we plant such plants on the edge of our farms that will be used for manufacturing furniture and houses, then after 15-20 years you can sell them with government permission.
This can be a new source of your income, and it can save India from imports of wood.
During the last few days, many states have carried out various activities to facilitate this rainy season. The government of India has recently passed the CAMPA Act. Under this law, more than 40 thousand crore rupees are being given to the states for tree plantation.
Rajasthan has celebrated such a massive forest festival of deserts and has pledged to plant 25 lakh saplings.
It is not a small thing to plant 25 lakh saplings in Rajasthan.
Those who are familiar with the soil of Rajasthan will be able to understand how difficult it is.
Andhra Pradesh is also planning to increase green cover to 50 by 2029.
Under the Green India Mission launched by the Government of India, the Railways have become greener.
Gujarat also has a vibrant tradition of Forest Festivals.
This year, Gujarat has celebrated many schemes like 'Amban', 'Ektaan', 'Shahid Van' and started a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I can't mention all the states, but everyone is praiseworthy.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa.
This is my first journey, and whenever I go abroad, it comes to diplomacy, trade and commerce, it is a discussion of security, it is a sign of silence, it is all about this thing.
But for me, South Africa was a pilgrimage.
Whenever it comes to South Africa, it is quite natural to recall Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever we hear the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness on this planet, their faces emerge in front of our eyes.
I visited the Phoenix Settlement during my visit to South Africa, known as Sarvodaya, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi.
The train on which Mahatma Gandhi had travelled, which was the seed of Janak Mohandas being converted into Mahatma Gandhi, was fortunate to travel on that train from the Petersberg station. But I would like to talk to those great people who had sacrificed their lives for the equal rights and equality of all.
Even after doing so much penance, there was no need to take anything on their face or to get anything.
I could see them as if they had met the duties mentioned in Geetha.
The interview will be remembered for my days.
There can be no greater mantra of equality and equal opportunity for any society or for any government.
This is the way forward for a better future for us.
We want a beautiful life, we want a good future for children - everyone needs a different kind of things.
Priority can be different, but the path is one, and the path is development, equality, equal opportunity, equal opportunity for all and everyone feels equal.
Let us feel proud of those Indians who have lived our lives in South Africa as well.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to the artist Burma, he has told me about an incident.
Prime Minister, I am calling from Bangalore the artist Burma.
Just a few days ago, I read in a newspaper article that a lady was cheated by deceit and committed suicide by losing 1.1 million rupees.
As a woman, I have a lot of condolences for her family.
I want to know what you are thinking about these deceitful and fake emails.
Some people get caught in the trap of money.
Through technology, it is a new way of scholarship that is spreading all over the world.
Technology has played a major role in the economic development of the country and its exploits are also falling on the field.
You people make mistakes at some point of time because they write your letters in such a beautiful way that it seems like they are real.
Some fake letter pads are made and sent to know the number of your credit cards, debit cards and your bank's account is empty with the help of technology.
This is a new kind of fraud, digital fraud.
There is a need to stay away from such delusions, stay alert and share such false messages with friends and friends and also warn them.
Our MPs should also take people from their respective areas, meet me, talk to me, they should also discuss their problems.
But recently I had a good experience.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
You've painted a wonderful picture at the station.
Not only this, the plastic bottles or oil cans in the village have been collected and planted by planting trees and making Vertical Gardens.
In this way, they have given the railway station a completely new form.
You must have seen the station in Aligarh.
There's a new look.
This is an example of how peoples participation can bring about change.
Thanks to those who have been working in the country, especially my colleagues in Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, as soon as the rains are over, the festive season begins in our country.
The fair will be held at various places in the coming days.
Festivals will be held at temples, places of worship, and you will also celebrate festivals at home and abroad.
Raksha Bandhan is an important occasion for us.
Cant you give Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of the country on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan last year, just like last year
My dear countrymen, there are many of us who were born after independence.
I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in an independent India.
On 8th August, when the uit India Movement started, this year it will mark 75 years and on 15th August it will mark 70 years of independence.
We rejoice in our freedom and the pride of being a free citizen this is the occasion to remember all those who brought this freedom.
The 75 years of uit India Movement and 70 years of independence can give us a new inspiration, a new enthusiasm and a new resolve to do something good for the country.
I hope that you too will do something or the other good work with the inspiration of patriotism.
And today, technology has become so affordable that you can easily deliver anything to me.I invite you - come, let us remember the virtues of our freedom fighters.
During the holidays, every person makes plans.
And this is our season during holidays, so I think we're enjoying our food.
Once again, it seems good if you have a chance to sleep in the afternoon.
But this time, the terrible heat has ruined all the fun.
It is natural for the countrymen to think.
The water storage available in these reservoirs is also reducing due to continuous drought.
Therefore, people are very sensitive to water and there is a need to do something about water conservation.
A few days ago, someone was telling me that in the village of Hebrade Bazar village of Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, the villagers under it emphasized the need for water in the villages.
We have decided to stop the cultivation of those crops where there is a need for water like sugarcane, banana, etc.
The simpler it sounds, the easier it is to do.
Everyone together made a big resolve!
If a factory uses water and we want to shut down the factory, because if the use of water is more then you know the result.
It is true that I talked about the market in a small village of Hebrew, but there are several such villages.
I congratulate all these villagers for this kind of good work.
The people told me that the Gorba Gram Panchayats of Devas district of Madhya Pradesh had tried their best to build farm ponds.
They built nearly 27 agricultural ponds.
This has led to an increase in groundwater levels and increased water levels.
I would like to say that they are better off than the railways.
It is the nature of human beings that no matter how many times they spend, no matter how much time they spend, no matter what kind of good news comes, it seems that the danger is removed.
From 106 per cent, the possibility of 110 per cent rain fall has been evident, only then it seemed as if a message of peace came from us.
There is still a delay in the rains, but the news of good rainfall has created a new vibrancy.
The soil needs of the farmers and the fields are used for crops.
Can't we take the soil out of the village pool and place it in the field?
It will keep the fields well and its water storage capacity will increase.
Sometimes, in cement bags, in the empty sacks of fertilizer, can we save water by placing stones and mud on the way to water?
Water levels will rise, water will come to our wells.
So we need to save as much water as possible.
If we do something for this purpose, it will be possible only through collective efforts.
So today the water crisis is fine, drought is going on, but next month we have time of 1.50.
Shriman Kumar Krishna has asked the question in MyGov: Will our Ganga cleaning campaign be possible in our lifetime
How many governments have come, how many projects have been developed, and how much has been spent
And that is why it is natural for crores of people of the country like Bhai Kumar Krishna to raise these questions.
The Ganga provides us with the Ruji-Roti and the Ganga gives us the strength to live anew.
Just as the Ganga flows, it also gives a new dimension to the economy of the country.
A Bhagirath brought us to the Ganges, but to save it, crores of devotees were required.
This will never be possible without the collective help of the people.
We have to be a change agent for its cleanliness and cleanliness.
Several projects are underway by the government.
Efforts are being made to take full cooperation of all the states on the banks of Ganga.
Efforts are being made to connect the social and voluntary organizations with each other.
Several steps have been taken to curb pollution through pollution and pollution.
Every day there is a lot of water in the Ganges through drains and drains.
The trash skimmers in Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna and other places to clean the garbage with water.
All local bodies have been informed and requested to keep up the work and do regular cleaning of the garbage.
Earlier I was told that wherever efforts are being made, it is possible to clean 3 to 11 tons of garbage every day.
So it's true that we are able to clean a large amount of garbage.
In the coming days, there are plans to install trash skimmers in some more places.
And as a result of this, people along the banks of Ganga and Yamuna will soon be able to understand that an effective plan has been prepared to control the pollution of the public and paper, distillery and the sugar industry.
The discharge of waste from the factory of Pulp and Paper Industry Bablak liquer is almost complete.
All these facts are proving that we are moving towards the right direction and awareness is also increasing.
People are also providing financial assistance for the cleanliness of the Ganga, which has led to this work being done very well.
My dear countrymen, today, 24th April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
It was on this day that Panchayati Raj system was started in our country.
And today the Panchayati Raj system across the country is working successfully as an important unit of our democracy.
On 24th April, we celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and today on 24th April, we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
This is a beautiful conclusion that is the most important part of our Constitution.
He was inspired to do this important work of connecting the village with the Constitution.
In this direction, the campaign started from 14th April to 24th April, 2020 on the occasion of the 10th day of the birth anniversary of Babaji Gramoday i.e.
It is my privilege that on 14th April, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, I had the opportunity to pay my obeisance at that holy place.
Today, on the 24th of this month, in Jharkhand, where more tribal brothers and sisters are present, today I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Diwas.
At 3 PM, I will talk to all the Panchayats of the country once again.
This campaign has been done with great awareness.
At the same time, so many villages in India have been running for 10 days.
I congratulate all the State Governments, the village heads.
You have used this opportunity to strengthen democracy, for the progress and prosperity of the villages in a very fundamental and new way.
And that is why the emphasis that we will give on village Uday will be as good as possible.
Shemila from Mumbai called Dharakura and spoke of her thoughts.
- Namaste
I'm from Mumbai to Shirmila Dharkurde.
You have a question about the education of my school and college.
For example, there has been a need to amend the education sector over the years.
Today, if every family has only one dream for their parents then it is the education of their children.
They're gonna come back to the house.
This idea, this idea, this idea of educating a child in a country like India, is a great strength.
I would like to raise this feeling of good education to the child and to bring more awareness about it.
For this, I would like to urge all the parents to discuss about the school program with the children in a very short time.
And if there is any issue then go to school and discuss with the teachers.
This monitoring will help us minimize the shortcomings in our education sector.
And this will definitely be possible in everyone's participation.
Every government of our country has emphasized upon education and they have tried their best.
And it is also true that for a long time our focus was on setting up of educational institutions, expanding the education system, creating schools and colleges, appointing teachers and many children in school.
We have done a great job in the field of education.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Good education through literacy campaign should be our main goal.
It was necessary to calculate the size of the infrastructure.
Now the success of education needs to be audited.
Till now, the focus was on how many students have come to school.
The mantra of Admission, Admission, Admission, Admission, Admission, Admission, Admission, etc.
But now we have to focus on providing good and quality education to the children who come to school.
You have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to focus on Su-Learning.
It's right, there's still a lot to go.
But if we take the decisions of 1.25 billion Indians, then we can cross this path.
However, it is true that Sharma ji wants to bring about irreversible changes in our own thinking.
You must have noticed that some works have been done outside the traditional thinking in the Budget.
Out of the budget, 10 government universities and 10 private universities have been asked to free themselves from government bondage and ask them to know what challenges they face to become the best universities.
Indian universities can compete with other universities in the world and such competitions should also be held.
At the same time, education is important as skills are important.
This is the reason why technology will play a big role in the field of education.
Tele-education technology will make our education easier.
And I believe we can understand the results in the near future.
Honble Prime Minister, Namaste
I'm Meena Karnawal from Bijnor.
Today, the youth have an important role to play in sports as well as education.
They need a team spirit and good leadership qualities to ensure their holistic development.
I want you to motivate more and more youngsters and I want the government to encourage more and more NCC, NSS and Bharat Scouts and Guides.
You have sent so many suggestions to me that before talking to you, I will also be willing to talk to NCC, NSS, Bharat Scouts and Guides and other organizations.
On repeated requests and suggestions, I had a meeting in which the heads of NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guides, Red Cross and Nehru Yuva Kendras were present.
When I asked them when they had joined hands before, they told me that for the first time since independence they had organized such meetings.
This time, I've shown them some of these things.
I told them, why don't our young friends take part in water conservation in this summer?
I had a similar conversation with them.
I see it as a stir between us.
You must have seen that the political situation in our country has reached such a stage where there has been a lot of discussion about the last few elections - which party will give gas cylinders
On the other hand, economists had suggested a reduction in the gas subsidy.
Some of the Committees have also proposed to reduce the gas subsidy.
It's everyone's experience.
I had said this thing but today I want to say this thing that I am proud of my countrymen.
One crore families have voluntarily given up their gas subsidy.
And this one crore families are not rich.
I have seen that some of the people who have left the subsidy include retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers - middle class or lower middle class families.
However, it has been observed that more than 80 of the 1 crore families who had given up their gas subsidy have given up their gas subsidy by going to the distributors.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small issue.
If the government gives a small discount in tax, it will be a week-long TV and newspaper news.
In our country, Subsidy is considered a kind of right.
But one crore families have given up their subsidy.
First of all, I salute and congratulate those one crore families because they have made political leaders to think in a new way.
The global economists, who do this, present such financial equations, are also beyond their concerns.
Sometimes I feel that we announce that there will be no ticket examiner on this route.
We can carry out many such tests.
He said that trusting the people of the country can yield better results.
Anyway, that's your opinion.
It can't be a government rule, but we can create an environment like that.
And this atmosphere is not being created by any political leader but it is being created by millions and millions of families of the country.
All breaking news is bad news.
Is there nothing better with us in this country of 1.25 billion people
Please change this situation.
He used to say this again and again.
A few days ago, on the basis of a newspaper, I have written to you that they will not print any news on Monday.
And everyone wants the common man to get the right and good news.
It is true that even if a well-known person speaks good words, speaks good words, and presents them well, the impact of which is more effective than any good news.
Good news inspires us to do good work.
It's right, if you focus on good, it'll reduce the bad places from you.
If I light the lamp, the darkness will be gone, it will be!
You might be aware of the fact that a website has been created on behalf of the government - 'Transforming India' website.
This is not just the government but the people of the country can also send you some good news on this portal.
You can also join it.
Ravi ji, you gave me good advice but please don't be angry with me.
Together, we will try to do constructive things, try constructive things, try to achieve constructive goals.
The specialty of our country is the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela can be a tourist attraction.
Very few people in the world are aware that for such a long time, crores of people have come to the banks of the river.
The fair is held in a calm and peaceful environment.
These events, in an institutionalized manner, have set a paradigm shift from the point of view of events management to the vision of peoples participation.
For the past few days, I have seen that some people are uploading the photo of Simhastha Kumbh.
I would like the Tourism Departments of the Government of India and the State Governments to organize a competition on these films.
And tell the people to upload a good photo.
He was saying that we have given special emphasis on cleanliness and cleanliness should not only be confined to this campus but they also want people to take the message of cleanliness from Kumbh Mela.
I believe that this Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual festival, but we can also make it a social blending point.
We can also develop it as a cultural area.
There can be an opportunity to take honest resolution, honest practice to the village.
My dear countrymen, on this occasion of Panchayati Raj, I once again meet you and thank you all very much.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
I have always been waiting for Mann Ki Baat on my behalf and on your behalf.
This time too, I have seen that a lot of letters, comments phone calls have been received, a lot of stories have been received, suggestions have been received and inspiration has been received.
I think you're taking my exam.
In spite of this, I would like to share your thoughts with you once again in the series of Mann Ki Baat.
You must remember that last time I had discussed a book on the story of Premchand ji and we had decided that if someone reads a book then he will share some of it with everyone through the NarendraModiApp.
I've seen a large number of people sharing information about different types of books.
I am glad that people have discussed a wide range of subjects such as science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade and self-employment.
Some people have suggested to me that I should talk about some more books.
But one thing I have to admit is that I don't have much time to read.
But I feel that we should take this experience forward in the last one month.
I want this book to become an active forum for the readers, writers and writers.
Friends, I feel that earlier I had touched upon the issue of 'Water Conservation' in Mann Ki Baat, but today I feel that the issue of water conservation was like touching your hearts before I told you.
I can feel that recently this issue of water has stirred the minds of our countrymen.
Several active efforts are being made throughout the country for the conservation of water.
People are sharing information on various traditional practices.
Media has also started an innovative campaign for conservation of media.
This not only prevents the loss of land and crop, but also provides water to the fields.
You will be happy to know that the beautiful state of Northeast Meghalaya is the first state in the country to have its own water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
There are so many fairs on these occasions.
We can use these fairs for water conservation.
People from all sections of society come to this fair.
We can also organize exhibitions, plays and deliver the message of water conservation in a wonderful manner along with festivals.
That's why I want to tell you some children today.
These are Nidhi Baiptu, Manish Joshi, Devashini Rawat, Tanus Jain, Harsh Devodharkar, Anant Tevari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aranyatesh Ganguly and Haritik Ala-Manda.
Whatever I will say about them, you will also be proud of it, and there will be a ray of hope among you.
We all know that cancer is a word that the whole world is afraid of.
It seems death is standing in Dorgoda.
However, these 10 children have not only defeated the deadly disease like cancer in their lives but have also brought glory to the whole world in their achievements.
In sports, we often see that a player becomes a champion after winning a tournament or getting a medal, but this is a rare experience where he has become a champion before taking part in the competition and is a life champion.
World Children's Winners Games were held in Moscow this month.
The event also saw participation from various sports disciplines such as shooting, chess, swimming, running, football and table tennis.
This country's 10-time champion has won the medal in this tournament.
Some of them have again won several medals in the games.
My dear countrymen, I believe that all of you must be proud of Chandrayaan 2, the achievement of India's space far and wide.
Sanjeev Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.K. from Telangana.
Many others like Arvind Rao have written on this subject in the Narendra Modi App and MyGov across the country and have expressed interest in discussions on Chandrayaan 2.
In fact, 2019 is a very good year for India from the point of view of space research.
Our scientists launched the A-Sat in March and then Chandrayaan-2.
In the absence of elections, such big and important news like A-Sat could not be discussed at that time.
In just 3 minutes, the A-Sat missile was able to hit a 300-kilometer long satellite.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this feat.
Recently, on 22nd July, the entire country witnessed how Chandrayaan-2 is moving from Sriharikota towards space.
The successful launch of Chandrayaan-2 has brought glory, strength and happiness to the nation.
Chandrayaan-2 is a special mission.
We should believe in our own talent and power.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is an Indian initiative.
This is a life-saving Indian.
This is a completely indigenous mission.
The way our scientists have launched Chandrayaan 2 in a record time, day and night to solve all the technological problems.
Even in our lives, we face such temporary setbacks or temporary setbacks.
But always keep in mind that we have the ability to overcome this obstacle.
I am confident that this Chandrayaan 2 mission will inspire the youth of the country towards science and innovation.
It is the ultimate truth that science is the path to development.
We are now waiting for the month of September when two landers - Vikram and Rover - will land on the Moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to inform my student friends, my young friends about an interesting competition, a competition and I want to invite the youth of the country in a quiz competition.
uestion to space and space, India's space mission, science and technology are the main topics in this question - how to do something like launching a polar rocket, sending a satellite in orbit, or knowing what to do with this satellite or with this satellite, A-Satkia.
I request my young friends to participate in this quiz competition and make it more memorable and memorable.
This will be a historic event in the lives of those winners, but for that you will have to take part in this uiz competition, you will have to get the highest marks.
My dear countrymen, you must keep in mind that our Mann Ki Baat has given momentum to the Swachhata Abhiyan from time to time.
All the efforts being made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago has set a new benchmark for cleanliness with the cooperation of all.
It is true that we have not yet achieved such an ideal condition in terms of cleanliness. But the way the campaign against open defecation has achieved the success of cleanliness in public places, it is the result of the willpower of 130 crore Indians.
But that's not what we're gonna stop.
This movement is now moving from cleanliness to beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching a news from Shri Yogesh Saini and his team on the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who left the American job and returned to the country to serve Mother India.
He took the lead in making Delhi a Swachh and a Sundar not only.
He started the beautification work of Lodhi Garden with his team.
Through street art, many places in Delhi are decorated with beautiful paintings.
When he made the huts from the walls of the overhead bridge and the school, many people started moving forward and the work started moving forward.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh Mela.
I came to know that Yogesh Saini and his team played a big role in this thing as well.
There may not be any words in the colour and shade, but the rainbow that emanates from these pictures is more meaningful than thousands of words.
We have seen this beauty even in the Swachhata Abhiyan.
It is essential that an attempt is made to convert waste to wealth into wealth in our lives.
That is, we have to move forward to make gold from garbage.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a fascinating comment on the MyGov portal.
This was the statement of the resident of Shopian district of Jammu Kashmir, brother Mohammad Aslam.
He wrote - I like to listen to Mann Ki Baat.
I am very happy to inform that in my state of Jammu and Kashmir, I play an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme Back to Village.
The event was held in June 2019.
I think this event should be organized every three months.
Also, online monitoring of the event should be conducted.
I think this is the first time that people could directly talk to the government.
After reading the message that Bhai Muhammad Aslam ji had sent me, I got the interest of knowing about the Back to Village project in detail and I read it in detail and then I felt that it should be known to the entire country.
This scheme is a testimony to the fact that the people of Kashmir are willing to join the mainstream of development.
They also came to know that the people of the villages are now getting government services.
How can their income be increased?
In order to make the program more attractive, some more things were included in it.
Under the 'Khelo India' scheme, children's sports competitions were organized.
During the event, Sports equipment, Power Cards for MNREGA, Certificates for Scheduled Tribes and Tribals were distributed.
Economic Literacy Camp was set up and stalls were put up by Government Departments such as Agriculture, Horticulture etc.
In this way, this event became a festival of development.
It was the festival of Jan Bhagidaari, the festival of Jan Awakening.
The people of Kashmir had embraced this event with open arms.
Any officer was so impressed by the warm welcome extended by the villagers that he had stayed in the village for more than two days.
It is a matter of great happiness that in these areas, participation of people in rural enterprises and participation in the development of their own schemes is a matter of great happiness.
This is a wonderful result of a new spirit and a new resolve.
Such programs and peoples participation in it proves that our brothers and sisters in Kashmir are interested in good governance and this is the strength of progress that has always proved to be more than the strength of a bomb.
Those people who want to spread hatred on the path of development and stop the progress, they will never succeed in their hate speech.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya described Ram Chandra Bandra as a poem in which he was honored with the Gyanpeeth Award and said, In Hodigi, Agadhedna, Arag Bhoomi Magna, i.e.
In this season, whenever we look around us, it seems as if the scented people have spread the green sheet.
The festival of love of brothers and sisters is also celebrated on this occasion.
When we talk of Shravan month, you will be happy to know that in the last four years more pilgrims have taken part in the Amarnath Yatra this time.
From 1st July till now more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than 60 days of pilgrimage in 2015, more than the number of pilgrims who took part in the Yatra this time in just 28 days.
I would like to especially praise the people of Jammu Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who have returned to the state have brought with them the warmth of hospitality.
All these will help in promoting tourism in the future.
I am told that more than 8 lakh pilgrims have visited Kedarnath Dham within a month and a half from the day the Char Dham Yatra started in Uttarakhand this year.
In 2013, after the massive natural disaster, for the first time such a record number of pilgrims reached there.
I appeal to all of you that you must visit those regions of the country where the beauty and the rainy season is spectacular.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of the people of our country, it seems that there can be no greater teacher than this.
I convey my best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and live month of Shravan, may there be a new energy, new hope and new enthusiasm among all of you.
On the other hand, it is at a time when heavy rains are spreading across the country.
When we watch TV, on one side there are floods, waterfalls, traffic jams, etc.
There is another picture of the monsoon in which our farmers, birds are singing, the waterfalls are flowing, you people have to come out with your families to see all these things.
May the rains bring both freshness and happiness together, the Prime Minister said, adding that may the monsoons bring happiness, prosperity and happiness to all of you.
My dear countrymen, where to begin Mann Ki Baat and where to stay, it seems to be a very difficult task, but at the last moment it is a limit.
I'll be back after a month.
I wish you all the very best in Easter.
My young friends, all of you are busy with the exam.
Some people might have finished the exam.
There are some people who are running pontaneous tests, while T-20 World Cup.
Even today, you people are waiting for a match between India and Australia.
Today, India will play with Australia and I convey my best wishes to both the players.
But unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been consistently getting a lower position - losing - returning - leaving behind - leaving behind.
Now, we cant afford to talk to anyone that our space has come down so much in matches.
Throughout the year, we can create a football-foot environment.
Our youth, our school children, in every corner of the country, are sweating in schools and colleges.
There are very few people who go abroad and most of the people go to their respective states for 5-7 days.
Some people go out of the kingdom.
The last time I had told you to upload your photos from wherever you go.
We have to take this task forward.
Now you do the same thing, but now write something with him - not just a photo.
And it is said - A trailer without observation is a bird without wing.
If you're interested in seeing good things, you're gonna have to look.
And I'm lucky I got a lot of opportunity to travel.
When I was not the Chief Minister, I was not the Prime Minister, and I was a very young person like you.
Probably there is no such district in India where I have not had the opportunity to visit.
Tourism has a big role to play in making life easier.
And now the youth of India is going to tourism with courage and is going to solve the curiosity.
I think it's a good example.
Our young generation should be brave, wherever there is no one, they should try to reach there.
I would like to especially thank Coal India.
Then I'll stay away.
When we look at the pictures of the people there, we feel what is the use of going there.
And that's why people go away from the mine because their hands are black in coal.
But that coal mining will become a tourist destination
And I am glad that so far more than 10,000 people have visited the eco-friendly mineral tourism site in the village of Sawan in Nagpur.
This place gives an opportunity to see new things on its own.
I hope that if you go out on vacation then you will be able to do some work related to cleanliness.
Maybe it's not very scientific, but it's happening.
Can't you also focus on the cleanliness of the tourist centres as a tourist?
I am confident that our young friends will definitely help us in this endeavour.
Therefore, there is a lot of employment potential in tourism.
India is still far behind in terms of tourism as compared to other countries.
But if we 1.25 billion people of the country feel that we have to strengthen our tourism, then we can attract the world.
We can pull a large part of the world tourism in this manner.
And then it will be possible to provide employment to crores of young people of our country.
Be it the government, the institutions, the society or the citizens, everyone has to work together.
Come on, we do something for that purpose.
My young friends, the holidays just come and go, I don't like it.
You should also think about it.
Will you, too, be allowed to leave your holidays, all these important years of your life, in such a way
You can imagine how many things I am talking about.
Can't you take a pledge to add extra quality to your personality during this holiday
If you don't swim, you can take a pledge to swim.
If you don't know how to ride a bike, learn to ride a bike during the holidays.
During the holidays, do something for the development of your personality, to increase your capacity and skills.
There is a lot of opportunity to work beyond just sectors that I have talked about.
With this, you will be able to see how much your personality and confidence will increase.
I'll talk to friends about it.
The MyGov portal has received some suggestions for this years Mann Ki Baat.
For example, my name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
I am delighted to do this and have become a part of my friendship with many birds.
I request you to repeat the same in Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to this child, Abhi Chaturvedi.
He reminded me of a good job.
Abhi tells me she's been doing this all year and many birds have become her friends.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi loved the birds.
In his poem, he wrote: "I will not let you go away, I will fill up the courtyard, I will fill the pot with sweet cold water.
Come, let us take this message of Mahadevi forward.
I congratulate them, I also express my gratitude you have reminded me of the important things.
From Mysuru, Shilpa Kuk has shown a very sensitive theme for all of us.
He said that there are milkmen, news papers, postmen who come near our house.
Sometimes people with utensils, even those who sell clothes go that way.
Have we ever called them to drink water during the summer, have we given them water
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, You have heard a lot about Digital India.
Some people think that Digital India is the youth world of the city!
If you download the app on your mobile phones, you will be able to get a lot of information about agriculture and weather.
The app also covers a wide range of topics like market conditions, situation of pisciculture, availability of good crop, availability of appropriate medicines, etc.
And if you put any question in front of them, they will answer it and explain it to you.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
This time is very important for the farmers before the start of agriculture.
Can't we dig and clean those old places so that we can save more water?
This time, you must have seen that efforts have been made to build 5 lakh ponds and land ponds.
Under MGNREGS, the focus has been on creation of resources through conservation of water.
Make a plan to start this awareness campaign on how to save water in every village, how to save every drop of rain in every village, how to save water in every village.
You should join various government schemes related to this so that a peoples movement is created for the importance and conservation of water.
There are several villages in the country, there are many progressive farmers, there are many aware citizens who are doing this work.
But we have to move forward.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to tell you one more thing that just a few days ago, the Government of India organized a big Krishi Mela.
As a result, I have seen how modern technology has been developed and how it has changed the way it has been done in agriculture.
But these technologies will now have to reach the farmers' fields.
And now farmers are also saying that there is a need to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers.
I congratulate this kind of person.
Excessive use of chemical fertilizers has made our earth sick.
But if good spices are given a lot, what do you like to eat?
No matter how good it is, over-exploited fertilizer usage will be harmful.
Every item needs to be used as per requirement.
It's cost-effective, money-saving.
I hope that we will be able to complete this task with full focus on all the necessary work related to water conservation.
The more the water lives, the more the farmers will benefit, the more the lives will be saved.
My dear countrymen, April 7th is World Health Day.
The theme for this years World Health Day is Beat Diabetes.
Diabetics is a disease that brings in all other diseases.
Once someone has diabetes, many patients enter their homes.
According to statistics, in 2014, there were about 6.5 crore patients of diabetes in our country.
Diabetics account for 3 deaths.
Diabetics are of two types Type 1 and Type 2.
Type 1 is hereditary, mother and father, there's a chance of having children.
And type 2 is because of bad habits, old age and extra weight.
The entire world is worried about diabetes, and therefore on 7th January, the World Health Day theme is Diabetes.
We all know that the biggest cause of diabetes is our life style.
There's hard work.
There's no smell of sweat.
It's not moving.
We're playing online.
Nothing's going on offline.
If you take interest in yoga, practice yoga.
If you don't, at least run.
If every citizen of our country is healthy, then India will be healthy.
And now all the facilities are easily available to us.
You must think about it.
The World Tuberculosis Day was celebrated on 24th March 2020.
When I was young, I was afraid to hear the name of TB.
But when TB was the cause of death, we were afraid.
But now we don't care about TB.
The number of TB patients in our country is much higher than in the world.
If we have to get rid of TB, we need proper treatment and comprehensive treatment.
Leave it in the middle of treatment, new problems arise.
Tuberculosis is such a disease that everyone in the neighbourhood knows.
It means, it's a disease that needs a quick test.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is going on in this regard.
There are more than 13,500 Microscopic Centres and more than 4 lakh DOTs providers.
Get the right treatment and continue the treatment till the disease is over.
I urge you, be it TB or diabetes, to defeat them.
India should be free from these diseases.
But this will not only be done by the government, doctors and medicines - unless you come forward.
And that is why today I request the people of the country to come forward and defeat diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, in the month of April, a very important day is coming, especially on the 14th of April, the birthday of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated with great fanfare across the country.
A Muh of Panchtirth is his birth place.
She studied in London, she studied at Nagpur.
I am fortunate that I will have the opportunity to visit the birthplace of Pujya Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April this year.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot of things to become a responsible citizen of the country.
Following is the text of Vice Presidents address: I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country on the auspicious occasion of Christmas.
The festival is celebrated in different states, with different names.
Some people call it 'Naab Sabtar' or 'Gudi-Parva' or 'Vasudhavada' or 'Ugadi'.
You know, last time I had said that my Mann Ki Baat programme will be heard on your mobile phones at any time in about 20 languages.
You just have to make a missed call.
It has been a month and I am glad that about 35 lakh people have benefitted from it.
You can also write the number 81908 81908.
I repeat, 81908 81908.
I am glad to be connected with you.
I also want to be a part of this.
The more you think about the examinations of your own children, the more I think.
If we change the way we think and think about exams, perhaps we will be able to stay stress-free.
I have said in my earlier Mann Ki Baat address that you must send me your feelings and suggestions through the Narendra Modi App.
In my Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to talk to parents, students and teachers in a special way.
What I heard, what I read, what I've been told is what I'd like to say.
I know the test will begin in a few days.
How much marks will you get in the exam?
I would like to say that you should set some goals for yourself.
Don't take the pressure of someone else's expectations.
You must work hard, but try to achieve a practical and feasible goal for yourself.
When I used to play cricket, I had many expectations from people.
As time passes, so do people's expectations.
It was very important for me to find a solution.
I had thought that I would hope for myself and set a target for myself.
And if I decide on my own goals and achieve those goals then I will definitely do something or the other for the country.
And I have always tried to achieve this goal.
My aim was always on the horizon and so it was on its own.
And I believe that God will give you good results.
Good luck!
Never fall under the pressure of hope.
You have to make your future.
You decide your goal yourself.
Why would I waste my time competing with others?
Why don't I try to break all the records I've created?
Friends, Don't think of exams as a number game.
Life should always be guided by one great purpose - one should walk with a dream - one should be committed.
Whether we're moving in the right direction or not, this test is for him.
So if there is a gap in meeting the expectations, it will not be disappointed.
Let us work more and more, and work harder.
Thousands of people have written small things on my app through mobile phones.
Shrey Gupta said that a healthy mind lives in a healthy body.
Students, you should pay attention to your studies as well as health, so that you can take the exam smoothly.
However, for 365 days, our daily routine should be compatible with our dreams and resolve.
I agree with Shri Prabhakar Reddy, who specifically said that he should listen at the right time and ask him to rise early in the morning.
The Prime Minister said that one should reach the testing centre along with the admittance card and other papers.
I might not have said this because I'm a little indifferent to sleep.
And when I spoke of my sleep, don't think I'm sleeping for the exam.
Don't get it wrong. I'm talking about sleeping to be stress-free to give a good test during the exam.
You mustn't do that.
I believe you won't do this.
It is necessary to strengthen the foundation of discipline and success in life.
Only discipline is the basis of a strong foundation of life.
The darkness and chaos that takes place in the morning and at noon, seems to have become a thing of concern.
I don't think there's anything small for that.
Do it properly, do it.
Friends, I have seen sometimes that the students are of two types.
One, they concentrate on what they read, what they learned, what's good.
Second, there are other types of students who don't know about the kind of questions that will come, the kind of questions that can be solved or not.
I have seen these two types of candidates whether the papers will be difficult or not.
There is a lot of test matches with the chess game.
When you're playing, you don't know what the boat's got to do, just as you don't know, there's a question in the test.
So if you're calm, eat properly, sleep enough, you'll see that your brain will remember the right answer to the right question at the right moment.
Do not expect too much - look at this as a challenge Just think, can I remember what I have learned throughout the year, can I answer these questions
So, calm down, sleep well at night, don't be too self-reliant, but don't be negative.
I've seen you're better off testing than your fear of testing.
So, be confident and many good wishes for you.
Viswanathan Anand has indeed said a very important thing.
His eyes don't move around.
We have heard that Arjun's life was just a bird's eye.
I saw Vishwanathan Anand, his entire focus in sports, his aim, and his inner peace.
Don't talk to your friends, stay alone, be happy, turn a lot of books over and over, so you can never calm your mind.
So, smile a lot, smile a lot with friends and see that your mind will calm down.
But if the water isn't calm, nothing can be seen.
I feel that: No, if I take a rest, it would be good - that's why I have prepared a system myself.
Deep breathing - keep breathing deep.
I keep breathing three-five times.
Sometimes it takes 30, 40 or 50 seconds, but my mind becomes very calm and I can understand something.
It may be my experience, but it can be of use to you as well.
Since most of the time we see that we start examining what is right and what is wrong
If parents are a teacher at home and are educated then they should write about what they have written in the entire account.
We're trapped in this.
Guys, don't do this.
What's happened at the test time is over.
Talking about something else to the family, the Prime Minister said, "Remember a smile on your mind.
Remember, if you are travelling somewhere with your parents.
Spend at least half an hour, leaving the exam concern.
In the present context, he mentioned the importance of "Ramcharit Manas" to reach out to the world.
Pujya Murari Bapu gave several important suggestions for the students.
And whatever the situation, accept him.
In my experience, we can be mentally satisfied and happy to cope up with the situation.
Without any stress, the exam will be completed in a happy manner.
And even if you succeed, you will not be sad for failure.
We are grateful for the advice given by Pujya Murmu to all of us.
Guys, I want to talk to you one more thing today.
Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, Shri Sushant Kumar, Shri K.
Yes.
But friends, if I say - start yoga from tomorrow morning, then it will be unfair to you.
But those who do yoga, they will not do it today, they will not do it.
If you are doing yoga, then do it.
If you do not practice Yoga before the test, if you do not practice Yoga then you should contact someone who knows about Yoga, who can do some yoga exercises within two to five minutes.
Why do you hurry up for this!
Prepare the schedule of your day in such a way that even if you are trapped in the traffic jams, you can get the check in time.
Otherwise, such a situation creates anxiety.
One more thing, if the guidelines on the question papers are available, then the time will be wasted.
I have seen that sometimes the questions are not properly understood after getting the question papers, but if we read the guidelines properly then we can adapt with it and fix it.
It is very important to understand the questions.
Rao laid stress on patience and gave his advice to all the students in a very short span of time.
That's what I tell my young friends.
At the same time, keep in mind that there are many opportunities in our country.
What you need is the power to be stubborn, self-sacrifice and attachment.
With all these qualities, you will succeed in all your trials and efforts.
This is the power of science and the power of a scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb that he has inspired the children of the country, the words of determination, devotion and penance are dedication, concentration and hard work.
Hold on, guys, hold on.
If you're engaged, you'll be afraid of fear.
A bright future is waiting for you to do better.
My app, Ruchika Dabes shared her experience of testing.
We all know about Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the electric bulb, and have read about him in our syllabus.
But today, the light of that lamp illuminates the lives of people. That is why it is said that success is inherent in failure.
He did not have any formal education or special training in mathematics.
Harry Potter series is popular all over the world today.
But in the beginning it wasn't like that.
How difficult he had to face, how many failures have come to him
Exams are now being conducted not only for students but also for the entire family, schools and teachers.
But the situation of the students is not favourable without the cooperation between the parents and the teachers.
Exams become easier if teachers, parents, and senior students come together to form a team.
Shri Keshav Vaishnav, in my app has written that he has complained that students should not be over-burdened by their parents for getting higher marks.
I just need to encourage you to be ready.
We have to think that they are free from worries.
Vijay Jindal has written, "Don't force your hopes on the children.
Make them dare as much as possible.
Please don't press.
If he's talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Friends, In one of the things I am sure, especially my young friends, is that our present lifestyle has changed a lot from the older generation.
We want to move forward with science at the same pace.
Friends, I am talking about this because today is National Science Day.
Every year, February 8 is celebrated as National Science Day.
On February 8th, 1928, Sir C.
Raman has declared his invention Raman Effect.
He won the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
Therefore, 8th February is celebrated as National Science Day.
Question is the mother of science.
Science-based thinking brings new ideas to science and on the other hand, new ideas are not possible without science and technology.
I am C.
I salute Raman and request all of you to enhance the interest of science.
Friends, sometimes it takes a lot of time to achieve success and when success comes, then the attitude of looking at the world changes.
There might not have been a lot of news in your mind because of your busy schedule for the examinations, but I would like to remind the countrymen that you probably have heard that there has been a very important discovery in the world of science.
Our scientists have identified Gravitational Waves or gravitational waves with their power.
I heartily congratulate all those scientists.
Our scientists will make efforts to carry forward this research in the future.
India will also participate in international efforts.
My dear countrymen, we have taken an important decision in the past.
There are only two such systems in the world.
India third.
I once again thank all the scientists and wish them the very best.
My dear countrymen, this is a number. You will be able to hear my Mann Ki Baat from tomorrow with a missed call on this number.
You will also be able to hear it in your mother tongue.
The number of missed calls is 81908 81908, I repeat, 81908 81908.
Friends, Your test has started.
I'll have to take the exam tomorrow.
1.25 billion Indians will take my exams.
29th February - This is Lip Year.
But yes, you must have seen how healthy I am and how confident I am.
It will be my exam tomorrow and you will start the next day.
If we all succeed, the whole country will succeed.
Thank you so much!
This is my last episode of Mann Ki Baat in 2015.
The next edition of Mann Ki Baat will be held in 2016.
A few days ago, we had raised Christmas, and now we are preparing to welcome the New Year.
India is a diverse country.
There are many festivals here.
Sometimes, India seems to be a country with an economy attached to festivals.
Festivals are the means to generate employment for the poorest of the poor.
I also convey my best wishes to the people of our country for Christmas and my best wishes to the people of our country for the New Year 2016.
May 2016 bring happiness to all of you.
New happiness, new hopes and new resolutions can take you to new heights.
Whether it is terrorism, global warming, natural disasters, man-made disasters, the earth should be free from all odds.
You know, I fully use technology and I can learn a lot from it.
Some people went out on Christmas holidays.
While the focus is on all other facilities in the field of tourism, it has also focused on a particular aspect, where tourists visit and stay, we should also be interested in keeping the tourist places clean.
The more clean our tourist centres will be, the more will India's image shine in the world's arena
I welcome the ideas of Mr.Souleshwarawarkar and convey his message to the people of India.
She did a unique job that was published in the newspaper.
That's why I think I'll get it to you.
Dilip Singh Malaviya, a resident of a small village, decided that if a person in the village collects the necessary equipment for the construction of a toilet, then he will build a toilet without remuneration.
Considering this as a sacred task, he has till now built 100 toilets in Bhojpura village.
I heartily congratulate and convey my best wishes to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes one hears a lot of sad things about our country.
As a result of the collective efforts of all the people, our country is progressing at a rapid pace.
1.25 billion Indians are moving ahead together and are also taking the country forward.
We have done everything possible to ensure better education, new technology and new avenues of livelihood, banking from insurance to insurance, new reforms in the era of international trade and new business infrastructure development.
We have provided easy loans to the people of the common family who could not reach the doorsteps of the bank through the MUDRA Yojana.
When every Indian came to know that the entire world was attracted towards Yoga and when all the countries of the world came together on the occasion of International Day of Yoga then we believed that this is our country, our great India.
When this kind of thinking develops in our minds then a wonderful image emerges in front of our eyes.
Cleanliness is being heard in every house.
People's participation is also increasing.
But I believe that the media will reach these villages and show the people's hopes and aspirations to the entire country.
Therefore, the biggest benefit will be that those government employees who are associated with this scheme will be encouraged to think that they have done something that will bring a big change in the lives of the people of the village.
Is it not necessary to reach out to the farmers, the poor, the youth, the women
No government has worked, no government has worked, no news has to be reached that what they need to reach is that they are not deprived of what they can get.
They must be aware of their rights.
We should strive to reach out to the maximum number of people with the right and the right message to the common man.
It's a sort of service.
I've made a small effort to do this, just like me.
I can't do everything alone, but I should do what I'm saying.
A common man can download the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone and communicate with me.
You too should join this effort in your own way.
I want to reach out to 1.25 billion people of the country.
Come, let us all together promote the well-being and rights of the common man in general and motivate them.
My dear young friends, from the Red Fort on the 15th of August, I am 'Start up I India, Stand up I'
Since then, every department of the government has shown that India can become a start-up capital.
There should be new ideas, new strategies in every aspect, because the world cannot move forward without innovation.
There are talented young friends in every corner of India, they only need opportunities.
I request all the State Governments to take this project forward.
On 16th January, I will meet you and discuss in detail, and wait for your suggestions.
There are crores of people in this country like me who are inspired by the ideals of Swami Vivekananda.
From 1995 to 12 January 2019, the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated as National Youth Festival.
The festival is scheduled to be held from 12th January to 16th January, 2019 at Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
Can you give me some suggestions about this youth festival?
I have a special request to the young friends to send their suggestions directly to you through the Narendra Modi App.
I want to know and understand your feelings.
This will be reflected in the National Youth Festivals and I will give my Government the right advice and information.
So friends, I am waiting for your views on the youth festival through the Narendra Modi App.
In Ahmedabad, the visually impaired teacher of Gujarat, Dilip Chauhan, celebrated Accessible India Day in his school.
We have received very encouraging response from students and motivated them to help the physically challenged people in the society.
I think this effort is an important step.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
You're working on it yourself.
You are well aware of their problems and you too have faced a lot of difficulties.
When there is an opportunity to connect with such people in the society, then there are many ideas in my mind.
According to our thoughts, we express our perspectives on their problems.
Some people are victims of an accident.
Again, some people are born out of physical disability.
A lot of words are used to identify these people and a lot of things are being thought about.
But it always seems, for these people, it is not appropriate to use such words, it is not honorable.
It's true that the word has a special significance.
This year, the Government of India has launched the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
Since I was supposed to be present on that occasion, I had a lot of thought about it.
During this period, I feel that God has given some imperfections or those two organs of which do not work properly, we call them disabled, we know them differently.
But sometimes when I meet them, I understand that there are some imperfections in our eyes, but God has given him some extra power.
They are those people who have one or more organs, which have the divine power, which are not present in the common man like us.
I like this word very much.
My appeal to the people of the country is that instead of the word divyang, can we popularize the word divyang
On that day, we launched the 'Sugam Bharat Abhiyan'.
We will develop both physical and virtual infrastructure to make it accessible to the Divyangjans.
We need a lot of things like school, hospital, government office or bus terminals, ramps, easy parking and elevator facilities, braille script and so on.
In our country gas cylinders are subsidized.
The government has brought some changes in this regard.
Through Jan Dhan accounts, Aadhaar cards, etc., the world's largest Direct Benefit Transfer scheme, Direct Benefit Transfer is directly credited into the bank accounts of the beneficiary.
I am proud to inform the countrymen that this Guinness Book of World Records has been created to successfully launch the largest Direct Benefit Scheme.
This project, known as Pahal, has been successful.
Till the end of November, about 15 crore LPG consumers have benefited through the PAHAL scheme.
Nowadays, employment of rural people is being ensured through MNREGA scheme.
There were several complaints regarding the amount provided under the scheme.
Now, in most of the places, this money is directly reaching the bank accounts of the workers.
There was a lot of trouble for the students with the amount of scholarship and there were many complaints.
This system has also been started for them and it will be taken forward gradually.
About 40 thousand crore rupees have been directly transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries under various schemes.
According to a simple estimate, about 35 to 40 projects have been included in Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, Republic Day is celebrated.
It is a matter of great happiness that this year marks the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the architect of the Constitution.
This is a very good experience as the session of the Parliament was scheduled for two days to discuss the Constitution in a special way.
The Constitution lays equal emphasis on duties as well.
There is a lot of duty while voting, but why should not there be a lot of duty in everyday life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, on 26th January, cant we organize essay, debate and poetry competitions on our primary duties in schools, colleges, villages, cities and social organizations
Before 26th January, you can send me a poem in your mother tongue or in English or in Hindi on the subject of duties.
I want to be aware of your thoughts.
You can send it to mygov portal.
I am very keen to know about the thought process of the duties of our youth.
I want to make a small proposal.
When we celebrate Republic Day on 26th January, cant we take steps to clean and refine the images of the great men and women of our cities established by our citizens and school-college students and to maintain the cleanliness of the surroundings
I am not talking about the government system.
As ordinary citizens, we are equally indifferent to the maintenance of these great souls, as much as we are passionate about establishing the image of these great men.
Cant we make it our normal habit for the society and for the country
On January 26, 2019, let us all work together to clean all these idols that have been honored by great men.
For this, the common man and the citizens have to voluntarily move forward.
My dear countrymen, once again, my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2016.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, Namaste
Business and employment will start with a new zeal.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas have already begun.
Festivals have a distinct significance in social life.
Sometimes festivals work to alleviate grief, sometimes inspire new ones.
But sometimes when there is a crisis in the festive season, it becomes very painful.
There are reports of natural calamities from all parts of the world.
There are reports of all the natural disasters that we have never heard or thought before.
My thoughts are with the families of the deceased and prayers with the injured.
The State Government has put in all its might in rescue and relief operations.
The central government also works shoulder to shoulder with them at all times.
Meanwhile, a rescue team from the Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I believe that despite this crisis, Tamil Nadu will again move forward with renewed vigour and enthusiasm to take the country forward.
The need of the hour is to prevent such incidents from happening all around.
Now his appearance has changed.
Enhancing the quality of our capacity building in every sector has become very important.
The government, the intelligentsia, the people and all the smaller organizations should work in a scientific manner to build the capacity building.
I am happy that this initiative was launched through a table-top exercise and a workshop on the best practices from SAARC countries held in Delhi.
You can very well understand the problem of farmers not only in terms of organic farming but also in terms of organic farming.
It has been our habit and generation after generation to burn the crops.
First of all, there was no idea of the damage that could have been caused by it.
Second, there was no training for what other methods could be.
When the impact of these disasters started falling on the city, the people continued to be against it.
The sorrow that you have expressed is true.
First of all, we have to provide proper training to our farmer brothers and sisters, and understand their reality.
Burning the root of the crops will save time, labour will be saved, the field will be ready for the next crop but that is not right.
Crop root is very valuable.
It's a biological agent.
We're burning food and ruining it.
Not only this, if the roots can be crushed, it can also be animal feed.
To burn this heel, the upper level of agriculture is being burnt.
Our soil is burnt to a great extent, which leads to the death of our fertile soil.
That's why we have to play a useful role.
Mixing the root of these crops in the ground, it will heal.
If this organic manure is applied on that soil, it will be of double benefit.
Once I had the opportunity to talk to the farmers.
They spoke of a very good experience.
Earlier when they used to cultivate bananas, they used to spend 5000 rupees, 10 or 15 thousand rupees per hectare to clean the roots of bananas.
If we didn't find a tractor to clean it, the roots would be like that.
Some farmers then buried these roots in a piece of land measuring 6 or 8 inches.
This is because there is a lot of water in the root of the banana tree and if there is any tree, tree or crop, it does not need to be cut apart for three months.
The water that is in the root of banana leaves the crops.
Earlier the money used to be spent on cleaning the feet, now it is getting generated from the same thing.
Our farmer brothers are no less than a scientist.
Dear Countrymen, The World will celebrate International Day of Persons with Disabilities on 3rd December.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had discussed organ donation.
I also talked about the help of NOTO in organ donation.
National Organ Donation Day was observed on 27th November, 2019.
It was attended by a number of dignitaries from the society including Dr.
Organ Donation can save a lot of precious lives.
It can bring immortality in a way.
When a part of the body is transplanted from one body to the other, it gets a new life and that person also gets a new life.
What else can be a greater donation than this?
A national level competition was organized through MyGov.in portal to create slogan for the logo, Donor Card and its content.
People with physical and mental disabilities have immense courage and capability.
But if we change our outlook, if we change our attitude towards them then these can become the inspiration for our life and work.
We're crying even when it's a small problem.
That is why they are our source of inspiration.
I appreciate the resolve, strength and resolve of their lives, the way they fought against it and the immense effort they made to turn the crisis into a force to reckon with.
I want to talk to Javed Ahmad today.
He was killed in some parts of kidneys, small intestine and stomach in the terrorists.
There was a serious injury in the spine.
His ability to stand on his feet was as close as he was, but Javed Ahmed didn't give up.
The terrorists couldn't cure him.
Despite the hardships faced by innocent people without any reason, even as they were in danger of life and youth, Javed Ahmed fought these difficulties with compassion and without any anger.
This is his biggest mental strength and he has devoted his life to the service of society.
Not always in power, but for the past 20 years, he has been engaged in teaching children.
He has done MA in Social Sciences and as a social activist and a conscious citizen, he has been revolutionizing the lives of the differently-abled as ambassadors.
Can the people of every corner of India not get inspired from the story of Javed?
On 3rd December, I will remember Javed Ahmad's life, penance and his dedication to service of humanity.
From time to time, I only talk about Javed, but I know that in every corner of India, the lamp of inspiration is lit which illuminates life in a new way, guides life in a new way.
3rd December is a day to remember all such inspiring people.
Our country is a big country.
There are many things in which people are dependent on government.
The Central Government and the State Government have a regular relationship with the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the dalits, the oppressed, the exploited and the deprived classes.
There is a network of ASHAs across the country.
They have done a lot of social work in India.
There's a lot of malaria.
One of the ASHA workers of this village had decided that they would not allow anybody in their village to die due to malaria.
Some people in the village had small fever but they had to reach the house immediately.
He started treatment on the basis of first aid.
He emphasized on usage of pesticides in every house.
Just as one needs to take care of one's own child, this ASHA worker Yamuna Monsing has dedicated himself completely to save the entire village from mosquitoes and has prepared all the villages for malaria prevention.
How many such Yamuna movings are there
There are millions of such people around us.
We will try to see them with respect.
They can become the greatest strength of the country.
We have always been a friend of happiness and misery.
I salute all the ASHA workers through Yamuna Moneying.
The first is the Swachh Bharat related events, the second is the Adarsh Gram Parliament and the third is the health related issues.
I request you all to watch these e-books.
Not only yourself, but also the others.
You might be able to read these and get something to do with it.
Then send it to mygov portal.
There are many such incidents that dont come to our notice but it is the strength of the society.
Accurate examples are our greatest strength.
I urge you to come and join the nation-building process.
My dear countrymen, the world is concerned about climate change.
Global warming, climate change are a matter of concern and concern.It is recognized as an indicator before every action is carried out.
The temperature of the world should not rise again it should be our concern and commitment.
The first way to save from temperature rise is energy conservation.
I once said that on the full moon night, the light should be switched off and the electricity should be saved and light bathed in the full moon for hours.
The moon should feel the ray.
I also had the opportunity to see some friend who sent me a link to such a scene.
A woman named Noorjahan from Kanpur, who was not able to see it on TV, did a job that no one could even think about.
He is working towards electrifying the poor, using solar energy from the Sun.
He is fighting darkness and his name is shining.
People take the lanterns in the evening, go back to charge in the morning.
It costs about three to four rupees a day, but there is enough light in the house.
These plants have been recharged through solar power throughout the day.
Look, the world's biggest people are doing a lot for climate change, but it seems as if a Nurjahan has been working to inspire all of them.
Noujah, in any case, means the light of the world.
Similarly, he too is spreading the light.
I would like to congratulate the Prime Minister that he has started a scheme with a Mudra Bank.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) is a Fund of Funds.
However, the speed at which we want to move forward is still going on.
Most of the beneficiaries of this scheme are Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes who have been working on their own and are working on their own to run their families with dignity.
Abhishek himself spoke of his own enthusiasm.
There's a lot of news coming to me.
I've been told that there's someone in Mumbai called Shailesh Bhonsle.
He received a loan of Rs.8.5 lakh from the bank under the Mudra scheme.
And he started cleaning the sewers.
During my Swachhata Abhiyan, I had said that this campaign will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhonsle did it.
And a good business was created for his family.
But I want to promote this scheme more.
May all our banks be sensitive and help small businesses.
In fact, the economy of the country is driven by these people.
People engaged in small tasks are the real strength of the economy of the country.
That's what we want to focus on.
Well done, but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I spoke of 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'.
There are many things that create awareness in our social life.
Home, Awakening, Expenditure - Internal Vigilance Is the Prize - That is, Independence will be the prize for Internal Security.
In order to maintain the unity of the country, this river of internal security has to be maintained.
I would like to give this idea of 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat' as a part of a roadmap.
I've been told there's a lot of suggestions.
I have been told that those who take part in it will be given certificates.
A big prize has also been announced.
I believe your suggestions will be of great help.
My dear brothers and sisters, winter is beginning.
This time it is a great time to wear food and various dresses.
But I'll tell you to exercise.
At least one hour of the family should practice the body together and see what kind of awareness it will increase and what kind of freshness it will need all day.
Have a good habit in a good season.
Jai Hind!
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
This is the 12th edition of Mann Ki Baat, and so it has passed a year.
For the first time on 3rd October last year, I had the opportunity to speak in Mann Ki Baat.
There is immense glory of public power in democracy.
There is a fundamental thought in my life and that is why I have great faith in public power.
What Mann Ki Baat has taught me, what it has taught me, what we have understood, what we have experienced, can tell us that the strength of the people is greater than what we thought.
Our ancestors have said that they are part of God.
I can say from Mann Ki Baat that our ancestors have a great strength and a great truth because I have experienced it.
I sought suggestions from all of you for Mann Ki Baat, but I have been able to see and understand every time about two or four suggestions.
But lakhs of people are actively advising me.
It's a great power.
Similarly Mann Ki Baat has become a medium of expressing ones own thoughts.
I once spoke about selfie with daughter.
And that's why the whole world was astonished.
But the pictures of lakhs of selfie with daughter have arrived from all over the world and the daughters have become proud of it.
And when they took up the selfie with daughter, they not only honored their daughters, but also raised a resolution within themselves.
And when you see these self-helps, everyone feels that they have to give up their indifference towards the daughter-in-law.
People from every corner of India have sent similar pictures to lakhs of people.
The state government or the tourism department of the central government could not even imagine that there are such precious resources in our country.
Let's just be a little bit less than we're gonna buy Khadi.
Today, I can say it with great pleasure that the sale of Khadi has doubled in the last one year.
And it's not for any public advertisement.
It didn't cost crores of rupees.
This was a belief of Jan Shakti, a feeling.
I had requested the financially sound people to release a subsidy on the gas cylinders.
On a TV channel, I saw a widow, a retired teacher, standing in line with the gas cylinder subsidy delivery.
The middle class, lower middle class families of the society, who have been facing difficulties in giving up their subsidy, have also given up their subsidies.
Is that not a silent revolution?
The more the government works by connecting with the people, the better it is for the development of the society.
The people of my country are making every effort to devote their lives for the welfare of the nation with special emphasis on every small thing.
In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I thought of taking a new initiative.
Be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup or Kashmir to Kanyakumari or India, there is no place where the people have not called.
It's one of my own feelings.
People from all ages have called.
I heard some phone calls myself and I liked it.
My whole government will work as per your advice.
They gave a very positive and positive suggestion.
So look at the positive attitude of the people of the country and this is a great asset for the country.
There was probably a serious complaint on one or two percent of the phone.
And one thing that has come to our notice is that there has been a lot of phone calls from persons with disabilities, especially the visually impaired.
One of the reasons is that since they don't have the chance to watch TV, they must listen to the radio.
From this, I understand how important the radio is for the visually impaired.
I have received a new direction from these phones and these phones are very important to make the government more sensitive.
Pawan Acharya has given me a suggestion from Alwar in Rajasthan.
I think everyone should listen to it and people from all over the country should listen to it.
Listen to what he is saying: My name is Pawan Acharya, I live in Alwar in Rajasthan.
Pawan, I believe that this suggestion of yours in the breeze will spread to every corner of India.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the Army.
Protecting the water, land and airways, I have spent time with the soldiers of the Navy, the Army, the Air Force and the Navy.
What was not there - the entire history was made alive.
We can understand the glorious moments of war, the indomitable courage and sacrifice of our army, because there was no videograph at that time.
Whether it is the fight of Haji Pir, the battle in the northern part of the country, the battle of Chamndas or the victory of Haji Pir Pass, whatever you see, you will get a thrilling experience and pride for our soldiers.
The exhibition will continue for a few more days.
I request all of you, who live near Delhi, to visit this exhibition with your family and not with a rush like me.
Look at the power of democracy, a young boy orders the Prime Minister, but he forgot to mention his name in a hurry.
We should make cleanliness a habit and we should take appropriate steps for that.
I also have to hear a lot of things that Modi Ji has said a lot about cleanliness but what is happening at the end
On the other hand, on the one hand, both the Parliament and on the other, the children of the country are talking about cleanliness.
This movement with the help of cleanliness, the atmosphere of hatred for garbage and the awareness about cleanliness will make this government work for making a Swachh Bharat.
Local Self Governments - Panchayat, Nagar Panchayat, Municipal Corporation, Municipal Corporation or State or Central - should work on this.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will move forward in the right direction to realise the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Mahatma Gandhi once said that if I have to choose between the two things - freedom and cleanliness, then first I would like cleanliness, after independence.
For Gandhiji, cleanliness was more important than independence.
Let us all follow the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and take some steps to fulfil his dreams.
He wanted to know about Deendayal ji's birth centenary.
My dear countrymen, life of great men is a source of inspiration for us.
Any day is historically associated with the name of some or the other great person.
In the coming days, we will remember these great men, we will take their lives to every house, we will try to learn something from them.
I would especially like to mention on October 2 that day, on the birth anniversary of Pujya Mahatma Gandhi, I had said last year that you have different fashion clothes, different fabrics, many other products but Khadi products should have a special place.
And that is why in this Diwali we will definitely give a place to our homes, we will wear khadi clothes.
And look, last time the sale of Khadi fabric doubled.
It has benefited the poor.
The work that the government can not spend even lakhs of rupees through advertisements has been done with a small help.
And that is why I once again request you to do this thing.
My dear countrymen, one thing has filled my heart with happiness.
I wish you all the very best.
I went to Kolkata in the month of May and some of the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose had come to meet me.
His brother-in-law, Chandra Bose, made all the arrangements.
I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with the family members of Subhas Babu.
You can imagine how pleasant it is for me.
Perhaps this is the first time that they have come to the Prime Minister's residence.
But its a matter of great happiness for me that I have never had the opportunity to host Prime Minister's residence in October.
Subhash Babus family has more than 50 members who live in different countries.
He sent me a message in his voice and I felt that he was going to be a leader or a leader.
My name is Vargabi Kande.
I request the Prime Minister to sensitize the youth about the electoral rolls, so that the youth of the country can join hands in the coming days, so that the youth of the country can join hands in the future, in the formation and administration of the government.
Thank you. He said, "The names of the voters are listed and the names of the voters are written.
Every voter in a democracy is the destiny of the country and this awareness is gradually increasing.
A few years ago, we have seen that only the Election Commission was conducting the election process but in the last few years it has seen a major change.
Today, our Election Commission is not just an election director, it is a supportive work, it has become voter-friendly, and all their thoughts and ideas are at the centre of every project.
But only the Election Commission will work, it will not work.
I hope that if the youth of the country do not register in their electoral rolls, they will certainly register and vote.
I openly tell you on the day of election: First vote, then drink.
It's a sacred duty, everyone should do it.
I have visited Kashi the next day.
I have met a lot of people, there have been many events, I have met a lot of people, but I want to tell you about two boys.
But at such a young age, his interest in physics research made me wonder.
I think he is doing a lot of studies, he is doing internet surfing, he is aware of new uses of science.
He was speaking about how to get rid of railway accidents, how to use technology, how to reduce the cost of energy, how to experience a robot.
One such person met a small boy named Sonmpetel.
Sonam's nine years old.
I was astonished, the whole Geetha is the voice of the girl, but the most important thing is, when I asked her, she was arguing in English with a shlok, explaining the shlok, she also analyzed in Hindi.
I told her to ask her father, she's been doing this since she was five years old.
I asked him about his studies, did he just read Geetha or do something else?
The gentleman said, "If there's no sign of the evening, and the evening is over, and if the history is read, then the face is in the evening.
They're astonished at the girl, she's the only one in the family.
I'm really impressed.
Sometimes children have a feeling of being a celebrity and there was nothing like that in Sonam.
I think God has given it a special strength.
Sandeep ji, what else will you do with me
Once a month, I have to make a lot of effort to attend this event.
Sometimes our All India Radio friends have to wait for me for half an hour and for 1.5 hours.
The programme Mann Ki Baat has completed one year.
Do you know how well Subhas Babu used the radio?
He started broadcasting his radio from Germany, and through radio he used to tell the people of India about the freedom movement.
He launched the Azad Hind Radio through weekly news bulletins.
It was broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pustu, Urdu and other languages.
I listen to you, I think for you, I consider your suggestions and that is why my thoughts are opened up, which reaches you through AIR.
I say, but it's yours, and that's my satisfaction.
Once again I got the opportunity to be amongst you in Mann Ki Baat.
The people of far-flung South India are celebrating Onam festival and yesterday the entire country celebrated the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Government of India has started several new schemes, including social security for the common man.
I am glad that in such a short span of time, many people have joined this scheme.
I had made a small request that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan our sisters should be given a similar security scheme.
I have received a lot of information, which shows that 11 crore families have been linked to it since the beginning of the plan.
I have also been told that nearly half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
Today, when I am talking to you, a year ago the Jan Dhan Yojana was launched.
A lot of questions were raised whether the work which was not done in 60 years will be done in such a short time
This has helped the youth of the country.
You will be happy to know that in this year, 1.31 lakh Financial Literacy Camp has been opened to bring together the banking sector, the economy and the lower middle class.
This is the belief that even the poor can get money from the bank.
I once again thank all the people associated with it and request the poor brothers and sisters who have opened their accounts to the bank, that you will not let this relationship go apart.
This bank is yours, you will not leave it anymore.
I have brought it to you. Now it is your responsibility to hold it.
We all have to keep our accounts open in the bank.
I have full faith, you will keep it.
A few days ago, the horrific events of Gujarat had stirred the entire country.
And it is natural that if something like this happens in the state of Gandhi Ji and Sardar Patel, then the entire country suffers.
But in a very short span of time, the wise citizens of Gujarat, my brothers and sisters have taken care of the situation.
They have played an active role in containing the situation and leading to peace in Gujarat.
This is the path of peace, unity and brotherhood. We have to stand shoulder to shoulder for the right path and progress.
Prosperity is the solution to all our problems.
Recently, I had the opportunity to meet and listen to the scholars of Sufi sects.
I am telling you the truth, its a great experience to listen to them, I have heard it from a musical experience.
The words of those scholars, the way of talking to them, the way in which there is a peaceful liberal tradition in the Sufi stream, have reached me like a musical instrument.
I like it very much.
Probably giving this true nature of Islam to the world of tobacco is the most important thing now.
I believe that the words of love and generosity of Sufi tradition will reach far and wide, so that the whole of mankind and Islam can benefit.
I also tell others that even though we are different communities, we need to understand the Sufi beliefs.
I am going to have another opportunity in the coming days and I consider myself fortunate to get this invitation.
Buddhist scholars from many countries of the world are coming to India at the entrance of Buddha. They will discuss issues related to mankind around the world.
I am glad that these scholars have invited me there as well.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pt. Nehru visited Bodh Gaya.
It is a moment of joy for me to meet all the scholars of the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to talk to you in particular.
I have already spoken about this in Mann Ki Baat.
You have heard it in the Parliament, in the General Assembly or in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I have been saying this thing every time that the government is open to the debate on the Land Acquisition Act.
I have often said that I agree to take any suggestions for the welfare of the farmers.
But today I want to tell the farmer brothers and sisters that the proposal to amend the Land Acquisition Act has come from the state.
But I have seen that a lot of misconceptions have been spread about this and farmers have been scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Our farmers should never be misconstrued as fear.
I don't want to give anyone a chance to misunderstand or scare the farmers.
For me, every demand of the country is necessary, but the demand of the farmers is of utmost importance.
I've decided, let this term be over.
That is, the position that was there before the formation of my government came back.
But one thing was incomplete.
There were 13 such things which were supposed to be completed in one year and that is why we brought them in the ordinances too, but due to this dispute, the matter was also incomplete.
The welfare of the poor and the farmers in the villages is our guiding mantra.
Therefore, on 15th August, I had said that not only the Department of Agriculture, but also the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be created.
We are trying to change this decision at a fast pace.
My farmer brothers and sisters, There is no reason to panic now.
If anyone tries to frighten you, don't be afraid.
I have one more thing to say.
Two days ago, the 50 years of the 1965 war were over.
As soon as the 1965 war broke out, it was natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is natural to remember the mantra of 'Jai Jawan Jai Kisan'.
It is very natural to recall the sacrifices made by the people who have laid down their lives for the honour and dignity of the tricolor of India.
I salute all those associated with India's victory in 1965 and salute all the brave martyrs.
Such historical events continue to inspire us.
I am glad that India is doing very well in various fields of science.
Our scientists are doing a great job.
I have seen how young scientists are talking with enthusiasm and dreaming new dreams in their eyes.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had said that our students should move further towards science.
After discussing with the scientists, I felt that there are many possibilities and opportunities in this field.
I am glad that in just 15 days, the government has started working on this thing in a short span of time.
The instructions have been issued and very soon it is expected that interviews for small jobs will be done away with.
Recently, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
In order to reduce the mortality, especially mothers and children, 24 countries of the world have come together to share Indias Call to Action Plan.
This is for the first time in any other country outside the United States of America.
It is true that even today about 50,000 mothers and more than half a million children die every year during or after childbirth.
It's very worrisome and scary.
Although there has been a lot of improvement in this regard, India's appreciation at the international level has also started, yet this number is not less.
Just as we have got rid of polio, we have also got rid of maternal and infant mortality due to tetanus.
The entire world recognizes this.
But we still have to protect the mother and the new-born.
Brothers and sisters, There is a lot of news about dengue today.
It's true that dengue is very dangerous, but it's easy to get rid of dengue.
It has a direct connection with the Swachh Bharat that I talk about.
We watch advertisements on dengue and on TV, advertisements are printed on news papers, but we don't mind.
There are provisions to keep small things clean, keep water clean.
Public education has started at an extensive rate but we are not paying attention to it.
Sometimes we feel that we are in a very clean house, a very good system, but I dont think that the water in my house is stored in the house, I invite dengue.
I request everyone not to let death come so easily.
Life is precious.
It's not right that indifference towards the dirty water around will cause death.
Around 514 centers across the country are now available for free testing of dengue.
Testing in time is very important to prevent death.
Your cooperation is of utmost importance in this regard.
Cleanliness has to be given utmost importance.
Now from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali, there will be many festivals across the country.
You will see, following this method of cleanliness will become your habit.
My dear countrymen, today I want to share a happy news.
I often say that it is not an opportunity to sacrifice our lives for the country, but it is an opportunity to live for the country.
Two young people from my country, two brothers from Nashik in Maharashtra - Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan and Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan Ji has a strong desire to serve the tribals of the country.
These two brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
There is a cycle race in America, the race is across America, which is very difficult.
I convey my best wishes to these two brothers, thank and congratulate them.
I am glad that these two brothers have succeeded in the mission of 'Team India Vision for Tribal' i.e.
See, how everyone is making personal efforts to take the country forward.
When I hear these incidents, I feel proud of them.
Sometimes we do injustice to the new generation due to the lack of old ideas.
Old generations of people think that the new generation knows nothing and this thinking has been going on for centuries.
I have met many young people who have laid down their lives on Sunday on Cycles.
Some people say that I celebrate Cycle Day a week.
It is also very useful for my health and environment protection.
And I like to think of the young man I am.
Now many cities of our country are cycling and many people are encouraging riding bicycles.
It is a good effort to protect the environment and improve health.
Today, when two young people of my country have unfurled the national flag in America, I am happy to mention the path that the young minds of India are undergoing.
I would like to especially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
The construction of the memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar at Indu Mill in Mumbai has been stuck for a long time.
With this, we have bought the house of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar in London's 10, King Henry Road.
The Government of Maharashtra will build a memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar there.
This place of London will be an inspiration for the Indians who travel around the world.
I would like to thank both the governments of Maharashtra for honouring Baba Saheb Ambedkar. I am proud of them.
It's a good start this year.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will be helped in the cultivation of kharif crops.
And I'm glad to see a happy news in my mind.
There is a huge shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
We want pulses for the poor, we want some oil for cooking.
I am happy to note that the area under oilseeds has increased by about 50 percent and there has been an increase of about 33 percent in the area of pulses.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
Farmers also have a close relationship with the country's land and the soldiers of our country.
The battle of Kargil was not only confined to the borders of the country but every city of India and every village was associated with this battle.
This war is also fought by those mothers and sisters who were fighting the enemy in Kargil.
Today, India is talking about the world with great vigor due to their sacrifices.
It is my resolve to increase the direct participation of the people in democracy, to take every person to the development of the country. And today, after a year, I am glad that about two crore people have seen the MyGov portal.
Why not keep reservation for persons with disabilities while booking tickets through RCTC website
Now this thing is very small, but never did the government think about it or discussed it.
But this idea of Bhai Akhilesh Bajpai has been seriously considered and today this system has been started for our differently-abled brothers and sisters.
The logo that is being developed today, the tag line is being prepared, the plan is being prepared, the policy is being prepared, the Mygov portal has positive views on all these things.
There is a feeling of a new clean air in the governance system.
I feel a new consciousness.
On 15th August, there are many suggestions on the MyGov portal regarding what I should say.
Cinema Raghabacharya has sent a lot of suggestions from Chennai.
You can send it to Mygov portal, write letters to All India Radio and also write letters to PM's office.
See, this is a good thing in Mani that on 15th August, I received suggestions from the people for my speech.
I believe you must send a good advice.
Just two days ago, I saw an accident in Delhi, the driver of a scooter after an accident took 10 minutes and started fluttering.
He didn't get any help!
And when you look at the statistics, you feel distressed.
There is one accident in our country every minute.
In the event of an accident, one death every 4 minutes for road accident.
And most importantly, one third of all the dead are from 15 to 25 years of age and one death can destroy the entire family.
They should do whatever the administration should do, but I request the parents that all the efforts should be made by the family for the sake of their children - Two Wheeler or Four Wheeler.
Sometimes I see it on the back of the auto rickshaw that says, "Papa, come home soon".
This is the reason why I am saying that the government has taken several new initiatives in this regard - be it education on road safety, or road construction, or administrative arrangements, or emergency treatment for those injured due to the accident, we have brought the Road Transport and Safety Bill.
I consider taking some important steps to implement the National Road Safety Policy and the Road Safety Action Plan in the coming days.
I have also taken up a project that will expand all the highways in the country, including Gurugram, Jaipur and Vadodara, and also in Mumbai, Ranchi, Ranagaon and Mandya.
I am thinking of a cashless treatment for the first 50 hours after an accident - whether the injured person has money or not, who will give money or who will not give it - all these things will help the injured in getting better health care and first aid.
I have arranged for a toll-free number 1033 for reporting accidents all over the country, but this is the next step after an accident.
Sometimes I say that employees are employed.
In the last few days, I have seen some incidents, which I like, and I want to tell you.
Vijay Vishal showed how one can associate one's interest, one's own art, one's own power with one's own work.
In the coming days, we will have to discuss and exchange pictures of Vijay Vishal.
I am reminded of one more thing - the entire team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has started a work in the entire district which has touched my heart and I like their work.
And they have taken the responsibility of ensuring that all the brothers and sisters get a toilet during the festival of Raksha Bandhan and no mother and sister of the entire district should go to the toilet in the open.
I came to know of a news item that I would like to share with you.
There is a small village named Keshla in Rajnandgaon from Chhattisgarh.
The people of these villages have been engaged in the construction of toilets for the past few months.
Now no one in this village has to defecate in the open.
After the completion of toilet construction, the people of the entire village have celebrated a big festival on this occasion.
This is an example of how the values of the society have changed, how the mindset of the people has changed, how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
About the North-East, the Bhavishya Deka from Guwahati has written to me that the work of the people of the North-East is very active.
They keep writing a lot - it's a good thing.
Today, with happiness, I want to say that there is a separate ministry for the North-East.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, a separate Ministry of Development of North-East Region (DoNER) was created.
After the formation of our government, our Donor Department took an important decision that the development of the North-East in Delhi could not be possible.
It was decided that a team of officers from the Government of India would be visiting the North Eastern States of Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal, Tripura, Assam, Sikkim and other parts of the country for seven days.
The effort to move away from Delhi to the East, which I call an Act East Policy, should be taken forward.
My dear countrymen, we are glad to see the success of the Mars Mission and we are proud of it.
Last day, India successfully launched five satellites of the United Kingdom PSLV C28.
These stories come for a moment and go away again.
These are not what we usually remember.
But sometimes it seems that today, when we talk to the younger generation and ask them about what they want to do in the future, there are 100 students who say, I want to be a scientist.
The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India has launched a National Skill Expedition to explore the new talent pool.
Now you have to go to another village even if you charge mobile.
All facilities available in the city should also be available in the villages.
That is why we have started the Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana.
But we have to do more for the poor.
We'll complete it.
I have started it, I will finish it, today I want to talk about a lot of things in this programme.
In a way, the month of August-September is celebrated in our country.
Many festivals are celebrated.
My best wishes to all of you.
Please send your suggestions for the 15th of August.
Your views will be of great use to me.
Thank you so much!
When I said, I didn't think we would get such a remarkable response.
Millions of people posted photos on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
I saw one photo after another how diverse is India - architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, hills, rivers, seas
I think you people have done a great job of not thinking about tourism in India.
And some of the pictures I liked so much that I tweeted on my own.
I think that if we do not post the photo of the Belgaum Caves of Andhra Pradesh then we might not have known the location in our country which is hidden here.
But the view that we saw on 21st June is very strange.I believe that wherever the sun has reached, there was no country in the world where the sun has not been welcomed by yoga exercises.
I can assert that the sun never sets in the world of yoga.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that the way people of the world have honoured and embraced Yoga.
I'm also very happy.
The River Sin and the Eiffel Tower symbolize the pride of the people of France, they chose that place for yoga and also showed the same respect for Yoga.
People have practiced yoga at the Times Square in New York.
When we talk about Sydney, Australia, the opera flies in front of the house.
Australian citizens have performed Yoga at their opera house and have given Yoga as much respect as the opera house.
Whether it is North America or Silicon Valley or the Duomo Cathedral in Milan, Yoga has made us proud.
On 21 June, when the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, was practicing yoga at the United Nations Chief Secretary, I was very happy.
Similarly, the UN Peace Keeping Force has performed very well in the field of Yoga.
Our soldiers have joined the Siachen Glacier in India, where the navy has participated in the yoga program wherever our naval was in the sea.
In Delhi, Yoga has been included in the Guinness World Records.
It seemed as if a new question - a new happiness - a new enthusiasm - a new spirit comes from all over the world.
A few days ago, on Twitter, I had tweeted the photo of a young child of a Vietnamese family who had been practicing Yoga, that photo was so beautiful that he was appreciated all over the world.
Ladies and Gentlemen, kids, villages and cities, developed or developed, have connected themselves to Yoga.
Yoga really unites the entire world.
I do not know how scholars and scholars will look at this event, but I feel one thing that every Indian can take pride in the fact that the whole world is eager to know India.
Everyone's interest in knowing India has increased.
The world wants to know about Indias values, traditions and heritage.
It is the responsibility of all of us to leave this legacy behind.
We can do this if we are proud of our heritage.
There are times when something is known to us that we dont have any interest in it, like our family values, we dont know that our family values are important to the people of the world.
Why dont we introduce our family customs and values to the world
I believe that the world will be astonished - my firm belief will be astonished - there are many such great things that the ancestors had given us and the world had a right over it.
The success of 'International Yoga Day' has brought a new sense of responsibility with happiness and satisfaction.
It is our responsibility to provide good yoga teachers to the world.
I believe that you can create a database about where you will learn yoga, where you will find yoga teachers.
I have seen the events of the past in a different perspective, and we have seen the results of the government's work, the government's work, the work being done, the work being done and the goals being set.
When there was despair all around us, as we heard a year ago, nothing will happen - nothing will happen nothing will happen.
There is a department of government 'Ayushman'.
No one paid any attention to this.
But on the occasion of Yoga Day, this small department, which is located at a corner of the country, has led such a big event in the entire world.
If the target is set, then even the smaller departments can do good work - this is their sample.
Just a few days ago, the world saw how our people saved the people who were in danger from Yemen.
In a few hours, Indians have come to Nepal to help.
If the government becomes active, then all the bank employees will come forward to open Jan Dhan accounts in the bank and within a few days crores of Indians will be connected to the bank.
On the 15th of August, I had requested for the construction of toilets in all the schools in the Red Fort and had said that by the 15th of August this work will be completed.
He said that the work that was not completed in 60 years, should be completed in one year.
That is, the government, the common man, the government employees all want to work for the country.
Last month, I had launched three Jan Suraksha Yojana from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have joined the Jan Suraksha Yojana, though we have to take this scheme forward.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan coming in August.
Cant we, the people of our country, together, create a strong mass movement before this festival and provide the facilities for the safety of the mothers and sisters of our country
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, it can be a great gift from the brother to the sister.
When I come to Mann Ki Baat, a lot of people send me suggestions.
Many people have suggested to me that I should talk about rain.
From Nagpur to Yogesh Dandekar, from Mysore to Harshavardhan Mahasaya, elderly dancer Mahasaya, Divyanshu Gupta Mahashya - everyone has told me to talk about the rain in Mann Ki Baat.
This season gives great pleasure to the mind.
People of any age want to enjoy the first rain water.
You people are also enjoying hot tea in this rainy season with pakora, bhajabhuji and corn.
As the rays of the sun give us energy, so do the rain give us strength.
Dropped water is also very valuable.
As a citizen, as a society, we have to develop the habit of saving every drop of water.
We should make a pledge that the water of the village will remain in the villages and the water of the city.
Rain Water Harvesting is not a new thing it has been going on for centuries.
We have to save every drop of water, be it check dam, watershed development, small ponds, or the small ponds on the fields.
The port was on the sea shore, so it used to collect rain water for the sweet water and keep it in the house.
Even at that time, such efforts were made to save the water of the rains.
We can do the same.
And I would like to give you a suggestion from my direct and successful experience.
It's a complete rural technology.
When you plant a tree, plant an old clay pot near the tree and fill it with water.
We're gonna have to get water once or twice a month.
You will see this tree growing very fast and will be very strong.
I would like to tell the farmers that they should not plant trees near their fields.
And we also know that in the rainy season the disease is spreading more through water.
Bacteria become active to increase the moisture in the weather.
Therefore, cleanliness is very important at this time.
You should drink clean drinking water right now.
It is true that the more we are careful, the more we stay away from the disease.
We want water, we want rain, but we want to save ourselves from the disease.
My dear countrymen, we have recently launched three new projects, especially for the citizens.
There are at least five hundred small towns in our country.
We have to take this effort forward.
And I want to live in this house with electricity, drinking water, toilets and schools for children's education.
When India completes 75 years of its independence in 2022, we want to give every country its house.
I am connected with you through social media.
I get suggestions from all of you and I get good feedback about the work done by the government.
But when this government scheme becomes its own scheme for the people, the society or the villages, then how much strength it has increased.
A very interesting effort has been made by Shri Sunil Jaglan Mahasarai, a panchayat leader from Bibipur village of Haryana in the past.
And this creates an environment that every father thinks of putting selfie with his daughter and posting it on social media.
In Haryana, the number of sand is very low as compared to boys.
There are about 100 such districts in the country which are very worrisome.
Haryana is the worst situation.
And that is why I request you all to join the Selfie with Daughter scheme of your daughters.
To strengthen the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, write a tagline, write a beautiful tagline, it can be in any language. English, Hindi, your mother tongue or in any other language.
The tag line that will be inspiring, I will tweet your selfie with your daughter.
In a way, all of us can make this 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' scheme a mass movement.
Make our country a herb.
I am telling you from my experience that you should take this effort forward.
Make it a part of your life.
And one more thing - 'Incredible India' - wherever you go, you must send a picture of that place.
Our country and the world will come to know about the diversity of our country.
I feel that in the pictures that you are sending, the paintings related to handicrafts have come down significantly.
You can also post the handicrafts of your area to the Incredible India.
Many things are produced in your cities and the poor people also produce many things.
And we have a simple medium to reach there.
This is what my dear countrymen, today.
I will talk to you again in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Some people sometimes feel that in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to announce a big scheme of the government, but not just that.
I'm working day and night.
Through this programme, I would like to talk to you in a lighter vein and I would like to share it with you.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
Just imagine the time in the middle.
When I spoke in Mann Ki Baat, I used to say that words are mine, voices are mine, but the words were yours, yourselves, yourselves, and your valour.
But this Sunday has made me wait a lot.
Well, there's a chance in the end.
In an informal atmosphere, the Mann Ki Baat, or the smallest bit of a mind, can change the life of a society, its continuity can give a new energy and thus keep pace with it by telling the spirit of a New India.
I had the experience of such a spiritual journey with you.
Some people asked me why I had gone to Kedarnath in that busy schedule of voting.
You have the right and I can understand your curiosity.
I think I can tell you about the situation of my time.
But today I feel that if I talk about these things then the nature of Mann Ki Baat will change.
The busyness of the vote, the estimation of defeat and the poling remains when I left.
Most of the people took political considerations.
But this was an opportunity for me to meet you.
You can say that I had gone to meet me.
I dont know when to say anything but I will definitely say this because you have the right over me.
As people wish to know about Kedar, I can feel a positive energy in your efforts and in your speeches.
Sometimes some of your words make my thoughts even sharp.
He also spoke of the challenges faced by people, in front of the country and the society, and the way they are able to solve them.
I have noticed that the letter contains a description of the problem, but it also has this feature that some solutions, some suggestions, some concepts are directly or indirectly presented.
If someone writes about cleanliness, he has expressed his grief over the filth and welcomed this effort towards cleanliness.
When someone talks about the environment then he feels the pain of pollution and he also talks about his own efforts.
He also referred to the steps being taken, and the vision that he has kept in mind, to curb pollution.
That is, how the solution to the problem is possible with the entire society so that I get a glimpse of it through your conversations.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror to the country and society.
This tells us that there is no dearth of inner strength, strength and talent among the countrymen.
It is only necessary to guide, provide opportunities and utilise that strength and talent.
Mann Ki Baat also tells us that the strength and dynamism of the 130 crore countrymen need to be incorporated in the progress of the country.
I would like to say one more thing that during Mann Ki Baat, I have a lot of letters, many phone calls, many messages are received but the number of complaints are very low.Some people have asked for something, some are asking for something for themselves, I dont think that this has happened once in the last five years.
Can you imagine, someone has written a letter to the Prime Minister of the country but is not asking for anything for himself
It is a symbol of the high thoughts of crores of people of the country.
Today my heart is full of happiness.
And that is why in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had announced that after a few months I would come back to you again.
Let us follow the spirit of Mann Ki Baat and keep pace with it.
When there was an emergency in the country, the movement against it was not limited to political circles, political leaders or prisons.
I don't feel hungry when we eat time and night.
In the same way, the importance of democratic rights in everyday life is felt only when that rights are plundered.
And it is not because the Indian Constitution took some steps to increase democracy.
The constitution and the laws are required to ensure smooth functioning of the society.
And that is why the country had dedicated this entire election not for itself but for the protection of democracy.
Recently, the great tradition of democracy, the largest election process has been completed in our country, where the poorest of the poor, had to join this campaign and decide the future of the country.
When something is very close to us, we can't understand its importance;
More than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India.
But if we look at the map of the whole world, I will say that more people than the population of any country in the world have voted in India without a Chinese.
The number of people who voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than twice the total population of America.
The total number of voters in India is more than the total population of Europe.
These are the hallmarks of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha Elections is the largest ever democratic election in history.
You can imagine what a huge arrangement and human resource is required to complete this process.
This election has been possible due to the hard work of lakhs of teachers, officers and staff.
On the one hand, nearly 3 lakh security personnel of paramilitary forces have laid down their duties while 20 lakh police personnel from different states have worked tirelessly to accomplish this great feat of democracy.
As a result of their hard work, this time more votes were cast than in the last election.
In this election process, about 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines and more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines are being arranged.
In order to ensure that no one remains deprived of his voting rights.
Polling stations are set up for only one female voter in a remote location in Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the officers of the Election Commission had to travel for two days to reach that place.
This is the true honor of democracy.
The highest polling station in the world is also in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Also, there is one more information that we can be proud of.
Probably for the first time in history, women too voted with enthusiasm like men.
The number of male and female voters is almost equal in this election.
One more motivational message is that now there are 78 women MPs in the Parliament, which is a record.
I congratulate the Election Commission and everyone involved in the electoral process and salute the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard many times in my face - 'not a book', 'book'.
I wish I could give you a book instead of a flower pot for the reception?
Another story that beats my heart deeply is Idgah.
The story is about a boy's sympathies pure love for his grandmother.
When Hamid, 4-5 years old, took a pinch for his grandmother from the fair, then he really seems to be human-minded.
The last line of this story tells us about the truth in life that taught us: Shishu Hamid played the role of old Hamid played the role of old Hamid aged Amina and girl Amman.
One such very touching story is Pus Ki Rat.
The story shows the shocking picture of the life of a poor farmer.
Even after losing his crop, the farmer is happy because he will not have to sleep in the fields in the winter.
Although these stories are centuries old, yet their relevance still remains the same.
After reading the story, I've got a different feeling.
When we talk about reading books then in some media, I read about the alphabetical library in Kerala.
You will be surprised to know that this library is located in a village in the deep forest of Idukki.
A teacher from a primary school there, P.
V. Chinnathampi did a great job for this library.
There was a time when a bag was packed and pressed on the back and a book was brought here.
Today this library is showing a new direction to the tribal children as well as to everyone.
Gujarat's 'Wangchi Gujarat' campaign is a successful initiative.
Millions and millions of people from all age groups have participated in this campaign of reading books.
In today's digital world, in the time of Google Guru, I will also request you to take some time out and place the books in your daily routine.
You will really be thrilled and will definitely write on NarendraModiApp whatever you read, so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy that the people of my country are thinking about all those things which are not only present but also a big challenge for the future.
I was reading your comments on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I noticed that a lot of people have written about the problem of water.
Belgavir Pavan Gowdai, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about the water related problems.
Water has a great impact in our culture.
It is said about the water at Upa-Suktam in Rigveda that it is said about water: Ao Hishtha Mayo Bhobo, Ujre Dadhatan, yo Baho Shivatmo Rasa in Maha Ranhe, Tasya Bhajyateh, Usthiriv Mata.
Due to lack of water, many parts of the country are being affected every year.
You will be surprised to know that in a year, only 8 of the water received from the rain was stored in our country.
Only 8 percent.
But now is the time to solve this problem.
I believe that like all other challenges, we will find solutions to this crisis with the help of peoples participation and the strength of 130 crore Indians with the capability, cooperation and resolve.
Keeping in mind the importance of water, a new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created in the country.
This will help in early decision making on all water related issues.
A few days ago, I tried to create something different.
I wrote a letter to all the Chief Ministers of the country.
I had written to the chiefs of the villages to save water, save water, save every drop of rain, they should convene a Gram Sabha meeting to take stock of the sanitation work in the villages.
I am glad that they have given a lot of enthusiasm in this regard and on the 22nd of this month, on the 22nd of this month, crores of people have donated their labour sweat.
In the villages, people resolved to save each drop of water.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I want to tell you about a Gram Panchayat.
My name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.When the Prime Minister has written a letter to us to save water, we could not believe that the Prime Minister has written a letter to all of us.
The people of that place are ready to play their active role in water conservation once again.
I convey my best wishes to all the Chief Ministers, all the Sarpanches for their active work.
There are several Sarpanchs across the country who are engaged in water conservation.
As I said, everyones efforts will have a very positive outcome.
But everyone's goal is to save water, save water.
The work of rejuvenating the drainage system in Punjab is underway.
This prevents water logging.
The construction of a reservoir in Thimaipalli, Telangana has changed the lives of the villagers.
The construction of a small pond built in the field of Kabirdham in Rajasthan has brought about a major change.
I was talking about a collective effort in Vellore in Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women came together to revive the river.
I was also reading about the women of Garhwal who have been working very well to hold the rain water together.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, three requests have been made to the countrymen.
My first request was to launch a mass movement for water conservation just as the people of the country had turned cleanliness into a mass movement.
Together, we all resolve to save every drop of water. I believe that water is the prasadam obtained from Parameswaran.
To save one drop of water, we start a campaign of awareness.
Whether it is the world of cinema, the world of sports, the friends of media, the people associated with social organizations, people associated with cultural organizations, artists for discussion, everyone should lead this movement in their own way.
You should awaken the society, unite everyone and unite.
You see, we can see changes in front of our eyes.
Let us draw a list of ways to conserve water and motivate people to conserve water.

My dear countrymen, I express my gratitude to you and all the people of the world for one more thing.
Just as on 21st June, once again on the occasion of Yoga Day, three or four generations of a family full of enthusiasm and zeal have celebrated Yoga Day simultaneously.
The awareness about Holistic Health Care has enhanced the importance of Yoga Day.
If any yoga lover welcomes the sun with sunrise at every corner of the world, his entire journey is over with the sunset.
The Presidents, Prime Ministers, well-known personalities and ordinary citizens of different countries of the world have shown me on Twitter how they have celebrated Yoga Day in their own country.
That day, the world looked like a huge family full of happiness.
We all know that to build a healthy society, a healthy and compassionate person is the need of the hour.
The promotion and spread of Yoga is an integral part of social service.
In 2019, Prime Ministers Awards for outstanding contribution in the field of promotion and development of Yoga were announced, which is a good news for me.
This award has been conferred on those organizations across the world who have played a pivotal role in the promotion and propagation of Yoga.
For example, Japan Yoga Niketan', who has made Yoga very popular in Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan is a premier organization and is undergoing training courses.
And where it is Yoga, can Indians stay behind
Yoga schools in Munger, Bihar, which have been dedicated to Yoga for the last few decades, have also been honored.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Munich has also been honored with the establishment of Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
The observation of IDY in the past years has been marked by thousands of harmonious mass demonstrations of Yoga in public places.
My dear countrymen, today our journey has begun with a new spirit, a new feeling, a new resolve and a new energy.
To connect with your thoughts, it is important for me that Mann Ki Baat is limited.
May your blessings be with me.
You are my inspiration, my strength.
Let us all sit together and listen to Mann Ki Baat and fulfill all the responsibilities of life.
In the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will talk to you again.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today I am filled with the feeling of starting Mann Ki Baat.
Ten days ago, Mother India had lost her brave children.
To meet this challenge before the country, all of us have to forget casteism, communalism, regionalism and all other ideologies, so that we can take even stronger, stronger and more effective steps against terrorism.
Our armed forces are brave enough.
You have seen that what kind of steps have been taken within 100 hours of terrorism.
The soldiers have pledged to destroy the terrorists and their drunkards.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, through the media, an inspiring message was sent to their families, which inspires the people of the country with great courage, enthusiasm and energy.
The father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur in Bhagalpur in Bihar, Ramnijanji, who had shown a strong resolve during this time of grief, inspires us all.
He said that his other son will also be sent to fight the enemies of the country and will be present in the battle field as and when required.
The entire nation salutes the indomitable courage of Meenaji, the wife of Shaheed Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
He resolved to join his only son in the CRPF.
When the body of Shaheed Vijay Soren, who was wearing a national flag, reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his younger son used to say that he will join the army.
This resolve, with the inspiration of this innocent child, reflects the spirit of the young children of India today.
My dear countrymen, the 'war memorial' that was waiting for us for so long for freedom is going to end.
It is natural for the countrymen to have a lot of questions and feelings in this regard.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Omkar Shetty from Karnataka expressed her happiness that the National War Memorial has been created.
I was surprised and distressed that there was no National War Memorial in India.
My dear countrymen, the birth of our country's former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was on February 29-February.
You all are aware of the fact that this special day comes just once in four years.
Be it a simple, peaceful person, Morarjibhai was one of the most devoted leaders of this country.
In our independent India, the record of presenting the highest budget in the Parliament was in the name of Morarji Desai.
In those difficult times, he gave the right leadership to India when the country's democracy was at a critical juncture.
In order to protect this democracy, Morarji Desai gave himself up in the movement against Emergency.
And even after coming to Bardhak, he had to pay a lot of money.
The government of that day arrested him and threw him into prison.
But when the Janata Party won in 1977, he became our Prime Minister.
The 44th Constitutional Amendment was proposed during his tenure as the Prime Minister.
This is also important because the 42nd amendment is proposed to be made for the Emergency, where there were certain proposals to dismantle the powers of the Supreme Court and undermine our democratic values.
For example, the proposal for amendment of 44th Amendment provides an opportunity for publication of news papers in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies.
The amendment also provides that the fundamental rights of citizens, in accordance with Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution, shall not be taken away from the provisions of the Essential Commodities (EC) Act.
Today, once again, I pay my tributes to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, just like every year, there was a lot of curiosity in the minds of people about the Padma awards.
I want to tell you about some such people today.
Recalling Abdul Gafur Khatadi ji of Gujarat, he said that he has done a wonderful job of reviving the traditional art of Kutch.
He did a great job to take this rare craft to new generations.
I had given the gift of '3e of life' by Abdul Gafoor to former US President Barack Obama.
Among the recipients of the Padma awards, everyone knows the essence of Marathwadas soap as a servant of mother Gomata.
He is unique in the way he has dedicated his entire life to the service of mother cow.
Madurai Chinna Pillai is a person who has tried to make the affected and the exploited people strong and self-reliant through the Kaljeeyam movement in Tamil Nadu.
He is also training people from all over the world in Yoga at the age of 100 years and has till now produced more than 1500 Yoga teachers.
Yamuna Tudu, the famous Lady Tarzan of Jharkhand, did not just save 50 hectares of forest from falling apart but sent 10,000 women together to protect trees and wildlife.
As a result of this hard work of Yamuna, today the people of the village plant 18 trees at the time of birth of every child and at the time of marriage of every girl.
He is a rare example of how he has worked for the development of women with disabilities as well as Divyang.He dedicated himself to the virtues of making visually impaired children self-reliant by creating an institution called Child Womens Services.
My dear countrymen, for the first time, this year, 12 farmers of those who have been awarded the Padma awards, have been included.
Generally, very few people associated with the agriculture sector and those directly associated with the farmers are also included in the list of those who avail the benefits of 'Padma Shri'.
And this is the living picture of changing India.
My dear countrymen, today, I would like to share with you a heart-breaking experience, which I have been experiencing for the last few days.
Today, wherever I go, I want to meet the beneficiaries of 'Ayushman Bharat' - PMJAY' and 'PM Jan Arogya Yojana' in the country.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme.
I understand how this has changed the lives of the poor.
If you know the poor people who are unable to get the treatment due to lack of money then you can tell them about this scheme.
This scheme has been launched for the benefit of the poor.
My dear brothers and sisters are going to start school exams.
Preparations will be made for various Board Examinations of Parliament and Class II across the country.
My best wishes to the students, their parents and teachers.
A few days ago, in Delhi, the Pariksha Pe Charcha program was organized in the Town Hall format.
All the students, their teachers, parents can see the recording of this program on YouTube. I convey my best wishes to all the participants of the upcoming exams.
My dear countrymen, India's words will not be spoken about and it will not be spoken about.
Probably there is not a single day in our country when there is no festival or festival or any special significance, because we have thousands of years old tradition with us.
In a few days from now, Mahashivratri will arrive and this time Shivaratri will fall on Monday, Monday and Shivratri together.
I have been impressed with the power of this Divyangjan.
My dear countrymen, connecting with you through Mann Ki Baat is a unique experience for me.
Every month, through radio, I face crores of families.
There are times when I read your letters, read letters to you, talk to you, and listen to your suggestions and comments on the phone, I feel that you have made me one of your family.
This is a very happy experience for me.
Friends, Election is the biggest festival of democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy with elections.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
He sacrificed his life for providing food, shelter, education and spiritual awakening.
Siddhaganga Math is organized by Animal Husbandry Dairying.
I once again pay my respects to such a great man.
But today I'm just saying something else about it.
Imagine just one voter.
If for some reason you fail to vote, you must suffer a lot.
I would like to appeal to the people of the country to register as Election Electoral Rolls in Amrasbimil and to the public to vote on the election day.
I believe that more and more young voters will register themselves and strengthen our democracy with their participation.
It was here that the Rulers of Bharat Mata were appointed as Principal, Premsehgal, Colonel Gurubax Singh Dhillon and Major General Shah Nawaz Khan.
When I saw the things related to Netaji's relationship with the Kranti Mandir of the Red Fort, then the family members of Netaji used to give me a special look.
Once Netaji used it.
I have put in place a set of satellites in order to view the satellites and also to motivate the countrymen.
The valour of our heroes, patriotic stories are extremely useful for our younger generation through various media.
This month, on 30th December, I had flagged off the Andaman Nicobar Islands.
But that was the 75 year anniversary of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Delhi: You have made the dream of a self-reliant India. You have made the dream of a self-reliant India become an international destination.
Over the years, there was a commitment to make all the files related to Netaji public.
I'm glad we've been doing this.
On that day, I have been told that the family of Netaji had come to the Prime Minister's residence.
I am told that Radio Stations are weekly news broadcasters in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pustu, Urdu.
He was a master of the great land.
The museum is a historical exhibition and has a collection of 450 ancient art works of 3 generations.
The exhibition showcases some of the finest art works of artisan like Amritsheel, Raja Ravi Varma, Abanindranath Thakur, Gaganendranatha Thakur, Nandalal Bose, Jaminiyar, Shilej Mukharjee.
He made a lot of painting.
He also referred to the Birds as well as the natural beauty of the region, and also provided Man Character-Chairperson the medium of craft canvas.
And it is surprising that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore did not mention any of these works of art.
I would like to tell them that they should understand their point of view and learn the art of making these paintings.
Orpainting has been displayed in various countries of Europe, Russia and America.
I hope you'll see his painting in the worldly temple.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our Saints have given a message of opinion and action, equality and social empowerment.
There was a similar feeling - a saint.
The birth anniversary of the 19thsebruary.
Last year, we had launched the Kalamsat on the 24th of January.

We have installed 104 - Satellite Launcher at a single launch vehicle on a global scale.

In this vision of Housing for All, almost 40 lakh houses have been constructed by the State Government.
In this context, he mentioned about the initiatives taken by the Government of India to promote innovation and entrepreneurship among others.
This satellite is a symbol of the country's progress.
This is our contribution to the development of a world-wide relationship.
South Asia Satellites is a unique experiment that has improved our neighboring countries.
They're gonna get their cars on their own.
Generally, the boys don't get excited, but they've got Sonely called Vicbadi and showed their skills.
The 10-year-old Avinashkilo India Youth Games is the youngest gold medal winner in the world.
Akshata Baswani has won the gold medal in the Kamtivrat Totel of Karnataka for her family.
When we talk of the creation of 'New India', this is the resolve of the youth, this is the New India.
These stories of Khelo India are etched in the pages of history for India and the work done by the brave-hearts such as the brave-hearts of the great cities like Varshaharba Mahanagara, the small cities of Uttaranchal, Maafsal, Gram-to-Ashishu, young and young warriors.
My little friends, they're on the exam day.
Himachal Pradesh has been referred to as "Phase-II". I will have to say something about these examinations and the results of those exams.
Mr. Ganguly, Thank you very much for this initiative.
Yeah, some family members are on top of the exam.
Students, their parents and teachers - everything is wrong with the test.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would like to share my thoughts on this episode of Mann Ki Baat today, but you will be happy to share with the participants of the Pariksha Pe Charcha 29th January 2019 at 11:00 PM.
I will tell you a lot about all the subjects related to the examination, especially the 'Stress Free Exam', which means, by doing an unbiased examination, I will tell you about my dear friends.

Wherever we go, we pay homage to the martyrs every 2 minutes.
We will fulfill the dreams of Pujya Bapu by fulfilling his dream of building a New India and by fulfilling the duties of citizens.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
We are going to enter 2019.
What can we do to bring about a change in our lives and at the same time take the country and society forward
My best wishes to you all for 2019

Electricity has reached every village of the country.
Several world leaders have acknowledged that India is on the path of poverty eradication at a record pace.
With the determination of the people of the country, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is going to achieve 95 percent of the target.
For the first time after the Independence, the Rashtriya Flag was hoisted from the Red Fort on the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government.
The Statue of Unity, the tallest statue in the world, is built in honor of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, who had embraced unity in the country.

As a result of all-round efforts, our country has achieved unprecedented success in Ease of Doing Business rankings.
The daughters of the country have made the country proud by visiting the entire world through the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
India's first waterway has been inaugurated in Varanasi.
This has brought about a revolutionary change in the field of waterways.
The longest rail-road Bogibeel bridge in the country has been opened for the public and Sikkim first and 100th airport Pakyong in the country has been inaugurated.
India won the FIFA U-19 World Cup and the World Cup.
India has also won many medals in this years Asian Games.
India's results in the Para-ASEAN games have also been very good.
But if I talk about the success of every Indian and our all-round efforts, then the Mann Ki Baat programme will become so long that it will begin in 2019.
All this has been possible due to the indomitable efforts of 130 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, in December this year, we have lost some wonderful countrymen.
Jaya Chandra lost her life on 19th December, 2019 in Chennai.
Narsamma was a helper in the delivery of pregnant mothers and sisters.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
Earlier this year, he was conferred with the Padma Shri award.
There are many exemplary personalities like Dr. Jaya Chandran and SulagittiNarsamma who have devoted their lives for the good of the society.
When we talk of healthcare, I would like to mention the social efforts of doctors in the business of Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some officials of my party told me that some young people of the city have been providing free treatment to the poor by organizing a medical camp.
Now hundreds of poor people are benefitting from this camp every month.
This spirit of selfless service is commendable.
Today, I can proudly say that because of our collective efforts, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign.
Some people have told me that a few days ago, more than 3 lakh people were associated with the Swachhata Abhiyan in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
In this Mahayagya of cleanliness, the Municipal Corporation, voluntary organizations, school and college students, the people of Jabalpur, all of them participated enthusiastically.
This is where I come to know about Dr. Jaya Chandran.
Whenever I get time, I try to learn about such inspiring things by going to The Better India.com website.
I am happy that today there are many such websites that connect with inspiring people with life stories.
You can easily learn Sanskrit language by sitting at home with the help of Sanskrit Bharati Dot In.
I believe that many people will come to know about these heroes who had transformed the society.
It is very easy to spread positivity, but very good work is being done in our society and this is possible due to the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports has a distinct significance in every society.
When there is a game, there is a stir in the audience too.
I would like to mention about a girl from Kashmir, Hannaya Nisa, who won a gold medal at the Carat Championships in Korea.
On the 12th anniversary of the uit India Movement, the Prime Minister said that on the 12th anniversary of the uit India Movement, there is an eternal flame in Kashmir.
I wish him a bright future from all over the country.
I wish you all the very best for the year 2018.
Similarly, there is a lot of discussion going on in the media about another daughter and sixteen Rajni ji.
You must have read it too.
Rajni has won a gold medal at the Junior Boxing Championships.
He does so in honor of his father, Jasam Singh, who sells lassi in a waterway shop.
Rajni said that she had to admit her father's sacrifice and suffering to reach this place.
Jasmer Singh left for work every morning before Rajani and her brothers and sisters got up.
When Rajni ji wanted to teach her boxing, she tried her best to encourage her, to make her dream come true.
It was only with the old gloves that started the Rajni Boxing Practice because the financial condition of her family was not good at that time.
Despite all odds, Rajni did not lose courage and learnt boxing.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
I congratulate Rajni ji and her parents, Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani, for being with Rajni ji and inspiring her.
This month, the 20-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni from Pune became the fastest-growing Asian to scale the world on a bicycle.
He cycled about 300 kms per day for 159 days.
Just imagine, 300 kilometers of cycling every day
His indomitable spirit towards cycling is indeed commendable.
Difficulty never stops.
When we hear of other such examples, we also get new inspirations in every moment of our life.
My dear countrymen, in the month of January, there are many festivals which are celebrated with great zeal and enthusiasm like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi etc.
All these festivals will see the color of traditional dances throughout India, the color of crops on Lohri, colorful horoscopes on the sky, sitting somewhere or the other.
Somewhere sports will be organised, somewhere sports will be organized, and somewhere sports will be organized to make each other happy by eating sesame seeds.
The names of these festivals are different but the purpose of the festival is to ensure that these festivals are associated in some or the other way with agriculture and rural life.
It is during this time that the sun descends and the sun enters the Capricorn.
Since then, the day has started to grow gradually and the winter season has started to pass.
On this occasion, my best wishes to the farmers and sisters of Annadata.
Unity in Diversity Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is inherent in this spirit.
We can see how closely these festivals are associated with nature.
Indian culture does not discriminate between society and nature, but it is a people and a group.
Another glorious example of our closeness to nature is the festival-based calendar.
This Calendar contains class-wise and subject-wise activities in tabular forms.
These traditional calendars tell us how ancient our relationships are with natural and astronomy.
The lunar and Sun calendar based on the speed of the Moon and the Sun determines the date of festivities and festivals.
It depends on who follows a calendar.
Festivals are scheduled to take place at many places where the planets are placed.
All festivals like Gudi Padva, Cheti Chand, Ugadi, etc. are celebrated according to the lunar calendar, similarly Tamil Puthandu and Vishu, Vaishkha, Vaisakha, Payla Vaishkha, Bihu etc. are celebrated according to the sun calendar.
Many of us also have a special purpose to protect rivers and water in Parban.
The Chhath Parbati is connected to the sun worship in rivers and ponds.
Even in Makar Sankranti, lakhs of people bathe in holy rivers.
Our festivals also teach us social values.
On the one hand, they have ancient importance on the other, on the other hand, each and every episode of life inspires and teaches to develop a brotherhood with each other.
I wish you all the very best in 2019 and wish you all the very best.
Share the photographs on the occasion of this festival with all of you so that everyone can see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there are so many things in our culture that we can be proud of and show the world the same thing as Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
Many films also present a wide range of aspects related to the heritage and the magnitude of the festival and the manner in which the Kumbh has been presented, have a great tradition as well as a great importance.
People from all over the country and the world come here to participate in the Kumbh.
The Kumbh Congregation is a celebration of the faith and devotion of the people.
Millions and millions of people from India and abroad are coming together at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh has been enriched and nurtured by our great cultural heritage.
Saints and sages have started reaching for the Kumbh from now on.
Last year UNESCO has registered the Kumbh Mela in the "Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity".
A few days ago, Ambassadors of many countries witnessed the preparations for Kumbh.
At the same time, national flags of many countries were hoisted at the same place.
There is a possibility of more than 150 people coming to Prayagraj for Kumbh Mela.
This can be a very big learning experience especially for the youth.
I had gone to Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparations for the Kumbh were in progress.
The people of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic about the Kumbh.
Now there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness in Kumbh.
This symbol of the faith of the people, this Akshayvat was kept in the fort for thousands of years so that even if the pilgrims wanted to visit it, they could not visit it.
Now the doors of the Akshayvat have been opened for everyone.
I appeal to you, that when you visit the Kumbh, you must share the different features and pictures of the Kumbh on social media so that more and more people are inspired to go to the Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of spirituality be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith also be the Mahakumbh of patriotism and national integration.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Republic Day on 26th January, we remember the great men who gave us our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu.
It is a privilege for us that the President of South Africa, Mr. Sirial Ramaphosa, is coming to India as the Chief Guest of our Republic Day celebrations.
Pujya Bapu and South Africa have an unbreakable bond.
South Africa is the place where Mohan became the Mahatma.
It was in South Africa that Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha and stood against caste discrimination.
He had set up Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, where the voice of peace and tranquility prevailed throughout the world.
He had the courage and inspiration to spend so many years in prison from venerable Bapu.
Mandela said, "Mahatma is an integral part of our history because it was here that he first applied himself on the path of truth.
There was a wide range of discussions on the measures needed to further strengthen the security of the country and its people.
In this conference, I have announced the Sardar Patel Award for National Unity, which will be conferred on those who have contributed in some way or the other to national unity.
Sardar Patel devoted his life for the unity of the country.
He worked throughout his life to keep the integrity of India intact.
He said that the unity of the country is inherent in its diversity.
I would like to pay homage to Sardar Patel through this award of Unity, to pay tribute to him.
My dear countrymen, on the 13th of January, the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji will be celebrated.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna.
He breathed his last at Nanded in Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna, the workplace of North India and the last time of life in Nanded is in Nanded.
In a way, the entire India received his blessings.
Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that the biggest service is to alleviate human suffering.
His Majesty was full of bravery, valour, sacrifice and devotion.
He had an extraordinary knowledge of weapons and science.
On the one hand, he was an archer, while on the other hand, he was well-versed in various languages like Gurumukhi, Brij Language, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi, Urdu etc.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are some good things that are not discussed extensively in the country.
Several events are being organized across the country to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Trying to develop safe and healthy food habits.
As part of the Eat Right India movement, the Swasth Bharat Yatra is being organized across the country.
The expedition will run from 27th January to 27th January 2020.
India will prosper only when India becomes clean and healthy.
For good health, the first thing is nutrition.
Whether it is personal life or national life or social life - the source of inspiration is progress.
Let us move forward with innovative inspiration, new zeal, new resolve, new vision, new heights and bring about a change in ourselves and the country as well.
Mann Ki Baat: November 2019
Today, the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat' has been celebrated.
Golden Jubilee Episode - Golden Episode.
This is the 50th edition that most of the letters and calls received today.
Through MyGov the citizen engagement platform of Delhi, Shri Anshu Kumar, Kamal Kumar, Patna, Vikas Yadav and Manika Jain of Delhi in the Narendra Modi App, the Government from Bardhaman in West Bengal, the Sangeeta Shastri of Nagpur in a similar manner.
- This question is natural.
In today's era, when people almost forgot the radio, why did Modi bring the radio back?
Now the shopkeeper said, listen to the radio.
I heard it on the radio, the bomb is under discussion.
The Prime Minister said that Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had said on the radio that the historical significance of the bomb blast and the nuclear bomb test was the significance of that day.
I was wondering that a shopkeeper is happy to watch the dance and dance of the people in this area, in the mountainous terrain surrounded by snow, in the jungles, he is listening to the radio from his shop all day.
I have been thinking about radio's communication reach and its far-reaching impact.
After that when I became the Prime Minister, it is natural that I will take the help of the most powerful connection.
Since May 2014, when I started taking charge as the Chief Servant, I felt that the unity of our country, our glorious history, bravery, diversity, cultural diversity, peoples work, mens work, their emotions, sacrifice and penance, all of us need to spread the story of India to all people across the country.
I have reached the 50th episode every month to read lakhs of letters, listen to the phone calls, learn about the various apps coming together and to share them with me, to talk about my own little fun.
The results of that survey are encouraging.
The survey reveals that 70 per cent of the listeners of Mann Ki Baat heard the episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Most people think that Mann Ki Baat has generated positive thoughts among all sections of society.
Through Mann Ki Baat, the mass movement has gained a lot.
There was a lot of discussion on Haas Tag India Positive.
It is such a big change that is coming forward for the welfare of the people.
Modi will come and go, but our country is eternal, our culture will remain immortal.
These small stories of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
A new inspiration full of enthusiasm will take the country to greater heights.
I read letters and feel such a feeling in them and work with them in mind.
I myself have realized both these things and share them with you and share them with all of you.
But who knows when these words will reach home again.
Sometimes the government will have so much power that the schemes like 'Selfie with daughter' i.e. 'Selfie with her daughter' will start from a small village in Haryana and will spread not only in the whole country but also in the whole world.
Every section of the society, every section of the society, every celebrity has also been associated with this thing and the thinking of the society has been depicted in such a modern way that the modern generation is illuminated.
Sometimes we have enjoyed Mann Ki Baat but I have always had 130 crore countrymen.
They're my mind.
Mann Ki Baat is not about government, it is about society.
There are many aspects of social life in which politics is only one aspect.
If politics becomes the basis, it cannot be a reflection of a healthy society.
Sometimes political events or political people become so important that other talents of the society get neglected.
It is our collective responsibility to take care of the talent and other aspects of the society for a bright future of a country like India and a small, humble effort to move forward in the direction of Mann Ki Baat.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50th edition of Mann Ki Baat is that you are not asking the Prime Minister to question one of your closest partners, it is democracy.
There is also a toll free number - 1x7x7800, where people record their messages by calling there.
I try to read as many letters and comments as possible before Mann Ki Baat.
I hear a lot of calls.
As the episode of Mann Ki Baat progresses, I keep on sharing my thoughts and ideas while travelling to and fro.
It's not just a piece of paper for me.
In addition to this, I have lived a life of about 40-45 years for a child and in most of the districts of the country, I have spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
And that's why when I read a letter, I can easily connect myself with that place-time.
After that, I note some information such as the name of the village, the person and the name of the person.
As a matter of fact, I have a voice in Mann Ki Baat, but for example, emotions and passion for my countrymen, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to Mann Ki Baat.
There are lakhs of people whose names have not yet been given the name of Mann Ki Baat, but instead of getting frustrated, they keep sending their letters and comments.
I am confident that your message will reach me much more than ever before and will make Mann Ki Baat more engaging, effective and useful.
It has also been tried that all the letters which are not included in the Mann Ki Baat programme are kept in mind by the concerned departments.
I would also like to thank all the media, Doordarshan, other TV channels and friends from social media for this thing.
Mann Ki Baat has reached the maximum number of people through their hard work.
They became Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I would like to thank them for their talent and skills.
I request you all to listen to this event in your regional languages as well.
I also express my gratitude to all those friends in the media who are regularly promoting Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
No political person is satisfied with the media, whether it is under coverage or negative coverage, but the media has taken several initiatives that have been announced in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Without your help, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Nidhi ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
Generally, I say I have no secret.
What I'm doing might happen to all families.
In a simple language, I try to prepare myself like those young people, keep myself in that situation and try to match a wave langth match with their opinions.
There are some old baggages in our own life and if they are not brought forward then it becomes easier to convince anyone.
We dont even know how one person has given up his thoughts and accepted the other and made up his own thoughts.
The young men of the present have a good quality, they never believe what they don't believe, and when they believe in something, they leave everything behind.
Often people discuss communication gap between the elders and the teenagers.
However, in most of the families, limited issues were discussed with the teenagers.
Most of the time there is talk about studies or habits, life style - do this, do not do this.
It is also a matter of concern that the open-mindedness of the family is gradually falling within the family without imposition of any restrictions.
Any media that takes importance in changing the expectations and the absence of discussion.
I am in constant touch with the youth through various programmes and social media.
I've always learned from young minds.
Young people have ideas.
Young people are entrepreneurship, innovative and focused.
Some say that young students want to work together.
I say, what's wrong with that?
They're good at multi-tasking, so they do it.
If we look around, be it social initiatives, start-ups, sports or any other field, the biggest change in the society is that of the youth.
Young people who have the courage to question and dream.
If we leave the power of decision-making on the youth and if they open up their minds, they can bring about a constructive change in the country and it is they who are doing it.
My dear countrymen, Vineeta Ji has written on MyGov website from Gurugram, that in this episode of Mann Ki Baat, on 26th November, we need to speak on the Constitution Day.
This is a special day because we are entering the 70th year of the Constitution of India.
Vinitaji, thank you very much for this suggestion
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
Let us remember all those great personalities who drafted our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949.
It took 2 years and 11 months and 17 days to complete this historic task of drafting the Constitution.
Just imagine, within three years, such a great personality has given us such a vast Constitution.
The extraordinary speed at which these constitutions were formed is a unique example of time management and productivity even today.
It has inspired us to fulfill our responsibilities at a record time.
The Constituent Assembly was an amalgamation of the great talents of the country and each one of them was committed to provide a Constitution to the nation which empowers the people of India and empowers the poorest of the poor.
The salient feature of our Constitution is that - Right and Duties are explained in detail here.
The balance between these two things in the lives of the citizens of the country will take the country forward.
If we respect each other's rights, then you will also protect your rights and if we follow our duties, then we will also be able to uphold our rights.
I remember that in 2010, in 60 years of Indian democracy, we carried a procession on the back of the elephant by placing it on the back of the elephant.
It was a remarkable effort to educate the youth about the Constitution and to inculcate interest in them about the various provisions of the Constitution.
As a democratic country in 2020, we will complete 70 years of our independence and in 2022 we will complete 75 years of our independence.
Let us respect the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His Mahaparinirvana Diwas on 6th December.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I salute Baba Saheb, who has given the right to honor crores of Indians.
He said that the democratic ideals of India are not out-of-box.
The definition of a democracy or a Parliamentary system was not new to India.
He had made an emotional appeal in the Constituent Assembly that we have achieved this freedom after many battles and that is why we have to protect it from the last drop of blood.
He used to say that no matter how different we Indians are, the welfare of the country is always the priority.
Once again my tributes to Baba Saheb.
My dear countrymen, two days ago on the 23rd of November, we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, and are going to celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev always wished for the welfare of mankind.
He has always shown the society the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony.
Our country will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji next year and the country will spread and spread its vastness throughout the world.
All the States and UTs have been requested to observe the day with pomp and show.
Similarly, the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated across the world.
A train will also run across all the sacred places associated with Shri Guru Nanak Devji.
When I was discussing this issue recently, I remembered the concept of Lakhpat Sahib Gurudwara.
The Gurudwara was severely damaged during the Gujarat earthquake in 2001, but the manner in which the state government restored the Gurudwara with the local people is an example.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that the passengers of our country can easily visit the holy land of Shri Guru Nanak Devji in Kartarpur in Pakistan.
My dear countrymen, we will meet again after the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat.I believe that for the first time I could share my thoughts on Mann Ki Baat, because you wanted to know it.
Our journey will continue.
The more I get your cooperation, the more will this journey deepen and be happy.
Sometimes people ask me what I got from Mann Ki Baat.
Today I want to say that the feedback that comes from Mann Ki Baat has touched my heart. Most people say that when they hear the Mann Ki Baat programme in their families, they feel that their family members are sharing their thoughts with them.
When I came to know about this thing in detail that I have made one of you, one of you, and one of you and you have made me big, then I am very happy that I will come again and again as a family member of your family through Mann Ki Baat, I will meet you.
You're right, I'm good.
Let us take this journey forward.
Mann Ki Baat October, 2018
I wish you all a great participation in the Run for Unity in large numbers.
About six and a half months before independence, the famous international magazine Time magazine published a picture of Sardar Patel on January 27, 1947.
Time served as a model for India in her lead story.
There were more than 550 indigenous states.
Even though the British had lost interest in India, they wanted to leave this country isolated.
Time magazine wrote that India has such dangers of isolation, violence, food crisis, price rise and power politics but if someone has the power to unite the country, then Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the same power.
Gandhiji had told Sardar Patel that the problems of the states are so dangerous that only you can find a solution.
Sardar Patel had really resolved one by one and the entire country by coming together. He had done a commendable job.
Whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad, Trivandrum or Rajasthan, Sardar Patel was the only person who understood the wisdom and the strategy of strategic strategy, today we are witnessing an India in totality.
When we look at our mother India, the nation that is tied to unity, naturally remembers Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's relics.
This 31st October is more important than Sardar Patel's birth anniversary, as a tribute to him on this day, we will hand over the Statue of Unity to the nation.
Located on the banks of the Narmada River in Gujarat, the statue is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty of America.
This will be the world's highest skyscraper.
Every Indian can proudly say that the tallest statue in the world is now in India.
I believe that this special structure will be considered as a favorite object in the entire country.
This was the day when the Indian Army troops landed on the land of Kashmir and rescued the valley from the intruders.
This historic event is also associated with Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview of Sam Manekshaw, the great soldier of India.
Field Marshal Manekshaw spoke about the time when he was Colonel.
At that time, in 1947, a military campaign had started in Kashmir.
Field Marshal Manekshaw has said that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was distressed at a meeting to delay the sending of troops to Kashmir at that time. During the meeting, Sardar Patel looked at his habit and said that there should not be any delay in Army operations in Kashmir and we have to resolve this problem as soon as possible.
On 31st October, we mark the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi.
Tributes to Indiraji.
My dear countrymen, is there people who don't like sports?
Spirit, stamina, strength, skill etc. are very important in the world of sports.
These qualities are the criteria of the success of any player.
On the other hand, these four properties are important for nation building.
With these qualities of the youth of a country, they will not only improve the economy, science and technology of the country but will also flag the country's victory in sports.
Recently, I have two meetings, which are memorable.
First, I had the opportunity to meet the Para athletes who participated in the ASEAN Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
With a total of 72 medals won in the Games, India has set a new record and has enhanced the pride of the country.
In addition to 13 medals in these games, we have won 3 more medals in the Mix Event.
You must remember that this time India's performance in the Asian Games has also been very good.
Look, in the last few minutes I've used the best, the most beautiful word ever ever.
He was eight years old.
He spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he used to clean the bus of DTC and watch the bus on the roadside.
This Narayan who won the gold medal for India at the International Event today.
Not only this, the field of sports in India is gaining ground in such an event that India has not won any Olympic medal in Junior or Senior Level, while Tababi Devi Youth Olympics has created a history of winning a silver medal in Judo.
The 160th anniversary of the birth of the young Tababi Devi resides in a village in Manipur.
His father is a daily wager and mother sells fish.
There have been times when they didn't even have the money to buy food.
Such a situation has also led to the loss of life to Taabi Devi.
He made history by winning medals for the country.
There are many more such stories and their lives are a source of inspiration.
Every young player, his or her enthusiasm is a symbol of New India.
My dear countrymen, all of you remember that in 2017, we had successfully organized the FIFA UNDERs 17 WORLD CUPS.
This has been appreciated by the world's most successful tournament.
FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUUPERCORDED IN THE PRESIDENTS.
More than 12 lakh visitors witnessed the football in different stadiums across the country and have inspired young players.
This time, India has got the opportunity to host the World Cup hockey organization in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will be held from 28 November to 16 December 2019.
There is a special place in the minds of any Indian who loves any sport.
India has a golden history in hockey.
India has won gold in the past several times and has won the World Cup one time.
India has also given some world class players the gift of hockey.
If there is any discussion of hockey in any part of the world, then it is incomplete if it loses its name.
Major Dhyanchand, a hockey magician, is known all over the world.
In addition, Balvinder Singh, senior, Lesli Cladys, Mohammad Sahid, Udham Singh with Dhanraj Pillai, has made India a global leader.
Even today, the hockey players of Team India have set an example for the new generation by their hard work and dedication.
It gives a wonderful experience to the sports enthusiasts to watch the games while sitting at the stadium.
While going to Bhubaneswar, the team will encourage not only the Indian team but also the entire country.
We have a tradition of prosperity and cultural excellence and we have to keep in mind the vibrant character and spirit of the people of Odisha.
It is also a great opportunity for sports lovers to visit Odisha.
I also convey my best wishes to the rest of the world.
My dear countrymen, a lot of people are coming forward in social service, they are doing volunteering and it is becoming a great inspiration for the people of the country.
A young man has also made a pledge that he is learning a wheelchair basketball in the wheelchair.
This is the spirit of self-reliance this is mission mode activity.
There is no Indian who will not be proud of it.
This spirit of 'I am not mine' will inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, This time when I was watching your suggestions on Mann Ki Baat, I had the opportunity to see a very exciting comment from Shri Manish Mohapatra, Puducherry.
He has written in mygov. In this Mann Ki Baat of the time of kindness, let us talk about how the tribal people of India and their customs and traditions become the best example of uniting with nature.
There is a need to learn from them as to how we can strengthen their traditions for sustainable development.
Manish ji, I express my gratitude to you for placing such a thing in front of the audience of Mann Ki Baat.
This is a matter that inspires me to look back on our glorious past and culture.Today, the world, especially the western countries, is discussing the issue of environment conservation and is looking for a new path for balanced life.
Today, India too is not out of this problem, but we have to introspect to find a solution.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh, especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the trees like Bat, Arjun etc.
In the deserts like Rajasthan, Vishnoi has shown us the way to conserve the environment.
They are ready to sacrifice their lives for the protection of trees, but they are not ready to accept the loss of a tree.
Arunachal Pradesh's Mishmi brothers demand their relationship with the tiger.
They call him their brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland, the tiger is seen as the protector of the forest.
The arrival of tigers from the Worli community in Maharashtra is a symbol of prosperity for them.
The Kolasib community in Madhya Pradesh means that their fate is linked to tigers, if they do not eat tigers, they should also stay in the villages.
The Gond tribe in central India stopped fishing at some places of the Kaiyon River in the breeding season.
These places are known as fish shelters, which feed them with fresh fishes.
The tribal communities have made their home from natural materials, which are strong and eco-friendly.
In the remote areas of the Nilgiri mountain in the South India, there is a small traveling community -- To break the tradition of the people who make their settlements locally based.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is true that the tribal community believes in peaceful and harmonious co-existence among themselves, but when one harms their natural resources, they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that the tribal people were among our first freedom fighters.
Who can forget Bhagwan Birsa Munda who fought hard against British rule to protect his forest.
There are many examples of tribal communities who teach us how to live in harmony with nature and how our country is indebted to the tribal community for the forest resources that we have left behind.
Let us pay our respects to them.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those people and their problems who are doing something extraordinary for the society.
Those things, which appear to be normal, but in reality, there is a far-reaching impact on the mindset and the direction of the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about Gurubachan Singh ji from Punjab.
The son of a common and hardworking farmer, Gurubachan Singh ji was married.
Prior to this marriage, Gurubachan Singh ji had told the parents that they would do this marriage on an uninterrupted basis.
Again he suddenly said he had a condition.
Nowadays, on the condition of marriage, it seems that he is going to talk about something big, he will want something that will make his family difficult.
But you will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurbachan Singh was a simple white farmer and he told his father that the condition that I am talking about is the real strength of the society.
Gurubachan Singh ji said that you should talk to me. From now on, you will not stop the residues that will remain in the field after harvesting your crops.
You can imagine how big a social force is hidden in it.
Guruvachan Singh Ji thinks that it is extraordinary, but it is his personality and we have seen that there are many such families in our society who have converted personal issues into good work of the society.
The family of Shri Gurbachan Singh ji had set an example.
I read about another village in Punjab, Kallar, which is situated near navar.
Kallar majra was heading for this because the people there used to burn the paddy straw and mix it with the soil by using technology.
Greetings to Bhai Gurbachan Singh ji.
Greetings to the people of Kallar and those places who are making every effort to make the environment pollution free.
All of you are taking forward the healthy lifestyle of Indian heritage in the right direction.
Just as a drop of water is produced by the sea, such a small awareness and positive work always helps in creating a positive environment.
For India, November 12 this year has a special significance because the first World War I was ending in November 1100 years ago.
That is, it will be a hundred years of the horrific end and the end of the massacre.
World War I is an important event for India.
In fact, we had nothing to do with this great war.
Despite this, the soldiers of our country fought, played a major role and made the supreme sacrifice in this war.
Indian soldiers have shown the world that they are not behind anyone in the battlefield.
Our soldiers have displayed bravery in difficult situations in difficult terrains.
There was only one purpose - to restore peace.
In the first World War, the whole world saw the horrors of destruction.
It is estimated that nearly one crore soldiers and as many civilians lost their lives.
After this horrible war, the whole world understood the importance of peace.
The definition of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
My dear countrymen, there is a special feature of the North East of this country.
The natural beauty of this place is unparalleled and the people here are also very talented.
Our Northeast is known for its great and excellent work.
It's a place where organic farming has developed a lot.
Just a few days ago, Sikkim won the prestigious Fury Policy Gold Award to promote sustainable food systems or long-term food systems.
The award was presented by the FAO, an organization affiliated to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation.
You will be happy to know that the award for Best Policy in this field is equivalent to Oskar.
Not only this, our 25 countries have lost their nominations.
I thank the people of Sikkim for that.
My dear countrymen, the month of October is about to end.
The change of the season can be seen.
The winter has come and the season of festivals has also changed with the change in season.Dhantras, Deepavali, Bhaifonta, Chhath Puja, may say that the month of November is also the month of festivals.
My best wishes to every countryman for all the festivals.
I request you to take care of yourself, pay attention to your health and also pay attention to the welfare of the society during the festival.
Your progress is an important part of the country's progress.
The country will progress as much as you can.
