Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
Salute , O ye land of my beloved .
The contribution of Deepavali to all of you is many ruins .
He said that the light in this world brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which can see goodness by destroying resistance.
Sahastradhara is a special attraction of the festival tourism in the world .
There is immense opportunity for the Festival to be celebrated at home in India.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is important in the promotion of Festival Tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided to do something new for this Diwali in Mann Ki Baat last time.
On seeing this in the social stories of innumerable stories were discovered .
This day our brethren are in good professions .
She is really Indian Lakshmi .
Greetings to your mother , and to your mother .
The poet Tiwari Giri is his strength , Indian Lakshmi .
How pride they feel their daughter wearing good paintings .
She brought a good rock in the CLAT test.
92 years old an elderly woman has provided free drinking water to passengers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Megha Ji was inspired by the humility and compassion of this Indian Lakshmi.
Many such stories people are Shering .
You must read, get inspired.
You also Sher such things around you .
My dear countrymen, the well-known poetess of the 17th century, written a poem in Hindi at the time of Honam, which was written in Kannada language.
I would like to say that the foundation of those feelings, those words and the Indian Lakshmade words will be laid here for all of us now.
How important things , how important feelings , how good thoughts , poets are in Kannada .
Because of the importance of these sons the future of our society , bright future .
My dear countrymen, 12 November 2019 marks the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji all over the world.
The effect of Guru Nanak is not only in India but in the whole world .
Our Sikh brothers and sisters are residing in many countries of the world, who are fully committed to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can never forget my journey to Vancouver and Tehran gates.
I can tell you so much about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, but it will have to have several episodes from Mann Ki Baat.
They were standing at the place of service .
It is believed that Guru Nanak Devji had done the service of Nirvana .
They were opposite to the social illusions like unconsciousness .
Shri Guru Nanak Devjis message was delivered to the people of far-flung areas of the world.
They were one of the people traveling more during their time .
He went to many places and embodied the spirit of selflessness, humility and simplicity of his mind.
Taking similar messages they went to all the sides of the north and south east west , and met people everywhere , saints , sages .
It is believed that Shankar Dev, the well-known saint of Assam, is also inspired by them.
They traveled to the sacred Haridwar .
Guru Bagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi .
Sri Guru Nanak Dev had stayed there .
He also visited the religious places like Rajgir, Gaya of Buddhism.
On the south Guru Nanak Dev had traveled Sri Lanka .
During the journey of Bidar in Karnataka Guru Nanak Dev had discovered the problem of water there .
During one Udasi period, Guru Nanak Devji visited the surrounding areas of Kashmir in the north.
He had traveled to Uzbekistan , where he was also a priest .
In one Udasi, they also travelled extensively in Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
They are in the minds of lakhs of people, they are following their teachings with full devotion and are still following it.
A few days ago approximately 85 countries Rai Baris had gone from Delhi to Amritsar .
Where Amritsar was visited to visit the Golden Temple , Guru Nanak Devji was presented in the year 550 .
Not only visiting the Golden Temple of all these people there , but also got the opportunity to know about Sikh traditions , culture .
I hope that Guru Nanak Devjis 550th Prakashotsava will give more inspiration to bring their thoughts and ideals into our lives.
Once I salute Guru Nanak Devji by bowing my head once .
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you all will remember October 31st.
If you read about the work style of Sardar Saheb , then how strong is their planning .
Thousands of delegates from across the country are required to attend the Congress in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the administrations of the museum were on the Sardar Patel .
They also used the occasion to improve the water supply network in the city.
Who has been built without deficiency of water .
Not only this, you will be surprised to know that the people who did not steal the goods and shoes of any representative in the meeting place.
They were contacted with the rails , made Khadi bags .
At the same time the victory of Khadi was also shining .
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for his role in the Constituent Assembly.
They have done an important job of establishing primary rights so that there is no chance of discrimination based on kulan and tradition.
We all know that a great Bhagirathi , historical work has been done by including the first Home Ministry of India , Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute of India .
You know very well that Lakshadweep is a group of some islands .
After the division of India in 1947 our neighbouring country was on Lakshadweep .
He also sent a ship with his flag .
Sardar Patel was immediately informed of the news and took stringent measures without wasting any time.
Starting with the brothers and sisters of Arkat Ramaswami and Arkat Laxmanswami, the Prime Minister said, The people of the country are being encouraged to join the drive and flag off the first tri-colour of Ladakh in Lakshadweep.
Immediately with his order the Trivarna Patan had taken away all the conspiracy of the neighbors who attacked Lakshadweep .
After that he does not want to make all efforts for the development of Lakshadweep .
Today Lakshadweep plays an important role in the progress of India .
It is also an attractive tourist spot.
I believe that you will visit these beautiful islands and sea shores.
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity, the Sardar Patel memorial built on October 31, 2018, has been dedicated to the world.
This is the highest statue of the world .
It is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty in America.
The highest statue of the world is the pride of every Hindu .
On an average, 8500 people visit the Statue of Unity every day.
SardarVallabhbhai Patel, in his address to the nation, has not only instilled faith and devotion in their minds but also has several attractive centres like Cactus Garden, Butterfly Garden, Jangal Safari, Children's Nutrition Park, Ekata Nursery etc.
For the convenience of the tourists, people of many villages are providing homestays in their homes.
We are witnesses to the fact that in just one year, a region is emerging as a world famous tourist destination.
People from the country and abroad come here .
Government has played its role .
Friends, Hindustan could not be proud of the fact that the Time magazine has given the status of the Statue of Unity as one of the top 100 tourist destinations in the world.
I hope that all of you will spend some time in your precious time and go to the Statue of Unity.
My request to every Indian who wishes to travel and stay there for a night will be with his family for at least 15 tourist destinations in India.
Friends, You are well aware of the fact that every year since 2014, 31st October is celebrated as the National Unity Day.
Today, we convey our message of protecting the unity and integrity of our country in any situation.
In the same way on 31 October the arrangement of Ran Fort University is being done .
In the last five years, apart from Delhi, in hundreds of cities of India, in the Union Territories, in the capitals, in the district centres, in small tyres, in 3 cities, a large number of women men and women, citizens, children, youth, divyang, all are joining in large numbers.
However, in today's era, we are seeing an interest and enthusiasm in the Marathon.
Run Fort University is also such a special opportunity .
running mind , brain is beneficial for body .
And that is why not just the body but the mind and culture of India should also take India to new heights for its unity.
Therefore in which city you are located you can know about the Ran Fort University nearby .
I believe that on October 31, you will definitely participate in the run for the unity of India and for your fitness.
My beloved country , Sardar Patel sit in the Ikta Sutra .
The mantra of 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat' is one of our lifelines.In a country full of diversity, we must strengthen oneness at every stage, at every turn, in every society.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been alert and vigilant to address the unity and integrity of the country.
If we look around us, we will find many such examples, those who are constantly working to increase mutual goodwill.
The scientists try to forget those situations according to their benefit in their own way .
How many types of words were spoken to increase excitement in the environment .
Try to increase burning sensation in different voices .
Some scholars , great guests do not know what they are talking to themselves .
It is remembered that what responsible words are spoken .
But this is happening for five days , seven days , ten days , but as soon as the judgment comes, a pleasant and surprising change has been seen in the country .
This was done for two weeks on one hand, but as soon as the verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi has come, the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all communities, saints and saints have expressed solidarity.
Try to reduce efforts in the environment .
But I remember those days even today .
The dignity of the judiciary has been honestly and never let there be any chance of increasing pessimism and heat.
These things should always be kept in mind that they give us strength.
Those days those moments , do us a song .
It is an example that how much energy gives the country .
On the day of getting a big wound of the country .
I also pay my tributes to them today.
My dear countrymen, today, if a story from home tells us a story of every village, from north to south, from east to west, then it tells us a story from the roots of Hindustan that is a clean story.
Every person, every family and every village wants to share their own joyful experiences of cleanliness as the Swachhta efforts are of 100 thirty crore Indians.
Its fruits are also hundred crores of Hindus .
There is an experience of making a happy thrill .
Not only to separate the garbage in it , making that arrangement is also a very important task .
In it , removing the garbage on 130 tonnes around the glacier , how big is the arrangement of delicate living there .
This is also a place where rare species of rare species of snow leopards are located where there are rare animals like Sichin species , sheep , wheat colored bears .
We all know that these Siachen Rivers are clean water sources and glaciers.
Therefore, here the work of swachhata is being done by swachhata that is , by making the people clean the water of the lower areas from here , along with using rivers like nabra and shok .
My dear countrymen, the festival celebrates a new consciousness in the lives of all of us.
The other is Deepavali , especially buying something new , the family of the family keeps on getting less .
I once said that we should try to buy local things only .
If we find the necessary things in our village then we do not have to go to Talku for them.
I once again convey my best wishes to you all on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
We are of various kinds for Deepavali .
But sometimes fire keeps on coming from carelessness .
My many good wishes .
Blessed is many times .
Batt of Mann, September 2018.
There is no Indian who is not proud of our soldiers and our armed forces.
Every Indian, irrespective of caste, creed or language, remains ever ready to convey his happiness and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1.25 billion Indians celebrated the Paraak Parv, and recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016.
When there was a proxy war on our country in the Terracotta then our soldiers gave the form of a surgical strike to their careless way .
How much capacity is there in us , how our soldiers keep on protecting all the countries , by cutting their lives .
Important days such as Paramparak Parv remind us of the heritage of our soldiers who are proud of our soldiers in the youth of our country.
Such days encourage us to uphold our nation's integrity and ethics.
I also participated in an event in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of these heroes.
In the two world wars that took place in the twentieth century, the soldiers of our country offered free sacrifices for the peace of more than one lakh people.
With the purpose of taking care of peace the soldiers of our country are adventurous .
India is also one of the countries where a large number of soldiers are sent to the UN peacekeeping forces.
decade our soldiers play an role in establishing peace in the world wearing blue helmet .
My beloved country , the heavens are unique .
On the 8th day of October we celebrate the air conditioned team day .
In 1932, the tiny air force of six pilots, 19 soldiers, etc., increased.Today, in the twentieth century, our team is one of the most courageous and powerful air force.
In 1965 the soldiers of the enemies had also given the pocket of the race .
Nobody knows about the fight of Bangladesh done in 1971 .
In 1999, the Air Force also played a pivotal role in the rescue of Kargil from the guerrillas.
Our Air Force too has built a bomb in Tiger Hills round the clock.
Be it relief rehabilitation or disaster management, our Air Force personnel are deeply grateful to them for their commendable work.
It is wonderful to see them face all the adversities of nature such as storms, wind waves, floods and storms in the forest.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring gender equality in the country.
Now our Air Force is providing an alternative option to the Patua Permanent Commission with Short Service Commission for Women and I have made this announcement from the Red Fort on 15 August 2018.
Now India will be proud of the fact that womens contribution to the armed forces in the Indian Army is equal with men and women.
The woman of Shakti has also become even today .
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, AbhilashTomy of our navies had fought his death for his life.
How to save him from the country of Yavat ?
You know that Abhlash Tomi is a very adventurous power .
He was the first Indian to surround the world with the help of a small boat, without using any modern technology.
For the past eighty days, he has been moving forward in the sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean, but the terrible sea storm brought him trouble.
But this man of India boating team had spent many days in the sea .
He was a great example of courage, determination and valour, and I spoke to him over phone just a few days ago when he was rescued and brought back to sea.
My dear countrymen, on the 2nd of October, everyone knows what is important for our country.
This year there is a speciality of both October .
From today we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi through many programs throughout the world for one or two years .
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi gave the inspiration of the whole world .
In 1941 Gandhi ji started writing some ideas in the form of a constructive program .
Later on fighting independence in 1945 he made the description of his thoughts .
To save the priests , villages , labor officers , cleanliness , education etc many things have been put in front of the people of the country .
It is also called Gandhi Charter .
This is specially recognized in his personality .
Bapu has understood how important , important necessity of the country .
Then as thy suspicions are being raised, as thy pride melts, it seems to thee.'
This mantra said by Gandhi ji and my dear countrymen, is still important.
Today the middle class of the country is increasing , their economic power is increasing , shopping is increasing .
Remembering the Bapu for a moment when we go to buy something, let us remember this mantra which he said.
Because of shopping of this thing I am giving benefit to any powder in the country .
Who has the pleasure of happiness in the Mughals .
This is his message that I believe that a great change can be brought about through the steps taken by you in the life of the poorest and the most vulnerable person.
Gandhiji said, My dear countrymen, we get freedom from cleanliness.
Although he does not know but India has come to freedom .
For example, in every case, many fishermen have been helped by buying Khadi and fisheries.
All these Khadi clothes are also very difficult but they are not made , they are used each other .
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was a man of conviction, from inside to the mountain.
"Jai Jawan Jai Kisan" is a fine demonstration of the great personality of Annaad Shastri.
And it came to pass , that in the eleventh century he gave victory to the soldiers of his country , to the soldiers of the country .
My dear countrymen, while remembering our revered Bapu today, talking about cleanliness is common.
A movement called Swachhta Hi Sewa was launched on the 15th of September.
Crores of people have participated in this movement and I got the opportunity to work with the children in the school of Ambedkar in Delhi.
Baba Saheb Ambedakar himself had laid the foundation of that school .
People from all walks of life from across the country participated in the Shramdaan on the 15th September 2020.
Come on, let's call a phone call.
I would like to especially thank you on your phone call.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (MGISC) is a global sanitation conference, where sanitation ministers and experts from across the globe are coming together to share their experiences and experiments in this cleanliness conference.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (MGISC) will be held on 2nd October, 2018, with the launch of Bapus 150th birth anniversary celebrations.
If we want to give freedom , peace , peace , justice to the people , then it is specially important .
Several laws have been done for the first huts of the names in the state built by Baba Saheb Ambedkar .
Inspired by that point, on October 12, 1993, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established.
I'm gonna finish the NHRC packages in a few days.
The NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also promoted respect for human rights.
Our former Prime Minister and our beloved leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, had clearly said - Human rights are not acceptable to us.
The motto of our National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is "Sarve Bhawan Sukhinah".
The NHRC has created wide awareness about human rights and has also played a pivotal role in preventing misuse of these rights.
In this journey of the past, NHRC has created an ideal and a trusted environment among the people of the country.
I believe that this is a very promising event for a healthy society and for the best democracy values.
Today, the Commission for Human Rights of 20-6 countries has also been set up along with the work of human rights at the national level.
This is the basis of the idea of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas - Development for all with the help of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
My dear countrymen, in the month of October, is the birth anniversary of Jai Prakash Narayan, and in the same month, the centenary celebrations of the birth of Rajmata Vijayraj Scindia will begin.
I will talk about them in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat but today I definitely want to say this thing - "Run for Unity" on 31st October, which was the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, is being established in every small and big city, in every village and in every village of India.
This time too, in our endeavor, we will set up this 'Run for Unity' in every small and big city, in every village and in every village.
The 'Run for Unity' program is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb.
On October 31, through the 'Run for Unity', we will strengthen our efforts to unite all the sections of the society and all the regions of the country.
This is the same place which we gave him .
My dear countrymen, on the auspicious occasion of Navratri, Durga Puja or Vijayadashmi, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all of you.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
India celebrates the pious festival of Raksha Bandhan today.
Best wishes to all the people of the country on this auspicious occasion.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a symbol of the love and affection between brothers and sisters and the belief that everyone is on one another.
This festival also serves as a great example of social harmony.
The entire atmosphere is filled with the joys of elephants, horses and palanquins - Shri Krishnaki Jai, Govind and Govind.
Bhagwani Chinmai , Bhavani culture - question .
Friends, on Shravana Purnima, along with Raksha Bandhan, we also celebrate Sanskrit language day.
I congratulate all those who are preserving and decorating this great heritage and providing it to the common man.
Every language has its own grandeur .
Tamil language is the oldest language in the world and it is a matter of pride for all the people of the country.
It is science , technology , agricultural science , health science , sculpture , Jyotishstra , Ganesha science , management , economic science , environment .
Karnataka: People living in Maturu village of Shivamoga district still speak in Sanskrit language.
His Jayanti is celebrated throughout the country on the day of meditation .
I convey my greetings and good wishes to all the teachers of the country on the occasion of Teachers Day.
Along with this science , education , students have impressed your contribution .
My dear countrymen, this rainy season brings a lot of hope to our farmers working hard.
The dry trees , plants , dry rivers .
But sometimes this rainy season also brings the floods that cause immense damage .
At some places less rains , at some places more rains are naturally rained .
The dangers leaving behind them are unfortunate .
But when dangers are happening then what is the meaning of humanity .
We all know that the soldiers of the warriors running in Kerala are the soldiers of the warriors .
They did not leave any opportunity to save those stuck in the flood .
Air Force, Navy, Army, BSF, CISF, RAF, everybody has played an important role in the rescue and relief efforts.
I would especially like to mention about the hard-work of the NDRF personnel, who have helped a lot in these difficult times.
Every Indian has to pay attention to the capacity of the NDRF and its commitment and efforts to keep the situation under control.
Ninnar is the festival of Onam .
We pray that the festival of Onam gives strength to the country, especially the state of Kerala, to come out of this crisis as soon as possible, so that the state of Kerala can progress rapidly.
I believe that the people of Kerala , the people of the country , the whole country is with them , the whole country is with them .
My dear countrymen, this time when I see suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, it is a matter of great concern for me.
They're about Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
In his message, many others including Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, and Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, and many others spoke to me on the Narendra Modi App and My Gautam through their different perspectives on the life of Atal ji.
On the sixteenth day of August the world of listening to the death of Atal Ji is drowned in the Shokadra of the country .
And he was a great governor , which left the fourteen years old , and left the eleventh prime minister .
In a way he went away from the active politics of the past teeth .
People have made him a good parlor , a delicate creature , a great word , a beloved leader .
The country will be indebted to Atal Ji for bringing good governance in the lives of people.
We always remain grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Constitution Amendment Act in 2003.
The amendment has brought about two major changes in the Indian politics.
The first change is that the number of mantras in the states is limited to fifteen percent in the number of sectors .
Atal Garh changed it .
That is why the forests of money were played .
Therefore the job has increased .
It is due to the visionary like Atal ji that this situation has changed and healthy traditions have begun to grow in our political culture.
Atal Garh is a true country .
During the entry of the budget in his administration changed .
Initially, according to the tradition of the British, during the time of parliament in London, the evening used to enter the budget.
In 2001 Atal ji changed the time of the evening to 11 o'clock in the morning .
In the same way you are watching the churches of the state , central centres once in the country .
This is a good contribution for delivery .
Healthy democracy, good democracy, good traditions, constant work to strengthen democracy and unbiased discussions and so on, etc. will also be our best tribute to Atal ji.
The job of the work in the Lok Sabha is eighteen percent , the work of the state is seventy four percent .
These rainy seasons in the Parliament will always be remembered as social justice and development conferences of the youth.
In these meetings, several important bills for the youth and the backward classes have been approved.
Like the decade of the decade of the decade of the decade of the decade of the S . . . .
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has fulfilled the pledge to set up the O-Mughal Commission this time.
One state has given it power and the goal of social justice will be taken forward.
That is why the parlor of parlor has entered hard training by entering the parlor of parlor .
According to this apart from the iniquities who do the iniquities not only the teeth of education , in twelve girls the girls were executed .
Just a few days ago, you must have read in newspapers, after just two months of interrogation of a judge in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh, two criminals were found guilty of rape in the case of a minor girl.
Earlier, in a judge at Kathani in Madhya Pradesh, only five days after the trial, the culprits were found guilty.
Even in Rajasthan, the judiciary has taken some such fast decisions.
This place plays an important role in stopping the unrighteousness done on women , girls .
When we move forward for the welfare of the nation, we can bring about a change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the oppressed and the deprived.
In the rainy season everybody has kept an ideal ideal place together .
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the members of Parliament in the country.
My dear countrymen, these days, the attention of crores of people is being paid to the Asian Games in Jakarta.
The films of Asia are still happening .
I tell all the players of the country ready for the country .
India's bright future will be built only when India is fit.
I once again congratulate the winners of the Asian Games and want to see the best performances by other players.
Everybody 's national year is the contribution of the national year .
Not only this, the whole country remembers him with great respect and self-confidence.
We will celebrate 15th September as Engineers Day.
Our country engineers running in their steps have their own identity in the world .
In Kutch it is called Bhonu .
These houses have seen three earthquake .
But if you see any harm happening at some place .
This house was built according to the weather here , nature according to the environment .
He said, I am proud to hear that centuries ago, engineers at that time had done such things to ensure that the common man lives safely.
Now when we are celebrating Engineers Day, we should also think of our future.
Keep a work shop at every place .
In changing times we learn some new things .
What should be taught to the students .
Then meet .
In the middle of this very place rains are coming very well .
At some places maximum rains are also coming .
In some places people are waiting for rains because of no rains .
The humans were able to bring resistance with nature .
That is why sometimes nature gets tired on us .
Therefore we have the responsibility of protecting nature , nature .
Twelve junior football players in Thailand went to a cave for their coach tour.
Normally it takes some hours to go into that cave , to come out .
But the decision of that day is the second way .
There is no way to come out , they stay near a small pocket situated inside the cave .
Not only in one , two days , but in one way it was like that for eight days .
On the one hand they are fighting the menace, on the other hand, the entire world has exhibited the human values shared by Lord Buddha.
The people of the world have prayed to come out safely .
These children were stuck where they were stuck , in what situation they try to know .
How to take out the water if they do not save them in time then it is possible to bring them out during the rainy season .
With the point of view of fortune they were safe , as soon as the message came , all the world had enjoyed .
But I kept in mind how this protection program was done .
The complete responsibility found in every level is marvellous .
The government , parents of children , their family members , media , people of the country , everyone has done wonderfully .
In this entire behavior a Jawan of the Royal Navy lost his life .
It is enough to work by keeping mind on our goal with calm , stable mind .
Just a few days ago, Neeraj ji had left us a favorite poet of our country.
Even our Indians can give a lot of strength and inspiration to every aspect of Neeraj ji.
This is the time of the start of the art galleries .
Youth will step into the most important part of their lives for the coming July, where their vision will move from question to cut-off.
The focus of the students changes from home to hospital.
The students come under the shadow of professors from the shadow of their parents .
It is my belief that my young friends keep giving their college life very happy , enthusiasm .
For the first time, it is time to get out of the house, get out of the village, get separated from a safe environment, and become guilty.
Many youngsters leave their homes for the first time and come out to give a new direction to their lives.
I tell you all that stay peaceful , spend life happily , enjoy your conscience in life .
Small friends are priceless .
But to choose new friends , to include friends , to keep those friends standing so much that they have to do very knowledge .
Learn new experts , new languages .
A student from a poor family in Madhya Pradesh who crossed all the difficult competitions in his life.
Jodhpur AIIMS Taluka has achieved victory in the first attempt of MBBS .
His father played the task of his father ' s garbage , and fed his family .
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a news item appeared to me that two youngsters came together to fulfil the dreams of Modi.
It has been seen in the internal reading that today our youth technology is using knowledge , creatively how is trying to bring change in the life of a common person .
I am discussing with the Indian youth once in the city of Sanzoj, which is called the technology hub of America.
I want them to think about how they can use their talent for India, take time and do something for the country.
Using their professional expertise, both of them have developed a smart gauge app.
This app will not only connect the people of the village with the whole world but will also be available on their own mobile if they need any further advice and advice.
In a way, this app is trying to bring about a digital revolution in the village and it has become easier to record, track and monitor the progress of the village.
The App has a village phone directory, news department, list of upcoming events, health centre and information centre.
In order to find out the FACT rate among the rural farmers of this app, it is proposed to be used in the form of a market place for their produce.
If you look closely at this thing then one thing is understood that the youth of America are leading a life in the midst of the lifestyle and the thoughts of that place.Even though they had left India many years ago, they kept in mind even the smallest things in their village, they understood the challenges and were deeply attached to their village.
That is why they can do something like that only .
This relation with your village, with its roots, is a penance for the country and it is natural for every Indian to do something.
But sometimes due to time, distance and circumstances a thin twig is formed on it, but if someone touches it with a small twig then all the inner things come up again.
Pandar is a sacred village of Solapur district of Maharashtra.
A fortnight of Asadha Ekadashi, twelve days ago, along with Varkari i.e. pilgrims and palanquins will set out on foot for Padur pilgrimage.
This journey is called Waterfall in which devotees participate in lacs of numbers .
Keeping in the palanquin of great saints like Gyaneshwar, Tukaram, etc., Vitthal, Vitthal, dancing, playing musical instruments and walking on foot to Pandharpur.
Pilgrimages or Vithoba or Pandurang reach there for a visit to Vithal Bhagwan .
The Lord Viththal protects the poor , trembling , victims .
There are immense devotion , devotion among the people of Maharashtra , Karnataka , Goa , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana .
Going to Vithhoba temple in Pandharpur, a unique experience of its majesty, beauty and spiritual bliss.
If possible then I want to feel the experience of Pandarpur once .
Innumerable saints like Jnaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ram Das, Tukaram are still training common people in Maharashtra.
We get a message of goodwill, love and brotherhood through their famous folk songs like Bharud or Abhanga.
Because of this the society of the society of the society is available to fight against the superstitions .
The power to see their mistakes for the British rulers is in him .
The English were so afraid that in twenty years they try to estimate Rajdroh thrice in twenty years .
This is not a small thing .
Today, I would like to share an interesting incident of a Tilak statue in Lokmanya Tilak, Ahmedabad.
He said that on August 1, 1920, the statue of Lokmanya Tilak was to be installed in Ahmedabad, after his death.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was selected as the Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and he selected Victoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak ji, which is the queen of Britain.
In the end the statue was built . Sardar Garh had built that statue besides anyone , on 28 February 1929 Mahatma Gandhi Giri .
The most important thing is that in his address to the accident council, Bapu had said that after coming to Sardar Patel, not only one person was found in Ahmedabad city but also the construction of Tilak ji's statue was possible because of his dharamshala.
Due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak, the tradition of mass Ganesh festivals has started.
The Commemorative Ganesh Festivals have become an effective medium to take forward the traditional reverence, celebration and social well-being, togetherness and equality of people.
It is evident from the fact that even today, our youth has a great interest in the history of our ancient heritage and of our brave leaders.
Today in many cities we see to worship the idols of Ganesh in approximately every street .
Pujas are organized together in that street with one team .
This is a great opportunity for our youth to learn the qualities of leadership, leadership, leadership etc.
Good milk , development fruits are given to every Indian .
He also sacrificed his life with the resolve to breathe freely.
I am talking about Chandra Shekhar Azad .

Chandrashekhar Azad had inspired many youths for freedom , for independence .
Azad put his life at stake and never cared for his foreign rule.
Just a few days ago, in the Junior Under-20 World Athlete Championship in Finland, India's courageous Ribbed Hima Das won the gold medal in the 400m race.
Another player from the country, Ekta Bhan, has received an e-mail from Indonesia where she is also known as the Asian Games.

In Tunisia the world 's Para Athletex Grand Select 2018 the golden plate , cosmetics were spent .
She was special because she changed her problem in the middle of her victory .
In a road accident that occurred in 2003, half of the body and the lower part of the body were destroyed but the girl did not accept Ootami.
I salute Ekata Bhawan ji, Yogesh Kathuria ji, Sunder Singh Garu and all of them for their courage and inspiration.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is historically full of events and festivals, but due to the weather, sometimes unhealthy ones keep entering the house.
I wish you all the best for the months of August , which inspires the country's devotion , and many festivals which have been happening for centuries .
Once again we will definitely meet in Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat' June 2018
A historical cricket match has been done in Bangalore for some days .
You will understand that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan water .
This is the first international match for Afghanistan and it is a matter of pride for every Indian that this match is with our Indian team.
I am reminded of Afghanistan President Shri Ashraf Ghanis words on "The people of Afghanistan are deeply proud of their hero Rashid Khan".
I am also indebted to our Indian friends for providing a platform to these athletes for their talent.
Rashid is the representative of the best talent in Afghanistan.
Cricket is the only contribution of the world .
On taking trophy the hair of Indian team had also taken two trafffee mixed on the platform for the first time .
We can know what is this incident .
Sports is a unique way to unite the society , to give a glimpse of the talent of our youth , to discover them .
India , Afghanistan two waters .
In future also we hope to play with each other in the future .
My dear countrymen, on the 21st of June, on the 4th International Day of Yoga, I had a lively view.
Even in the high snowy peaks of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China have together practiced yoga.
Yoga is spread all the borders of yoga , everyone is celebrated .
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have turned the occasion into a big celebration, forgetting the essence of caste, creed, region and gender.
Yoga Day is celebrated with great enthusiasm across the world and why do not people of our country celebrate it with double enthusiasm.
The soldiers of our country , on the ground , on the ground , on the ground , 125 crore people were able to practice yoga at three places in the sky .
Some of them are practicing yoga in the water reservoir, some are practicing yoga in the snowy mountains of Siachen .
Our air warriors made Yogasanas at a height of fifteen thousand feet in the sky and made it the identity of all .
Apart from sitting in the air the view of yogasanas while moving in the air is worth seeing .
Schools, art galleries , offices , parks , high buildings , fields of games have been practiced everywhere .
A view of Ahmadabad is very interesting .
Around 750 Divyang brothers and sisters have created a world record by practicing yoga at one place .
Yoga has done the work of uniting the people around the world by crossing the kulal, religious and geographical boundaries.
We have always believed in the idea of VasudhaivaKutumbakam that our sages, saints and saints have always been there for centuries.
Yoga has been seen properly .
We are those who worship mother as Lord and consider mother as equal to God.
Only by reducing diseases the role of doctor does not end .
Today, there is a deep understanding and experience of what will be the impact of medical science on the health of our doctors as well as on the general way of life.
Indian doctors have proved their identity in the entire world with their capacity and expertise.
Our Indian doctors have recognized the problems of clinical management along with industry as well as complex medical problems .
Through Mann Ki Baat, I convey my best wishes to all our medical friends on the occasion of Doctors Day on the 1st of July.
My dear countrymen, how lucky we were to be born on this land of India.
In the history of our country there is no historical event of any historical event in the history of India , there is no day .
Every country in India has its own heritage.
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th day .
When I was working in Kabirwad in Gujarat, I organized a national conference with some people who followed the Kabir tradition.
You know why Kabir Das Ji had gone to Maghar?
There was a belief that the death of Maghar would reach heaven.
It is believed that by doing body sacrifice in Kashi the heaven goes .
Maghar was seen as unclean and Satpurush Kabir Das Ji did not believe it.
He tried to destroy the superstitions of the superstitions present in his life .
Therefore he went to Maghar and buried there .
Kabirdas has dedicated social equality , peace , civilization through his crafts .
This is his ideal .
We see this ideal in his writings.
In these days also they are inspired with us .
One of his poems is Kabir Soi Pir Hai, Joe Jane Pirjo Parjo Parjo Janhi, So Kar Peer Meer. That is, he who understood the pain of others is a true saint.
Kabir Das Garud has shown special attention to the social civilization .
He was more thinking about the future than his time .
There are other such gurus - Jagdguru - Bhagwan Guru Nanak .
It has been giving inspiration for centuries .
They said , The service of the poor , Nirvas , God is our service to God .
We are going to celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Lord Guru Nanak in 2019.
I want to participate in this festival with all our enthusiasm .
It is a world full of sacrifices in Leh .
There is a history engraved with Punjab.
The Jalianwala Bagh incident that had taken place in the memory of the 2019 incident, will be completed by 2019.
Who can forget that dark day of 1919 , April 13 , day .
During the reign of English , Kolkata University is the first time in the language of bathing festival .
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
The first industrial policy of independent India coming in 1948 , his thoughts , his philosophy .
Among the factories established by Mukherjee ji are Chittaranjan Locomotive Works Factory, Hinsendri Fertilizer Factory, Damodar Valley Corporation - these are the four most successful projects.
In the rest of the River Valley projects also Dr . Shyam Prasad Mukharji 's residence is a big help .
People spoke about their resolutions, their happiness, and their convenience.
One of the sisters of Chhattisgarh who have been making ice cream with them is the Sita Falls.
Like Anjana Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters from across the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and delivering quality medicines at their doorsteps.
A young man from West Bengal who is working for 2-3 years is now making his business successful .
Besides this ten - fifteen people are giving jobs .
In the schools of Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa, students are working on important issues like management with waste material in the Tinkering Lab of the school at a very young age.
There are so many stories in the country that people dont have to tell about their success stories in the country.
In such a situation, if the common man talks about the incidents happening in his life with new hopes and enthusiasm then it is not the importance of the government.
Incidents of a small child in the small village situated in Maru can also give inspiration to hundreds of crores of people of the country .
I am indebted to the people of the country.
40,50,000 people participated in this video bridge and gave me new energy.
Once again I am telling you that I am indebted to all of you.
We can enjoy the aroma of this goodness .
A few days ago one thing came to me and it's a great coincidence.
This includes engineers and professionals on one side, and our farmer brothers and sisters on the other hand, who are engaged in agriculture.
Those farmers who have not yet grown the same variety of crops in their fields, have not been able to grow much of the crops and have not been able to get much of the benefits today they are growing vegetables and they are also getting good benefits of marketing through the Trust.
The farmers who cultivate wheat are also associated with this trust.
A sea-bank has also been prepared specially for the increase of fruits , its proper quality seeds .
Once again, I congratulate the youth of this country for their experiment, for their knowledge, for their unknown, for their unknowing public, and for their persistent efforts and efforts for the welfare of crores of people.
One Nation, One Tax is the dream of the people of the country.
One Nation, One Tax Responsible I would like to congratulate the states only if one had to congratulate them.
GST is a great example of Cooperative Federalism and all the states have come together to take a decision for the benefit of the country whereas such a big tax reform has been implemented in the country.
But the decisions taken by the GST Council so far have also been taken with full consent.
There were 17 different types of taxes in the country before the GST, but after the system was created, only one tax came into effect in the entire country.
Before this many times in the country films were coming on Ajamishi in the matter of teeth .
The entire process from return to refund will be done online through information technology.
But the enthusiasm and zeal of the true people of the country and the zeal with which the people have participated and this new tax regime has not only kept its place in a single year but has also changed the requirements through its inbuilt system.
My dear countrymen, once again, I will be waiting for the Mann Ki Baat programme to come forward to meet you and talk to you on another occasion.
Many good wishes to you all .
Man Ki Bat , May 2018 .
Greetings!
Once again I got the opportunity to come forward through Mann Ki Baat.
It is said that all of you will remember that six women of the Navika team of the Navy are doing the creator of the sea for some months .
I would like to talk about this journey which was undertaken with the name of Navika Sagar Parikrama.
They decided to sail around 20,000 nautical miles in different oceans and seas.
This is the first incident of the world .
Last Wednesday I got the opportunity to know their experiences together .
Five tribal students from Ashram, Chandrapur in Maharashtra - Manisha Dhur, Pramesh Alay, Umakat Madvi, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam Veerta scaled the highest peak in the world on May 16.
The Prime Minister said, These youngsters, who have been selected through the Mission Shaurya, have proved that the entire country is proud of the Everest.
I am told that the school of Chandrapur is Sibni , the heart of these little friends and many congratulations .
In the middle itself there remained a very old Indian woman who had climbed Everest from Shivangi Pathak to Nepal .
There are many opinions of Shivaji .
The first Indian father of the climber of Ajit Bazaj , his mother Diia AIDS was given the first Indian father - Kut .
Only youths have not been anywhere .
This is a very peaceful work .
At the same time it shows their responsibility of cleanliness , environment .
Many people try to climb the AIDS , in which some of them were fulfilled this work as well .
I convey my heartiest congratulations to all these brave-hearts, especially to the children.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, two months ago, when I talked about Fit India, I didn't expect that much more.
It is not considered that in such a large number people of every place do not consider it massage .
When I talk about Fit India, I believe that how much we play , the whole country plays more .
In social meditation people participate the videos of fitness .
One of them is taking a taxi to each other .
Everybody is participating in the proposal of this fitness India .
Whether it is in the film sector, whether it is in the sports sector or the prominent personalities of the country, the soldiers of the army, school teachers or on all sides have heard the same call - "If we are fit, the country will be fit".
My dear countrymen, many times in Mann Ki Baat, I have been talking about sports, games and some other camp through me.
Recently, the medal winners of the Commonwealth Games shared their views with us through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Thank you, Mr. Yadav, thank you for calling you phone.
Some games that have become a part of every street and every child's life, are slowly getting over today.
There was a special place in the summer holidays of these games .
Once in the ribs , once in the night after eating at the same time all the children used to play all these games for hours without worry , without worry .
Some games were playing with the whole family .
The oneness hidden in diversity of our country is also seen in these games .
One game is known by various names in various places .
Is it not the vehicle of Gujarat where there is a game called Chomal Isti (Ashta-Champa).
It's playing with 88 square boards, with chimneys, or diss.
This game was played in approximately every state .
It is called Chowkabara in Karnataka, it is known as Atta in Madhya Pradesh, Pakidakali in Kerala, Champakulam in Maharashtra, Dayam in Tamil Nadu, Thiam Ani in Tamil Nadu, Lochangapo in Rajasthan.
This game is called Guti-Billa or Karra-Billa in Andhra Pradesh .
Gulbadi in Orissa is called Anini , Maharashtra .
There is a time for playing some games .
There is also a time to fly the wind.
That is, how to achieve goals, how to build strength, how to learn team spirit, how to provide mutual cooperation, etc.
If we play these games together with parents , mothers , mothers , mothers , mothers of children then the international waves also stop .
At the same time we also know our culture , traditions .
Many sports give us information about society , environment etc .
Come forward in the schools , streets , youth and encourage these games .
Through crowd sourcing we can make our traditional sports a very big storehouse .
My dear countrymen, India will officially host the World Environment Day Celebrations on June 5th.
Keeping this in mind, we must ensure that all of us are not using polythene bags or grade polythene bags.We should try to minimize the adverse effect of plastic pollution on our nature, wildlife and our health.
On World Environment Day, let us visit the website of www.india.gov.in 2018 to see and learn many interesting suggestions received there and try to make them part of your daily lives.
Be compassionate towards nature , protect nature .
Stay in our culture .
In the last few weeks, sand storms have wreaked havoc in various parts of the country.
All these are also really changes occurring in the sample of environment , their results .
Our culture , our tradition has not taught us to discover with nature .
We should be in harmony with nature and be connected with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had dedicated this thing at every step of his life .
Today, while talking about climate justice of India, playing a leading role in COP21 and Paris agreements, the whole world has been placed on one trinity through the International Solar Alliance, behind all this there is a thought of fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this environment day, let us think about what we can do to make our planet clean and green.
In this direction we can walk ahead .
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have you remembered 21st June well
Not only you , the whole world will remember 21 June .
Because of yoga it encourages us to save our father .
When all these qualities are drowned in each other then Yogi gets victory on all kinds of emotions .
Once again I would like all the people of the country to take forward our traditional yoga practice.
In the year 1857 in this month our Indians showed their success to the English .
Our soldiers and farmers in many parts of the country are displaying their valour, in the face of injustice.
It is a matter of sadness that we have to say that only 1857 incidents of 1857 incidents of 1857 incidents have been rebellious .
But in reality not only is it an attempt to underestimate the incident, it is also an attempt to injure our own self.
Veer Savarkar ji had said with courage , this was not just a rebellion in 1857 but also a struggle for our first independence .
Savar Garden is a personality of many specialities .
He worshipped both the operations , hospitals .
We remember the victory of his victory , the brush of his rule against his rule .
But apart from all this, he is a poet, social reformer and always gave strength to the feeling of harmony and unity.
Our beloved Excellency Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had said that there is a great deal about Savarkar ji.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji has done the right painting.
Savarkar Garden walked both with poet , cranti .
Today, when the poor learns to do something, they are clothed in cloth to cover their bodies.
I wish to tell the bright future of these children full of hope , belief .
They have proved that if there is a desire to conduct something , if there is strong determination , then victory can also be achieved in the midst of many difficulties .
This is not just about the Sikar region, but every corner of India, you will get to see many such things.
If you pay attention to your area and the surroundings then how people will be able to overcome their difficulties.
If we enjoy tea standing near any tea tree , taste of tea , then people who are talking to the guests , their churches , opinions , examinations .
It is said that if a person running tea is giving electricity to more than seventy children then you will be surprised .
A school named 'Ashwan' was started for the children living in Bastion and Puri huts.
The education , health , food habits of all the children coming to the school completely .
Who does not know the word ' Jyotirgamia ' .
But we saw that word alive .
There are such inspiring incidents around you as well .
There are many types .
Come , let us move ahead with the beauty .
In some days people wait for the moon .
Chandra Kanbad is that the meaning of this festival can be celebrated .

Along with India 71 other countries of the world participate in these games .
In such a big program thousands of sports participating in it , how much environment can be able to imagine there .
Enthusiastic zeal, zeal, enthusiasm, hope, aspiration and achievement are the hallmarks of such an environment that no one can afford to miss.
India recorded games in shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis, badminton, etc.
India won 26 gold medals, 20 silver medals and around 66 medals on offer.
This victory is a matter of pride for every Indian.
Adventurous games also have the pride of pride , happiness .
This is an extremely glorious festival for the entire country and for the entire country.
After the completion of the match, the athletes who were coming to India from all over the world were standing there with medals, covering the entire spectrum of our country and listening to our national anthem, this feeling of happiness, joy, pride and honour is unparalleled.
There is no word with me to express the feelings like unconsciousness .
But I have heard from these players and would like to tell you that too.
I am proud .
Specially because this time many things have been done again .
Do you know that this time all the wrestling contestants from India and abroad who have participated in the Commonwealth Games have won medals

The last edition of the tournament was attended by two Indian players, Sena Nehru, P.K.
All the people of the country have seen this game very interesting .
The athletes who had come to participate in the Games had come from different parts of the country and from smaller cities.
They have faced so many hardships and problems that they are facing today, their goals and their lives, their parents, their guardians, coaches or support staff.
In all the situations standing with them there is also the support of their friends keeping their courage standing with them .
I am very happy to participate in this park .
Many people have responded to it and shared their fitness mantras and Fit India stories in social media.
Shashikant Bhosale ji has said that along with his painting my body , my basic substance , water of my body , this is my world .
Ruma Devnath is Ramsar , because of Marning walk I am very healthy , happy .
She is still saying For me- fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, when the sea is full.
There is no doubt in meeting the joy of Devnath Garu , fitness .
Dhaval President . He does not come to participate his trekking experiences that trekking , trekking in my sight is India .
It gives me great pleasure to see many distinguished people enthused with the spirit of Fit India.
Sini artist Akshay Kumar Twitter also shared a video.
He told us that exercise is beneficial for the muscles of back , stomach .
In the second video famous video he was seen playing Valibal .
Many youngsters joined the Fit India App and shared their experiences.
Such campaigns are beneficial for all of us , the whole country as well .
The other important thing that I say is that the expensive Fit India Movement is Yoga.
Yoga has a special place in the Fit India campaign.
I think you are also going in that direction .
The International Day of Yoga (IDY) celebrated on 21st June 2020 has been adopted the world over.
You can also make it from now on.
Not only this, every one of you, your city, your village, your area, your school, your college, any age, man or woman, should try to make Yoga active.
I have received a lot of publicity in the midst of the anemia video made of yoga .
I appreciate the people who have to do a vacination , which is done by an anemia .
You will also benefit from this .
Many youths are using their time to learn some new thing in this center .
Internship is a new experience.
Therefore, outside the four walls, one gets a chance to experience the right experiences to lead a new life away from the penu ketum and computer.
My young friends, today I invite you for a special internship.
A Swachh Bharat Summer Internship-2018 was inaugurated by the Department of Sports, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India in association with three departments.
On the 2nd of October, we will be satisfied to know what we did before the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi ji.
I once again invite the students and the youth to take advantage of this internship.
You can register with MyGov for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
By participating in it, we hope that our youth will take forward the campaign of 'Swachh Bharat'.
You must send information about your Tallu , write stories , send pictures , send videos .
Come on.
For a new experience , to learn something we use these ruins .
My dear countrymen, whenever I get the opportunity, I would definitely watch the Good News India programme in Doordarshan, I would urge the people of the country to watch it.
Together with this youth group a big proposal has been done for the study of the children living in the streets , dirt .
Initially they were able to see the situations of children who were hungry on roads , doing small tasks , seeing the situations of children living , so much that they were standing in such creative work .
Starting with fifteen children of Mukwari situated near Geeta Colony in Delhi this campaign has now joined two thousand children in twelve places in the capital .
The youth and trainers associated with this campaign are spending two hours of their daily routine, trying to change the society.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have worked to motivate all the farmers across the country.
They changed their place apart from their incidents with their incidents .
Bageshwar in Uttarakhand mainly produces wheat, horticultural crops, corn, barley etc.
Because of being a hilly area the rails do not get the right price of these fruits .
The rails of Kapkot region have discovered the way to increase the price of girls directly in the market .
Because of the excess of iron ore in all these fruits, these iron ore rich biscuits are very useful for pregnant women .
In Munnar village all these rails were organised a government institute where the factory of making these biscuits were opened .
Looking at the courage of the farmers, the government has also linked this institute to the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM).
Now besides about fifty anganwari centres of Bageshwar district apart from Almora , Kausani .
My dear countrymen, we hear that in the future there will be wars for water in the world.
Everybody says this but nobody is responsible .
The conservation of water is that social responsibility of social responsibility .
How should we pay attention to the cost of one rain ?
We all know that water conservation is not a new thing for all Indians.
Not only the subject of books but the beauty of language is not a subject .
Our ancestors had seen it for centuries .
We know how much importance they give every drop of water .
In the protection of one drop of water they saw new solutions .
If one of you has a chance to go to Tamilnadu then in the big edicts built in some temples there the arrangement of water conservation , water conservation system , dry management will be done .
If you go to temples like Manar Koval, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai then you will find big inscriptions from all the places.
Even today, we are familiar with various stepwells in the tourist places, but we should not forget that all these are living examples of the efforts made by our ancestors for water conservation.
Adalaj Digvavi from Gujarat and Patan Rani Digvavi from Patan have been identified as the World Heritage Sites of UNESCO.
If you want to say one another then the temples of water .
If you go to Rajasthan then definitely see Chand Bawadi in Jodhpur .
The budget for employment will also help in conserving this water.
In the last three years, everyone has made their own efforts towards water conservation and water management.
An average expenditure of Rs. 32,000 crore has been incurred on water conservation and water management from the budget allocated for each year's employment.
About 2017-18, I have spent 55 of the total amount of 64 thousand crore rupees i.e. about 35 thousand crore rupees on water conservation works.
In the last three third three years 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted more by such water conservation , water conservation methods .
The government of India has used the resources of providing employment for water conservation and water management in a very beneficial manner.
But in Uttar Pradesh and in some other places, in Fatehpur district, two small rivers like Sasur Kheri, etc. have dried up.
The whole of the district headquarters has put the India to take care of soil , water conservation programs in a large area .
With the help of the people of about 40 - 45 villages this dried stork river has been restored .
This record of using animals , birds , rails , fields , villages is a victory full of blessings .
Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore is a person of complete personality full of understanding .
When there was an opportunity to hear poems like Anand Loke, Aanganer, Poroshmani, etc., there was a lot of consciousness in our minds.
Ravindra music also affects you , how much their poets .
I am dedicating the unique Anjali of Rabindranath Tagore.
The month of Ranjan is celebrated with complete devotion , pride .
The estimation of fasting is that if man is hungry himself then it is not understood that his hunger is not understood .
If he is thirsty then the thirst of others is understood .
This is the time to remember the education , message of Pigbar Mohammad Sahib .
It is our responsibility to walk on the ways of equality , brotherhood .
Therefore donation is given in the month of sacred Ranjan .
My dear countrymen, Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud of the path shown by Lord Buddha and have shown the path of compassion, service and sacrifice to millions across the globe.
Once again, the responsibility of all of us to follow the path shown by Lord Buddha, to travel on the path shown by him, to resolve, to walk on, and to remember this Buddha Purnima.
Buddha Bhagwan is the inspiration of equality , peace , peace , brotherhood .
The need of such human values is more in the world today.
Dr . Baba Saheb .
Ambedkar Ji was an inspiration from Lord Buddha in his social philosophy.
There is no important example of Karnataka .
One of the most important qualities that Lord Buddha has shown to the people suffering from such compassion.
In many countries like China , Japan , Korea , Thailand , Cambodia , Myanmar etc . this Buddhist tradition , Buddhist teachers are included in their roots .
It gives me great pleasure to partner India in the revival of many Buddhist temples, including the magnificent Ananda Temple of centuries ago located in Bagan in Myanmar.
I pray that Lord Buddha bless the entire world to build a peaceful , compassionate world with the blessings of Buddha .
Today, while remembering Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of Lord Buddha and said that the statues of Lord Buddha are also a matter of great fortune.
On that day also Buddha is complete .
On May 11, 1998, Molecular experiments were carried out at Pokhran in Rajasthan on the western borders of India.
To say one another India has displayed its strength in the areas of science and technology .
This day is etched in the history of India, in the form of a military-power demonstration.
Lord Buddha saw the world as to how important is the inner strength of the inner strength .
Similarly, when we stand as a strong nation, we will be peaceful with all.
In the month of May 1998, it was not only important for the country to conduct molecular experiments, but it was important to know how it was done.
India has seen the world as a land full of some great scientists, a land which has proved to be a strong leadership that India can achieve new milestones and new heights every day.
Atal Bihar Vajpai had given the mantra of Jai Jawan , Jai Kisan , Jai science .
This time we are going to be successful in the twenty years since the launch on 11th May, 1998.On this occasion, we should resolve to contribute to the making of a modern India, to make a strong India and to make an effective India, with the help of Atal ji's Jai Vigyan Mantra.
Give your capacity to India 's capacity .
Bat , March 2018 .
These are the festivals of Shriramvami .
On this festive occasion of Rama Navami, let us resolve to follow Shri Ram's ideals in our lives.
We saw at every moment in the life of the worshipped Bapu .
On the 26th of January 26th January when all the countries of Asia came here then they brought their cultural groups with them .
Most of the countries of them are proud to exhibit Ramayana here .
That is, Rama and Ramayana have not only inspired and influenced our country, but also all the Asian countries in the world.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, this time too, in large numbers, I have received answers, e-mails, phone calls, jaundice, etc.
I read that you are trying to teach Sanskrit language courses through online mode at Komal Thakur Garuda, My Gauop.
Despite being in Tingrang also it is very happy to see the love of culture language .

Manki Bat February 2018 .
This question has given an important scientist to our modern India .
When we talk about science then before India Sir C . .
His research is famous by the name of Raman Effect .
On one side there is a tradition of the main Ganesha scientist Bodhisattva , Bhaskar , Brahmagupta , Aryabhat etc .
On the other hand Sushma , Charaka is our pride in the therapy .
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose, Har Govind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose have made India proud.
The name of the famous particle BOSSON has also been named after Satyendranath Bose .
Today, I got the opportunity to attend an event in Mumbai - the invitation to inaugurate the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It is very interesting to know about the wonders happening in science .
Through Artificial Intelligence, Robots, Bots and many more can be used for manufacturing.
The machines in this center also increase the intelligence on their own .
This technology is useful for improving the lives of many poor, innocent and needy.
Can I get any help from Artificial Intelligence to make the lives of our Divyang brothers and sisters better
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit Ahmedabad in Gujarat along with the Prime Minister of Israel for the inauguration of the I-Create.
I saw a design made of a young man there .
I think we can use Artificial Intelligence in many ways.
The price of science and technology is permanent .
They do not have any price on their own .
Every instrument does the work of how we want .
But through instrument we do any work which depends on us .
The goal of human here is very important .
Science should not only be used for the welfare of human beings but it should also be used to climb the pinnacle of excellence in human life.
Thams Alwa Adison had successful in his researches many times .
It is a matter of great fortune that today I am present at the Karmabhoomi of Maharshi Aravind.
In the same way he questioned everything of life in the form of a Maharshi .
They also took out the pocket , saw the way of humanity .
To know the truth it is important to keep questioning every time .
On National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those involved with science.
Friends, In times of crisis, I often get to hear messages about safety, designer etc and people keep on coming to me with something or the other.
Ravindra Singh from Pune, in a message to the Narendra Modi App, spoke about the comprehensive safety.
He said that safety standards are not very important in our country where factories and construction work is done.
In his Mann Ki Baat programme on 4th March 2020, the Prime Minister urged to take some precautions on safety and raise awareness among the people on safety.
In daily life we are not able to take care of Bhadrata , not taking precautions , it becomes difficult to get safety during accidents .
They are - loss of concentration and danger - one mistake causes harm - happiness and laughter - not only bringing one's feelings like speedily increasing the bond of safety - not playing with security - not losing life - we keep reading these things.
By crossing that path all the times in our life can not be used .
But if we leave nature options then more dangers take place on our layer .
We should remain alert, take necessary precautions, not only to save our lives but also to protect the society from bigger dangers.
There is a lot of information about safety at the place where one works, but no one pays attention to it properly.
I want to make a mask in front of the children of various schools once in a week with fire educations situated in metropolitan cities , city .
This country has faced many natural and man-made dangers and many chemical and industrial accidents.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is conducting a major disaster in the country.
When there are various kinds of hazards such as earthquakes, floods, cyclones, etc, NDMA reaches out there along with rescue operations.
Besides, they are also conducting training programmes for capacity building.
In the districts coming to floods , storms a program was done by the name of Apada friend for training .
Training and best practices play an important role.
Two-three years ago, every velocity of people died due to heat waves.
In 2017 the number of deaths occurring due to heat stroke is 220 .
Therefore, it is known that if we give importance to security then we can be safe.
I congratulate the people, the social groups and the best citizens who are engaged in the relief work in minutes after coming to the rescue operations in such a situation in the society.
India led a joint disaster management exercise with the name BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal etc.
This is the first-ever, great human experiment.
They should participate in our life .
Normally, we travel by air several times and at the beginning of the flight, we keep on giving information about the safety of air hostess.
All these informations are also heard many times .
But if someone takes us in the air , where is a life jacket , how to use it , then I can definitely say that no one in us can answer properly .
There is a chance of seeing them clearly .
That's it.
But we pay attention .
Therefore, no one in us feels that we do not sit in the air but listen to caution in our ears.
We consider every kind of life like that .
We should not consider this posture as not for us .
If we all are very best for our Bhadrata then the society is also international in it .
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, we started a programme with a focus on waste to wealth, waste to energy, from waste to wealth and from waste to energy through the medium of bagasses for villages as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
GOBAR-DHAN means - Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The objective of Gobar-Dhan is to clean the villages, make animal dung and organic waste not only in the form of COMOPOST, BIO-GAS, but also in generating wealth and energy through them.
The number of animals in India is about 30 crore, which is about 30 lakh tonnes.
In some European countries and China, animal dung and other organic wastes are used to produce energy.
But in India they are not used in the whole state .
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, now we are moving in this direction.
A goal has been set to produce bio-gas based energy from the waste generated from animal dung, organic waste, etc.
Under the GobarDhan Yojana, the farmer brothers and sisters in rural India are encouraged to not only look at the poor and homeless, but also to look at them as sources of income.
The health of animals will improve and their production will increase.
With bio-gas self-sufficiency increases in the case of the need of cooking , lighting Kosam .
This way is helpful in increasing the alternative of rosemary , animals and animals .
New park increases for hunting , transport , bagage , girls etc .
An online trading platform will also be created for the smooth roll-out of GobarDhan scheme, which will connect farmers and buyers.
I urge the traders, especially the brothers and sisters residing in the rural areas to come forward and utilise this opportunity by establishing self-help groups and cooperatives.
I invite you to join the campaign of clean energy and green jobs so that you can convert the waste into wealth in the villages and ask for Gobar-Dhan.
My dear countrymen, till now we have been hearing about many types of festivals like Music Festival, Food Festival, Film Festival etc.
But in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, for the first time, a wasted festival has been organized with a special effort.
The objective of the festival, launched by the Raipur Municipal Corporation, is to create awareness about cleanliness and various methods of making use of waste in the city creatively and using waste again.
All the students and elders participated in various programmes during the event.
In some of the remaining districts of Raipur, vain festivals have also been organised in various ways.
International Women's Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
There are many programs in our country , in the world .
That is, today we are talking about women-led development, moving ahead from women's development.
On this occasion, I am reminded of Swami Vivekanandas words - "The idea of perfect humanity is perfect independence" - the new year ago by Swami Vivekananda, is an expression of the spirit of Indian culture.
We are a part of the tradition of identifying men and women.This was the identity of every son.This was the identity of Yashodan, Kaushalya and the sons of Ganthari.
Now I have got some information from Jharkhand.
In Jharkhand, about 15 lakh women - not a small number, but 15 lakh women - participated in a month's cleanliness drive as part of Swachhta Abhiyan.
Starting from January 26, 2018, in just twenty days, these women have set a new example by constructing one lakh seventy thousand toilets.
How big incidents you can imagine this .
Women in Jharkhand have proved that women can make an effective effort to make hygiene practice in normal life and to make the culture of cleanliness a natural practice for common people.
I saw in the newspaper two days ago that after the independence of three villages of brother Sodarimunula , Elifanta island came to the independence of three villages , that is why the enthusiasm of the people there .
You all know very well that Elephanta island is situated ten kilometres away from Mumbai in the sea.
I told the government , people there .
The life of the people of the country is shining , enjoying happiness in their life , what are the more exciting times , happy moments ?
My dear brothers and sisters, Just a while ago we celebrated the festival of Shivaratri.
Now with the fruits of the month of March , golden colored wheat , glittering mango , all these are specialities of this month .
The festival of Holi is also very dear to all of us this month.
On March 2, we will celebrate Holi all over the country with joy and enthusiasm.
The importance of colors is as important as Holi and the day of destruction by burning in the fire of wickedness.
It is a celebration of the spirit of love, togetherness and brotherhood that brings together joy and happiness in one another.
Manki Bat January 2018 .
This was the first Mann Ki Baat in 2018.
Two days ago, we celebrated our Republic Day with great enthusiasm.
The students of ten countries participate in this festival for the first time in the history of the country .
It is said that on the one side of February , on the other side of February the imagination of going in the space of the space .
The forest leaving us in the accident of Colobia space , the world has given inspiration to some lacs of youth .
If there is desire , strong resolve , if there is any desire to do anything , then there is no impossible .
On this day, all women in India are increasing the pride of the country by growing in every field.
Since ancient times, the respect that women have received in our country, the place they have got in the society, their contribution is surprising the whole world.
There is a tradition of many advertisements in India .
In the Vedasar Museum there is along with many Indian students .
Opening memories like Lopamudra , Gargi , Maitri .
Today, we denounce the practice of saving children and reading girls, but for a long time ago, in our scriptures, what can be said in Skandapura, "If the fruits of Dashasaputra, Samaya, Dasaputra are available, then the benefits of matriartha are similar to the ten sons of Kanyakumaria (Kanyakaiya, Uh, Uh, Uh).
The recognition of ten sons is available with one daughter .
It shows the importance of women in our society .
And the seed of Lopamudra, Gargi, and Maitreyi , the archipelago of the Vedic times;
The administration of Ahilyabai Holkar was created by Rani Lakshmibai and the strength of the woman always inspires us and protects the pride of the country.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given many examples .
The Sukhoi 30 war air journey done by Sitaraman of our brave security midwives give how much inspiration to all women .
Bhavnakanth , Mohana Singh , Avani Chaturvedi , three adventurous adventures are taking training of 30 warriors .
Under the leadership of Kshamata Vajpayee, the All Women Cruise was operating from Delhi to San Francisco, USA and back to Delhi by Air India Boating Jat.
They said properly - Today women are playing leadership apart from queen in every hole .
Today, in every field, more and more of our women are showing some or the other thing, laying foundation stones.
A few days ago, the respected President had started a new work.
A book on these women achievers, first ladies, has also been prepared to learn about the power of these women across the country and to draw inspiration from their lives and work.
This is available in the form of e-book on the Narendra Modi website.
Today, the women power of the country is an important role in the positive changes happening in the country and the society.
Today, as we talk about women empowerment, I want to talk about a railway station.
You can imagine what a railway station has to do with women empowerment.
The station of Mumbai is the first railway station of the country laden with all the female workers .
In all the parts there women Sibbadi .
In the trade sector, in the railway police, in the ticket booking, in the announcement staff, in the fountains, more than forty women all were present.
This time after seeing the parade of the Ganesha day many people came to know the special importance of their spending in Perade through Twitter and other social mediums .
This adventurous experiment has also surprised all the guests coming from abroad .
This is a form of women empowerment , self confidence .
Today our women are playing the role of nervous system .
They are changing .
One more thing that came to my notice was that our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have done a great job and have set an example.
One can see a true picture of the tribal women in their minds - a forest where women carrying the weight of the bundles tied on their heads are painted .
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have shown a new picture of the country.
In the Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, through violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, maoists have created a terrible atmosphere.
In such a dangerous place tribal women were standing on their feet by walking this rickshaw .
Many women were included in it at the time of at least .
On one hand, Self Help Groups (SHGs) have made them self-reliant.
Leave it in our hands , adopt changes in important places .
It is a speciality of our society .
We have inherited such a culture and tradition of Indian tradition.
Only a few days ago Bihar had taken an interesting new wave program .
The biggest human chain of the world is about 13 thousand kms to hypnotise the bad habits of the society of the state .
Through this programme, people have been taken to the forefront against child marriage and atrocities.
On the contrary to the bad ways of childhood , Varkat Duracharya etc . the whole state has been given to fight against the whole state .
Children, elders, youngsters, mothers and sisters, everyone has participated in this fight.
This human Harem from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, is connecting people uninhibited to the borders of the state.
If the fruits of all the people in the society are properly developed, then the society should be free from such evils.
Come, let us all together take a pledge from the society of such evils.
We will build a strong and capable India, a New India.
I congratulate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister, the administration there, and every person involved in the human welfare, for making such a unique and extensive effort towards the welfare of their society.
My dear countrymen, whatever may be happening in the DarshanGaba, Mysore, Karnataka, the cost of treatment will be 6 thousand rupees per month.
In front of them the prime minister Janani Medicine is known about the medicinal substance .
After knowing about the reproductive center not starting medicines there , the expense of medicines decreased 75 percent .
Medicines available in the centres of reproductive medicine are available in the market for fifty percent of the brandy medicines sold in the market .
This will help the common man, especially the elderly with regular medicines.
Due to this reason good quality medicines are available at less price .
Today, 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras are being set up across the country.
Therefore besides getting the medicines cheap there is also a chance of employment for those who do their own business .
Medicines at affordable prices will be practiced at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras (PMBJK) and at Amrit Stores in hospitals.
The objective of the scheme is to provide quality healthcare services to every poor citizen of the country, thereby building a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Mangesh ji from Maharashtra sent a photo to the Narendra Modi App.
There is a photograph on the other side of my eyes .
One of them is running in the program of cleaning the Clin Morna river with his own self-confidence .
The people of Akola will have a cleanliness drive to clean the river Morna under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The river Morna flows through it in twelve months and now it flows only in a few months.
The other painful thing is that the river is completely full of horse riding .
There is also a lot of garbage on the banks of the road .
Hence, the day before Makar Sankranti, i.e. the 13th of January, in the first part of Mission Clean Morna, the cleanliness drive was carried out at fourteen locations on both sides of the river Mona in fourteen kilometers.
Large changes can be brought by the preservations .
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district, the municipal corporation, and every citizen who has turned this work into a public movement, your efforts will inspire all of you in the country.
My favorite country , in the midst of this Padmasambhava , you will hear the churches happening on the Padmas .

His goal is to give inspiration to scientific experiments with children 's work .
That is why he gives inspiration to the children by going to three thousand schools of the country and watching the films made in 18 languages .
How marvellous life .
You must have heard about the Bajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, who was born in a poor tribal family.

These pictures have been exhibited in many countries like Netherlands , Germany , England , Italy .
Bazju Shyam ji, who brought laurels to India and abroad, recognized him and gave him Padmashri.
On hearing the story of Lakshmi Kut of Kerala you will stay with happiness .
The teachers are still residing in a pack made of towels made in the tribal areas in the dense forests of the forest.

In making the medicine used for snake there is a principle of playing medicine .
Lakshmi ji is continuously serving people with its own information in the three medicines .

December, 2017.
This year it is in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat and today it is a coincidence that the last day of the year 2017 has come to pass.
The year changes in some hours but our words keep on continuing .
In the context of Christmas we remember the great doctrines of Jesus Christ .
He told us about the service of all the works of Christ .
We also see the spirit of service in the Bible.
Dear fellow citizens, This year marks the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.

I live in Mayur Vihar, Packet-1, Phase-1, Delhi.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wae.
He died in danger .
At that time we know our situation .
How much help we got from the government and I was able to reach it in time.
My name is Anand Jadhav.
National Highway was laid in 2017 through the village of Bhair.
That is why our roads are very unknown , our business has also increased .
My name is Dipanshu Ahuja.
Sadat Ganj Talku and Saharanpur districts of Uttar Pradesh.
Secondly, the valour of the Indian soldiers is unparalleled when we saw them in the docklam.
My name is Satish Bewani.
This is the great custom that happened in 2017 .
Many such people are bringing about positive changes in their lives as they work from their level.
If you are talking about the point of view of social point of view then I also want to pay one thing .
Anjam Bashir Khan Khattak Taluka, who led me in the Kashmir Administrative Service Examination, shared his inspiring story.
He came out of the clutches of terrorism and hate and stood as a top tolerant in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
In 1990 rapidly were burnt the house of their ancestors .
There rapidly , hyssop is so much that their family had to leave the land of their ancestors .
All around such a positive environment is to fill darkness , cruel thoughts in the mind of a small child but Anjum does not let it happen .
He never left hope .
He chose a new path for himself and the way he served the people.
He came out from the opposite environment and came to his victory story .
Today, he has not only stood for Jammu and Kashmir but also as an inspiring example for the youth of the entire country.
It has proved that even if the situations are not alright then by suitable tasks one can suck the clouds .
Last week, I got the opportunity to meet some of the girl children of Jammu Kashmir.
When I hear about their passion, enthusiasm and dreams, how optimistic they were when they heard about the progress in whatever fields they wanted to achieve in their lives.
While talking with them there was no feeling of restlessness in them .
There is enthusiasm , strength , dreams , cultural heritage in them .
This is my youth . This is the future of my country .
My dear countrymen, when I talk about the world's famous religious places not only in our country but also in the country, it is natural to mention about the famous temple of Sabarimala in Kerala.
In this world famous temple every year many devotees come here in numbers of crores for the blessings of Appa Swami .
How important is the place of the devotees coming to the contact with so much importance , cleanliness is along with how much challenge .
Especially because of being a place between mountains , forests it is even more difficult to clean .
But the Shabarimala temple is a great example of how peoples cooperation is needed to solve this problem and to convert the problem into a culture and understanding of the way out of the problem.
Shri P.K.
A police officer named Vijayan started a program called Pungvanam .
Every tourist calls for some time in the prayer part of God . works to clean the garbage .
Every morning the view of cleaning the premises of the tourists here is so unique .
No matter how big a officer is, no matter how rich a common traveller goes forward after participating in the cleanliness drive as a part of the Pungvanam programme.
There are many such examples for the people of our country.
This sanitization drive, which has so far been developed in Sabarimala, will be a part of the Yatra for every passenger.
They will also be accompanied by a stern message against any disruption caused by COVID-19.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Bapuji Jayanti on 2nd October, 2014, we have pledged to change our country into a Swachh Bharat, a Swachh Bharat that is incomplete and an India that does not belong to us.
Bapu ji, on the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will do something or the other in an attempt to give him a clean India of his art.
Several efforts are being made across the country to maintain cleanliness.
In the rural areas and urban areas, changes are being seen with extensive public participation.
The Clean Survey 2018 will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March 2018, the largest survey in the world to assess the level of sanitation in urban areas.
These surveys take place in about 40 crore population in four thousand cities .
The survey also calls for making cities free of open defecation, transport arrangements for collection of waste, collection of garbage, scientific cleaning, efforts for behaviour change, new efforts for capacity building and cleanliness, and peoples participation for this task.
This survey , various teams go and check the cities .
We talk to the citizens and take their opinion.
The use of the cleanness app, and other different types of service places are estimated to change.
Through this survey the arrangement of cleanliness in cities is estimated to be a part of the cleanliness of the city or people 's life style .
Cleanliness is not only the government .
This is also a big responsibility of every citizen , every public incident .
In the days of coming , in this survey every person participates with enthusiasm .
In this survey, you should strive hard to ensure that your city, your area, your streets are not lagged behind.
I believe that the use of blue color , green colored garbage in your house and the use of garbage of dry garbage in order to remove the dirt of the garbage in your house has become a good habit for all of you now.
Reducing garbage , using it again , it is very beneficial .
This should be a public discussion in every city, and not behind you in this healthy competition on cleanliness and hygiene, which will take place from 4th January to 10th March, 2018.
Our city - our efforts, our development - the mantra of progress for the country should be your mantra.
Come, let us once again remember Bapuji and try to fulfil the resolution of a Swachh Bharat.
Dear fellow citizens, Some of the things seem very small to see but have a profound effect on our identity as a society.
Today I want to share one such thing with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Who has made such rules ?
Because there is necessity .
It is said that when I went deep then independence came and stopped such a restriction that we were able to know that we were only seventy years old .
decade Muslim women have become unrighteous but no church has happened .
This rule is also not there in many pandemic countries.
But Muslim women of India do not have this power .
Our government has made me very happy to pay attention to this matter .
Generally, Haj pilgrims are given permission through lottery system but my opinion is that women alone have to keep away from this lottery system.
We need to ensure that our women have equal rights as well as equal rights as men and women.We need to make every effort to make them equal partners in progress.
Dear fellow citizens, The 26th of January is a historic day for us.
But this time in 2018 January 26th January is specially remembered .
This time, a total of ten ASEAN member countries are coming to India as chief guests of Republic Day.
This time there are not one or ten chief guests for the day of Ganesha .
This has never happened before in the history of India .
2017 is very important for India , Asian countries .
If ASEAN countries complete 50 years in 2017, India completed its partnership with ASEAN countries in 2017.
It is a matter of pride for all our Indians that the great leaders of these ten ASEAN countries gather in one place on the 26th of January.
I want to bring happiness , happiness , happiness , prosperity to all of you in the new year .
We should move forward with new enthusiasm , new hope , new resolve .
In January the sun enters the northern part and in this month Makar Sankranti is celebrated .
This is a festival full of nature .
It is a tribute to our every festival, but it is also a celebration of this unique festival in diversity of our culture that celebrates this unique event in diversity in the form of Loh De in Punjab or North India.
Sankrant in Rajasthan, Magh Bihu in Assam, or Pongal in Tamil Nadu, all these festivals are unique in itself.
All these festivals will be celebrated from 13th to 17th.
Best wishes to all the people of the country on the occasion of these festivals.
On the second time there are many ruins of your new year 2018 .
Dear Countrymen, Many thanks to you.
Talking to the next time in 2018 .
Bit of Man, September 2019.
If there was anyone in our country who could not afford it, who would not have been proud of it, how big was it at the age of all of us
The history of the country is witness to many miles , different times .
We call it Didi - she is Lata Didi.
Till this September 28th September ninety years were filled .
Before going to foreign journey I got the opportunity to talk with this .
A younger brother walked this conference as if he talked with his sister .
I will never talk about such personal interactions but today I want you to hear the words of Lata Didi and our conversation.
The internal Laddi , Namaskar .
I am talking to Nrandra Modi .
Lattu is worshipped .
I had phoned you before going to America to greet you - Lata ji: I was surprised to know that your phone is coming.
When will you come back?
Modigar . on crossing the midnight of 28th day in the morning on 29th day in the morning your birthday will be your birthday .
Lattu Garden . Oho , Alana .
On the day of birth there is nothing to celebrate .
If you get your blessing .
Modi . Woe unto you , that ye are older than me , therefore we want your blessing .
If you say the pride of your mother 's mother Gujarat then I enjoy .
This self-confidence , one family gives me happiness .
Lotay Tshering, Prime Minister (Lyonchhen) of the Kingdom of Bhutan.
How much one has to think .
But I will definitely come in haste .
Modigar . Come home , eat some Gujarati dishes made with your hands .
For the next few weeks the festival of Varuku is the light of the country .
We all celebrate many festivals like Navratri festivals , Garba , Durga Puja , Dussehra , Deepavali , Bhagini handicrafts , Chhath Puja .
A testimony, an inspiration.
If sweets are getting spoiled in some houses, in some houses children are offered sweets .
At least we must develop the habit of sharing most of the things that are present in our homes, and of sharing of those things which are not necessary for us.
They will be able to collect clothes, swivels, food from the people and find out what is needed.
We consider those who play in our culture as Lakshmi ji because the girl child brings prosperity and happiness to her.
This time we have organised the program of honoring children in our society , villages , cities .
Do not organise such an opportunity program .
With their difficulties , crafts , every family , society , society , country and many children stay among us .
Our society should recognize such children , pride , pride .
This pride program of the country is celebrated .
We can do another thing - share the achievements of these girls in social media, use a hashtag, say Bharatkilaxmi (Bharat Lakshmi).
Just a few days ago, I received a very interesting reply from a student from Arunachal Pradesh, AlinaTayang.
I am coming from Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when my test results came then someone asked me , read the book of xam warriors .
After that I had a lot of good .
If you read this book in front of the tests then it would be more beneficial .
If the book is intended to be reprinted once more, then the new edition will be printed in which the parents, teachers, etc.
See, my young friends also believe that if the work of the country's main servant is entrusted then it will definitely happen.
Blessed is my little student today , beforehand to answer me .
Along with this my younger sister has also given me work .
But all of you want to me one more .
Can you help me?
Do I tell me what you feel in the daily life ?
Definitely I read them , thinking , in which informations can be done , try to come in my words , in my way .
I wait for your thoughts .
I express my gratitude to the younger brother of Arunachal Pradesh, AlinaTayang.
My dear countrymen, the Prime Minister of the country will keep on talking to you through newspapers and TV about the wide range of activities.
If you want to hear the speech of Daniel Medved , especially the youth , then this video will definitely be seen .
The thought of our ancestors is really spectacular .
Mani Kancha Sangosthi: Joyful worldly thought: That is, when a person enters yoga, hearing and hearing once, he can win the minds of anyone.
Actually , this youth game has spent the hearts of all the people of the world .
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, I wish you all the best for what I am going to say.
Nicotine present in Tambak gives intoxication to the substance .
This habit of this habit in small age also has its effect on the bones of the brain .
But today I want to talk to you about another new thing .
You will be aware that there has been a ban on e-cigarettes in central India.
These cigarettes are a kind of electronic consequence of this cigarette .
Heating a liquid material along with nicotine in e-cigarettes shall also result in a chemical smoke that consumes nicotine.
Like the rest of the cigarettes in which aromatic chemicals are also included .
We keep seeing that in one house the father is a Chain Smoker and the rest of the people at home are being prevented from getting smoked, they are trying to keep the children away from getting smoked, smoked, smoked, etc.
Other members of the family do not see this smoking with itching .
They know that due to smoking , due to tobacco heavy loss of body occurs .
In fact, many harmful chemicals are added to the e-cigarettes, which have a huge adverse effect on health.
You know , if someone smokes then we will know that due to the smell coming they are burning cigarettes .
If there is no cigarette in his pocket then the smell becomes known .
However, it is not like e-cigarettes, but it is not like e-cigarettes, but that is why many children, youngsters, ignorant and fashioned are becoming more and more proud amidst books, offices, pockets, and sometimes even hands-on e-cigarettes.
Youth meaning the future of our country .
I want all of you to leave the expression of Tambak , do not become the victim of the discussion about this - cigarette .
Fit India means that by going to the gym for two and a half hours in the evening, one does not have to go hand in hand and foot.
To stay away from the above illusions is Fit India.
India has been the land of birth for so many extraordinary people like Aurobindo and the Karma Bhumi.
He also lived for others besides himself .
One such person is being honoured in Vatican City on 13th October.
This is a matter of great pride for all Indians and the 13th of October 2018, Pope Francis will be honored as the speaker of the 13th October 2018.
Sister Mariam Trasia is an example of the whole world about the good work done for humanity and human welfare in his fifty years limited life .
There is a great interest of forestry in the social service and education sectors.
I once again pay my tributes to Sister Mariam Trasia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this recognition.
At some places people give their contribution to this campaign in their own way .
A young man of our country has run a picture of a picture .
This movement has also increased the awareness of fitness and hygiene among the people.
If 130 crore people of the country ask for this mission then India will move 130 crore steps forward to get rid of single use plastic.
Repudman Garu, once again many thanks to you.
Many congratulations to you, your team, this creative experiment, my generation.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is going to celebrate October 2 in India and for October 2.
That is why every year on October 31, we are running for national integration called 'Run for Unity' in the country.
You start making yourself already .
You will be happy to know that our India has progressed on the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index, which is due to the cooperation of all of you.
This has happened especially because you are aware of the importance of tourism.
My dear countrymen, once again many good wishes to all of you on the occasion of various festivals of India, which is full of diversity.
Man ki Bat November , 2017 .
Namaskar, to the people of my beloved country.
Just a while ago, I got the opportunity to interact indirectly with the child friends of Karnataka.
These northerns gave me a lot .
The children spoke about many things: Kirti Hegde from North Karnataka, Digital India and Smart City schemes, and suggested that we need to bring about changes in our training system.
If we give our children the knowledge about nature then perhaps there is an opportunity beforehand to protect the environment.
It is said that from Lakshmieshwar a girl named Rida Nadaf is proud to give a soldier .
Is there not an Indian that prideth not our soldiers ?
It is common to pride you as a soldier daughter in it .
Irfhan Begum from Kalburji comes to know that her school is five kilometres away from her village, so the school has to leave very soon and there is a lot of delay in returning home.
But the people of the country , my varuka had enjoyed the opportunity of reading all these northern parts of the country .
I am a good experience .
My dear countrymen, today is November 26th.
This is our state day .
On this day in 1949 the parliament of India was established the state of India .
Because of coming to the Amalek of the state on 26 January 1950 , 26 January we celebrate that day .
The kingdom of India is the Spirit of our democracy .
This is the day to remember the members of our state assembly .
They worked for nearly three years to make our Indian constitution .
It will be a matter of pride for all of us to read about the thought process of those who had dedicated their lives to the country.
To make the kingdom of our country full of many studies they can imagine how hard industry can be done .
Is it a time when the country is free from the shackles of slavery, and at that time they could have imagined both intelligence and awareness and far-sightedness.
In the matter of this state the responsibility of making new India according to the thoughts done by the state , the responsibility of all us .
Our state is very expansive .
Be it poor , teams , backwards , tribals , women , women , every citizen not only protect the primary rights , but their category is developed in our state .
We must definitely participate our kingdom .
It is common to come to the memory of Baba Saheb Ambedkar .
On the main matters of this state ten - fifteen times have been formed .
The most important among these is Dr . . Musida committee .
Baba Saheb Ambedakar is the study of the contemporary period of old age .
They played an important role.
We are proud to see any Indian state today , in building that state of India Dr .
In the society every category of the society they made the kingdom .
On the sixth day of December, we would always remember them as a mark of respect.
December 15th December is the story of the Wildlife Sanctuary .
Sardar Patel ji had shown the extraordinary talent of the country to stand on the banks of the river.
Sardar Patel is also a member of the state .
They are also studying the incidents of primary hiccups , many other tribals , the advice of making on tribals .
The next day was the memory of their Pauls , security , Bhadrata Sibbadi , the country salutes all those who had lost their lives .
Their sacrifice will never forget the country .
Acute pain today has hidden a terrible form because of accidents happening daily in every place of the world .
Because of acute pain we have to face many problems of the country in the last forty years .
Thousands of innocents lost their lives .
In order to destroy the powers of humans the rapidity has been done .
With this not only India but all the human civilizations of the world should be smitten by standing together with the powers of the world .
Buddha Bhagwan , Mahavir , Guru Nanak , Mahatma Gandhi etc . have given us the land of Ahimsa , lovers of the world .
Acute pain , wrath weakens our social system , try to make it small .
That is why it is the time to keep all the powers of man alive .
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of December, we will celebrate the Navy Day.
Sindhu river , Ganga , Yamuna , Saraswati river , any of our civilization is on the banks of the river .
Yavat is the entrance door between us .
This country , this land is an unparalleled bound with the oceans of the great seas .
Looking at the history, it was eight, nine hundred years ago, while the naval team of all the Navies was recognized as the most powerful naval team.
In the vast expanse of the Chola empire, the Cholas have played a major role in the economic power of Kerala in contemporary states.
Examples of adventure tours of the Naval Forces of Cholas are available today in Sangam literature.
A lot of people know that many naval forces around the world, many years later, have allowed women on warships.
But in the Navika team of the place eight , nine hundred years creatory women played an important role in large numbers .
Women also participate in war .
The science related to the construction of boating of the Chola rulers was rich .
Konark situated on the main role of the sea was a part of the kingdom of Maharaja Shivaji .
Several forts like Sindhu Fort , Murud Janjira , Golden Durga etc . of Maharaja Shivaji were surrounded by sea or sea .
The responsibility of all these forts was done by the boating of the Marathas .
Large boats and small boats were included in the Maratha Navy.
Their naval forces were highly skilled in fighting any enemy and escaping from them.
While talking about Maratha sailors, Kanhoji could not remember Angre.
They went to the highest level of the Maratha Navy, where they set up bases of the Maratha Navy at many places.
Our Navy saw its valour in the freedom struggle in Goa, during the Indo-Pak war of 1971 and in many cases after the independence.
Several fishermen were rescued from the water and handed over to Bangladesh.
This year, in the month of May and June, when there was a severe flood in Sri Lanka, three ships of our naval forces arrived there immediately and provided their assistance to the government and the people there.
In the month of September in Bangladesh, our naval ship INSV Tarini was embarked on a visit to the Republic of Bangladesh on 19 September 19.
If we have to provide health services to the people of Fiji, if we want to provide immediate relief and if we want to provide help to our neighbouring country in times of crisis then our naval forces have always been doing a commendable job.
In order to make the people of 125 crore countries happy, our brave soldiers dedicate their youth and lives for the country.
Every year on the 7th of December, the Armed Forces will celebrate the Flag Day.
This is a day to celebrate the pride and pride of our armed forces.
There is a pride of pride in the country .
Army personnel in school and college will be invited and Army information will be sought from them.
This is a good opportunity for our youth to know the information related to army .
This is an opportunity to raise funds for the welfare of all our armed forces personnel.
The entire Army Welfare Board shall bear the cost of rehabilitation and assistance of the injured soldiers to the families of the martyred soldiers in the war.
On this occasion, let us also work to enhance the morale of our armed forces.
We also do good work for them .
My dear countrymen, the 5th of December is World Soil Day.
On this occasion I want to say some things with my brother , sister .
The most important part of the hill is soil .
The symbol of food we are connected with this soil .
In a way the whole food chain is covered with soil .
There is no soil , trees do not increase .
Where is the cost of human life ?
How is it possible to live animals ?
This has been discussed in our culture long ago and this is the reason that we have been familiar with the ancient times of soil importance.
In our culture, on the one hand, natural efforts have been made to inculcate the spirit of devotion and compassion among people towards crops and soil, while on the other hand some scientific methods have become part of our lives to nurture this soil.
The devotion to our soil, the scientific conservation and protection of soil are equally important in the lives of the farmers of this country.
It is a matter of pride for all of us that the farmers of our country are associated with tradition, interest in modern science, efforts and resolve.
I have heard about the farmers of Bhoranj Block in Tohu village of Hamirpur district in Himachal Pradesh.
Some farmers in the village were advised to check the situation and check if any type of fertilizers , micro nutrients , organic manures were used during the time of soil testing .
After that you will be surprised to hear the results .
At the same time soil has also been shining in soil .
Now our farmers have also come to know that if we dont protect the Earth, if we save the Earth, it will protect all of us.
All our farmer brothers and sisters across the country have understood their soil better and have taken more than 10 crore soil health cards for sowing the crops accordingly.
We will worship Mother Earth but have we ever thought how ill the health of Mother Earth is
This has been proven by all kinds of scientific tests that the use of more fertilizers than required causes serious damage to the earth.
Global Warming , changes in environment , we all experience .
There was a time when the winters used to come before Deepavali and now on coming December the winters are slowly moving .
But as soon as winters begin, we all do not have to come out of chaos, this is an experience for all of us.
Due to this kid who used to go to 30,40 houses every day and preach about cleanliness, the village of Kumhari was freed from the practice of defecating in the open.
The kid did a very inspiring job in the direction of cleanliness.
There is no restriction with age to participate cleanliness , there is no border .
It is necessary for everyone to clean children , elders , women , men .
Everybody needs to do something for cleanliness .
Our Divyang brothers and sisters were determined.
A capable, brave-hearts can make a resolve.
One can learn something or the other every moment from them .
These are coming in every way .
In sports, our Divyang brothers and sisters will not be taken away from any social problem.
You will remember that in the Rio Olympics, our differently abled players displayed a unique game and won four medals.
Blind TV-20 is a world cup of champions.
Different types of competitions keep on happening in the country .
A few days ago, 17th National Para Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in the competition and presented their talent.
A Divya young man participating in it is 19 years of Jagger tour of Gujarat . He is not even eighty percent of the body .
But see his adventurous , culture , woe .
He is a recipient of 32 Para Athletes and is trained at Centre for Excellence, Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
Everybody should walk ahead .
After some days this festival is celebrated .
On this day Digambar Hazrat Mohammad Sahib was born .
I heartily convey my greetings to all fellow citizens.
I hope that this event gives us a new enthusiasm, a new energy and a new ability to make new resolutions in order to increase peace and harmony in the society.
2017 was completed . 2018 .
But you have done very well.
I thought to change your words even more .
Let us forget our grief and sadness as the elders and elders of our villages, who live in our villages, do not forget happiness.
In our country too, there will be an attempt to recall the interesting events of the past year in the media.
Take the things that give inspiration to others .
If you want to pay good things , then mind to do good work .
Give strength to do good things .
Let us all see the power of this place and its influence together.
In the coming days, I will definitely try to provide the people of the country the things that have come up in this positive India.
My dear countrymen, I will be amidst you in the coming month and in the coming month.
On the second time there is a chance of telling many pockets .
Man Ki Bat : Woe in mind .
This festival, which is a special festival, is also fully celebrated with the blessings of nature and nature.
The sun and water are worshipped at this time of worship by using different components of these worshippers, earthen utensils, bamboo, etc.
In this festival full of faith, the message of the sun rising in the morning , the prayer of the setting sun is full of a special culture.
If the world is worshipped , it is necessary to worship those who know that it is necessary to worship this Chath Puja .
This festival also resonates with the importance of sanitation in our lives.
In the run-up to this festival, people clean the entire house with great enthusiasm - singing of songs, rivers, ponds and rivers.
It is natural for everyone to feel proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I see the impact of Mann Ki Baat on the people, I am confident that the word Mann Ki Baat has become a hundred percent strong bond with the people of the country.
Take the example of Khadi , fish only .
During Gandhi Jayanti I have done the result of taking Khadi , fields , fields , if you know how much happy you will also be .
On the 15th of October, 2018, on the occasion of the opening day of the Dhan, a record sale of Rs.1 crore and Rs.20 lakh was registered at Khadi Shop in Delhi and at Khadi Shop in Delhi.
Khadi , fishing , both the girls are so big that you also have a pleasant thing .
During Deepavali approximately 680 percent old age has been registered in the girls of Khadi Gipt couples .
Even in all the girls of Khadi , handicrafts the last year has registered about ninety percent growth this year .
In this center youth , elders , children , aged , women , all adults also like Khadi , fields .
That is why I can imagine how much benefit to the families of many families , doing so many poor families .
I am talking about Khadi for fashion and now I have seen that Khadi for Nation, Khadi for Fashion is taking lot of interest from both the places.
Khadi and handloom are not only transforming the lives of the underprivileged, but are also becoming a powerful medium for bringing them up with confidence.
How can we provide our homely sweets to the security forces in the N-Randra Modi App that was also inaugurated by Tejas Gaikwad.
It is said that during the festival we also come to remember our Veer Jawanes .
I also felt that the sweets of our house were given to the teams of Bhadrata .
On the other hand, we have got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with our brave soldiers while performing the duties of our valorous forces.
This time I have forgotten to celebrate Diwali with security forces in the Gurej Sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I would like to honor the soldiers of our security forces who are protecting the country from the harsh and poisonous situation in the borders of the country. I would like to honor the soldiers of our security forces for their bravery and dedication.
We should listen to the experiences of our soldiers when they get the opportunity and when they get the opportunity and listen to their glorious stories.
Many of us do not know that the soldiers of our security forces are playing an important role not only in the border but also in establishing peace throughout the world.
As peace observers of the UN Peace Keeper United Nations, they have changed the name of India to the world.
A few days ago, on October 24, UN Day, the United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world.
The efforts to establish peace in the world , their successful role is remembered everybody .
We believe that the whole world is our family .
It is with this belief that the first time of the United Nations, India has been actively participating in various important efforts.
You must be aware that the establishment of India's constitution, the establishment of the United Nations Charter, both of them will begin with the words 'we the people'.
India has always supported female equality, the UN Declaration of Human Rights as its live example.
It seems like a very small change but a strong thought is seen in it .
As part of UN Umbrella, India has played the most important role in UN peacekeeping operations.
India has always played a major role in the UN Peace Keeping Mission.
For the first time, many of you are aware that more than 18 thousand Indian security forces have served in UN peacekeeping operations.
Till August 2017, Indian soldiers had served in about 50 operations in 71 peacekeeping operations worldwide by the United Nations.
These operations have taken place in many countries around the world, such as Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cypress, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan, etc.
The hospital set up by Indian Army in Congo, South Sudan treated over 20,000 patients and saved many more.
The security forces of India have not only protected the people of many countries there, but have also won many hearts by conducting public friendly operations there.
Indian women have played an important role in the peace establishment program .
After that, all other countries have also started sending their women police units.
India's role is not just limited to peace-keeping activities and it will be a matter of pride for you to hear that India is training the Peace Keepers in about eighty five countries.
Our brave soldiers who left this land on the path of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, have given out the message of peace and harmony to the entire world.
Peace conservation is not easy .
The soldiers of our Bhadrata dynasty also have to work in dangerous places .
Different kinds of humans have to be in the middle of humans .
One has to know various situations , various types of traditions .
They have to forget themselves according to the local needs , situations of those places .

The national memorial has been done by making people aware .
Going to various countries of the world against the bad advertisements about Sana religion , philosophy .

First of all, my best wishes to all the children on the occasion of the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
These are the dukes for the construction of the children , Hirol .
Your thinking is right that the diseases that occur in old age are at the end of life - they are now seen in children as well.
Children also surprised to hear diabetes .
This has not only affected the lives of such people but also affected the lives of such people and affected the lives of such people.
Such diseases were rare in youth .
But today our life style has changed .
Such diseases are known by the name of lifestyle today .
Change in our diet , not doing adequate physical labor in life is the main reason for such diseases in the age of people .
It is necessary to pay attention to this matter of society , family .
If we think about it then there is no need to participate more precautions like .
Small tasks have to change their habits regularly in the right way , changing their habits , changing them into their nature .
The members of the family members should try to adopt the habit of playing their children in the plains .
If possible then also try to play with the children in the field of Patu .
Do not use the lift of the child , do the habit of moving down on the stairs .
After dinner try to take everybody , children in the family .
It is easy because one can easily learn and practice Yoga anywhere.
There is no need of any special administration , fields .
How many researches are being used for yoga to control diabetes .
We should not only see Ayurveda , Yoga , we should not only see the medium of illness .
We should make them part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, in the last few days, good news has come in the field of sports.
In different games our country games have been named the country .
Seeing the unique sports of India in Hakilo India got the status of Asia camp .
Because of the exhibition of our sports our hockeys were given Asia camp champion after the teeth of our hockey .
So much so that India became Asia Cup champion in 2003 and 2007.
Many-many thanks to the entire team, to all the members of the community, to all the friends of the country.
After hockey, India also had a good fortune in badminton.
Badminton star Kedambin Shrikanth has given every Indian the honor of winning the Denmark Open Siris by displaying the best sports .
Indnesia open, and after Australia open it's his third super series.
I congratulate our young friends for this feat and for increasing the pride of India.
Friends, In this month itself, the FIFA Under-17 World Cup was started.
All the teams from across the globe have come to India and everyone has shown their talent in the football field.
I also got the opportunity to see a game .
I once again tell my greetings and good wishes to the sportsmen , their friends , sports , games .
My dear countrymen, as far as I am concerned about Swachh Bharat, if I want to judge all of them, then I must have a daily conversation in my mind.
If one sends photographs of small children , then there are stories of the youth at other places .
If there is some creative innovation related to cleanliness at one place then there is a news about the changes occurring due to some authority .
Just a few days ago, I received a detailed report which included the restoration of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
An NGO team, Ecological Protection Organization, undertook a cleanliness drive at Chandrapur Fort.
In the run up to 200 days, people did not get tired and kept a team of sanitation workers.
Two hundred days respectively .
Before the program , after that photographs were sent me .
This Bhagirathi effort for cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, collective strength and continuity.
Forts are our heritage symbols .
The responsibility of keeping historical buildings safe and clean is to all the people of the country .
I convey my best wishes to the Election Commission of India, to the people of Chandrapur and all their friends.
My dear countrymen, on the fourth of November, we celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
Apart from the first guru of the Sikhs Guru Nanak ji is also the Guru of Jagat .
They have served the entire humanity and have seen all the species coming together.
Women have given importance to pride , women .
Guru Nanak ji undertook a 20,000-8,000-km long journey on foot and conveyed his message of true humanity.
They talked to the people and saw the path of truth, sacrifice and penance.
The message of equality in the society was not only through words but also through his work.
Guru Nanak had also discovered Gurubani to speak his words .
In the coming year 2019, we will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.
Come, let us try to move ahead on the teaching path of their messages.
My dear countrymen, two days later, we are going to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
We all know that the foundation of modern Andaman is the foundation of India .
Today we can learn a lot from the extraordinary journey of Indias mother and child.
On 31st October, Smt. Indira Gandhi left this discourse.
He is his same time in doing counsel .
The paths standing on the banks of India have been stopped by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .
Crores of Indians are determined to bring India under one nation, one constitution.
Their decision has given them the power to face all obstacles .
Where there is need of entertainment work was done with entertainment .
It has been done wherever it is required.
They decided to set a goal and went ahead with all their efforts.
This program which does the country can be done only .
Everybody wanted to imagine the country like that .
I want their words to be an inspiration to all of us - do not stop us from breaking silos.
This story of Sardar Saheb is still inspiring and relevant for our dream of a New India.
Due to this reason their birth is celebrated on the fifth day of the country .
His support is unparalleled in giving a form of a country .
My dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali, with a new resolve, with a new determination, all of you must have started once again in your daily lives.
My generations want to all the people of the country , their dreams , ruins .
Three three times spent in your mind by the sky .
The word in the mind of today is 36th .
I have never said these things in my mind .
These things which I spake in this mind are the words of the people which I sent to me from all corners of the country .
In these many were my inspiration .
Many people are like bringing changes in the government .
Some personal physiotherapy is like paying attention to some social problems .
Once in a month, I take your time for an hour, but people keep reaching out for thirty days in a month for Mann Ki Baat.
That is why the journey of three times in this mind is the journey of all the citizens of the country to Tallu .
I express my gratitude to all the people of the country for giving me the opportunity to understand the common man of India in such a short span of time.
Now three have been completed so far, it will be analyzed by social scientists, universities, research scholars and media experts, both good and bad.
But such path-breaking discussions will go a long way in instilling a new spirit and a new enthusiasm in the minds of the future.
After that many social institutions of the country , many social institutions , many youths were doing such tasks before .
I had come to know that how many people were thinking about how many people were leaving food in Kanchenjunga , I had a lot of happiness , how much happy .
Once again I saw a photograph of Selfie with Doctor, who had taken a sarpanch in Haryana. I had told everyone in my heart about it.
Looking at this, not only in India but in the entire world a big movement called Selfie with Daughter has started.
This is not only the subject of social meditation .
This is the incident of producing a new self-confidence , new pride in every girl .
Everybody felt as if the parents have to take self from their daughters .
It is believed that every girl has some importance in itself , it has its own importance .
Just a few days ago, I was sitting in their tourist department by the Government of India.
I want to tell the people going there where they go to Incredible India where they are going to send photographs there.
Lakhs of pictures that have come from different parts of India as well, in a way, have been a great asset for all those working in the tourism sector.
I had experienced by talking in the mind how big a small incident can not get up .
On the coming of the thought of the third third three incidents many incidents of my mind were mesmerised .
For walking in the right direction the country will always be before .
Every citizen of the country, every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the welfare of the society and for the progress of the country.
I have heard, learned and learned from the people of the country as a part of my three-year Mann Ki Baat campaign.
This is the biggest power of any country , the biggest power of any country .
I salute all the people of the country with heart.
I once talked about Khadi and said that Khadi is not a garment, but a thought.
Discounts will be given in Khadi outlets on 2nd October, which will come down significantly.
I want to increase this Khadi proposal in such a way that I want to increase it again .
This increased interest towards Khadi and those working in the Khadi sector and those related to Khadi in the Government of India, the enthusiasm of thinking in a new angle has increased.
How to bring new technology, how to increase the productivity, how to bring the handkerchiefs from the work of solar power, how to revive the age-old tradition of 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years, etc.
The opportunity of many people has been produced .
The training centre for Khadi and Village Industries, which was shut down at Pampore in Kashmir, has been resumed in Kashmir and there is a lot of work to provide this sector.
With the resumption of the training centre, it will help the new generations to build, lead and deliver new things.In the meantime, I am very happy to note that a large corporate entity is selecting the Khadi items to be given the Deepavali Prize.
People also began to choose expensive things while giving gifts to each other .
Some things naturally come to the experience of all of us .
My dear countrymen, we had made a solemn pledge in the last month of Mann Ki Baat and had decided to celebrate the festival of cleanliness across the country 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti.
Our Honble President had started this programme.
Children, elderly, men, women, in cities, in villages, everyone has participated in the cleanliness drive today.
As I have said, with determination, we are looking at the way the sanitation coverage has progressed.
Everybody has adopted this proposal , giving its support to support , success .
I express my gratitude to the honble President for this.
In addition to this, every section of the country is also considering it as its own, and everyone is associated with this campaign.
In the field of sports, they met with students, academics, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, coolies, officers, police, children, jawans, everyone.
If these places are garbage free, people are aware that there is no dearth of food, this pressure is also seen among the people working there.
More than seventy-five lakh people, more than forty thousand people have joined the campaign in four days since the launch of the Swachhata Hi Seva.
Some people work continuously with the goal of showing results .
This time we have also seen another new thing - one hand sanitization is being done and one hand sanitization is being done and one hand sanitization is being done.
If you want to change cleanliness in a nature , then emotional park is also important .
This time many competitions have been done by cleanliness service .
More than two and a half thousand children participate in the competition of this cleanliness .
Thousands of children have been made pictures .
The pictures have been pictured about cleanliness with their own hypnotise .
Blessed is the media when sanitization comes , and I will never forget .
We are seeing the electronic media and print media of our country as much as we are serving the country in this mission of cleanliness.
Someone told me about a 14-year-old young man from Srinagar-Bila Dar.
You will be glad to know that the Municipal Corporation of Srinagar has appointed this bill as its brand ambassador for sanitation, whether it is brand ambassador or whether it is a film field or a sports player.
Not only this .
Bilda Dar had paid attention to the cleanliness of his twelve - three years old age , last five decades .
He is an inspiration for all those who are interesting in the age of small age .
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
We should confess that my beloved country , future history , past history .
This time also marks the centenary year of Nanaji ji and Pandit Deendayal ji.
Do not know what is the center of all these great men .
One common thing is that living for the country , doing something for the country .
Nanaji Deshmukh left politics and spent his entire life in the village, working for the welfare of the people.It is natural to have a sense of respect and regard for their rural activities as they celebrate their centenary today.
Shri Abdul Kalam, former President of India, used to talk to the youth about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh every time.
Like Mahatma Gandhi Garden also used to talk about the person sitting in the last class of the society .
We should also run ahead for oneness , one mantra .
The unity in diversity is generally said to be the speciality of our India .
We respect diversity but do you ever try to feel this diversity ?
Deepavali is nearing the city and the idea of travelling to and fro is inherent in the country.
Everybody is a common thing to go to tourists .
But what is painful is that people do not see our country, nor do they know the diversity of the country.
Our country is full of many studies .
All these Mahabharatas have also been developed in the country .
Before starting this work , an attempt has been made to understand the country , understanding .
They have tried to make India live by themselves.
My own experience is that I have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts of India.
I got the opportunity to spend night in more than four hundred districts .
I would like you all to feel this vast India, our vast pool of energy, not just the concept of unity in diversity.
One India - best India is hidden in it .
This is the biggest power of our country tourism .
My request is that if you want to go out on your holidays or if you want to change some or the other then go out with the purpose of understanding , learn .
Visit India within you.
Your life will prosper with these experiences.
Your thought will be large .
There is cost of cost of experiences .
Normally from October to March is better for tourism .
Definitely send your photo to IncredibleIndia (Hashtag Incredibleindia).
You should also send pictures of humans connected to the place .
Not only the identification of construction but also not only the beauty of nature but also write about the life style there .
Can you put it in Incredibleindia
You see, I would like to tell the government that all the information from the same state should be examined and public literature should be prepared about the seven places where most of them had come.
The Government of India works on them .
The government will accept the information of the location and location of yours by making pictures, videos, making publicity and encouraging them at such good places.
Come , walk with me .
You can also become a major source of inspiration for using and encouraging the countrys tourism during the month of October to March.
I am inviting you .
My favorite country , one man , many things meet me .
My mind becomes the victim of obstruction .
Deep effect is left on my mind .
No matter how much I am man like you .
Why does Assam say that while serving the mother of India , their husbands are not heaven .
In small age if we are breasts then how can we imagine their state .
She trained with hard industry for eleven months , gave her life to fulfil her husband dreams .
Although the husband of Dhubbu Mukhsh Dubey had forgotten the death of working in the army of Dubai .
His wife also reached the army .
It is natural for every Indian to have a sense of respect for our mother power and our heroes.
I heartily convey my best wishes to these two sisters.
They have given new inspiration and new inspiration to crores of people of the country.
These two sisters are many opinions .
My dear countrymen, on the auspicious occasion of Navratri, Diwali, there is a great opportunity for the youth of our country.
The FIFA Under-17 World Cup is taking place in our country.
It is believed that the sounds of football are echoing all around .
Every generation the interest of football is increasing .
There will be no grounds for a youth playing football in any school or college of India.
My dear countrymen, Navratri is celebrated.
Durga Devi is worshipped .
The weather is pure , pleasant .
All around there is a spiritual atmosphere , atmosphere , atmosphere full of devotion .
All this will be considered as a festival of Shakti.
These are also known as Sarada navaratris, which are now beginning in the winter season.
O my beloved country , thou shalt worship me .
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals, on the other hand, it is natural for the country to worry about the news of violence from any corner of India.
This is the birth place of Sardar Patel, who sacrificed his life for the unity of the nation and the birth place of Lord Buddha.
Ahimsa Parmo dharamshala . We came to hear it from a small time .
I have also said from the Red Fort - There is no reason to tolerate violence in the name of beliefs. It is a traditional belief, however, political ideology is the belief of a person, but it is a traditional belief.
According to the state given us Baba Saheb Ambedakar , every person has all kinds of arrangements for getting the judgment of every person .
I assure the people of the country that no government will stand shoulder to shoulder with those who take the law into their hands, who take it on the path of violence, whosoever is a person, who is a group, who doesnt belong to this country.
Our festivals are also full of diversity.
If we look at the cultural heritage, social traditions, historical events and historical events because we have inherited the ancient culture of several thousand years, then there will be no day of any festival in a year.
All our festivals also come in accordance with the nature.
Everything is directly related to nature .
The Jain community is celebrating the festival of year yesterday.
Jain society is celebrated in the month of Bhadrapad .
The festival of Purusho is celebrated on the last day of the year.
Actually this is a unique tradition .
Year festival is a symbol of peace , Ahimsa , Sneh Bhavan .
My dear countrymen, today every corner of the country is celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi.
It is natural to come to the subject of Bahraang - Ganesh Festival on the coming of Ganesh Chaturtha .
Bal Gangadhar Tilak was born to this tradition 125 years ago, and in the last 125 years, he was a symbol of freedom.
After independence they stand symbol of social training , social consciousness .
Ganesh Chaturth festival is celebrated for ten days .
This festival is called the symbol of unity , equality , cleanliness .
Ganesh Festivals of all the people of the country are many good wishes in the context of Ganesh Festival .
Now the festival of Onam is celebrated in Kerala .
Onam of Kerala is a major festival of colourful festivals of India.
This festival highlights the importance of social and cultural importance.
The festival of Onam presents an important cultural heritage of Kerala.
The festival brings new zeal, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people with the message of love and harmony in the society.
Now our festivals are also becoming the attractions of the tourists .
Navratri Festivals in Gujarat and Durga Puja Festivals in Bengaluru became an attraction of the tourists in a way.
Our other festivals also help attract foreigners.
In that direction we should think what we can do .
In the tradition of these festivals, the festival of Id-ul-uha takes place in a few days.
I convey my best wishes and greetings to all fellow citizens on the occasion of Id-ul-uha.
Festival is a symbol of faith , belief .
Festivals in Navbharata should be made symbol of cleanliness .
This is not new for us but it is important to change it as a social habit .
Cleanliness is not only at home, but also an important part of festivals like cleanliness and hygiene in the entire village, city, state and country.
My favorite country , modern meanings are changing .
These days, no matter how many of you are Sanskrit, no matter how modern your thinking is, all these things have become a new angle, a new measure and a balance to give Beriz .
Therefore in the days of this festival the soil Ganesha park has started all the places suitable for environment .
If you look at the YouTube then children in every house will be made of mud and color will be blinded .
Some vegetables stop colors , some colorful pieces of paper .
The media houses are also providing motivation and guidance to the people to train the making of the statue of soil Ganapati, which is suitable for a large scale environment.
Look how big change has come .
Enjoying change.
As I said , our country is full of unique thoughts of crores of crores .
It 's a lot of fun to do new inventions .
Some engineer himself told me that he has got some special types of soil , mixing it , giving training to the people making soil .
After worshiping the Ganesh in a small pocket , the idol melts immediately in water .
Three years ago, I started the cleanliness drive and the next three to three months will be completed by October 2.
The results of this park are seen .
The construction of toilets has reached approximately 67 from 39.
It has been said that more than two lakh thirty thousand villages , Bahraang stool has been freed from the excretion of excretion .
There have been severe floods in Gujarat in the middle of the state.
Many people lost their lives .
But after the water of flood many odours spread .
During the same period, in Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat, the workers of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind cleaned twenty-two rooms and three mosques affected by floods in a phased manner.
Protecting their sweat everyone .
As a result, our country will be able to scale new heights if our efforts for cleanliness are made as permanent.
In one way Deepavali , Navaratri , Durga Puja is considered to be the first support of this .
Go to the nearby villages, go to the nearby villages, but consider this as a mission.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
All my friends in the social media can also take up your creative work and work on the Virtual World Forum which can inspire us.

My dear countrymen, I especially want to accept your debt.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for not being able to connect with me so far but also with my heartfelt gratitude.I am grateful to you all for joining me in my Mann Ki Baat programme from all corners of the country.

This has become a great opportunity for me to know the thoughts of all the people of the country.
The more you wait for words in your mind, the more I wait for your messages.
I do the work which comes in use .
Once some things get so much connected with our habits , we also consider that we are doing business .
My thoughts are with the people of Pune, the Prime Minister said.
I want to tell you about my friend.
She was always trying to help the people, but a habit of hersinged me out.
I went to the shopping mall once with him .
Two thousand rupees were spent easily on one pus .
450 for the pizza but the auto driver who went to shopping mall for Rs. 5.
On the way the vegetable of the vegetable remains 4,5 rupes .
I did not like it .
Not only this, if you go out to buy a shit from the showroom, then Berlad but if someone comes to work with the poor, there will be no inconvenience in using the pills.
Do ye ever think that what does the poor want ?
There is no significance for two rupees or five rupees in your life, but did you ever think of how deep your small habit could hurt their minds
I am grateful to you, Madam, for telling me about such a heart attack through your phone call.
My country 's people also have a habit of such a way with their poor people , they will definitely change .
My dear young friends, On the 29th of August, the entire country will celebrate National Sports Day.
This is the birth of great hockey player , hockey minister Major Chandan Garden .
There is no service of Hachi , which he did to play .
The reason to remember this is that my desire is to be covered with the emotional sports of our country .
Sports should be a part of our life .
If the youth of the world is our country then it should also be seen in the youth sports of that youth .
It is a big medicine for playing games .
I want our countrys youth to come forward in the world of sports and I want to warn that the flying field is more important than the play-station in the Italian computer era.
Play the FIFA in the computer but sometimes in the open field also show the feet with football .
Cricket keeps playing in computer but in the open field the joy of playing cricket below the sky is different .
At one time the children of the house go out , when they ask .
Now the situation is that even children in the house are drowned in seeing photography , corton cinema or mobile Gam .

Our schools , our art galleries , our students can make such environment .
If we talk about change in our country , if we talk about family , then students remember about the society .
Teachers have a very big role to play in the transformation.
In every study because of its natural artificial efforts in life there are incidents of success in an attempt to bring changes in each other 's life .
If we try together, we can play a big role in transforming the country.
Let us move ahead with the mantra of 'Tech to Transparent'.

In monsoon season the mind of man is very important .
Animals , birds , stairs , nature , everybody changes due to rains .
The changing weather cycle is changing the environment and its impact is also increasing rapidly.
In the last few days, natural disasters have to be encountered in Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal due to hospitality.
My friend members of the council of ministers are also visiting the area if possible.
The State Governments are also providing the best assistance to the flood victims in their respective manners.

I was very impressed to hear your chartered accountants' address.
Last month, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) came into force in our country.
That is why you can tell whether the government had come to the expectation of the last months .
I want to know your thoughts in this matter .
I am very happy and happy to learn that GST has reduced the prices of essential goods and has provided me with the right kind of things.
Especially the trade of yoga is increasing on the business level .
I am aware of the impact of GST on transportation and logistics.
The rapid changes occurring rapidly , rapid registration has created a new belief in the country .
The experts and technologists in the economy have studied the use of GST in India and it is expected that the world will emerge as a model.
This is a case study for all the world university .
Because with the efforts of such a big height , so important change , with the efforts of so many crore people in this large country it is a very big task .
Definitely researches on this thing .
All the decisions have been taken by the state , central governments .
Whatever kind of weight does not fall in poor condition is the result of the concentration .
You will be able to know very well about the price of the GST which was earlier the price of the GST which is now being paid through your mobile phone.
A warm and cordial atmosphere has been created between the government and the businessmen and this has played an important role in instilling trust between the consumers and the government.
My heartiest congratulations to all the ministries, departments, and officers of the Central and State Governments who have participated in this event.
GST is a great example of Indias collective strength.
In a way, this is a social reform movement.
Once again, I salute all the crores of people of the country who have made such a big effort to make it easier.
Beloved my country residents , August meaning the month of August .
On 1 August 1920 the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the support .
The uit India Movement started on August 9, 1942 and is also called the August Revolution.
In 1947 August 1547 independence came to the country .
Seeing in a way , all the incidents done in the month of August are also specially engraved with the history of freedom fight .
Our new generation should know what happened in the 9th day of August in 1942 .
From 1857 to 1942, the freedom struggle that the people of the country had fought for freedom was an inspiration for building our emotional India.
On the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians have led their lives in the movement with the mantra of DoR Day.
Lakhs of youth have stopped their studies , leaving books .
Great men like Lohia, Jay Prakash Narayan have played a big role in this movement.
The uit India Movement in 1920, the uit India Movement in 1942, will also reflect two forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1942, the intensity of the movement had increased so much that even a great man like Mahatma Gandhi had given the mantra of DoR Day, behind all this peoples support.
Once again, I would like to say that India's first freedom struggle had started in 1857.
Then in the beginning of the freedom struggle till 1942 some or the other corner of the country has been happening .
This Surgha period has created the status of independence in the minds of the country .
Everybody has become unsuccessful for the decision of some or the other .
This industry, which was formed from 1857 to 1942, is a new situation that has been created and reached to the last stage of 1942.
The goal of Queen India was so much changed that in 1947 the British had to leave the country in 1947 .
This independence of 1857 had reached all the people of this independence of 1942 .
From 1942 till 1947, all the people, with the same conviction and determination, became successful in making the country's independence a five-year period.
These five are like a turning point .
Now I will join you with one past .
In 1947 we came to freedom .
Now 2017 .
Approximately seventy years were spent .
Governments came .
Arrangements have been made , Marai , increasing , increasing .
Everybody has made an attempt to come out of the problems of the country .
I had observed that even five years till 2017 till 2022 were like a resolve of five years.
Try to complete them .
Like from 1942 to 1947, five milestones were achieved for the country's independence.
These five, that is, from 2017 to 2022, India should do the same for the future of the country.
After five years, we celebrate the diamond jubilee of the independence of the country.
Therefore, we have to make a firm resolve today.
2017 should be done in our cultural year .
Every Indian, every social institution, regional department of local bodies, schools, colleges, different institutions, each one of us is committed to the cause of a New India.
Come, let us be a part of this cultural festival.
Since we are nowhere else, we are definitely online, today I particularly urge my young friends and my young friends to come forward and contribute with innovative ways to build a New India.
Using technology, bring new ideas like video, post, blogs, businessmen and new ideas.
We will not forget this question as a people .
In the Narendra Modi App, we are also launching the uit India uiz for our young friends.
This uiz helps the youth of our country to connect with the glorious history of our country and introduce the leaders of freedom struggle.
I believe that you will make an extensive proposal for this effort and spread all the directions.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, we get an opportunity to talk to the people of the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort as the Prime Minister's Servant.
Hundreds of crores of people sound from the Red Fort .
In the last three years, on 15th August, I have been giving suggestions and suggestions on what should be said and what should be said about the country from every corner of the country.
This time also, I invite you to send your ideas to MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
In the last three years of August 15 , I heard that my labor is taking a long time .
That is why I decided to reduce the time of my progress this time .
My dear countrymen, I would like to talk about one more thing.
There is a social economy in the economy of India .
We should never consider it less .
Our festivals , our festivals are not only fun .
Our festivals and social reform programmes are also there in our festivals.
But at the same time, every festival of ours is directly associated with the economic life of a poor person.
In some days Raksha Bandhan , Janmashtami , Vinayak Chandra , Chandra , Anant Chaturdashi , Durga Puja , Deepavali .
Rakhi is being made in small cottage industries in lakhs of families from a few months prior to Rakhi on the economy.
The day-to-day business of lakhs of people making Rakhis, Rakhis, sweets and sweets are part of a festival.
Our poor brothers and sisters, the families of those who had spent their lives because of these things.
This is not just a festival of lights, it is not just a festival of lights for a house.
The relation to it is directly related to the poor families of making small soils .
But today, I want to talk about festivals, about the economy of the poor who are associated with those festivals, and about the environment as well.
Sometimes I feel that the people of my country are more active , active .
In the last days of the last month the best people were written to me .
125 years, 125 crore people of the country.
At the same time we say that for the protection of environment we should worship Ganesh , that is , soil Ganesha .
I congratulate all the people of the country for the various festivals coming in.
My dear countrymen, education sector, economic sector, social sector, sports, our girls continue to name the country and give new goals.
All the people of our country are proud to see our girls.
In some days cricket hair of our country has exhibited a unique game in the world competitions .
In this week I got the opportunity to become Bhenti with those games .
It gives me great pleasure to talk to them, but I have noticed that they are not able to win the World Cup.
In their Mughals also that depression , pressure has been removed .
When the players of India were smitten then we saw in many games to break them with anger .
You have won the hearts of 125 crore people without winning the match.
I tell those players that they are really young in our country, especially our girls.
Once again, my heartiest congratulations and best wishes to the youth of the country, especially to our girls.
I also remember that 2022 AD , 75 years of our independence .
Every citizen of the country should make a five-year roadmap for his resolve and resolve.
The future of the country , future is the best belief .
Blessed is the blessedness of all of you .
The more we are in conflict, the more we are in stress, the more we can live each other's own life or the lives of the people - the more we get excited about the years to come.
Jagannath Rath Yatra is being held in many parts of the country, with great reverence.
This festival is now being celebrated in some parts of the world as well.
People of Arunachal Pradesh have developed a deep experience with Lord Jagannath .
Lord Jagannath is a worshiper of the poor.
I convey my greetings and good wishes to all the people of the country on the auspicious occasion of Jagannath Rath Yatra.I bow down to Bhagwan Jagannath Ji.
Unity in diversity is also one of the specialties of India.
A family of about 3.5 thousand Muslim brothers and sisters reside in that small village.
On the occasion of Ramzan, he decided to join the rural communities to build toilets.
Uttarakhand and Haryana also joined the list this week.
But our habit will not change.
Cleanliness is also the same.
We have to constantly strive to get rid of such evils.
The incident took place in Vijaynagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
Its goal is that at the time of hundred hours the construction of 10 thousand toilets in Panchayatti .
People of my country , during an hundred hours the government , people of my country , the opportunity of making ten thousand toilets together gives you immense happiness .
71 villages changed into villages without excretion .
I congratulate the people working in the government, the government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijaynagar district for making Bhagirathi a role model for others.
I have been discussing about Mann Ki Baat in the recent past and several suggestions have been received from the people and some suggestions have been received on the NarendraModiApp and some suggestions have been received on MyGov.
Prosperity is not just a system but a culture.
There is a need for constant vigil on the public health and therefore, we have to take care of the issues that disturb the democracy.
First of all the good things related to delivery .
June 1975 became a night of 25th Teeeeth .
At that time Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also bound in Karagarh .
One year has passed and one year has passed since the Kumbh of India which was stuck in the hands of the infamous bird-lover, trapped in the clutches of the wicked, the people who were trapped in the clutches of the untouchables, stood out of their homes and raised the voice of slavery. One year has passed and one year has passed since the days of the shaking of a blind eye, the one year has passed and one year has passed.
In such a situation the people worshipping the poet of Saagar were fighting fast .
In the coming days from the waterfalls to the mountains, all the people welcomed the sun's rays.
This is the pride of all Indians.
All the countries of the world have put 21 yogasanas on June .
In China, Yoga at Great Wall of China has been practiced at 2,400 metres above sea level at the World Heritage Site of Machu in Peru.
Yoga was performed at the Eiffel Tower in France.
In the UAE, more than 4000 people have collectively performed Yoga at Abu Dhabi.
The event was attended by all the staff of the UN and the emissaries of the UN.
This time Yoga records have broken worldwide .
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, nearly 55,000 people have together performed yoga and created a new world record.
I got the opportunity to participate in the yoga program happening in Lucknow .
But I had the fortune of yoga in the rains for the first time .
Our soldiers also performed yoga in Siachen, which was 20, 25, 40 degrees Celsius.
Some TVs have come in the chests related to it .
At the same time we should understand that yoga is a unique medium for Bhadrata .
The Prime Minister said, "I speak to Dr. Anil Sonara from Ahmedabad in Gujarat, by the Honourable Prime Minister.
I want to give you a question .
Whether we can do it throughout the country
I gave me the opportunity to remember the forgetting the grains of the corners .
When I became the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I decided to give books instead of bouquets or welcome them with a handkerchief.
Immediately I started giving instructions to the government officers .
Gradually change a part of our nature .
One flower blooms for some time .
Take it in hand once , leave it .
I am talking about such things which have historical value.
And it came to pass in the last year , when he went to London , that the British queen Elizabet called me to eat .
A ray of light shines in her eyes when she gives me a ray of hope.
On the day of his marriage the ruins of this hand Mahatma Gandhi had given him in the context of his marriage , this was left .
It is surprising to keep the beauty of Mahatma Gandhi at home with the queen of Elizabeth .
The smaller gift given by Mahatma Gandhi Gandhiji remains a historical thing in her life .
I know that such good habits come to night .
There is complete transparentness .
The details of the requirements of the persons registered with the e-GeM shall be examined by the Government officials.
Because of no medieval things are available .
In this effort 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan , Britain , America are also participating along with India .
With the help of these Nanosatellites, many innovations can be done in the field of agriculture.
I am reminded of the events that took place a few days ago, ISRO successfully used GSAT 19.
This is very heavy in the museum sent in the space of India .
June 19th honeymoon was completed for a thousand days .
You all know that for Mars mission we have chosen a place successfully in space .
The duration of the mission is 6 months.
To complete a thousand days is an important step in the space journey .
Along with studies, the youth are also participating in the sports activities - all these are the symbols of the future of their bright future .
With the success of our sportspersons, our country has reached a glorious stage in the field of sports and our fame has spread all over the world.
Recently, Badminton player of our country, Shri Kedambi Shrikanth, won the opening ceremony of Indonesia.
I heartily congratulate Shrikanth and his coach for this great victory.
In the development of personality sports play a unique role .
Sports are very important in the construction of the person .
There is no dearth of every part of our country .
If children like in our families then give opportunity to the water in the sports .
It is not possible to change books by bringing water from the field , binding in the room .
They should take a lead in the field of sports as well as in the field of sports where students are interested in sports, in school, in art and in the family.
In the context of coming Olivex all Indians move forward in the direction of new dreams .
But the rainy season is waiting for rains .
I am talking with you today the sacred Ranjan month of this day .
My heartiest greetings to the people of India and the entire world, especially to the Muslim community on the auspicious occasion of Ramzan.
In the month of Ranjan prayer , spiritual , spiritual , philosophy is given very special importance .
It is indeed our privilege that our ancestors have made us a proud tradition of all our Indians.
It is a matter of pride for all the traditions of the world to be present in our country for the hundred crore Indians.
There are goods in our country , guests .
It is said that the idol is dedicated , the idol is opposite to the idol .
Such places of worship such as Siddhatu, such a tradition that we all can fine tune our chords of art.
Dharamshala , traditional , principles , customs give us a message - peace , unity , goodwill .
This sacred Ranjan helps in the journey ahead of the path of peace , unity , goodness .
I want to tell everyone the next time.
Many people gave me a lot of happiness to give it every moment .
Everybody has enthusiasm to tell their things .
I could not read everything, I could not hear every message at least, and most of the messages were received.
But I have seen that some try to learn music , some try to learn new musical instruments , some try to learn new things with the help of the youth , some try to learn new languages .
Some are learning , some are learning to dance , some are learning to dance , some have started coming to poets .
Try to know about nature , living in the direction of understanding .
I'd like to tell you a phone call as well.
PM said, "I am talking about Diksha Kalyal.
I read all the habit of reading .
Therefore I decided to read again in these holidays .
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I understood that how much struggle we had to fight to give freedom to India, how many sacrifices we had to pay, all the freedom fighters spent years in jail.
How much fame in the small age I was influenced by Bhagat Singh .
Therefore, I would like you to give a message to the youth about this.
It gives me great pleasure to inform our youth about the history of our country, about our freedom fighters and about those who sacrificed their lives for the country.
The great men who were numbered had lost their youth in jail .
Those great men who spent their entire week in the jails used to do great work like reading, writing etc.
We all know that the secrets of India have given a lot of strength to the country's independence.
Several years ago, I visited the Cellular Jail in Andaman Nicobar.
The poets were coming on the walls .
He was bound in a small dark room .
How did freedom lovers feel .
When I read Savarkar's book 'Maji Janmathe', I am interested to see the Cellular Jail.
There's also a light and sound show that's very inspiring.
I would like to tell the youth of the country that what kind of suffering people had to suffer for our freedom, how many difficulties they had to face in the Cellular Jail, why it was Kalapani or Kalapani.
If you can also, in a way, go to this pilgrimage site related to our freedom struggle.
People of my country , June is a Monday in 5 months .
One more thing to say is Back to Basics.
If you want to contact with nature , increase the bet platform .
Who can say this better than Mahatma Gandhi ?
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times: One must carry out a world one will not see.
That is, we need to think about the world we dont see.
You must have noticed that when the power of nature is exhausted, the water of a glass is so hot that it refreshes itself and becomes fresh.
On getting tired properly the windows of the room open , opening the doors , while sucking the fresh air new consciousness comes .
Therefore, the world effort to fight against the 5th of June should also be our own effort.
Our ancestors are now available as a result of protecting environment .
We have told the reason of cleanliness of our cleanliness .
When Buddha came to know of Lord Buddha, it was said that the birth of Lord Buddha, his wisdom was attained, and his Mahaparinirvana was built under a tree three years ago.
Reading , education , city residents , villages , tribals , tribals , nature lovers , nature lovers are naturally part of their social life .
But we need to add these things with modern definitions and modern ideas.
In the midst of this I got carpets from the states .
That is , in approximately all the states the program of planting plants at a height starts .
Plants are planted in crores .
Yoga exercise is not only yoga .
Two days ago, keeping in mind the Yoga Day, I had come across all the governments and the entire world.
Recently, I announced a few competitions related to Yoga and also announced a few prizes.
Slowly the tasks move forward in that direction .
It is a very interesting advice .
Adopt those photographs by putting yogasanas together , parents , mothers , mothers , mothers , sons , sons , three generations .
Yesterday, today, tomorrow, this beautiful yoga festival gives a new dimension to yoga and I thank all those who have given this advice.
As we have gained a lot of interest in Selfie with Doctor's way of life.
These three generations of yogasana their photographs will definitely give fame to the country and the world .
Wherever they have done yoga , they do yogasanas together , definitely send me the photographs of yogasana .
In a way it is called pravative health care park .
Since then till now I have been tourists in various kinds of gifts in India .
While returning I saw that some were doing very minutely , where are they going ?
If you hear this phone call then it will be understood .
Modi ji, I have often seen in TV or social media that people are paying special attention to cleanliness everywhere you go.
On your invitation people have gathered in Mumbai and Surat and have adopted cleanliness as a grand initiative.
The cleanliness drive that you have started from Kashi Ghat has become a movement inspired by you.
Wherever I go, the government machinery will organize a cleanliness drive, but cleanliness has also become a function in the middle society.
Five days before I leave, seven days ago, ten days ago, a massive cleanliness drive will be organized.
Do not know how much of all these things of the country do not consider this thing , how much fun I can imagine .
I would also like to congratulate all those who are encouraging this cleanliness drive.
Someone gave me some advice .
Actually the advice of reality is very good .
I do not know whether I can do it .
Modi Garu, what kind of tourism would you like when you decide to visit, what kind of tourism would you like to call him Babu, how much would your cleanliness level
The solution is very good but I should think .
But it is a very good thing to give a gift of cleaning the garbage of tonnes than what is being given a lot of things.
By doing this many people are saved from the grip of disease .
The Government of India has decided to launch a massive programme of waste management with the help of State Governments and Urban Representatives.
On the occasion of World Environment Day on 5th June, around 4000 cities of the country are being provided with tools to integrate solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of dustbins are available - one in green colored dubs and the other in blue color.
All these will work well in the fields and if the fields are green, what will be the sign of green stubble burning
The second type of garbage bins are covered under a variety of dry provisions like hand washbasin, coir, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, polythene, broken bins, rubber, metal etc which are required to be recycled in the machines.
You must have heard that in the last few days, the Versova beach of Mumbai, which was called a wasteland, has turned into a clean and beautiful beach today.
For nearly 80-90 weeks, the residents of these Versova Beaches had to face difficulties and changed the face of the Varsova Beach.Today, after thousands of tons of garbage was removed from the place, the Varsova Beach became clean and beautiful.
Its full responsibility is taken by viros velocity volunteer (VRV).
Shri Afroz Shah, was engaged in this work since October 1, 2015 and gradually became a mass movement.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15-15 months, the government is counting on newspapers, TV channels, and on social media to complete three years.
Three years ago you entrusted me the responsibility of 'Prime Minister's Servant'.
Several symptoms , opinions have been done .
All these processes I accept healthy information .
In every test all these three feet have been tested .
Everybody of every part of the society has polluted it .
There is an excellent process in delivery .
I would also like to thank all those who have provided a crucial and important food bank.
If you come to the light of Lot , Lopal then you get the opportunity to recover them .
The thing is good , something good , something bad , learning something from it , walk ahead with it only in the evening .
The negative examination gives strength to the delivery .
This brainstorming is essential for a vibrant country and a vibrant nation.
This is the thing that many families were written to me .
One person , one ordinary powder this incident has increased my enthusiasm with my enthusiasm .
I would be grateful to the Honourable President and the Vice President and Speaker of the Republic of Guinea for giving me the opportunity to speak in Mann Ki Baat at such a large scale.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given a new dimension to the program.
My friends, while working on the book Mann Ki Baat, also talked to me at times.
I'll be grateful to Akbar.
My dear countrymen, this time when we meet, there will be widespread rains all over the country, and the atmosphere will change.
Come, let us move forward by loveing nature in this environment.
Blessed is my generation for all of you .
O ye people of my country , salutation .
Probably arrangement , people have become a habit of these problems .
The subjects of children , youth , the feeling of elders etc . have been seen in my sight .
While traveling in bus , train someone gets coughing , immediately someone comes and gives some advice .
Advice , information is that we are in our nature .
Many people try to reach me , advice to give advice to give me something or the other in their life .
With the instrument of some good jobs keep changing their intelligence , strength , capacity according to the situations .
Some people tell their advices at the place of working , the rest of the people who have heard that they have also made a comprehensive form with the purpose of changing everyone .
Not only this when I proposed something then it would be very happy to remember such things .
After that, in Narendra Modi App and MyGov, many people from all over the country have made innovative efforts to ensure that food is not wasted.
I also sent some videos .
There are roti banks at some places .
May is the establishment day of the states of Maharashtra , Gujarat .
This conclusion is many ruins of the people of both these states .
Both the states have made continuous efforts to overcome many new developmental peaks and have contributed to the progress of the country.
In both the states, the life of the great men continues to inspire us in every field of the society.
Remembering these great men, let us make a pledge that by the year 2022, where we will be able to take our states, our country, our society, our cities and our families to the 75 years of our independence, on the day of the subjugation of the state.
We have to prepare a plan to realise this resolve and move forward with the help of all the people.
On the second time these two states are many ruins of my states .
The rapidity of summers living in the months of May , June in our country this time has to be felt in the month of March , April .
Therefore, this time when I seek advice for words in my mind, most of the advices have been given to take any precautions during this summer.
All these are in the public domain and are not new, but it is also good to remember them at the right time.
He said that water should be kept in balcony and para phenna for birds.
In many families small children have also seen this work .
Once this work comes to their notice, they keep going to see if the bird comes ten times a day or if there is water in a kept bowl .
It makes us such a game but in reality it is a unique experience to raise courage in the mind .
Although in our country everybody knows about animals , nature 's living with nature but it is necessary to give strength to such efforts .
When I was the chief minister of Gujarat then the Guru of Dawoodi Bohra society came for hundred years .
He lived an hundred three times .
On the occasion of his hundred birthday the society of Bohra society has run a very big garden for the preservation of pictures by their Burhani Foundation .
I got the opportunity to start it .
He has sent approximately 50 thousand bird officers throughout the world .
This has also been reported in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we were not able to take so much that they were wearing pepper , milk , vegetables , pistine , such a summers who drink good water in this summer days .
Young friends, I want to tell you a few things as well.
Sometimes I feel scared that many of our youngsters like to lead their lives in the comfort zone.
Mother parents also participate in a safe environment .
The residents of these zones are asymptomatic but would mostly be found in the containment zones.
Now they are able to get tested , to enjoy the holidays .
After the summers of summers the cosmetics are good .
I want to tell you how to spend your summers like a friend .
It is believed that I am able to use some definitely .
If you want to hear this , do not think , do not think , go to unknown place .
Try new places , new experiences , new talent .
I wish that you should try to know what is your interest in these summer holidays .
Make new use .
Use should be positive and you should be taken out of your comfort zone.
We belong to the middle class and belong to a happy family.
What is the matter with those passengers, what do they do when they get down at the station
In the evening go to the bus standing moment with your foot ball , Vali Balno or some other sports .
Play with that poor child yourself , see that you will get the joy of never getting in life in that game .
If the children living such life in the society get the opportunity to play with you then do not know what change comes in their life .
I can say with confidence that if you go once again, you will be allowed to go again.
This experience will teach you a lot .
To reduce technological distances , to destroy the borders , but its adverse effect has changed as if six humans living in one house are in one room as well as if they are in one room between them are also beautiful to imagine me .
Can you try to spend time with you away from technology ?
We are a country full of diversity and we get to learn something or the other in our neighbourhood.
Try to give something or the other on your earnings, if you don't have a drink, if you don't have a drink, if you don't have a drink, you will be able to save the hidden human being.
If we feel small tasks then we can not learn some tasks on our mind .
You can learn to walk for cars but when you want to learn auto rickshaw ?
You may be coming for a cycle but have you ever tried to drive a three-wheeler carrying people .
You see, these new efforts and new skills will not only make you happy, but will also help in pulling your life out of it, which has been tied to a single framework.
Keep showing the Indrajas for your friends .
I am telling with my experience , how much we are able to learn the world , how much we can not even imagine .
New places , new villages , new cities , new villages , new villages , new places .
But if you go where you are going before going, if you try to get a glimpse of that place, if you try to know, talk to the people, ask them, then it will be a different pleasure to see those places.
Therefore you will get the opportunity to learn how much .
Friends, This time the Indian government has also given you a good opportunity.
New generations are getting rid of the close proximity of cash.
They do not need the river .
They started believing digital currency .
Do you also believe it , but do you ever think that you can gain from this plan ?
The Government of India has made a plan .
Would you have been using to download the BHIM app.
Send it to each other .
If you want to stay with twenty people in the day then you will get two rupees in the evening .
This plan is implemented till 14th October .
In this way, you will be helpful in making Digital India.
New India will become your guard .
The holidays , a gift to the holidays .
Repeat .
Normally there is an extreme climate of VIP culture in our country .
Now even if red light has gone on vehicles , the red light entered in the brain has not been able to say loudly .
Greetings to Prime Minister Garu from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I'd like to talk about the government's decided Red beacon Light Ban.
It seemed very pride to me .
Now my time is also so important that I have enjoyed .
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic jam and don't have to wait for each other.
I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this decision.
The Red Fort is a part of the Red Fort by the Government .
The concept of New India is going to increase the importance of EPI in place of VIPs in the country.
In place of VIPs, it is clear to me that every person is an important person.
There is importance of every person , every person has importance .
If we accept the importance of 125 crore people of the country , if 125 crore people of the country accept the importance of 125 crore people then how big power is to fulfil great dreams .
We all should do this work together .
Dear fellow citizens, I would always like to remind you of our history, our culture and tradition.
Therefore we get energy , inspiration .
This year we will celebrate the thousandth birth anniversary of the 125 crore people of our country Swami Ramanujacharya.
Because of some reason we are not able to take so much that how small is thinking that more than one century we are thinking .
Take a cosmetic .
Even today it is so difficult to come out to the society .
How to stay in front of a thousand ?
Ramajas had done very big fight against the bad , descriptions of the society , internationality , species etc . during their time .
They were hungry all those who take the society through their own jewellery .
Before a thousand years he got the permission to give them entry into the house , and they were given permission to enter into the house of all them .
It is our good fortune that in every era, great men and women from all over our society keep on fighting the evils of the society.
Today, we are celebrating the 100th birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya. Let us rededicate ourselves to the cause of unity in our quest for social integration.
To morrow the Government of India has released a Tapla Billa in the memory of one May to morrow .
I am telling the guests of Swami Ramjunjas , telling the guests of Adarpur .
Dear fellow citizens, Tomorrow is the 1st of May.
It is celebrated in many parts of the world as Labour Day.
When it came to pass on the day of the workers , when they discussed about the labours , then it is natural for me to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar ji .
Today, when I mention Babasaheb Ambedkar, and the Swami Ramanujacharya of Karnataka, the 12th century saint and social reformer Jagadguru Basaveshwara ji of Karnataka.
In the 12th century, he took a keen interest in Kannada language, about labour and labour.
And he said unto them , Behold , he is a Kaikey , and Kailash .
It means, you will be able to get the benefit of 'Sivaji' home with your industry.
That is , by doing karma heaven is available .
If you want to say in other words , Lord Shiva .
Today when I talk about the workers then it is natural to remember the Ganges of Dattop Tingdi .
My dear countrymen, in a few days we celebrate Buddha Purnima.
All the followers of Lord Buddha are celebrated worldwide .
On the full day of Buddha it is my fortune to celebrate Vesak day by the University states .
This desert is done in Sri Lanka .
On this sacred day I get the opportunity to offer a Diwali to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka .
The opportunity to remember their memories is available .
My dear countrymen, in India, we have always tried to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'.
When we talk of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' in India, it comes not only to India but also to the world.
Especially our neighbouring countries are also known .
Our two countries should be associated with each other , the development of the developed countries .
Many experiments are done .
On 5th May the use of south - Asia museum of India .
This museum is capable of capacity , how useful is it to fulfil the economic , development of south - Asia .
This satellite will help in mapping the natural resources, tele-medicine and the knowledge base with high concentration and greater interaction among the people.
My dear countrymen, the sunshine is fast, save yourselves and save yourself.
Most of the families of the country are engaged in the test of their children .
In the families of those who have been tested , the atmosphere of cosmetics , tests done in the families of the families , where there is an atmosphere of stress .
In such a time, I can only say: listen to what I have said to the students in Mann Ki Baat last time.
In a historic war done against unrighteousness Bangladesh has achieved victory without any victory in the leadership of Bangladesh .
On such a special day, I convey my best wishes to the brothers and sisters of independent Bangladesh, on the occasion of the Independence Day and wish Bangladesh all the best in the field of development.
As a strong partner and a good friend of Bangladesh, together with you, India will continue to extend its full cooperation to protect the peace and security of this region and to take steps towards its development.
The memories of our Ravindranath Tagore are pride with the heritage of our two countries .
Because Bangladesh is the confluence of our Guru Ravindranath Tagore .
It is interesting to note that in 1913, the Nobel Prize was conferred on him by the first person and the British.
In 1919, when the British created the death of Jalianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindra Nath Tagore was also one of the great men who had taken the opposite of them .
This incident is a time to show strong effect on the mind of a child .
In the childhood of playing playing this Jalianwala Bagh has given an inspiration to the life of that child .
In 1919 this small part of the twelveteenth century is the favorite , inspiration of all of us .
On the 23th day of the month of March , on the 23th day of the month of March , he climbed the English of Sukh Dev , Rajguru Lucknow .
This incident is known to all of us that without the death of three of Bhagat Singh , Sukh Dev , Rajguru , the joy of serving us of India has remained.
We cannot put the story of sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
The British empire was afraid of these three .
When they were in the jail , how was the brush of the brush in softly with them .
Therefore in the month of March one has to implement the training of hanging on the 24th day of the month of March 23th day of the month of March .
Besides this the stealing of their dead bodys brought to the Punjab region of today .
Many years ago when I went to that place for the first time then a kind of impressions were present in my body .
Whenever an opportunity arises, I urge the youth of the country to visit the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru and Rajguru by going to Punjab.
At that time the call for freedom, its intensity and its scale were increasing.
They like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru on the one hand inspired the youth for the armed revolution.
Right before the bridge of Italy the museum of Mahatma Gandhi was established in 1917 on the 10th day of April 1917 .
This is the year of Champaran Satyal Museum .
In the fight for India's freedom, Gandhi Wadda , Gandhiji 's behavior style was known for the first time during Champaran .
This event marks a milestone in the entire journey of our freedom struggle, especially in the fight against Corona.
It was during this period that the Champaran Satyagraha, the Kheda Satyagrah, and the mill workers of Ahmedabad, all of which have a strong impact on Mahatma Gandhis thoughts and behavioral style.
A man who returned to India in 1915 was only two-fold.
The collection of people , the power to know the pulse of Indian society , the power of its way , the poor people of the British empire , the illiterate people , to fight , to inspire , to fight , to fight , etc . have shown the unique powers of Mahatma Gandhi , that is why we can visit the world of Mahatma Gandhi .
If one person starts knowing about Gandhi Garden during the Champaran Satyal Museum , then it is important to know how much Champaran Museum started from normal life .
How to start a normal life, how much industry Gandhi himself has done, he can learn from it.
Rajendra Bab , Acharya Kriplani Giri had sent the village of Gandhi ji at the same time .
How did he learn the color of freedom struggle in association with the people.
A unique balance is in the work style of Gandhi Garden .
The desire of hundred crore people to bring change , this is the strong foundation of India , India .
There's a desire, a resolve, a enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, if we come out of the mind-set of life, if we look at what is happening in the society, if we try to understand what is happening around us, and if we try to understand what is happening around us then the goal is to ensure that people do something for the society and the society, for the victims, for the victims, for the poor.
They are doing their work like a penance, a meditation, a dumb servant.
There are many people who go to the hospital everyday .
Blood i . . along with blood donation is there .
There are many people giving food facilities to food habits .
Once on seeing its community , incident form it is known with such a big strength .
All these are not celebrated with the budget evening , government 's first government , government money .
But you see the country, the dream of the people of 100 crore people of the country, New India seems to be relevant in front of our eyes.
It is to be said that every citizen must abide by the civic duty and take responsibility.
Then on its own the same New India starts a ruins .
By 2022, when India will complete 75 years of independence, let us remember Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
We want to recognize the truth .
Can we also participate in the journey of 'Surajya to Surajya' by establishing our lives and making resolutions
In the last few months, a lot of people in our country have joined the Digital Payments, Digi-dhan Abhiyan.
There is a lot of increase in the way of various digital payments after the cancellation of the mouth.
About 1.5 crore people have downloaded the app while it is only two and a half months since the launch of BHIM app.
People of my country, black money, we have to move forward in the fight against water.
Can a hundred and fifty crore people of this country make a pledge of making two and a half thousand crore digital transactions of this year
We declared in the budget.
If this work done for hundred crores of people of the country then they did not work for a year .
You can complete in six months .
All these can be done in daily life .
No matter how much service you can serve in the country, you cant imagine that in the fight against black money and water, you can become a soldier.
Several programs have been organized in the last few days to make people aware , to make people aware .
Such hundred programs in the country have been contributed to Japanese .
80 - 85 programs were done .
And the princes which were made for traders were seventy thousand .
Everybody wanted to lead this work ahead .
Earlier, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April, this Digi Mela ends.
On the completion of hundred days a big last program was celebrated .
The biggest dresses are built in it .
I am confident that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary will continue to be celebrated as far as we are concerned.
We have worked hard to reduce the usage of cash and also to reduce the behavior with mouth.
My dear countrymen, every time I ask my advice for Mann Ki Baat, I am delighted to have some kind of suggestions.
But in the matter of cleanliness pills keep listening to every time .
Gayatri, a girl from class 11, who is also a student of class 11, has phoned from Dehradun and sent a message from Dehradun, saying, "I bow to the Honourable Prime Minister Guru, Prime Minister Garu and I bow down to you.
First of all, many good wishes to you all for your victory in these so many numbers.
I want to speak in my mind .
I want to tell people how important cleanliness is .
People travel everyday on a river polluted by putting a lot of garbage .
This river comes to our house on the Rispana bridge .
I am recognizing it .
I want to be angry with the anger of uncleanness in the minds of hundred crore people .
Once the anger starts , if we start getting satisfied , then we apply something or the other incontinence .
If you are very active , active part , then how important is their importance .
But cleanliness is always covered with a habit .
I believe that the same spirit that has been awakened among the youth, among the youth, among the youth, in the youth, in the youth of the country, is a good result.
We know that if we have eaten at home , in community lunch also we take food in our lunch more than necessary .
After putting everything in the eye it becomes difficult to eat .
Half of them wearing in Kanchenjunga are also not able to put in the stomach , leaving there .
Have you ever thought how much harm we are leaving these sour things ?
If you do not leave it on swallowing , then do you ever think that the stomach of all lice is full ?
It is not a subject to be understood .
It is said that in our houses the smaller children can eat as much as they can eat .
But this is such a thing that family is also good for family .
They made some mobile apps.
You will find such people somewhere in every state of our country .
Water life also does not leave us flying , as much as we can eat , it gives support .
See , these paths are available for change .
Those who take care of body , health care they say that keep a little empty in the stomach , keep a little empty in the eye .
Therefore it is a matter of health that April is the 7th day of the World Health Organisation .
The United Nations has set a target of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030.
This time the 7th April of the United Nations has focused on depression during the World Health Day.
According to an estimate, more than 35 crore people around the world are suffering from mental depression.
The danger is that we have seen it among those around us and we also like to talk about it better.
Even a person who is a victim of depression does not talk about it because even that person is ashamed to discuss it.
I want to tell the people of the country that they should not feel free from depression.
On making a mental environment relief starts getting rid of .
The first mantra is that instead of supression x-ray is necessary .
Open your heart with your friends , parents , parents , brethren , what will you do with meditation .
Children living in slums are sometimes distressed by loneliness.
The good fortune of our country is that we have grown into a large family of the common man and there is no size of depression because we are connected with big families.
You believe that they are the first steps towards depression .
This is the best way .
This depression is the cause of physical , mental diseases .
As diabetes is the root of all kinds of diseases , like depression also does not stand , do not stand , do not take decision , do not take decision , do not take decision .
There is also another way .
When you meet others, when you serve selflessly, you can easily lighten the weight of your mind.
June 21 is the third International Day of Yoga.
You too must keep up with your efforts to celebrate mass Yoga Day in the presence of lakhs of people.
If there is any suggestion on this 3rd International Day of Yoga in your minds, then send your suggestions to me through your mobile app and suggest ways.
How many verses and poetical compositions you can make in Yoga can be easily understood by the people.
As there has been a lot of discussion about health, I would like to tell the mothers and sisters one more thing during this time.
In the last few days, the Government of India has taken a major decision.
The number of employees in our country is increasing day by day and their participation in the working class is encouraging.
Along with this there are special responsibilities for women .
Apart from family responsibilities, they also have to participate in financial responsibilities, so that sometimes or sometimes children born are wrong.
Therefore, the Government of India has taken a big decision.
We have now extended maternity leave of 12 weeks to all working women, who are pregnant and in childbirth, to 26 weeks.
In this matter two countries of the world were before us .
Technology has become an inseparable part of our lives .
Flowers develop .
Gardens , forests are filled with greenery .
The forts of birds get stuck to the mind .
Apart from flowers, teeth are also seen shining in the sun from the branches of trees .
The mango of mango coming properly in the summers is seen only in the bridge of mango .
Yellow green mustard increases the estimation of rose flowers .
The red colored flowers give the message of Holi .
The poet Amir Khus Road has described how much more on these moments changing the weather .
And he said , These are the mustards , the mustards , the branches , the branches , the branches , the branches .
"When nature is pleasant, when the environment is pleasant, man also enjoys that environment.
Festivals like Vasant Panchami , Maha Shivratri , Holi etc . fill the colors of happiness in human life .
In an atmosphere of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are going to give a befitting reply to our last month of Falgun.We are ready to welcome the Chaitra in the new month.
The couple of these two months is the season of spring .
Many people do not have any awareness about ISRO's applications at the SWAYAM PRABHA JALAAN, and therefore, you have to use 104 satellites and send some information about the interface missile.
Excellency, Thank you very much for remembering the glorious example of India.
They have acquired a place that is possible only through technology and science - to solve poverty, to protect against diseases and to cover the world with knowledge and information.
2017 2017 15 February is a glorious day for the lives of Indians.
Our scientists have done a great job of lifting our country with pride in front of the world.
He has successfully completed many unique experiments in ISRO in the past few years.
ISRO has set a world record in the space sector a few days ago, after successful experiments such as Mars Mission, Mangalyaan etc.
Once India had created history by sending 104 satellites into space .
It is a matter of great pleasure that PSLV has successfully completed its 38th successful mission.
This is not only an ISRO but also a historic contribution to India.
This space program, which was run by ISRO with minimal expenditure, has become a wonder in the whole world.
This victory of Indian scientists has been appreciated by the whole world with a large heart.
Brothers and sisters, One of the 104 satellites of India is Cartosat 2D.
How useful are the pictures , wildlife maping , economic facilities , development plans , city development plans etc .
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, how to use the source of water in the country and how to take care of it. Cartosat 2D helps us in this matter.
While going to our style some pictures have been sent .
It started its work only .
It is a matter of happiness that all this program has been done by our young scientists , women scientists .
Youth , women , this strong part of this strong part is a glorious subject of success in the victory of Isro .
I congratulate ISRO scientists and the people of the country.
They are also setting new records daily to keep the goal of using space science for the people, for the service of the country and for the service of the people.
Our scientists , their entire Vrindini told how many opinions we were less .
Shobh Garh was also another question related to the Bhadrata of India .
In this matter India has also achieved another important success .
There is no big church about this thing but this special thing has been paid attention to this important thing .
India has also successfully tested the ballistic interceptor missile in the field of defence.
Interception Techniques, who have successfully achieved Kuppukulchi by identifying enemy squirrels from a height of 100 kms from the ground as part of their experiment.
Our Indian scientists have seen this .
And its strength is such that if there is any missile to attack India from a distance of 2000 kilometers, then our missile has the power to destroy it within the space.
When we look at the new technology, it gives us happiness when we get a new scientific victory.
Jignity has played a very important role in human lifes development journey.
Special intelligence , every person does not let his memory remain like a memory .
That is the reason of new research .
The scholars are not able to sleep at peace to their questions .
If we look at the journey of development for thousands of years in human life, then we can say that there is no end to this journey of development.
The same is impossible .
There is a continuous effort to know all the creations , creations , human mind .
Although every new technology , new science gives birth to a new age .
My dear young friends, While we talk about science and the hard-working industries of scientists, I have often said that in Mann Ki Baat, I am trying to increase the attraction of science in our youth.
There is a need of many scientists of the country .
Today scientists become the cause of a permanent change in the lifestyle of the coming generations.
Mahatma Gandhi says that no science has dropped from the scies in a perfect error.
Science must always keep in mind the needs of the common man, how to use his principles naturally, what is the medium for which it is useful, and what is the technology needed, because it is more useful for the common man.
When I saw such creativity, exhibit it, provide information to the people, and how such creative innovations could be useful to the people, how to produce them in a big way, how to use them commercially, etc. I saw how they did a great job.
These are the things which I have seen .
In 2005 maximum rains came in Mumbai .
This means that in the society, in the country and in the country, humans play such a role.
Our society is also very interesting in the direction of technology .
All the behaviors also run in the direction of technology .
In a way, technology is becoming a different part of our lives.
In the last few days the vaginal irrigation of design is very strong .
Slowly people move forward towards digital currency leaving the river .
In India too, digital transactions have grown at a rapid pace.
Especially the youth are becoming a habit of making their digital payments from their mobile phones .
I consider this a good sign .
Just a few days ago, India's Lucky Grahak Yojana and Digi-Vyapar Yojana got a huge boost.
Through these two schemes, an attempt has been made to make cash payments in India a peoples movement.
More than 100 account holders received prizes of Rs. 1 lakh each as part of the scheme.
For more than four thousand traders were found more than fifty thousand .
When I asked about this analysis, I am happy to know that among the awardees, there are not only 15 years of age but also 65 and 75 years of age.
Expressing his happiness, Shri SantoshGadkari from Mysore said he received a thousand rupees under the Lucky Grahak Yojana on the NarendraModiApp.
I felt the price of a thousand rupees which I got , and felt that poor old age , gave her a thousand rupees .
Travellers always keep talking about digital related things .
How enthusiasm , others are also encouraging .
Even a young friend of Maharashtra, who is reading PG from Maharashtra, who uses RuPay card and e-wallet in his family, how much fun he enjoys, shares his experiences with his friends.
It is said that how important is the gift of lakhs to come to itself , he takes it in a garden , encourages others for this .
In my view, everyone associated with this work is a new opposite party of this country .
In a way you're a clean soldier.
April is a dress of 14 crores of rupees .
There are 40,45 days near it .
Can you do any work while remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar ?
Some days creator Baba Saheb Ambedakar had taken the 125th birth .
Keeping them in mind, you also teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM APP.
This time, give special importance to both Baba Saheb and Ambedkar Jayanti, BHIM APP.
Therefore I say that the foundation of Baba Saheb should be strengthened .
125 crore hands should be connected to BHIM APP at the doorstep.
The effect of this garden happening in the last two three months is that how successful in many villages , many villages , many cities .
Dear fellow citizens, Agriculture is a major pillar of our nations economic system.
The economy of the villages gives strength to the economic disease of the country .
I want to tell you a pleasant thing .
Our farmer brothers and sisters have done a lot of hard work and have filled our grains.
This year in our country corn has been produced at the record level with the labour of rails .
All the signals say that our rails were bound all the old records .
This time the fruits in Pola appear as if everyday Pongal , Baisakhi festivals are celebrated .
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country.
This time 8 % more than the record of our rail name Namoda record .
This is the success of flying so much .
I am especially impossible for the farmers of the country .
He said that apart from traditional crops, he has been keeping in mind the poor and has been able to cultivate various varieties of pulses so that the poor get most protein from pulses.
Keeping in mind the need of the poors of the country near about two hundred ninety lakh hectares of fruits of various types of pulses have enjoyed me a lot .
This is not only the production of various types of pulses , but also an important service for the poor people of my country .
My prayers and my prayers are with all of you, the farmers of my country have made a record by putting all their might upon their heads. Therefore, my farmer brothers and sisters, I salute all of you.
Dear fellow citizens, In our country, through the government, society, and institutions, something or the other is happening in the direction of cleanliness.
In a way, it is seen that everyone is behaving wisely in relation to cleanliness in some form or the other.
The government is also constantly trying .
6 houses have been cleared by emptying the toilet pits.
The twin pit toilet was empty and the authorities themselves saw ways to reuse the toilets.
How do we clean other cleanliness , this toilet can also be cleaned in the same way .
Because when an ice authority cleans the toilets itself then it is natural to attract the people of the country .
It's proved too.
For the family of six members a standard tower fills in five toilets .
After that the garbage can be easily turned into another pit .
In six to twelve months the garbage reached in the toilet is completely rotten .
The government takes this in front , others also use such a way .
Even in the government, Swachhta Pakhwada is being organized in different parts of the country.
In the first phase of March, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs along with the Ministry of Women and Child Development is also supporting the cleanliness drive.
We welcomed the exhibition by our Divyang Sportspersons at the Rio Olympics.
Divang friends have the pride of this glorious work .
Always have to learn something from them .
The matter related to sports , space related to space women of our country do not take anyone .
They are moving ahead step by step and increasing the country's stature with their achievements.
Our country's women players won a silver medal in the Asia Ragby Seven Summits that was held in the meantime.
My heartiest congratulations to all of them.
On 8th March the whole world is celebrated on the day of women .
The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is progressing at a rapid pace.
Today this is not just a government program.
It has become a social movement and a mass education program.
In the last two years, this program has attracted the minds of common people.
This problem has been solved by the people from all corners of the country and there has been a change in the thinking of the people about the behavior that has been going on for years.
As soon as the girls were born then how much fun will be enjoyed when they know that the girls are celebrating .
In one way the virus of increasing girls is because of their social freedom .
In the Kadlu district of Tamilnadu state child marriage can be stopped by a special program .
Till now approximately 175 girls can be stopped .
More than 55-60,000 girl child bank accounts have been opened under Sukanya SamriddhiYojana by the district administration.
In addition to the village council management, efforts are also being made by the district administration to adopt girls from the district administration, to provide them education facilities, etc.
In Madhya Pradesh, door-to-door door-to-door system in villages, villages and villages is being run by the name of Har Ghar Dasak to read girls.
ApnaBacha, ApnaVidyalaya is being run in Rajasthan to motivate the girl child to join the school and read it again.
The BetiBachao-BetiPadhao scheme is also going to be in many forms.
This movement has become a peoples movement.
New thoughts are drowned with it .
They are changing them according to the needs of the province .
My dear countrymen, sometimes I get the opportunity to talk to you all through Mann Ki Baat.
You are also playing with activeness .
I think I know from you.
Whatever happens , in villages , poor people want to stay in mind .
I am grateful to you for this cooperation.
Man Ki Bat , August 2019 .
Today our country is enjoying rains on one side .
On the other hand some or the other festival of India , on the other hand all of the fairs of Diwali are held .
Probably our ancestors, in any situation, had created a system of life in the society for the monsoon and the economic cycle of the society.
So far we have celebrated many festivals.
The birth of Shri Krishna Festival has been done in the whole of India .
It is such a personality that despite spending thousands of years, every festival brings a new spirit, a new spirit, a new energy, a new energy, can anyone imagine
Today I am talking to you that there is a thought about two great motors .
One is the Mohan of Sudarshan Chakradhar , one of the Charakhadhar .
And when Sudarshan Chakradhar had left the coast of Yamuna , and went to the sea shore of Gujarat , and established it in the city of Dwarka , then Mohan the son of the sea shore came to the river Yamuna , and spent the last days of life in Delhi .
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan had used his intelligence , story to stop war , to stop war , to stop war , to stop his intelligence , his capacity , his understanding .
At the same time, India is in the process of celebrating another big festival.
This discussion is going on not only in India but all over the world, my dear countrymen.
I am talking about Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary.
He served the rails being identified in Champaranyan .
He himself served the patients with anemia to remove many misconceptions about the disease.
Services have standed for their life only .
We can understand this thing straight from Bapuji 's life .
Mahatma Gandhi used to be the person , society , humans , humanity .
Phenix Farm of African , Tolstoy Farma , Sabarmati Ashram , Wardha Ashram , all the places of the society , community Mobilization were dedicated to them in a special way .
Community Service Community Mobilization is the need of the hour for all of us to inculcate this spirit in our practical lives.
The truth is that this is the true devotion of Mahatma Gandhi , true work .
Let us join the people of the society, join in with all sections of society, and think about what we can do to the society, whether it is a village or a village, whether it is a man or a woman, what I can do to the society as a person.
The cost of the cost of my generation is good .
Community is our strength.
In the program running on this 150 years of the year there was no community , service .
Our woman is Mandali Ladys Club .
We will do the work of the Ladies club in the modern era, but we will join hands with the members of the Ladies club to do some service.
We can do a lot.
130 crore Indians and 130 crore Indians can start sharing their books and sharing their knowledge.
There is no limit - there is a desire in the mind - if a good desire, virtue and goodwill can be served with full dedication then it is enough.
It's also a comfortable comfort - if it's for a strange feeling
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I visited Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha is a turning point in freedom struggle.
I attended the inaugural session of a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
Write three to four things while expressing one's emotions along with those photographs so that others will also get inspired.
Several programs , competitions , exhibitions have been organized during the coming time .
But in this context I want to participate with you an interesting thing .
Venice Beinnell is a famous art exhibition where artists from all over the world come together.
This time, an interesting exhibition was held in the memory of Gandhi at the Indian Bhawan of Venice Beennel.
In this Haripura Palace is specially interesting .
The conclusion of Kangras festival in Haripura of Gujarat , in which the Subhash Chandrabus student of Subhash Chandrabus will be remembered for you .
This art panel has a beautiful past.
Before the Haripura assembly of Kangras, in 1937-38, the then Principal of Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan was invited by Nandalal Bose.
Gandhiji urged the gathering to showcase the life style of the people living in India through art forms and the exhibition of their art works.
The artistic work of our state is this Nandalal Bose .
The state has a special identity .
This Bos Garden has cherished his own with the state of art .
Nandalal Bose made an art cansvas while touring the villages nearby Haripura , finally showing the life of rural India .
There was a great discussion at Venice about this priceless art.
I wish you all the best on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji and wish you all the best in your endeavours.
Do something for the country , for society , for others .
That's Bapu's straight, real, authentic work.
This time it starts from 11 September .
At this time, we came out of our homes and paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi.
But at home , street , pool , but art , but at all public places cleanliness should be done .
This time pay more attention to plastic .
On 15th August 2015, I had said - How the 1.5 billion people of the country did swachhata in the spirit of swachhata and swachhata in the public places - we did the work of getting rid of the spitting in public places.
We all should join hands to stop single-use plastic.
All sections of the society are excited about this campaign.
This will save money and contribute to the protection of environment.
This time, on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Bapuji on 2nd October, we should not only dedicate to the nation, but also lay the foundation for a peoples movement against plastic.
I appeal to all sections of society, to every village, to every city.
This year we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti from plastic garbage of India .
All the Municipalities of the country , corporation , district report , village panchayat government , private arrangements , all the institutions , every person , every person is my opinion that plastic garbage is appropriate for the collection of plastic garbage .
I appeal to all the corporate sector to look at how the plastic waste gets stored in one place and how the disposal can be made possible.
It can be resciled .
It can be made of fuel .
Today I want to say a very important thing with a culture .
There is a lot of importance for food in our culture .
As much as we were also included in science .
Poshan Abhiyan is becoming a peoples movement for nutrition in modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting with malnutrition in new interesting ways .
Once one thing came into my eyes .
In Nasik, a big movement of grain was started which was full of fists.
On the day of harvest, Anganwadi workers will collect one piece of grain from the people.
This grain is used to make women , children hot food .
The person donating this is a conscious citizen of the society .
This culture is celebrated at the time of feeding the child for the first time .
Liquid is not a vegetarian .
Gujarat made a suggestion in 2010 that why should not it be made necessary by giving Complementary Food to the children during Annaprasana.
This is a very important step, which everyone can participate.
In many states people eat food .
A unique function of service , happiness is worth seeing .
Friends, in such a small way, our country can be affected by malnutrition.
Today the right information or poor , rich people are also becoming victims of malnutrition .
September is celebrated across the country as the Poshan Abhiyan.
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was sure that there would be a lot of questions about it, and it happened.
In the last few weeks, wherever I went, I talked to the people about 'Man vs. Wild'.
I did not imagine that whenever the opportunity of touching the hearts of the world comes in my life .
But what happens .
Last week I went to Bhutan.
As the Prime Minister, whenever I visit, I am reminded of one thing: On the occasion of International Yoga Day, somebody will talk to me about Yoga for five-ten minutes, even if there is an occasion to talk to anyone in the world.
The world's largest leader does not discuss Yoga with me and I am telling you about it all over the world.
Discovery Channel has planned to make this program in 165 countries in their language .
Now people want to know the churches taken in the direction of climate , clean environment in our country .
But one more interesting thing is that some people are asking me something or the other while struggling, please tell me this thing that you are speaking in Hindi and do not Hindi for Bear Grylls.
After this do the cost of adventure .
Then what happened to the cost of shooting .
It is questioned very loudly .
Look , there is no secret in it .
There is a question in many minds - Okay, I will tell you this secret now.
Actually this is not secret .
In fact, during the interaction with Bear Grylls, the technology has been completely used.
As soon as I said something, the English translation was done in parallel, so Bear Grylls had a small card lens wrapped in his ear.
Therefore, as I speak in Hindi, it became a good conversation when I was listening to him in English, it was a miracle of technology.
After this Samaria many people are seen discussing about Jim Corbett National Park .
You too must visit nature, wildlife and habitats.
What is nature
You will keep watching .
Your internal also expands .
On 15th August, I had appealed to you from the ramparts of the Red Fort that in the next three years, at least 15 places in India and 15 places in India would be completely tourist destinations.
You go, look, study, take the family, spend some time there.
Your thought will be large .
My dear countrymen, in India, the idea of environment protection, i.e. care is natural.
In the last month I was spectacular to release the population of tiger in the country .
Do you know how many tigers in India ?
Indias tiger population is 2967. Two thousand nine hundred sixty seven.
It was difficult to stay half in this number below some corners .
A Tiger Conference was held in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2010.
In which the number of tigers decreased , information about the number of tigers has been taken .
2022 Kalla is the contribution of double the number of tigers in the world .
But now this is a new India and we will accomplish our goals quickly.
We doubled the tiger numbers in 2019.
Not only tigers in India, but the number of sanctuaries and community reserves has also increased.
While releasing the tiger data I also recognized the Gir lions of Gujarat .
When I responsible responsibility there the residence of lions in the jungles of Gir .
Their number was decreasing .
We took several steps one by one in Gir.
In 2007 the decision of making women guard there .
We have improved the infrastructure for increasing the tourists.
When we talk about nature , wild animals then conservation is done .
But along with protection think about taking this church towards Karnataka .
Therefore, it is not only necessary to protect forests, trees and wild animals, but also provide appropriate environment to grow in the right way.
My dear countrymen, on 11 September 1893, how can we forget the historical teachings of Swami Vivekananda
My dear countrymen, you will remember that 29th August is celebrated as National Sports Day.
On this occasion, we are going to launch a Fit India Movement across our country.
We must keep ourselves fit and make the country fit.
All their descriptions are now told .
Stay on 29 August .
Not only this 02 October is a complete plastic cosage .
In order to get rid of plastic we should participate in all the places of the house , house and house .
I know that in the social media about this matter the dust of the social media .
Come , let us move ahead with a new alternative , new culture , new energy .
I will be waiting for your words, for your suggestions.
Come, let us together create the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters. Let us move forward to realize Gandhi's dreams.
Man ki Bat - word in mind .
O ye people of my beloved country , Namaskar .
On the day of January 26th January 26th January we all celebrated with so much enthusiasm throughout the country .
The Constitution of India, the duty of the people of the country, our dedication to the rights of the people of the country and our democracy, this is a celebration of our country's culture in a way that upholds the values of democracy and values of the people of the country.
But now the responsibility of people in our country , how deep is the church of people , how deep is it not so much .
To morrow January 30 our worship Bapuji is the pilgrimage of Bapuji .
On 30 January 30 in the morning at 11 o'clock in the morning we offer our tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country .
It is a natural way in society , country .
It will also mark two minutes of dedication, commitment and dedication of the Martyrs.
There is a natural example of the army and the security forces in our country.
On this Republic Day, I congratulate all the families of those who were honoured with various awards.
In these books there are many types of Kirti Chakra , Shaurya Chakra , Parma Vishakhapattanam , Vishakhapattanam etc .
We will not only be surprised when we understand their valour and bravery but also get the inspiration from pride.
On the 26th of January, while on the one hand we are excited and excited, our army personnel in Kashmir are engaged in the security of the country and they have been martyred since the breakdown of the snow storm.
I am engraving the honor of all these brave soldiers .
My young friends, you all know very well, I keep talking in my mind continuously.
In January , February , March , April all the months of April are time for every family .
There is a test of two children at home , there is a test on everyone at home .
I thought this was the right time to talk to the student friends, their teachers and their teachers, because wherever I went, I found that these tests were a big problem.
The family, the students, the teachers, all of them seem to be troubled and a strange mental environment is visible in every home.
Seeing them I want to pay attention to the thought that came in my mind .
I received a telephone message from the creation.
Listen to what the creation is saying - Sir, what I want to say to you is a terrible environment in our homes, in our neighborhood, in our society during tests.
Due to this reason students are encouraged by inspiration .
Rejoicing people benefit . people suffering from tension .
Therefore, I mean to say that examinations are just a festival, and consider exams as festivals.
On the occasion of the festival , festival the best time comes out of us .
Our society is also expressed during the festival .
Whatever is the best .
Festival removes the environment test .
Therefore I would like to tell all the parents that you should change the time of these three - four months into an exciting atmosphere .
The fact is that these 3-4 months tests are conducted from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup and from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh.
That's why I call you all "Smil Mor, Scor Mor."
If you pressurize, all the doors will close, the things will not go inside, the things inside will not come out.
Nobody has to say anything .
Why was it remembered that Meera had come out of the pressure .
Therefore , if there is an important medicine to increase memory power then it is Relax .
Through my own experience, I can say that we will forget our thoughts if we are stressed, but when there is Relax, we will remember the things that do not even think.
Therefore, A happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet is the key.
Sometimes it seems that we are not able to see the examination with proper point of view .
It is not a life test .
How you live , how you live , how you want to live , it is not a test of everything .
Apart from testing through the not-book in the class room, many more tests will be conducted in your life, so that the test does not come out of the confusion regarding the fate of life.
G.
The great example of Abdul Kalam ji is in front of all of us.
He wanted to reach the airways .
Not found .
Someone had sent a question to me - "The biggest challenge I have seen in terms of education in this period is that education has become the focus of testing.
That is why I want to know your thoughts about the present direction of education and its future.
"The answer is in their question, but Rukh Garu wanted to know my point of view as well.
You tell me, would you be a family doctor who shows the entire family
You will see his experience , knowledge , how much beneficial he is .
He also spoke of the word "Pratispartha".
This is a big mental war .
The speciality of the life of many May is that they competition with themselves .
It is a wonderful life journey that over twenty years it has been asking its own record and smiting it every time .
Because he has choosed the way of support of Kanna .
Friends, Can you spend three hours in every field of life, even when you go for a test, when you can study peacefully two hours ago
They were not able to get up at the time when they had decided to get up beforehand but are they able to get up at the right time now
Before this the cost of the test is not able to sleep , now it is not able to sleep .
On its own it produces that strength inside .
To be easy to say, if you are competing with someone, you will find three important points - first, that is, you are better than the others.
What did he say - My mother did not read much .
But when I sat with me , he asked me , saying ,
Adopt what is there .
Use it as much capacity as you have, as you are in work, as much as you have time.
If you learn to accept once , main problems end there .
It is believed that in the roots of the problem there is a belief of safety , studies .
Several years ago - we were in the hospital with the heart attack of the person knowing very well .
Then the first speaker of our India Ganesh Dada Mavalkar , his son , one time A . . Purushottam Mavalkar came to see in the hospital .
If we want to say , if we meet the person with disease then we fear him with the name of disease .
I have told the conservations that at times we also move like this with children .
On the day of the test do you want to give the situation of laughing to the child at all times ?
By doing this , the weather changes .
I got a picture phone call.
And he spake not his name .
Why do you understand that he is not able to call his name ?
That is why I started trying a lot .
I tried to find out its methods so that my time has become very old.
It is said that how long time I try to see the burrows , how long time I had spent that time I had to read very well , that time I had got the opportunity .
Seeing the way you see that it flies you towards the way to fail your life .
If you are taken in tests then your life will be destroyed .
If you are not taken then the responsibility of life I do this that the trespass is not able to stay in your mind .
When you have to tell your children then you can not speak clearly in their eyes .
If you also turn your roads into pits, then I have seen that how much talent you use in looking for new methods to look at, how much investment will be made, it will be spent on the methods of looking at your entire creativity.
That is creativeness , on the same time there is no need to see unconsciousness .
Whatever results are available with their own difficulties , therefore the self confidence of increasing self confidence is unique .
Your gurus , your parents anger me .
Because students pay attention to sports , it is generally considered that the meditation of reading studies decreases .
Definitely counsellers .
The rest of the body also needs to be active .
Give breakfast for at least five minutes .
You will know your work easily .
Everyone does not know whether it is my experience .
In such a time taking a deep breath is very beneficial .
There was no room in the room to take breath deep .
If you go to Mugitloko , Daba to see the sky then sit for five minutes deep breathing again .
Some people start reading more than waking up all night but definitely give adequate sleep to the body .
Your concentration increases .
Freshness increases in you .
The capacity of your entire capacity increases very well .
When I participate in how many councils , sometimes my throat starts growing .
Once a folk singer came to meet me .
It is said that while sleeping properly you will get a lot of rest for your voice .
I've never thought of my sleep, snobbing my speech, snobbing my throat.
However, my young friends, you are in the process of testing and I will put you in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I think that my words will definitely give you rest .
The motto of the Coast Guard is Empowerment.
Creator had done the program to clean the sea shore of our country along with their responsibilities .
Thousands of people participate in it .
In the Coast Guard, the women officers are working as watchmen and the Hovercraft Command as well.
As a part of Indian Coast Guard, the conservation of our sea waters is also an important part of the world today, and many congratulations to the Indian Coast Guard for completing 40 years.
Prebravari is a festival of Tarikhun Panchami .
On the day of Vasant Panchami in our country the festival of Saraswati is celebrated .
The opportunity of electricity is considered to be the opportunity of education .
Not only this , today they give inspiration to these people .
This is the inspiration of MeraRang de Basanti Chola.
My best wishes to the people of my country on this auspicious occasion of Basant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat too, the spirit of the sky is filled with new colours.
People are coming from far off places .
The thing in the mind gives me an important opportunity to one with you .
How many ruins are you all .
My dear countrymen, Namaskar. Greetings to all of you on the occasion of Christmas.
Today is the day to place emphasis on service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
We need not comfort for the poor, he said.
He has not only served the poor, but has also served the poor, he added. This is the real empowerment.
The story related to this is very popular .
It is said in this story that a hut of jeeeps is standing near the Kosam .
And when many riches came , they gave many gifts .
After that a poor person came and gave two copper coins .
Seeing one way there is no big price of two copper coins .
At the Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi, I laid the foundation stone of the great Manshi Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre.
Today is also the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
The country will never forget the services of Atal Garden .
Under his leadership, we have also raised the head of the country in the atomic energy.
Party today , parlor member , magnificence , prime minister , prime minister of every role has filled an ideal in every role .
It is said that on his birth day he has to give him good health as if he has to give him good health .
I got the opportunity to work with Atal ji as a worker.
Many memories are shining in front of the eyes .
Today, in the form of a festival of Christmas, the people of the country will be benefitted by two schemes in the form of gifts.
If you want to say in one way , two new substances start .
Everybody wants to learn and learn from each other.
To promote this, the Government of India has started a pro-active scheme for consumers and small traders today, to promote mobile banking and e-payment habit.
To encourage buyers, the Lucky Grahak Yojana and Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana are being launched to promote traders.
Today, on 25th December, 2018, a record number of 15,000 people will be receiving the prize money.
This fifteen thousand people go a lot of Rs . 1000 everybody in Khata .
On 14th April, after three months, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, there will be a bumper draw on this day.
The Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana is mainly for traders.
The businessmen themselves can also include shopping in it to change their business in this way .
Many may be surprised, but today there are 30 crore RuPay cards in India, of which 20 crore are with the poor families and Jan-Dhan accounts.
These 30 crore people can be a part of these gifts immediately .
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to see the rapid increase in awareness on how to use technology in the country, how to use e-payment, how to use online payment etc.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased from 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to encourage it .
How big businessmen can be estimated very straight .
The traders who celebrate digital transactions, develop online payment system instead of money in their business, are exempted from Income Tax.
A committee under the chairmanship of Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Shri Chandrababad Naidu has also been formed to deliberate on various schemes for the same.
But I have also seen that the rest of the governments have also started and implemented several schemes in their own way.
Somebody said, the Government of Assam has decided to give 10 discount to the taxpayers who digitally pay the goods tax and business licence.
50,000 from the Government if the Gramin Bank Departments have made at least 2 digital transactions involving 75 of their customers from January to March, 2017.
It is heartening to note that GNF has registered a 27 increase in sales of fertilizers compared to last year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, the unorganized sector of our life system is very big.
We know that these cools are given in the form of cool , money , jeewellery daily .
But now the residence of the river is being done .
The money is directly in Bank .
My dear countrymen, every month, I urge people to share their ideas and suggestions with each other in their minds.
So, 80,90 of the advices received on MyGov and Narendra Modi App in thousands of numbers have come for the fight against black money and black money.
He said that the third section of the society has not only acknowledged their support but also urged them to take the lead in this fight.
Like water , blackness should not be completely destroyed , for which one has to give more difficult feet , how much strong words were written .
I am grateful to the people of the country who have supported me in many replies.
He said, The steps taken to curb the menace of black money are commendable.
We are all facing difficulties, but we are all fighting against injustice, we are happy to cooperate in this fight.
We are working like a military force against black money and injustice, he said.
But when it is so difficult , when such problems are faced , then the person is true .
I have also had the same problem with you .
But the people of the country stood firm in their resolve, in the midst of all these difficulties, sorrows and sufferings, while working for a better cause, in the spirit of one noble idea, clean and selfless work.
These people are responsible for the true change .
People are the forms of God and their blessings are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people of our country for participating in this Mahayagya on water and black money.
If the person is , institution , political bird everybody has to take pride , chatti .
Why do the rules of repeatedly change ?
This government is for the people of this government .
And on the other hand, I said it on the first day, and the eighth day, this fight is not normal.
When I decided to fight with such powers, they also seek new ways to ship the government continuously .
When we choose such new solutions then we also have to put a suitable solution to face them .
I would like to heartily congratulate the people of my country on one thing.
Is that secret ?
The secret is that the description of Nakka is coming to the people .
More information is available to common people than the number of information that is available through the government system.
This victory available to us is possible because of being very common people .
Can anyone imagine how brave a citizen of my country is by removing such forces ?
Therefore maximum victory is available by the information coming .
The government is built to fight with all such illusions .
Its support is very easy to fight .
The category of the northern archaeologists of the third type is in large numbers .
We took it out and brought it to the Benami Property Act, in so many words.
In the days of coming that chatti also does its work .
What should be done in the country 's literature , January , we will give its first importance .
My dear countrymen, in the last few years, I have spoken in my heart, our farmers have recorded a lot of hard work, they have been able to get out of their fields in the midst of these difficulties.
This is a sign from the point of view of agriculture .
Be it the labourers of this country, the farmers of this country, the youth of this country, the hard work of all of them is creating a new dimension today.
In the last few days, on the global economic platform, India has made its name so glorious in many ways.
Indias rise in the global rankings through various indices is a result of continuous efforts by the people of our country.
Indias ranking in the World Banks Doing Business Report has improved.
According to the World Investment Report by UNCTAD, India has reached third place in the 2016-18 list of economically developed countries.
People of my country , this time the parliament museum of the country has become the identity of the people of the country .
Special exhibitions related to the parlor workers of all the four directions have been done .
President , Maharashtrapati also told their satisfaction .
But even in such a situation, some good things happen and the mind becomes very happy.
In the midst of all the disruptions in the Parliament, the country has been doing an excellent job.
Brothers and sisters, Today, I am very happy and proud to inform you that the bill related to what our government has decided to set up for the Divyangs has been passed in the Parliament.
On this I was blessed to all the members of the Lok Sabha , state .
The crores of the country have also been able to fulfil the waves of Divyas .
Our government is committed for the Divyangs.
All divyang brothers and sisters have also contributed to our efforts and to our faithfulness by winning four medals in the Olympics.
Also, through their delegations, they not only honored the nation but also surprised the people with their capability.
All our Divyang brothers and sisters are also like our citizens.
Today I am very happy that this law made for the welfare of Divyangs will increase their employment opportunities.
Their reservation in Government posts has been increased to 4.
Special provisions have also been made for education, facilities and complaints of Divyangjan.
During the last two years, 4350 camps for Divyangjans have been set up by the Government of India with an outlay of Rs 352 crore and distributed Aids and Assistive Devices to 580,000 Divyangjans.
The government brought this chatti according to the feelings of the IQraj Samvat .
Initially the category of Divangs was 7 types .
But now with the law, it has been changed in 21 different ways and 14 new categories have been brought in.
By getting it there is a chance of judgment , opportunity of many new descriptions for the first time .
Thalassemia , nervous weakness , irritation etc have also been included in this .
Indian cricket team has spent Siris with 4 . diferences by shiping England .
In this some youth games are spectacular .
Test Capeine Virat Kohli has told the symptoms of good quality along with good batting .
Indian cricket team of Spin Baular .
Aswin was adjudged the Cricket of the Year and the Best Test cricketer for the year 2016.
Junior hockey team is available worldwide .
After 15 years, Junior Hockey team got the opportunity to get the World Cup.
These guides are many opinions of all the young players .
This is a very good news for the Indian hockey team.
In the last month our women were also miraculous .
Indian women hockey team won the Asian Champions Trophy for their outstanding performance in the Under-18 Asia Cup a few days ago.
I heartily congratulate all the players of cricket , hockey team .
In the last month, we have enjoyed the festival of Diwali.
Like every year, this time too, I went to the Chinese border to celebrate the festival of Deepavali with the soldiers.
Deepavali is celebrated on the peak of the Himalayas with the ITBP jawans and jawans of the Army.
Also, it is a wonderful coincidence that at a time when the people of the country greeted the nation on the occasion of the festival, the soldiers also took part in it.
Some of them suggested that a coffee table book should be prepared by selecting a few of them.
We are always engaged in the defence of the country.
However, it is still remembered during the festive season.
In fact, this time it has not happened.
Whether we did not feel like staying at home on the occasion of the festival
Deepavali is being celebrated with the 125 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, may this festival of Diwali be celebrated among the soldiers, and may this atmosphere, and these experiences be limited to a few occasions
A few years ago, a large number of villages from Jammu and Kashmir came here to meet me.
He is from Jammu Kashmir Panchayat Conference.
They came from different villages in the valley of Kashmir.
There was a lot of opportunity to talk to them.
This President who has come from the valley of Kashmir has given me a standing ovation.
If we see students appearing in Board examinations in such large numbers, it is an indication that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are determined to bring their bright future, to achieve the best possible development through education.
I congratulate the students who are showing this enthusiasm and their parents, their family members, teachers and all the villagers from the bottom of my heart.
This time I would like to say that all the dear brothers and sisters who are seeking people's suggestions for 'Mann ki Baat' will be able to get a similar feedback.
500, 1000, he added.
Addressing the nation at 8 pm on the 8th of November, I said that I am launching a great scheme to bring about change in the country.
When I take this decision and place this thing before you, Id like to tell all of you that this decision is not ordinary, it is not difficult to get involved with difficulties.
I have also said that this decision is important and it will take 50 days to get out of its impact, but we cant move towards a normal situation.
The work that we have been trying to overcome for the past 70 years will not be easy.
I can fully understand your problems.
500, 1000, on the other hand, such a big country, such a big currency, and this decision has been taken by the whole world, and each and every economist is making a deep analysis of it.
Our country will certainly overcome this problem with all kinds of efforts.
Central Government, State Governments, Local Bodies, 1.25 lakh bank branches, 1.5 lakh workers, over 1.5 lakh post offices and over 1.5 lakh bank friends are engaged in this work all night.
Despite all the difficulties, this work has been considered as a synonym for service of the nation and has been working as a great service.
This is the reason why India has been able to overcome this situation.
In the midst of all these difficulties, I have seen that all the employees of banks and post offices are working.
The real strength will be measured only when the test is conducted.
But the evil path has become so strong that even today, there are no evil ways of doing anything.
Even today, some people are trying to bring this money, this money, this money, the money that has not been counted, and this money should be brought into the system by any means.
In their efforts to save their idiosyncrasies, many societies are looking for path breaking avenues.
My name is Ashish Parre .
I am an ordinary citizen of Tirali village of Tirali Teh Sheil district of Harda district in Madhya Pradesh.
I am with the whole country in this fight.
I am calling from a village tour of Koppal district of Karnataka.
My name is Elappa Velankar.
Rs 500,000 and Rs 1,000 for Naldhan, Assam and the judiciary.
It is a matter of great joy and pride for my country to see the wonderful capabilities of the common man.
People are going there and eating.
But I do not know that marriage will also take place through tea-eating discussions.
Similarly, people are looking for ways of their own.
We can reduce this change as well.
See, what kind of changes are taking place in the villages as well.
This campaign has provided immediate benefit to some people.
In the days of coming the country also benefits .
You are well aware of the fact that the poor people had a habit of paying their dues 2-3 days earlier.
It is the people who are very big and have a big hand, who are asking for money so that they are unable to afford it.
Only 50 per cent tax will be levied by every municipal corporation on the minimum amount of damage.
But this time, after the 8th decision, everyone started running to collect their old notes.
Where are three, three and a half thousand?
Where are 13 thousand crores
There are many such examples to show that the corporate sector has a lot of benefits directly.
Our villages and farmers are the pillars of our economy.
Farmers are looking for ways in the midst of many difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions to give priority to the farmers and the villages.
Small businessmen of our country will be given employment and economic activities will also start moving forward.
Like the big malls, the small shops in the villages will also be able to do their business for 24 hours and we have taken a major decision under the budget because as per my view, when the big malls are traded for 24 hours, why should not the small shopkeepers in the villages get the same opportunity
We have taken several steps to provide loans to them through the MUDRA Yojana.
Millions and crores of rupees have been given loans through the Mudra Yojana to such small traders, because this small business is being done by the people in the form of crores.
And on this occasion, I request all of you, our small business brothers and sisters, to step into the digital world.
You too should download the Bank Apps in your mobile phones.
I hope that you can do business in the entire village on the basis of this technology.
Therefore, I would like to especially urge all the friends of the working class to participate in this scheme as at the end, I have taken such a big decision for the poor people of the country, for the farmers, for the labourers, for the oppressed and the deprived sections of the society.
Today I would especially like to talk to young friends.
We know that a hundred feet less cash-free society is not possible.
You know how many opportunities are there for cashless society, digital banking or mobile banking.
Each bank will provide an online facility.
Each bank has its own wallet.
Several cards are also available.
Through the Jan Dhan Yojana, there are close cards for crores of poor families in India.
Earlier, the use of RuPay card was very low and now the poor have started using RuPay card.
As there are pre-paid card holders in the mobile phone, they also get pre-paid card to pay money in their bank.
This work is easy to send whatsapp messages.
People who do not want to go to school today can also be used to whatsapp, messaging, forward.
Not only this, technology has become so easy today that a big smart phone is also not required for this work.
The cash transfer will also take place through a phone having common facilities.

How to prevent such accidents ?
People of my country , this pain is not only related to a person .
Shri Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a person who made efforts to unite the country after Chanakya, is a witness to this history.
The unity in diversity is the root source of our country .
That is our strength .
The original mantra of Ekadya is a strong foundation for the construction of the best India .
The life of Shri Sardar Patel started with the fight of farmers.
He is a bastard .
Shri Sardar Patel also played a key role in the freedom struggle.
Only Shri Sardar Patel has not given his life to the incidents .
He told me new things to imagination .
These days we hear the name of Amul .
In 1942 he was surrounded by the support of the rails .
This day is the root cause of Amul's prosperity and prosperity for farmers.

The truth is that such rebels are moving away from the path of peace .
In every family parents , schools , art galleries are considered to work at the whole level .
The rails also want to come into their hands quickly , economic activities are hoped properly .
The responsibility of the Government of Kashmir is responsible .
For the protection of Shanti Bhadra the government has to take many churches .

This app has to be used by the youth especially.
The Government of India is also hoped for coming forward for this .
Young people who want to work for cleanliness can participate in it.
Such youth can be sent in various districts as Swachh Bharat workers .
Cleanliness is not only the result of our beliefs , habits .
Cleanliness is not complete as our nature has become our nature .
In this the main friends of the country , mantras , metropolitans , committee are participating .
Churchs are held on all these things .
By donating themselves the students have helped in making approximately 9,000 toilets .

There is a need to go a long way in the field of sports.
Parents are still saying that it is only possible to pay attention to reading.
He said that playing games means losing time.
There is a need to change this thinking.
Almost thousands of people have suggested this.
There is no exhibition as we hope.
Moreover, some sports persons have not even shown the status of an indigenous player in Rio prior to this.
When we look at the medals here, both of us have arrived.
For the first time in many aspects, our Indian sportspersons had displayed remarkable performances across the globe.
In the shooting, Abhinav Bandra was ranked fourth and won the medal in a very short span of time.

After Usha, Lalita Babu became eligible for Track and Field Finance.
The future is ours.
I announced the setting up of a committee.
Plans have to be prepared to move forward with a view to the year 2020, 2024 and 2028.
I also appeal to the state governments that you should also set up such committees.
Every state cant be made.
Each state can be strengthened by choosing 1st and 2nd.
I would also like to request that all sports related events be conducted in an unbiased manner.
The role of a mother in life is the role of a teacher.
We have seen many of the teachers who love more students than themselves.
They ignore their life for their disciples .
Now after the Rio Olympics, we have heard the name of Gopchand.
Today, I see Gopichand as an outstanding teacher.
On the occasion of Teachers Day, I wish him a very happy and emotional experience in the field of sports and his hard work.
He used to say that he is a good teacher when a student is still hidden in a teacher.
Even after being the President, he kept his students alive and spent his life as a teacher.
Participate in a photo or inspiring incident related to your teachers or students with the Narendra Modi App.
He made a religious occasion a celebration of the collective Ganesh Festival, which is also an occasion to awaken the nation.
Tilak gave an inspiring mantra - 'SwaatmaNirbharBharat - JanamHuk'.
Now we are in an independent India.
This time many people have sent me lots of letters on the subject of Ganesh Utsav and Durga Puja.
His words hurt the environment.
Modi ji asked people not to make use of the words of Venkiah with the plaster of Paris in Mann Ki Baat.
We will build the soil garden in accordance with our ancient traditions and practices such as Ganesh idols, we will protect the environment, ponds and rivers.
Small worms and animals in the water are destroyed by the pollution of the water.
We keep learning every moment through saints, sages and saints.
This does not require big studios and big cameras.
Bangladesh is our neighbour.
I express my gratitude to Bangladesh for this commendable job.
I also express my gratitude to the All India Radio friends who are involved in foreign policy.
I have faith in the power of 1.25 billion people of my country.
Thank you all.
Today, the youngsters of Delhi have got the opportunity to spend a few moments with smoke.
I believe that in the coming days, the sports in India will be filled with the enthusiasm of every one of you.
Today, India has organized great events such as Run for Reio, Eat Live and Play in Delhi city.
In a way, it's a tough penance!
How much desire about food you have to leave them all .
Their parents also have to give excitement from behind their children .
Nobody was not able to play at night .
I am also ready to do this work from your generation.
Your country's Prime Minister Postman is ready to work to convey your best wishes to our sportspersons.
You will send greetings by the name of the players in the Narendra Modi Yap .
Your ruins give me the name of my name .
I am talking about Riyo Olivek . . a literature lover , Punjab Central University student Suraj University has sent a poet .
However in all languages the words written in poets , poets , writing them can be independent .
But in this contribution I want to bring this poet sent me to you .
Youth world has glorified the world .
But when we remember Abdul Kalam ji, this picture of India that was full of science, technology and microbes will appear in front of our eyes.
You can not take technology at one level .
If this research meaning if there is no new information then how does the water standing without flowing , how does the pollution spread by increasing the pollution also becomes India .
Without research , without the help of old technology we live with the help of old technology .
Therefore in the youth the government of scientific scientific science , technology has taken many programs .
We will not only sanction 16 lakh rupees for the setting up of these tinkering labs in our schools, but will also pay 16 lakh rupees for their maintenance for five years.
I say that if we talk about the Atal Incubation Centre then in the direction of giving ten crore rupees to India the government has also thought .
Although India has been smitten with many other problems .
We see many problems with daily life .
These scholars encourage the government of India by giving special book to the Government of India .
A true tribute to Dr. Abdul Kalam, that is, in the 21st century, technology for research, innovation, and technology for solving our daily lives, and the ease with which our youth is working, will be a partner in India's development.
It is my belief that it will be a true tribute to Abdul Kalam ji.
The central government associated with the state governments is troubled without strength by mixing the shoulders with the shoulders .
No matter how much leeches , running we are not able to think about us once .
The medicines which are not able to do the work of that patient , fighting with disease , making new medicines , scientific researches are not done , such diseases are not able to spend new problems .
Therefore it is very important to be cautious about disease .
The microbes which spread diseases of tuberculosis , malaria bring changes in our body so much that medicine does not have any effect .
In the medical condition it is called antibiotics .
Therefore, how to use antibiotics, it is also necessary to follow those rules.
Our government has made the contribution of stopping these antibiotics .
But it is said that the number of mothers who died untimely during delivery in the last teeth decreased but many lives in pregnant mothers are not safe .
Keeping this in mind, for the past few months, a scheme called Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan has been launched.
The scheme is primarily aimed at ensuring free testing of all the pregnant women on the 9th of every month at the public health centres.
The doctors who came forward after forgetting my supplication were thousands .
But our India is vast.
Lakhs of doctors should be done by this technique .
It is being discussed in the country and abroad .
The age-old people of India are pressing this thing .
Lord Krishna is also proposed about the trees of Shri Krishna in Kurukshetra war .
In the followers of Mahabharata the discussion has been described about this .
It is said in the festival of Mahabharata that if a tree is planted, it will become its offspring.
There is no doubt in it .
By their children they get benefit from the same kind of benefit by the tree as well .
Therefore, parents who want to fulfil their resolutions should plant good trees and nurture them like their children.
A few days ago I remembered one of the girls of Pune .
It touched my mind .
In Pune of Maharashtra in Junnar Talku village in Narayanpur village the Ratu had celebrated his marriage with a lot of support .
The pill was done that the marriage of Sonal was so much that kinsmen , friends , guests came to all those who came to Kesar mango plant .
I surprised to see that picture in the social media .
In the marriage there is no smile of lips , so many plants are seen .
This scene of the heart is in that picture .
Sonal agricultural scientists . This thought came to itself .
Many people use such use .
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims used to visit the Ambaji temple in the month of Bhadrapada.
This plant is a prasadam by offering a prasadam to the visitors of the temples and if you take it carefully, if you plant it in your house and increase it then you will see that you will get the blessings of the mothers.
This year lakhs of trees were sent to the tourists who had come to Padyatra .
Temples can also start the tradition of giving plants instead of prasad in the rainy season .
This day we have to import the worth of crores of rupees from abroad for the construction of houses and for the construction of houses in our country.
If we plant trees on our farmlands then we will increase the domestic and furniture if we plant trees, then we will sell them by the permission of the government after 15-20 years.
The Central Government has already approved the Companies Act, which provides for plantation of over 40,000 crore rupees under this Act to the State Governments.
I am told that the Government of Maharashtra has planted 2 crore saplings on July 1, and resolved to plant more than 3 crore plants in the coming year.
Rajasthan is the desert region of Rajasthan, the state has started such a massive festival that lakhs of plants have been planted.
Planting of yakti lacs of trees in Rajasthan is not a normal thing.
The condition of the land of Rajasthan is understood by the people who know what is true and how wonderful it is.
In Andhra Pradesh too, it has been decided to increase forest cover by 50 by 2019.
This work is being done under the Green India Mission of the Government of India.
Even in Gujarat, Namaste has a very vibrant tradition.
But the tourism of South Africa is like a pilgrimage .
It is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi , Nelson Mandela on the head of South Africa .
As soon as the sounds of Ahimsa , love , peace - peace in the world , Gandhi , Mandla their faces appear before our eyes .
During my visit to South Africa, I went to the Phoenix Centre, the place where Mahatma Gandhi lived is known as Sarvodaya.
The most friendly of Nelson Mandela Shri Ahmad Kathrada , Shrilalu Chiba , Shrijarj Bijos , Shrironi Kasrials have achieved the opportunity to visit all these Mahabharatas .
Our children want a good future .
I am deeply indebted to craftsman, I have sent a message to him.
A woman does not know that deceived I . . . is not able to bear the problem of losing 11 lakh rupees .
I was troubled about her family because of being a woman .
Tell your opinion about such a deceived e-mails .
Such things can also come to your attention - in our mobile phones, in our e-mails, there are many such messages that make a difference, and behold, you have received such a lot of awards.
You can sometimes deceive.
The Mary is sent by making some authority litre pad .
Your credit card November , Debt card November .
The craftsman brought such a good idea to me and I feel that you too would not be able to take much of it again and I want to take it for you, my dear countrymen.
In the Parliament session, I have got the opportunity to meet many people of the country in the Parliament session.
Our MPs will also bring people from their respective places to me.

Art painting has been done on the station .
The station has been given a new form of a new form by making this description garden in plastic bottles towards the railway station .
If you ever go to Aligarh, you must visit this station.
These messages are being sent to me from several railway stations across the country and the local people are displaying their local identity through their art at the railway stations.
Congratulations to all those who are doing this work in the country, especially to all the friends of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, in addition to the rainy season, the festive season in our country will begin.
Raksha Bandhan is a celebration of our special bond.
Can you not give Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of our country during this period as per the previous year
This is the true meaning of Raksha Bandhan.
However, I am the first Prime Minister of independent India.
We all need to celebrate Diwali like a festival and do something that is inspired by the spirit of patriotism.
You can feel these thoughts as much as possible from the top of the Red Fort .
As the Prime Minister of this country, as the Chief Servant, tell me about the things that I want to hear from the Red Fort from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
I got the opportunity to discover words in my mind once .
In my view, Mann Ki Baat is not a religious practice.
How enthusiasm I am enthusiasm to speak with you .
I am really delighted to be with you all at the root of the country through the Mann Ki Baat programme everywhere in India.
I thank the All India Radio for successfully telecasting the Mann Ki Baat programme in regional languages at 8 PM.
I hope that you will be more energetic and participative in looking at the work being done by the peoples representatives of our democracy.
The heat of summer is increasing daily .
In such a situation ruins have increased the dream of coming late for a week .
Approximately all the country got stuck in the effect of strong sunshine .
The temperature keeps on increasing .
Animals, birds, or humans.
Every animal is feeling pain .
Due to the reason of blindness of tourism these problems become poisonous .
The vegetation of forest starts getting scratched by cutting the trees carelessly .
If you want to say in a way , human species has become a victim of development by giving a sound of nature .
This time, the United Nations Committee on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has laid out the theme ero Tolerance for Delhi Global Life Trade.
As per the tradition of the government till now, I can hold a joint meeting with the Chief Ministers of all the states under drought, but I will not do so.
I had a detailed meeting with each state and spent about two and a half hours each to each state.
I obeyed the instructions of every state.
Normally, the central government has sanctioned the amount of money on the state-wise basis, which is not enough for every state to spend.
In view of this, the Central Government officials were surprised to know that some States have made commendable efforts to deal with water, environment and misery, take care of the affected animals and the affected people.
I have directed them that NITI Aayog should work towards bringing in best practices across the States.
Some states especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have fully leveraged technology.
I would also like NITI Aayog to implement the most successful efforts of these states in the future.
Peoples participation stands as a strong foundation to address such issues.
Along with that, we pray five times, seeking forgiveness of God.
Water is also the prasad of God .
Therefore, water harvesting, judicious use of water and judicious use of water all these things will be of utmost importance.
By adopting a micro-irrigation method, there is a need to implement more crop with every drop of water by planting only those crops that consume less water.
In many states, our captivity farmers are also adopting micro-irrigation techniques and many more are using water.
The aim is to bring 2 and 3 hectares of land under micro-irrigation every year.
Our Telangana farmer brothers are making efforts to effectively utilize the water of the rivers of Krishna and Godavari through Mission Bhagirathi.

Chhattisgarh has launched the Lok Suraaj - Jal Suraaj campaign.
Efforts are being made to restore most of the old wells in Rajasthan and Gujarat as water Goddesses.
In Rajasthan, Chief Minister Jal-Swaalban Yojana has been launched.
Jharkhand is a forest area - there are some places where there is an ox.
This is a matter of concern for the villagers, the poor, the dalits, the labourers, the farmers, the Patnaites and the villagers.
This time, it is a matter of happiness that how much water can be hidden while celebrating Diwali and how much water can be prevented from getting wasted.
Then there is no limit to our happiness.
The power of water is so strong that when we are so tired, we pour so much water on my face and it becomes fresh.
It's too tired to see a big pond.
We will preserve the wealth by putting a mind on it.
We will increase the water resources.
Increase water .
We will bring back the used water.
I am emphasizing on this thing.
Do not leave any stone unturned in the coming days.
Let us make Jal Bachao Abhiyan a peoples movement to save water for the next four months.
We are not ministers.
It is the responsibility of all of us, the media and the media have given a detailed account of the water oxen in the past.
The media also wanted to guide people on water conservation, take up activities and involve them in water harvesting and water harvesting.
I also welcome those media persons.
We have to change our old habits slightly.
If you help me in that matter, I would like to assure you that we will be able to achieve our growth in the same direction.
There was a time when there were no coins there were no mouths.
If you want salt, give vegetables.
The world is moving towards a cashless system.
We can and can afford money through electronic technology.
There will be no fear of being able to deliver the services from the pocket.
There are automatic numbers.
First of all, it will be difficult.
But if we gradually become a habit then this system becomes easy.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, bank accounts have been opened to almost all the families of the country.
In the coming days, the card will serve two types of credit and debit.
No money is required to be taken out of the pocket.
There is no need to move around with money.
The second task that we have started is to change the Bank on Mobile-Universal Payments Interface-UPI.
It will be easier to transmit money through mobile phones.
If this happens then you will not have to keep the RuPay card in your hands as well.
Around 1.
More than 25 lakh banking correspondents are being employed for young people.
But it will be better if it happens as soon as possible.
How's the food, huh?
When the player knows that the 125 crore people are with him, the enthusiasm becomes doubled.
If we do not come to the conclusion that we think life will not stop there.
Living with faith and self-confidence, moving forward with faith.
But a new kind of problem has come before me and I have never thought about it.
Mygov.
When an e-mail was received in site, my attention went that way.
He brought before me his message - Gaurav Patel from Madhya Pradesh.
He sent me a letter stating that it seems a burden on my mind.
Earlier you people used to feel like developing more.
All of you, I would like to say - When your children bring home the results of the exam, tell them to be real and be happy and mentally retarded.
Encourage them to develop further, otherwise they have brought an hundred - hundred - 100 - yes.
It will also come the day when something else will happen
The people around me do not recognize our situation.
These lines cannot be properly remembered.
But the poet has said - "My pain is on the dolls of life."
He suggested that when the film is screened, it would improve the quality of the film, instead of blue, it would be better if the images were still intact.
The pain of the film is not understood but it is said that more people want to improve it.
But if you do not feel happy to see the result, you will never be able to do new things.
Fulfillment is joy and helps to achieve more.
It keeps on waiting for life.
You must have heard of Santoor's business.
There was a time when it used to be only in folk music in the valley of Kashmir.
The biggest weapon for prevention of diseases is cleanliness.
Cleanliness is the biggest benefit for the poor.
The second weapon is yoga, every time I say it.
It is called yoga .
June 21 is the International Day of Yoga.
In a world full of problems, Yoga offers the power to live happily.
Yoga Day on 21st June is not an event.
We need to be inspired by June 21 to change our lives.
Each time a collective environment can bring about a change in the life of a human being.
Start, see, on June 21, you will be a partner.
Can we use June 21 to make Yoga a part of our lives
This time I will be in Chandigarh for the forthcoming event.
I am going to meet the people of Chandigarh on the 21st of June.
On that day, along with all of you, yoga is going to be imparted all over the world.
All right , O my God ,
Thank you very much.
Namaste
Now summer time.
Everyone prepares plans for summer holidays.
This is also the time of mango fruit and we want to taste these fruits.
It seems as if we take a little afternoon then we will be able to take a little time .
But this year the sunshine had destroyed all the entertainment of everyone .
How natural is it that the species of heat about heat .
Further, in the last two years, there has been adverse impact on water storage sites in our country.
Several times, due to the sound of the clutter, many times the sand had blocked the flow of water into the reservoir and other sources of water.
As a result, the reservoirs are able to retain only less water than their capacity .
Governments try to solve the problem of famine , to provide relief from water crisis .
But this is not one .
Citizens are doing commendable work to deal with the situation.
In many villages, consciousness is now becoming visible.
On feeling the deficiency of water the price of water can be known .
He said that in the village of Hiu-Rabazar village panchayat in Ahmadnagar district of Maharashtra, these villagers have solved the water shortage problem by considering it a major and delicate problem.
Anyone can see villages that are eager to store water.
Farmers have also resolved the problem of changing the rate of sowing of crops in the hive market.
That is, they have decided to stop the practice of cultivation, like prisons and bananas.
It is very easy to hear, but in reality it is not that easy.
How big a decision would have been
Anyone can imagine the response to the request by the employers for excessive use of water, asking them to shut down their units by telling them about the use of water.
But see the discovery of this rail brother .
They felt that there was a need for boiling water for the farm produce and therefore they thought that it should not be harvested and the same idea was implemented.
Other than captivity fruits , carrots are being used as much less water as possible .
They have undertaken numerous activities such as sprinkler, drop-out, water harvesting, water recharge, etc.
I might be talking about a small town like the Hindu city, but there are many more such villages.
I heartily congratulate the residents of such villages for their good work.
Who told me that there is a village panchayat in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh.
About 27 crop ponds have been constructed.
About 20 of their agricultural production has increased.
When the water level rises then the quality of water also changes drastically.
Clean drinking water is also the reason for GDP growth.
But how many people around us are adopting new methods to solve the problems faced by us by our surroundings.
Why dont we take the soil out of the pond and throw it into the field
The field will also work well and the capacity to store water in the field will also increase.
Sometimes in cement bags, sometimes in empty bags, the soil is filled with soil, and the water can be kept in check if the water becomes old.
He has written in MyGov, Shri Kumar Krishna and has expressed a lot of curiosity.
Without peoples participation, we have never been successful in this work.
Therefore, everyone has to become a messenger of change for cleanliness and cleanliness.
This should be repeated and discussed.
In this, we are also playing a role for social organizations and NGOs.
Several steps are being taken to reduce the pollution of waste and industrial pollution.
Every day, large quantities of garbage are brought in by canals on the river Ganga.
In order to clean up such garbage, we have to remove garbage from the drains of Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna.
A detailed presentation was made to all the local bodies for the cleaning of the garbage.
Wherever this sanitization is taking place, it has been observed that from 3 tonnes to 11 tonnes per day, the same waste is being discharged.
The pollution coming from the paper industry has also stopped.
This shows that we are moving in the right direction and there is a awakening.
Not just the people living on the bank of river Ganga.
It is very rare to have so many such programmes in all the villages of the country for the past 10 days.
Several initiatives have been taken for the welfare of the villages, for the development of the villages and for the empowerment of the people.
Whatever awareness is there in the villages, whatever awareness is there.
Therefore, if we strengthen the progress of the entire village, then we will achieve the desired results.
She expressed her concern over the situation arising out of Mumbai and her phone call.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of PMs address in the 4th Episode of Mann Ki Baat 2.0 on 31.03.2019 My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Hello.
I am speaking to Shirmila Dharmapura from Mumbai.
Sharmila Ji, your concerns are very natural.
Now if there is a dream for parents in every family, it will make the children read a lot.
If anything comes to you, go and talk to the teachers on your own.
This monitoring system will reduce the gap in our education system.
Technology plays a very big role in education as well.
Many more are coming to me on the NarendraModiApp.
I speak to Mona Karnawal from Bij Norr.
They should have a spirit of team spirit and have the qualities of a good leader.
The result of all your stress, suggestions and all of them is that NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guides of India, Red Cross and Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan has organized a conference.
He said that this is the first time that such an event would have been organized when the country's independence was met.
They are doing a lot of work in their own way.
But if we work collectively with our various systems in the community then how big a result can be seen.
There will be inspiration and a national outlook will grow.
I have seen that benefit in a very young age.
I also want to give a new lease of life to these institutions.
This time I have placed something in front of them.
How many blocks and how many districts we have worked and how many districts can stop the spread of the disease.
Today, I'm making a plea for you all.
Please give information about the solutions of this youth institution .
Can we add a new dimension to their work and their activities
If you come to me on my NarendraModiApp, I'll send them to the right place.
And I hope that after this meeting, they will be able to get a new momentum.
You too want to work with them.
Crores of rupees will be spent on these committees.
But the thing was that there was nowhere else.
This is the experience of everyone.
Nobody thinks about it .
Today, my dear countrymen, I am very happy to put forth my personal concerns before you on this subject.
One crore families voluntarily gave up their gas subsidy.
This fort is not a family of affluent families.
It is very easy to leave the above subsidy.
Mobile phone can be made available through app.
This can be done online by giving a missed call to the telephone number and also by releasing the subsidy.
I salute the families of those forts.
This one thing has also made economic scientists of our country think differently.
We have to move forward in this direction.
One more thing that happens to me is that I have to go through the course of action and why is it that I interact with the employees of class 3rd and 4th
Many times I feel that there are some ways in which those people who have booked their tickets.
Once you make such a pledge, you will get unprecedented results.
These are not the ideas in my mind that cant be converted into government rules.
However, such an environment can be created where it is possible.
He further wrote, Please instruct your officials to post a good incident on a daily basis.
Breaking News or TV channels are all fake news.
Whether the concerns around us are on the rise in the country with a population of 1.25 billion or not
Change this situation.
Ravi ji had expressed his anger but his anger was not against me.
You will remember that our former President, Dr.
P.
When Abdul Kalam used to say - Please give me only good news on the first page of the newspaper.
These days some T . . .
When a lamp is illuminated, it removes darkness and removes it.
The government is also running a website www.india.gov.in.
We have to come together to do something positive, to talk constructively and to spread positive things.
Many people around the world are aware that over a period of time, crores of people will reach the banks of a river and take holy bath.
In the last few days, I have observed that many people have uploaded photographs of the Kumbh Mela.
I hope that the tourist institutions of the Central and State Governments will have a photo competition.
Although the Kumbh is a religious and spiritual festival, we must also consider it a social event.
On important occasions such as Panchayati Raj Day, I will definitely meet you all this evening.
This is my heartfelt thanks to all of you.
It gives me immense pleasure and joy, as always, that the bond between the thoughts of your mind and the thoughts of my mind does not leave me alone.
Man Ki Bat , July 2019 .
Just as Mann Ki Baat has always been a programme, you too have to wait.
A large number of people shared a variety of books.
People are discussing books on subjects such as science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business and life history.
Some people would also like to talk to me about some more books.
At the same time, I will talk to you about many more books.
However, I would like to confess that I am not able to spare time to read more and more books.
But, there was a benefit, that is, if you look at the writing details, I get to know a lot of books.
With the experience of this month, we feel that we need to take it forward.
Why dont we put a permanent book corner on the NarendraModi App that can be used for reading, writing and discussing
You can name a good name for this book corner.
It will be an active platform for the readers and the authors.
You keep writing and sharing it with all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
I would especially like to congratulate the government here in discussions with the farmers and in encouraging the crops that have less water and instead of their traditional agricultural practices.
Why not use such places for water conservation
People from all sections of society will gather here.
These children - Nidhi Baipot, Monish Joshi, Devshini Rawat, Tanash Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Desh Mukhar, Aroniyatash Ganguly, Hardik Alamda.
What I have said about them will be a matter of great pride for you.
We all know how much the world is afraid of cancer just by listening to it.
Knowing that the death toll is at its peak, these ten children have brought the name of India to the world by defeating cancer and other serious diseases.
We will be seeing championing the cause of sports only after winning a tournament.
But, in this rare event, champions were before participating in the competition.
They are champions in the battle of life.
Competitions such as shooting, leather, swimming, running, foot ball and table tennis were organized.
These 10 champions from our country have won medals in this tournament.
Some people have also received more than one neck.
Sanjeev Haripura from Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata and P.K. from Telangana.
In fact, 2019 is a very good year for India.
Our scientists have launched A-Sat in March.
The A-Sat Missiles have a three-minute capability to lift a three-wheeler Satellite at a distance of 3-meters.
India has emerged as the fourth country in the world.
Now, on 22nd July, the whole country has taken pride in the manner in which Chandrayaan-2 has been placed in the extreme direction from Sriharikota.
The photographs of Chandrayaan-2 have brought glory, enthusiasm and happiness to the nation.
We must have faith in our talent and capabilities.
On the eve of the moon, we look forward to the September of the month of the month of September, which will be the Lander Vikram Rover Pragyan.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share a detailed account of competition and competition with our student friends and young friends of the country.
I invite the youth of the country - a quiz competition.
Space science and technology - the key elements of this quiz competition are Indias Space Mission.
I would urge the young colleagues and students to take part in this quiz competition and make it interesting and memorable.
I make a special request to the schools, enthusiastic teachers, teachers and caregivers to make every effort to make their schools successful.
In September, they will have the opportunity to see the lunar eclipse on the surface of the moon.
This victory will be a historic event for the students who have won.
But do not forget to participate in the quiz.
Let us encourage more and more people to participate.
My dear countrymen, you must have noticed one thing.
Our 'Mann ki Baat' campaign has led to the cleanliness drive in the coming days.
And all the efforts for cleanliness have inspired Mann Ki Baat.
This journey, which began just five years ago, marks the beginning of a new era of cleanliness, and marks the beginning of a new era of cooperation among all.
In cleanliness, we have not reached the ideal yet, be it from the ODF or the success of Swachhata Abhiyan in public places, the resolve of 130 crore countrymen.
But we just stopped here.
This mission will go a long way in swachhata.
A few days ago, in the media, Shri Yogesh Saini, his team and his stories were seen.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who left his job in America and returned to serve Mother India.
They have not only made Delhi clean, but have also made efforts to beautify it a short time ago.
They started their work as well as from the garbage dumps of Lothal Gardens.
Through the street art, many places in Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
This tradition has continued with the cooperation of the people in the form of over bridge and over bridge to the huts of the salam that are not being carved out of their art.
You will remember how Prayagraj has been decorated with street paintings in Kumbh.
This will also make us feel better in the beauty of Swachhta Hi Seva.
This is the statement written by His Highness the Alam Bhai of Shopian, Jammu Kashmir.
He wrote It would be better to listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am very happy to say that I have played an active role in the formation of Community Mobilization Program in the State of Jammu and Kashmir - Back to Village.
At the same time, there should be an online monitoring system on this programme.
In about 4.5000 panchayats in the state, the government officials gave a detailed account of the government schemes and programmes to the villagers whether all these government services are reaching their doorsteps or not
How can the capacity of Panchayats be further enhanced
How can we increase their income
Literacy, sex ratio, health, hygiene, water conservation, electricity, water, girls education, old age pensions.
Sports competitions were organized for the children of Khelo India.
Sports kits, job cards of Man-Raga, SC and ST certificates were also distributed.
Financial Literacy Camps have been set up.
The people of Kashmir have participated in a big way in this celebration of development.
In this season we have seen around us that the earth appears to be covered with green clothes.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is also a celebration of the love and affection of our brothers and sisters.
You will be happy to hear another episode of the Shravan month, more than four years after the Amarnath Yatra this time more devotees have gone there.
From 1st July till now, more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than 60 days of this journey in 2015, more than 28 days participated.
On the success of the Amarnath Yatra, I would particularly like to appreciate the guests from Jammu and Kashmir.
I am told that in Uttarakhand too, since the start of this Chardham yatra this time, more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham in a month and a half.
For the first time since the devastating disaster in 2013, a record number of pilgrims reached there.
It is my request to all of you that whatever countries are present in the country during the rainy season, do not go to those places throughout the year.
There will not be any greater teacher than this who travels in our country to know the spirit of the people of our country to see these beauty.
On the other hand, it is time to have heavy rains at several places across the country.
Today the Christians of the world are celebrating the festival of East India .
This is the contribution of everyone .
My young friends...
On one hand, T20 cricket is a world cup match.
Even today evening, I know that you are eagerly waiting for the India-Australia match.
Just a few days ago India had won in two straight matches with Pakistan , Bangladesh .
We are witnessing a good response in this T20 Cricket World Cup.
Today, India and Australia are ready to play the games and these two waters are my best wishes.
65 of our countrys population is young and there is no reason why we are not able to stay away from milk in the world.
This is not the work done .
In sports, we need to bring about revolutionary changes.
We can see this place in India .
Like cricket now interest in football , hockey , tennis and cabbies is increasing here .
You will be aware that India is going to host the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in the coming year.
There are twenty four teams to play from all over the world .
In 1951 , in 1962 Indian football team had won gold medals in the Asian Games and other 1956 Olympic Games standing in the fourth place of India .
From the point of view of measles we slipped to the places from there .
Today, I don't feel like talking about how low our ranking is in the IAF.
On the other hand, I am seeing the growing interest of football in India as much as possible, whether it is English Premier Leg or Spanish Leg or Indian Super Leg Matches.
Indian youth have been given time to learn about these matches and watch them on television.
I want to say that when this game is increasing so much that when we get the opportunity to give the opportunity to the guests of Af-17 World Complex then we were able to fulfil our responsibility only .
Or, should we encourage sports by using this opportunity to benefit us
We have to create a conducive environment throughout the year - Fit Baal, Fit Baal and Fit Baal. In schools and colleges, India is at the core of every corner.
Our youth , our children should kiss with sweat while playing football .
Although it has been done , for giving guests we will get a simple fun .
Therefore, we should try to take the beauty of football village , street .
From now on in 2017 A . . . under the Under - 17 World Complex is a kind of excitement in the youth .
It is good to give guests to this program that many civilizations keep on taking the form of economic games here .
If we can make every youth of our country with this game .
How can we enhance India's interest in sports through the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup
In order to make literature with this game how can the competition of competition in the government , educational institutions , social institutions .
We are seeing such places in cricket .
We should also try to come to the other parts of these parlors .
This is an opportunity for the world to recognise the potential of India's youth power - not just for winning a match or for building a ship.
2017 Afff A . . . while preparing the guests of the World Cup , we can exhibit them by comparing their capacity .
In doing so, we can also undertake branding of India's reputation.
You can send me your suggestions and suggestions related to the 2017 IFFI Under-17 World Cup through the NarendraModiApp.
How to have milk , milk ?
What's the point, Sawani?
Friends, think.
Every young person should be given an angel of 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup.
You should participate in this program at a large height .
This is a golden opportunity for making the beauty of India .
Dear students, You must be thinking where to travel on holidays.
There are very few people going to the country and abroad .
We should take this task more ahead .
Do this work even this time .
Who said , The journey without observation is like a bird without wings .
If you are really interested in seeing, you should also prepare an internal view to see them.
The journey plays a powerful role in correcting life .
Now the young people of India are increasing interest and curiosity towards travel in India.
In the next days they did not go on the way to go on the way , made on the way .
They want to do something new;
If we see the pictures of the workers there , then how will it be even more ?
But this Boggan tourism has shown the status of Western Coal Falls Limited .
Eco-Friendly Main Tourism site near Sawaner village near Nagpur has so far been visited by more than 10,000 people.
If you want to see something new then this is a chance of us .
This time when you go to tour the holidays then you can also do something for cleanliness .
In scientific method this attempt is not happening but the work is done .
But if we want to strengthen the tourism sector of 1.25 billion people of the country then the world will attract us.
We can make a big part of the world tourism .
Moreover, crores of our youth will be able to get employment opportunities.
Government Gni , institutions , society , society , people do the work of this .
Come, let us make an effort in this direction.
My dear young friends, I would not like to waste a little bit of time in the city on holiday days.
If you do not swimming at one time , you can contact this learning in holidays .
If there is no cycle then the decision can be taken in the holidays .
Now if you are typing only on computer with two fingers then do you think that I do not learn typing in the right way ?
There are many types of equipments for the development of our personality .
Why should not you learn them ?
Now look at a thought .
In these you need many classes , training , very big figures , big budget .
You look around you.
You must make use of your holidays for the development of your personality, to achieve excellence and to improve your skills.
I remembered the thing that I had told me .
That child told me about a good work by photographing me .
I am told that Abhi is doing this work for one year and many birds have become his friends.
How much love is the bird of Mahadeo Varma in Hindi language .
Come, let us also do as Mahadev Varma ji had said.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for remembering an important thing.
The sculpture of Mysore has brought a kind of problem before us .
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, You must have heard the words of Digital India.
Digital India means that it is a matter related to the youth in cities, which can be seen as their world.
It is not true .
You will be happy to know that Kisan Suvidha App has been launched for your convenience.
You can download this Kisan Suvidha App on your mobile phones and disseminate the detailed information related to agriculture and environment in your hands.
The cotton situated in it speaks to you directly with agricultural scientists , agricultural experts .
If you ask some questions then they give pocket .
You will tell you .
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
Try to see once . What are you doing in it ?
There is some deficiency in it , there is less information that you can also make me fierce .
Ratu waits for rains .
But, it is a matter of concern for all our countrymen that what happens when there is no water.
During this time, our ponds, places of water flow in our area, the way water reaches the ponds, or the work of digging of the ponds, stop flowing water, so that the water supply is reduced.
The cost of water in the past , places , places again and again we can clean the garbage by cleaning the garbage and make ready to reach the water .
If our rivers and canals are filled with ponds, then there is no shortage of water even if the rains are not visible after that and we will not be able to do much harm to it.
But if we stand by holding the pinch of every rain water then it is possible .
This time we contacted five lakh water pools .
Although now how much effort is necessary in this direction .
Dear farmer brothers and sisters, Recently, the Government of India has organised a massive farmer meet.
Every one should be in balanced .
That is why money remains less .
Our mantra is - Short term income and maximum investment and more crop.
This is the mantra that we must follow and we must develop scientific temper in our agriculture.
This year, the event is being organized with the theme Beat Diabetes all over the world.
It is estimated that about six and a half crore people of our country are patients of diabetes .
Three percent deaths have become the cause of diabetes .
There are two types of type . , type . in diabetes .
Type . dynasty comes .
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause of diabetes.
Physical labor is less .
Sweating does not take place .
What can we do in our personal life to defeat diabetes by getting support from 7th April .
If you are yoga meaning yoga then do yoga .
Or do at least walk or race .
If everyone in this country is healthy, then my country will also be healthy.
On 24th March the World Tuberculosis is celebrated daily .
If my little time the name of T . . is heard then they were afraid .
It seems as if death is near .
But now there is no fear of TB because now everyone knows that the treatment of TB is possible.
On the top of any disease i . . nearby people also recognize .
There are more than 13,500 microscopic centres in our country and more than 4 lakh dot service providers.
This test is also done free .
Get your check up done once .
This disease stops .
Getting proper treatment done , getting the treatment done till the disease is completely cured .
There are some special occasions in the month of April, especially on the occasion of Baba Saheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14th.
He had done 125th Jayant hunters seven years .
His birthplace was in Mhow, his learning in London, his residence in Nagpur, his residence in Delhi, 26 in Alipur Road, and his funeral was done in Mumbai.
We are constantly trying to develop these five pilgrimages .
I had the privilege of visiting this place on April 14 this year, the Mahatma.
Baba Saheb had inspired us to change a good nutrition .
By changing a good Paul on his way we can glorify him in a glorious way .
In some days the new year starts .
It is celebrated in different forms in different states .
You can listen to your mobile phone.
This is why only one missed call has to be made.
This service has started a month ago, but more than 35 lakh people have availed it.
You can also come in number.
Staying in such a way that I am so happy .
I want to know from you as to how best we can use the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017 for our benefit.
How to do this program ?
The FIFA program provides a unique opportunity to do this.
They have uploaded photographs of such magnificent places and it really gives a great pleasure to see them.
I consider it a good sign .
Wherever there is no knee , one should like to knee there .
This conclusion is considered to be the special opinion of Kolkata India .
India is far behind in the tourism sector as compared to the world.
You also look like this.
You tell me one thing to think.
Look - you'll be happy.
I request you to repeat the same in Mann Ki Baat.
If you want to say the truth , I forgot its identity .
How happy was I to spend this thing .
In taking any church for the protection of water we should take that church with complete cleanness .
Many other diseases of our body enter our house as guests of evil .
You must think about this thing .
Tuberculosis is said to be done by Babu test .
It is said that he had come to T . . .
This means that this disease is such that it can be tested very soon .
But you do not think that this work is not because of the government , doctors , medicines , therefore my request to the people of the country .
Therefore , there will be same glittering in your mind as well .
I also want to meet you in this journey .
The more you stop in the case of the tests of your children , the more the obstruction is that .
But if we change the thought process of tests , perhaps we will get rid of this problem .
I have already said in Mann Ki Baat that you must not send your experiences and suggestions through the NarendraModiApp.
Today I want to talk to my parents, especially parents, students and their teachers in Mann Ki Baat.
I know that the tests start in a few days .
Everybody asks how to go , how is ready for tests .
How many ways come , how many times I want to tell one another .
You decide to set a target for yourself.
While playing cricket I kept many estimations on me , how much hoped from me .
While passing time the estimation of some time was even more named .
Then how important is it for me to bear the result of this .
I decided my goals on my own , I am able to fulfil them so much good for the country .
I was constantly trying to meditate those goals .
The goals were fulfilled slowly in the central corner of my eyes .
Good luck.
Make your future .
I believe that these words of Sachin Giri are definitely useful for you .
Why should we not keep our position with us ?
Where we reached , how far away came .
Do not get stuck in the same number .
One more important goal of life should be to travel with a dream.
Therefore if you make a large , high dream then - tests become a fun year .
In these healthy body there is a healthy mind in a healthy body .
In that context, 365 days of our day-to-day actions must be in line with our dreams and resolutions.
His special information is that one should sleep regularly , waking up early in the morning , waking up early in the morning .
Taking the entry of the test centres , other things should be reached before fixed time .
Do not do this .
I believe that you can do this .
Although respectively in life the foundation of victory is responsible for keeping the foundation of victory nutritious .
There is a strong foundation from the potency .
Those who are not fit and are not disciplined and disciplined, they complete the work in the morning and the afternoon is done after midnight when the work is over.
Not only this , our daily routine also gets disturbed .
Therefore we should not see anything small .
Make sure, do it.
Friends.
Sometimes I saw that two types of water are seen in the students going to the tests .
Who can say this thing better than I can say - , That is, the Chadaranga Champanion Vishwanathan created by the players of the world who returned.
He will divide his experiences with you .
Come , let us learn how to play these tests .
Hello, I enjoy Vishwanathan.
How am I ready for my tests , what more my experiences are now developed .
I told me that these tests are like the problems occurring before life .
Therefore if you are peaceful , if you eat nutritious food , sleep properly then only your brain can remember the right peace at the right time .
Therefore stay calm .
In the last minute, look at the most important points and the things you have felt more important, and look at the things you do not remember very well.
Vishwanathan is really an important thing .
How much he sits in the international Charang competition , how much concentration you are able to discover .

India is the third .
Once again I convey my greetings and best wishes to all the scientists.

I salute all of you.
This was my last Mann Ki Baat address in 2015.
Let us speak through Mann Ki Baat in 2016.
India is a nation full of diversity.
These festivals provide an opportunity to the poorest of the poor to take up economic activities and ways of income generation.
Greetings on Christmas and the New Year 2016 to all fellow citizens.
You know, I will use technology completely.
He added that this is the season of tourists, the arrival of large number of tourists from India and abroad, and that many of them are travelling to and fro from various countries to spend Christmas.
Dilip Sinha, an old man from Bhojpura village in Sihor district of Madhya Pradesh, spoke about Malaviya.
In Bhojpur village, he has built 100 dustbins for the purpose of maintaining physical distancing and not taking labour.
I convey my warm greetings to Dilip Sinha, the Prime Minister of Maldives.
I would like to hear a lot of news about our country.
This is our ability to move forward.
Therefore, it seems to be a very good opportunity for Dilip Sinha to be treated proudly in the Mann Ki Baat.
The same Yoga Day event has made our country also very happy.
The mantra of cleanliness is changing in every house.
This has not been discussed in detail in the media.
But I am confident that the media will reach such villages and bring light to the country.
The biggest benefit of this is that the government employees of this distribution of electricity will get a lot of happiness and satisfaction.
We all have to make efforts to ensure that the best of the things, the right things, the good work done by the common man is done to as many people as possible.
This is also a service program.
But you are saying, should I also do it
Every person will be able to download the app on their mobile phones and join hands with me.
I would like to share some small things with you in this app.
It is a matter of great happiness for me that I am told several things through this app.
You too should be a part of this effort in your own way and at your level.
Tell me how will I reach 100 crore Indians without your support
Come, let us all together inspire the common citizens, the common man in the language of the common man, to help them achieve their rights.
Can new start-ups, new start-ups, start-ups, and start-ups, become an excellent employment opportunity for our youth and the people of our states
The world has not moved forward without innovation and creativity.
Start-up India - Stand-up India has given a big opportunity to the youth.
My young friends, the Government of India is going to implement a comprehensive action plan for Startup India-StandUp India on 16th January.
We had a feeling that the start-up is the only place in the digital world and in the IT industry.
That's the idea.
India has the talent of its youth from all corners.
On 16th January, I will come before you and talk extensively about this.
Your suggestions and suggestions are always welcome.
Swami Vivekananda on January 12, 2019.
There are crores of people in this country like me who are inspired by Swami Vivekananda.
Since 1995, 12th January is celebrated as Swami Vivekananda Jayanti as National Youth Day.
The festival will be held from 12th to 16th January, 2018 in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
Dilip Chauhan, a student from Ahmedabad and Gujarat.
Sir, we have celebrated the 'Accesible India' festival in our school.
Dilip ji, I thank you.
We call it Handicapped once or disabled - it is said - "specially a bubbling person - there are so many words we hear.
We know that rankings also matter.
Why not use the word Divyang in our country instead of the term Divyangjan
Those people, who are full of divinity, or who are more or less, are not aware of it.
Be it the schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stands, railway stations, ramps, parking, elevators, or any other instrument in the Braille script - all these things need to be creatively equipped - technology, system and arrangements - a sensitive and courageous document.
They should not remain dead and remnant of files.
Schemes are meant for the common man and the poor.
There is no time available or no method of knowing.
The government has brought some changes in this.
Opening of Jan Dhan Accounts - Aadhaar Card - with the help of which the largest cash transfer scheme in the world has provided direct credit to the beneficiarys account.
I am happy to note that the Guinness Book of World records has been placed in the worlds largest direct cash transfer scheme.
The scheme named Pehl has been implemented in a very successful manner.
On one hand, the Aadhaar card scheme, the opening of Jan Dhan account on the other, and the list of beneficiaries belonging to the third State and Central Governments, with Aadhaar seeding of the same with Aadhaar and Aadhaar seeding of the same are continuing.
The National Rural Livelihoods Mission is being implemented in villages.
Now about 40 thousand crore rupees are being transferred directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through various schemes.
I am hopeful that 40 out of 35 schemes are being implemented directly through cash transfers.
This is a happy coincidence that the birth anniversary of our founding father Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar was celebrated on the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
In the Parliament too, a special discussion was held on the Constitution for a period of two days.
My thoughts are with you, on the subject of duty, duties and laws before 26th January, if possible in your language and after that, send me a poem on duties in Hindi or English, if possible.
I want to know your opinions and ideas.
Send to mygov portal.
I want the youth of my country to know what they are thinking about performing duties.
New business activities have also been started with great enthusiasm.
On the other hand, arrangements are also in place for Christmas.
Festivals are very important to us in social life.
Once the festival uses our wounds to stop, it gives us a new strength.
In our country, in a few days from now, we have been fortunate, timeless and everlasting years.
In particular, the damage caused by these rains in Tamil Nadu has affected other states as well.
But now the coast of disasters has changed.
At every level, it has become imperative to work towards enhancing our capacities.
The Government, civil society, people, and small institutions need to enhance capacities with a very deep scientific temper.
I spoke to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif, after the earthquake in Nepal.
He called for a joint exercise to prepare for disasters in all SAARC countries.
I am very happy to hear your words from Lakhwinder Singh ji.
But this problem is not in one Punjab or one Haryana.
But, your feelings are very true today.
This is not real.
The residue of the crops is also very valuable.
How it works to feed the animals and thus our land will be better.
Doubling of this type of fertilizer is available on the ground.
Once there is an opportunity to talk to the farmers who do banana cultivation.
They told me about a good experience.
When banana cultivation was done, bananas remained unloaded.
5,000, 10, 15,000 for each hectare.
Dear fellow citizens, The world is celebrating International Day of Persons with Disabilities on 3rd December, 2018.
Earlier, in Mann Ki Baat, I had spoken to you on member donation.
I also spoke about the Noto Helpline for organ donation.
Body part donation saves many precious lives.
The organ donation brings a different kind of impurity.
We are going to celebrate 3rd December as Disability Day, as I have said earlier.
Today I want to tell you about Javed Ahmad.
He is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, a terrorist attack took place on Javad ahamed in Kashmir.
Digestion, some part of intestine has gone away.
The spinal cord has suffered severe injuries.
How to improve the facilities for the disabled persons in the external and government offices
He continued his studies on this subject.
He took a Master's degree in social service.
There is something in it too.
A few days ago, the Odisha government specially celebrated the occasion of Independence Day as a mark of respect.
Similarly, Jamini Singh village has been relentlessly engaged in the prevention of mosquitoes.
In the same way, malaria has been prevented.
Dear young friends, I have placed three e-books on MyGov for my young friends who are active in internet and social media.
One is an e-book for inspiring stories of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, an e-book for the villages of Sansad Adarsh, and an e-book for the health sector.
Send MyGov back.
The Prime Minister said that the 100th edition of the 2019 edition of the 2019 edition of the 2019 edition of the 2019 edition of the 2019 edition of the 2019 edition of the 2019 edition of the 2019 edition of the India-U.S.
I once said that on the auspicious occasion of full moon day, let us switch off all the lights in the streets and light a lamp in the moonlight and let us experience the moonlight.
Because this link belongs to jee News.
Noor Jahan of Kanpur is a woman.
On TV, she does not seem to be reading too much.
But, her work does not matter to anyone's thinking.
We are working to provide light to the poor by using solar power.
War against darkness.
On the evening of the evening, she will be taken to Lantern.
I have heard that about 500 houses, at a very large height, will come near her and will carry their lanterns.
But the house is light .
But this Noor Jahan will be engaged all day in the work of recharging the Lantern with solar power.
I also congratulate GTV because this work that has been done in Kanpur has proved to be beneficial for the entire country and the whole world.
Many congratulations.
I have received a phone call from Shri Abhishek Kumar Pandey from Uttar Pradesh.
I will speak from Gorakhpur to Abhishek Kumar Pandey.
I would like to congratulate the Prime Minister a lot.
The message has been sent to me from Gorakhpur.
The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana will provide financial assistance to those who are not covered under the scheme.
It will promote the MUDRA entrepreneurs.
It provides an opportunity to earn stamps.
MUDRA is truly empowering.
The Mudra Yojana is helping small traders.
The speed at which we are moving has to be accelerated.
But, it started very well.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, an amount of Rs. 42,000 crore has been disbursed to about 66 lakh people in such a short span of time.
Abhishek himself has said about his enthusiasm.
A lot of news is coming to me too.
I am told that in Mumbai, Shailesh Bhonsle is a man.
He said that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan will create new entrepreneurs.
Sheesh Bhojle was shown by doing it .
I think the same is the purpose of our MUDRA Yojana.
On the occasion of Mamta Sharma from Bhopal, she received Rs. 40,000 from Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
She is working on making parcels.
She used to borrow money at a higher rate in the past and was a hard-working man.
Now she is doing her job better because she has a large handkerchief now.
Due to non-interests, she used to spend more on account of other reasons.
The loans sanctioned by the Bank to the tune of Rs. 1000 per month will ease the flow of finance.
A good business is gradually growing for his family.
But, I would like to make a lot more public about this scheme.
They should help as many small traders as possible.
We want to give strength to them.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Sardar Patels birth anniversary on October 31, I refer to Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.

But I hope more suggestions come from you.
I would like to make a clear plan.
I am told that the participants will get certificates.
Some big announcements have also been made.
You too, use your creative energy.
Stay full of life .
I am confident that your suggestions will continue to work.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter is beginning.
In order to keep the body healthy, do some exercise and yoga in this winter season.
Therefore, let us develop a good habit of living in a better condition.
Once again my best wishes to all my dear countrymen.
Jaihind.
I salute all of you.
The series is titled Gandhi-Mandela Series.
I congratulate them because many people started participating in the programme Mann Ki Baat - Mann Ki Baat.
Today I have to say something more about Kerala.
A letter was written to me by the students of the top schools of St. Mary, Kochi and Chittoor.
Mother India has sent me a picture of Mother India.
I was astonished at the beginning why they had painted the Indian image with their thumb impressions.
But I am understood after reading the letter written by those people who want to give such a great message.
These girls have not only made the Prime Minister aware of what they have done.
Their aim is to become a professional and progressive body.
These girls, in their letter, have written to me, "You should appeal to the people on the occasion of your Mann Ki Baat programme, and on the occasion of your Mann Ki Baat.
Sudhke Guruji, 80-year-old son of Maharashtra, has always been a votary.
He said that the body needs to be celebrated.
There are many messages coming to me on the phone too.
Devesh from Delhi also sent me such a message.
But with 125 crore people, only 5000 members of this country are being covered.
Each year, one lakh eyes are required.
We are only able to reach 25 thousand crores.
We are giving only one place where four eyes are needed.
If one dies in road accidents, then one can donate body parts.
There is also a lot of legal hassles.
We have established the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization - NOTO to promote organ transplanting.
24x7 Helpline 1800-114770 is available.
The Ten Techniques are said to have been sterile.
The joy of sacrifice and its finest description lies in the Mantra of Ten Technique Bhanji Tha.
All of us have seen it on TV recently.
Just now we have celebrated the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashami and Saturday night.
Ganesh Chaturthi also marks the birth of Lord Ganesh.
This is the first time that India is handling the force at such a big level.
I invite leaders from 54 African countries and counties.
Africa is the largest gathering of African countries.
If these two things meet, then we will become the third largest population of the world.
More than 25,000 African students are enrolled in India for Human Resource Development, Capacity Building, etc.
Many of those who have read here are now leaders in many countries of Africa.
This is what we know about a stronger relationship.
From that point of view, this conference is very important.
This time the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has done a good job.
The exhibition was attended by lakhs of students.
The people of the village have seen it.
People are aware of the great role that Mahatma Gandhi played in African-Indian relations and the impact of Mahatma Gandhi on the individuality of these two regions.
After that, many MPs have fulfilled this task.
He worked with utmost diligence.
In the last month, a programme has been organised in Bhopal.
The village elders, district collectors, members of parliament and all the central and state governments came together to discuss the Adarsh Gram Yojana in detail.
Unfortunately, this is what we hear when a terrorist attack, a bomb, a cyclone, or a blood-blooded land comes to Jharkhand.
Several areas have been devastated by the impact of Left Wing Extremism.
The officials encouraged them to visit the city.
Congratulations to Honble Speaker of the Parliament and Honble Members of the Parliament.

ShriRuvaalaGadkari inaugurated the KuruvaiGarib village on March 11, 2019.
Congratulations to ShriRuvala for his efforts in transforming the village of Adarsh and the village Self-Reliant India.
My dear brothers and sisters, How can we not talk about cleanliness in this mind
The message was sent by a woman from Mumbai, who is also known as Savitri Rai.
This time, on Diwali, let us clean our homes as well as our neighborhood.
As a result of this, the same movement on cleanliness started immediately after Diwali.
You have said that what we think before the festival should be brought into the form of a festival after the festival.
We should do this in every public programme.
Today, I specially congratulate all the media houses in the country.
On 2nd October last year, on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhis birth anniversary, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, I got the opportunity to participate in the India Todays Press Conference on Cleanliness.
The institute presented the Clean India Awards.
I am glad that such people have worked for 'Swachh Bharat' under the aegis of 'One Lakh One Mission'.
How many countries have been sanitized in our country
I heartily congratulate the India TV Group for this wonderful initiative.
He also interacted with about 55,56,000 school going children from Andhra and Telangana states, involving around 51 lakh children.
Cleanliness drive has been undertaken in various locations such as external locations, railway stations, spiritual places, hospitals and parks.
Now these messages will give us the strength to fulfil the goals of Swachh Bharat through these programmes.
Therefore, whatever suggestion Smt. Savita Rai has made, all the people of the country are now taking this programme further, considering it as their duty.
He further said that this village is home to the cleanest village award in Asia, the Cleanest Village.
I am glad to know that many villages in the state of Meghalaya, which are far away from our country, have won awards in the field of sanitation.
My dear countrymen, in my address from the Red Fort on the 15th of August, there are a few things that have disappeared.
When a poor person goes to a small job, how much he feels for the recommendations, how much money he asks for the money from his colleagues, the money goes for his job, the money goes for his job.
I have never heard of anyone in the world who could fully understand a person in an interview of one or two minutes with a psychological expert.
Greetings to all young friends on this occasion.
In the following budget, I announced a face-to-face scheme.
In our country, gold has become a part of our society.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in banks.
Now do not keep gold in the house .
The other thing is that gold rings do not come into your hands in the Savin Gold Bond.
But now we started it .
Therefore, there is no need to buy gold.
This scheme, which promises to be of security, will be taken forward by the people of the country in the coming week.
I am very happy to say that we are also bringing gold coins.
Why should there not be any indigenous sign of our country
Therefore, before the start of the week, we will be able to reach the common man with the help of 5 gms and 10 gms of Indian gold in the Ashoka Chakra.
Along with this, 20 gram gold will also be available to the people.
I am confident that this new scheme will bring about a new change in the direction of economy.
But the one mantra is a constant medium for our thinking, for our behavior and for our behavioral approach.
There is diversity in India .
Many classes, religions, traditions, many languages, different tribes and cultures.
Therefore, diversity is the only mantra.
Peace, harmony and togetherness - these are divine medicines for development.
For the past several years, on 31st October, we have been running the 'Run for Unity' at many places in the country.
Take the mantra forward.
Now all of you are engaged in the arrangements for Diwali and keep cleaning your homes.
New items can be bought.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated everywhere in the country.
Greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
But in the day of Deepavali, we keep hearing some problems.
Therefore, I am particularly excited about my visit to Britain.
Several years ago, Lord Basaveshwara had done the work of women empowerment for the democracy in the world.
The statue of Lord Vishweshwar on the soil of London is a shining example of how the great men of India think far and wide about centuries ago.
In a country like India, we have to learn many languages.
I will also try to reach you in your language at 8 in the night.
However, there is a good bond between us.
The year has been completed in the last edition.
Now we are entering a new year.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen.
Prime Minister's Office Mann Ki Baat Programme (Tuesday) September 2015
My dear countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat - Mann Ki Baat - One year, many words.
I dont know what you have got due to this but I can tell you how much I have got.
The power of the people is very important in the democracy.
There is a fundamental thought in my life that gives me immense confidence in the power of the people.
But through Mann Ki Baat, I have learnt, understood, understood and acquired through Mann Ki Baat, so I can say that we think, more and more peoples power is immense.
Our ancestors have said that people are a part of it.
But lakhs of people used to be alert and advising me.
This in itself is a great power.
These lakhs of examples have taught me a big lesson.
That is - information should reach the top level from the bottom to the bottom, which is actually moving from the top to the bottom.
Who can say that this information will change into Mann Ki Baat.
But it happened.
Similarly, in Mann Ki Baat, there is a need to bring about a change in the mindset of the society.
Keeping in mind the tourism sector in India, I have appealed to all the citizens, I have said - , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , : , , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , , : , : , : , : , : , : , , : , : , : , : , : , : , , : , : , : , , : , : , , : , , : , ,
However, such a big crisis has come.
Millions of people have photographed in the country.
A vision for the power of the people and a feeling.
Once I have spoken in Mann Ki Baat' episode of Mann Ki Baat, and in the houses of the poor people there is a smoke and children are crying.
It is difficult for the common man, the middle class and the lower middle class to get rid of the concession.
There is no place from Siachen or Kutch, but from Kamrup, Kashmir or Kanyakumari to call it a phone call.
Fonds have been done from all the places .
This is a pleasant experience.
The message was sent to all the aged people.
I would like to listen to some messages on my own and it is very good.
My team is working on the rest of them.
But the reason is that they listen to radio because they cannot watch TV.
I have come to know that radio is a great medium for the visually impaired.
I see another new dimension of how many good things they have told me - it is enough to awaken the government.
The message of Pavan Acharya was sent from Alwar in Rajasthan.
Soil prices are also priceless.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Vinaya, I got the opportunity to spend two to three hours with our soldiers.
Our army, the navy, the air force - the army, the army, the air force, the air force and the Navy - protect the land of the country, the sea and the sky.
In 1965, 50 years of war with Pakistan were completed.
A grand exhibition was also organized at the India Gate in Delhi.
I saw it with so much interest.
The battle that took place in Hajipur, but the battle that took place in Guni and Chaminda but the victory over the Dandi and Hajipur pass makes it easier to see.
Character is associated with our heritage.
I wish you and your families - if you are around Delhi, then this exhibition will be there for a few more days.
Don't go as fast as I can.
I returned in two and a half hours.
A young boy ordered the Prime Minister, but the boy soon forgot to mention his name.
For the first time since independence, the issue of cleanliness in the Parliament has been discussed for hours.
I am seeing good in this .
And the country's parliament also look at the other side to discuss the issue of cleanliness.
On one hand, MPs from across the country, MPs from both sides are talking about cleanliness.
And you know what Mahatma Gandhi will say.
He once said that if one has to choose one of the two freedoms and cleanliness, then he would choose cleanliness and independence.
Cleanliness is more important than independence for Gandhiji.
He said that he wants to know about Deen Dayal Jis Birth Anniversary.
Bapuji Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October.
5, Rs. 10 or Rs. 50, if any handloom or Khadi product is available, it will eventually reach the Khadi leaders.
I also want to share some of that joy with you.
When I went to Kolkata in May, members of Subhash Chandra Bose's family came here.
Chandra Bose, son of his brother.
Subhash Babu got the opportunity to spend the evening happily with his family members.
Over 50 members of the Subhash Bose family came to the Prime Minister's residence last week.
But what makes them happy is that the opportunity to host such a great human race has never come to the Prime Ministers residence, which I am going to get in October.
More than 50 members of Subhas Babu family from different countries are coming forward for this purpose.
Is it a moment of joy for me
Is it safe to have the precious power that I have got
In the meantime, I have visited Kashi.
I met many people .
One student, Kshitij Pandey, was a student.
There is something in the Central University of Banaras Hindu University.
But, at such a young age, I have always looked at the issues related to physiotherapy.
He had said that there is micro-technology in it, but his faith, I have seen it.
I hope that all the children of the country will develop interest in science.
Sometimes it also takes a little enjoyment with such plants.
Sometimes our astronomical tides are half an hour.
But - I will cherish your feelings.
Thank you for your suggestion.
Now it is fine for a month.
In a way, this year has been the year of Mann Ki Baat and you know it.
You know how much Subhash Babu used radio.
He also launched the Azad Hind Radio along with a weekly news bulletin.
He used to play radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, pass and Urdu in all languages.
It has also been a year for me to speak in Mann Ki Baat.
My Mann Ki Baat - because of you, it has become a matter of fact in your minds.
I am certain, but these days will be yours.
You should keep on giving your suggestions.
The government will also benefit from your suggestions.
Conditions begin.
Man Ki Bat , August 2015
On the second time there was a chance of coming in between you to tell words in my mind .
In the far southern part of the country, people are immersed in the auspicious occasion of Onam Sabra, the festival of Raksha Bandhan, celebrated all over the country yesterday.
Government of India has introduced many new schemes for social security of common people .
Since the launch of this scheme, over 11 crore families have been covered under this scheme, as per the latest data.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, I am talking to you - Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has been launched in a big way a year ago.
The youth have also been provided employment opportunities and in one year, the banking sector, the economy and the poor have also been given employment opportunities.
Do not just open your accounts.
He said that the poor will get money from the bank.
These banks are yours, you should not leave them now.
I have brought them to you and it is your duty to continue them.
All of us should have bank accounts alive.
I am confident that you will continue to do so.
Recently, incidents of violence and violence in Gujarat have troubled the whole country.
Whatever happens in the region of Gandhiji and Sardar Patel, the first country will suffer and the first country will suffer.
But, in a short span of time, the elders, my brothers and sisters, and all the citizens of Gujarat have overcome the situation.
They have played a pivotal role in containing the situation.
Peace, unity and brotherhood is the right path.
The way they speak, the simplicity with which they speak, the rhythm with which they speak, the rhythm with which the music is hidden.
All these things made me feel like being in the midst of them.
I feel that there is a need to tell the whole world about the true form of Islam.
I am confident that the warmth and compassion with which we can convey this message to far-flung areas.
I would like to share with others, that although we follow any religion, there is a need to understand the Sufi culture.
I will get another opportunity soon and I am fortunate to have this invitation.
Buddhist scholars from many countries around the world will visit Bodh Gaya in India.
I have been invited to participate in it and I am very happy to be here with them as they have come to Bodh Gaya.
Pandit Nehru went to Bodh Gaya, the first Prime Minister of our country.
I have already mentioned this thing in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
We have issued an ordinance on land acquisition.
The ordinance will be promulgated on 31st August, 2020.
But there was a depth in it .
That is why I had said on 15th August - not just the Department of Agriculture, but now it will become the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare - we have taken this decision very fast.
You dont need to be a victim of alarms.
While referring to the 1965 war, it is common to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
The Mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is also remembered.
It is very appropriate to recall the pride of India, the tricolor of India and its pride.
Such historical events always inspire us.
Just last week, I got the opportunity to meet those people associated with Sufi traditions - this is a great opportunity.
I have had the opportunity to interact with renowned scientists of the country for over an hour.
How to add a lab at the field level
It needs to be taken forward as an opportunity.
I have said in the conversation in the following Mann Ki Baat: There is a chance for students to take a lead in the direction of science, there is a lot of chance and there is a lot of opportunity.
Especially tell one thing to my young friends.
Everybody is running , at the lower level it can also be the cause of water .
Now the decision to free the small businesses from the medium of interviews is going to be almost implemented.
This is the first time that this meeting is being held in other countries outside the United States.
Till now, about 50,000 pregnant and 13 lakh babies in our country are dying every year at the time of delivery or at the time of delivery.
Just as we were free from polio, we were also free from TB in case of maternal and infant mortality.
There's news about Dengue in the meantime.
Let us not make death as easy as possible.
How much price is life .
Not paying attention to drinking water, nor is it easy to adopt hygiene, if it is a cause of death.
There are 514 centres across the country where free dengue testing is available.
Now we do not get the opportunity to die for the country, but we do not get the opportunity to live for the country.
These two brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
Sometimes we wrong our youth because of lack of awareness.
I would like to say - this has been going on for centuries.
My experience with the youth is different.
Sometimes you talk to the youth - there is a chance to learn something from them.
They say- "Sandey on Cycle" will be a boost.
Some say - we are observing cycle day in a week.
Man Ki Bat , June 2019 .
Salute , O ye land of my beloved .
Sometimes our words were inspiration for us .
How will I spend my time in this middle ?
On Sunday , the last Sunday at 11 o'clock I felt as if I had lost something .
Definitely feel like .
Probably this is not a unforgettable program .
This programme was life, it seemed private, it was mind-set and it was heart-to-hearts. Therefore, I felt very difficult to come here for this programme.
But this Sunday waited a lot .
In the last few months, many messages have come in, and people are also missing Mann Ki Baat.
It will be very good for me when I read these .
Why did I travel to Kedarnath in How many adventurous games ?
I can make your curiosity .
I also feel that feelings with you .
But when they talk, the form of 'Mann ki Baat' will change.
I am Baaldera before the completion of how many other poolings , in the contribution of Japanese .
Many people were discovered in it the meaning of Rajiki .
It's my fault, I gotta spend with me.
I can only say that because of the small break in the chain of Mann Ki Baat, there is an opportunity for me to fill the gaps in the caves of Kedar ghati and so on.
Not only this you also try to fulfil your curiosity one day .
Whenever I do not say , but definitely do .
Because you have that right over me.
As far as the people are concerned about Kedar, with the same carelessness , in some positive things you pay attention to , many times in your words .
Sometimes the work of making my thoughts also keep your words .
The problems faced by the people, the country and the society, and the challenges being faced by them are also being addressed by them.
If someone is writing about cleanliness, he will keep appreciating the efforts made for cleanliness while expressing his concern towards pollution.
That is , how the results of problems are seen in your words in the society of the society .
The country of Mann Ki Baat is like a tribute to the society.
This can be gauged from the fact that there is no dearth of internal power, strength and talent in the country.
There is a need to give an opportunity and work together to strengthen these forces and talent.
One more thing that can be learnt through Mann Ki Baat is that 130 crore people are actively and effectively involved in the development of the country.
When I do such things analysis, you can imagine how much strength I can enjoy.
Actually I didn't come, you brought me, sat down, you gave me the chance to talk again.
With this spirit, let us take forward the tradition of Mann Ki Baat.
There was a climber in the mind of all people .
Therefore the country not only for itself , but also for its own welfare , for the protection of democracy .
Probably the people of any country in the world have not only voted for democracy, but also without taking the rights, powers and needs of the people there.
Today's democratic election is the biggest election campaign in our country, from the rich to the poor, everyone is happy to participate in this festival and to decide the future of our country.
When something is near us, we underestimate it, and ignore its harmonizing effects.
But if we look at the world, if we leave China, we can say that more than the population of any other country in the rest of the world has voted.
How many people were voted in the numbers of members in 2019 , that number is more than the total population of America .
The total number of Ootters of India is more than the total population of Europe .
It highlights the vastness of our democracy.
The number of members in 2019 is now the biggest democracy of the world in history .
You can imagine how much manpower and arrangements are required for this kind of electricity.
It is possible only on the day of lacs of students , rulers , workers , workers in the daytime .
About 3 lakh Paramilitary personnel have been entrusted with the responsibility to fulfill this great mandate of democracy and 20 lakh police personnel of different states have also worked tirelessly.
As a result of their hard industry this time more Ooting has been done .
More than 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines and more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines across the country, you can imagine in such a big way.
This has been done to ensure that no one Ooty has got the opportunity to do so.
A polling station has been set up for a woman operator in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
If you have to travel for two days to reach there then you will be surprised .
But this is the pride of democracy .
Poling center of the highest place in the world is in India .
It is located at a height of 15000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Moreover, there is another aspect of pride in these numbers.
Probably for the first time in history, women also participated in Ooting, as much as men.
The percentage of comparison to women and men is almost equal in these numbers .
Although enthusiasm is that in parlor today 78 -LRB- 78 -RRB- women were employed in parlor .
My dear countrymen, you must have heard it many times, not just a book, but a book.
I pray that we give books instead of flowers in welcome and hospitality.
Approximately such books are being given at many places .
The book Prem Chand Ki Lok dear Kahania was given by me.
It liked me a lot .
I could not find a long time , while in delivery I got the opportunity to read some stories again .
Their stories reflect the feelings of the whole of India.
Reading the story of 'Nasa', I turned my attention to the economic inequalities of the society.
When I was young, I remembered how many nights spent in the discussions on this matter.
We know that the son of Jamindar Ishwari, from this story of the poor family, if not cautious, then we will know about the impact of evil harmony.
Id ghah, the heart of a child, his pure love for his mother and his hobbies at an early age.
Taking 4 . years from Hamid Sanctuary to go to my mother , in reality it is considered the destination of human heart .
The last words of this story will not be so emotional and the younger Hamid's party plays - old Amina, Amina, has become a small sin.
Similarly, Pus Ki Baat is a memorable story.
In this story a poor life style is seen .
It is not necessary to sleep at night like a camp for the field in the cold of his fruit that he has not been destroyed .
Actually this story is a century old , today it seems appropriate for the contribution of today .
After reading these I am a special experience .
If I talk about reading , then in some media I read about Akshar Library of Kerala .
If this library is in a village of dense forests then you will not be surprised .
The first school student there is P . .
K.
Both of them have worked tirelessly for this library.
Once one has to be brought by carrying the books on the shoulders .
Today this library is looking everybody along with the tribal children .
Gujarat Vanchek (Chaudhary Gujarat) Movement is a successful experiment in Gujarat.
Lakhs of people from all age groups have participated in this campaign.
Definitely write to the NarendraModi App on whatever book you have read so that everyone in the Mann Ki Baat can know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy that the people of our country think not only about the present but also about the future challenges.
I have seen your comments on the Narendra Modi App and Mygov, and a lot of people are writing about the problem of water.
I have written about the problems related to water in Belagavi, Pawan Gorai in Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Farid in Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf.
Water is very important in our culture .
It has been said about the water of sadness in the menstruation . Apo hypnotise , hypnotise , hypnotise , hypnotise , hypnotise , hypnotise , hypnotise , hypnotise , meaning is the power of life .
Every year in many places of the country the problem of water is lifting up .
We can hide only 8 % water in the rainy season falling along with the year that you will not be surprised .
Only 8% .
The result of this problem has to be discovered .
Let us resolve all the remaining issues with peoples participation, with the strength of the people, with the ability and resolve of 100 crore Indians.
A new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been set up in the country, considering the importance of water as the most important factor.
By this in all the matters related to water one can take fast decisions .
Some times I did a new work .
The serpentine of the country has written the northern tip of all the villages .
In order to collect water for the villagers , to collect water , to collect water every drop of rain water they have organized a meeting in the village council , to discuss with the villagers .
This month, on the 22nd of this month, crores of people have donated their labour sweat in the Panchayati Raj.
People in the villages have resolved to collect every drop of water.
Today, in the 'Mann ki Baat' programme, I would like to share a surprise with you.
The Lupung Panchayat Sarpanch of Katkam Sandy Block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand gives us a message that my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
Once again the people there were ready to play their part in the water conservation .
All the heads of the villages , all the serpents have many feelings for their activity .
The people of the village seem to be competitioning to build the water temple of their villages .
The positive results of warning are seen before , collective efforts .
There is no alternative for the result of the problem of water throughout the country .
Therefore efforts are being made in various ways in different parts of the country .
This will remove the problem of water logging.
A major change has been brought about in the small ponds set up in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
20,000 women together made a collective effort to revive the Naga river in Vellore, Tamil Nadu.
I also read that all the women in Garhwal are working together on the rain water harvesting.
I am confident that if we try our best together, we will make the impossible possible.
My first prayer - how did the countrymen swachhata become a mass movement, and also for water conservation.
Let us collectively resolve to collect every drop of water, and I believe that water is the prasada of Parameswaran.
In order to save every drop of water one has to do a necessity .
Talk about the problems of water in it , talk about water conservation methods .
I would particularly urge the heads of various areas to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Whether it is the field of cinema, whether it is sports or sports, whether it be our friends in the media or be it the people of social institutions or be it the people of cultural institutions or be it the preachers or not, everyone should lead this movement in their own way.
wake up the society , do the society together , work with the society .
Look, we'll definitely see the change before our eyes.
I appeal to all of you to share the traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you have the opportunity to visit the birthplace of the revered Bapu, there is a house behind the house of the revered Bapu where there is a water storage tank of 200 years.
I always keep on saying that if someone goes to Kirti Mandir then definitely look at that water tank.
Come, let us make a list of best practices related to water conservation and motivate people to conserve water.
All of you can share your content using the Hanshakti4alShakhi tag.
The awareness about Holistic Health Care has increased, in which the importance of Yoga has increased.
At the time of sunrise in all the corners of the world yoga practice is welcomed , the sunrise takes place .
Wherever man is yoga has been done there .
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to the Sub Marine Verses, from Air-Fore to Air Craft Carriers, from AC Gyms to the desert and from villages to cities, Yoga is not only possible, but has also been organized collectively.
In a tweet, the Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent people and common citizens of many countries have shown me how Yoga can be practiced in their own countries across the globe.
On that day the whole world looked like a happy family .
Therefore the propagation of yoga is a great society .
Do not recognize the cost of this service .
Prime Minister's Awards for those who have played a significant role in the promotion and development of Yoga in 2019 are a matter of great happiness for me.
This award has been given to many institutions across the world and you cant imagine the crucial role played by them in spreading the message of Yoga.
For example, by taking Japan Yoga Niketan, it has made Yoga popular all over Japan.
There are many institutions and training courses run by Japan Yoga Niketan.
Later Miss of Italy .
Antonietta Roi, has initiated the Sarvayog International and practiced Yoga all over Europe.
These are all suitable .
In the case of yoga related to yoga Indians are not able to go back .
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger also received the award and is dedicated to Yoga for the past few decades.
The award for the widespread celebration of Yoga and for those who include the message of Yoga at home, has made this Yoga Day more important.
My dear countrymen, our journey is beginning today, new emotions, new experiences, new resolutions, new capabilities.
Although I am waiting for your advice .
Walking with your ideas is an important journey and a 'Mann ki Baat' mission.
Come , we are meeting , talking .
While listening to your feelings , keep understanding .
Sometimes try to live according to those emotions .
Never stay your hopes on me.
You are my inspiration , ye are my strength .
Come, let us sit together and cherish the duties of life while enjoying the Mann Ki Baat.
Let us meet once again in the next month in Mann Ki Baat.
Blessed is many of you all .
Hello.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today the mind is India while starting the Man Ki Bat .
The creator Bharat had lost his sons for ten days .
These mighty men have lost their lives for the protection of 125 crore people of the country .
For sleeping peacefully the people of the country these virgins saved us from their sleep .
Our armed forces have always displayed unparalleled courage and valour.
Ram Niranjanji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, in such sad moments, his thoughts also inspire all of us.
He said that he would also send his second son to fight against the enemy, if necessary, he would also fight.
Seeing the courage of the martyrs of Jagtsingpur Tallu of Orissa , the wife of Prasanna Sahas , the whole country salutes her .
Today, every child of India tells us everything.
It is not like this that we are seen in the houses of our Veer, Parakram, Amaravir.
Their families also have no mineral in it .
The martyrs of Deoria, the family of Vijay Maurya, the parents of Tilak Raj of Kangra, the son of Hem Raj, the son of a 6 year old martyr of Kota - anyone, every family of these martyrs is full of stories.
I request the youth to know and understand the feelings displayed by these families.
The living witnesses in front of our eyes are the inspiration of the future of India .
My dear countrymen, though there are so many homes in our freedom struggle, are we still waiting for the memorial of war or not
I was astonished that there was no National War Memorial in India.
It is a memorial of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the country .
I am determined to make such a memorial in the country.
It is a matter of great happiness that the construction of the National War Memorial was completed in a very short span of time.
To morrow , that is on the 25th of February , on the 25th of February , we will give this national military memorial to the army of Kotalalala country .
This is a small effort by the country to fulfil their debt.
The memorial has been erected close to the heart of Delhi, that is, in Delhi, where there is India Gate and the Martyrs Jyoti.
I believe that visiting this national soldiers memorial is equal to visiting a pilgrimage of the people of the country .
After the independence of the country this national monument is a symbol of thanks to seeing the country for the soldiers given maximum sacrifices for the country .
This monument symbolizes the unique courage of our martyrs.
The design of the National Military Memorial consists of four central circles, the entire journey that took place from the birth of every soldier to the gallant action taken in the first round.
The flame of Amar Chakra is a symbol of immortality .
The second circle is the heroic wheel.
There is a queue of dense trees in this wheel .
Looking at the essence, it has become a must for the visitors to visit the National Military Memorial to learn about the great martyrs of our country, to express their gratitude and to explore them.
Here are the donkeys of those who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the country and the development of our lives.
For the development of the country it is not possible to say in the words of our armed forces , police , para military teams .
In October last year, I also got the opportunity to dedicate this National Military Memorial to the nation.
The National Police Memorial epitomises the thoughts that we express gratitude to the police personnel and the police personnel who are constantly striving to protect all of us.
I hope that all of you will go to see the National Police Memorial , National Police Memorial .
Whenever you go there, you must share the photographs taken there in social media so that others also get inspired to go there.
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, I will get the opportunity to read thousands of replies, speeches and stories from all over the country through various mediums.
This time when I was reading your speeches, I could see an interesting suggestion written by Ashish Mukhopadhay ji.
What does he not come , on the 3th March , 1900 , on the 3th day of March , when the British expressed Birsa , his age is only the milk .
In a way, paying homage to Birsa Munda and two Jamshed Ji Tata in Mann Ki Baat, it is a way to remember the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great leaders not only Jharkhand but also the fame of India .
With them, the entire India is grateful to them.
Today, it is important for the youth of Mann Ki Baat to know about some inspiring personality, which is the great Bhagwan Birsa Munda.
The English hid him , and took him while he was sleeping .
Why do you know the cost of such a person ?
He had seen all this in his small life .
Sun rays have filled the light in their life of mosquitoes , mosquitoes .
Mahabharat had sacrificed his life in the small age of the milk of Birsa Munda .
But itching is that the stories of the people of those places , beauty , sacrifices have not been able to present even today .
He knows very well how important it is to make India a science, technology and industry hub.
The Tata Institute of Science has been established from a distance and is now known as the Indian Institute of Science.
Besides this he established many world level institutions , companies etc .
Jamshed Ji Tata Reiki , Samavas Swami Vivekanand Reiki has been done in a ship in the campaign of America .
My dear countrymen, on the 29th of February, the birth anniversary of the former Prime Minister of India, Mr.
Today comes only four years once .
Muraji Bhai, full of natural and peaceful personality, is one of the most disciplined leaders of India.
The name of Morarji Bhai Desai was registered as the person who introduced the highest budget in the independent India Parliament.
During the difficult time of the difficult period of the nation's democracy, the country was run by its expert leadership with Morarji Desai.
To save delivery Muraji Bhai is also drowned in fighting against the emergency of the emergency of the country .
That is why in his old age also he had to pay heavy price .
Since then the government had also kept him in jail .
In 1977 he became the prime minister when he was successful in so many numbers .
In his eleventh century 44th kingdom was brought .
Why is this important (Emergency) as per the 42nd Constitution Amendment in the Emergency situation - reducing the power of the Supreme Court and such other arrangements - such as harming our democratic values
Similarly , in 1975 as in the emergency of emergency the democracy of democracy was done , in such a future without happening in the future the fixed arrangements were done .
The future generations will remember his invaluable contribution in keeping the Indian democracy alive.
I dedicate such a great leader once .
My dear countrymen, every time, people have been excited about the Padma Awards.
Today, we are taking steps towards a New India so that we can take pride in those who work with a sense of self-reliance at the grass root level.
With their hard work, people are bringing about positive changes in the lives of others in various ways.
Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalya, Bhagwad Gita is one such message which is lively and truly relevant.
The canalman of the Odyssey used to make a path of three kilometres by digging the hill with his hands only in his village , by removing the problem of water from his industry , water problem forever .
On the birth anniversary of Abdul Ghafur Khatri of Gujarat, he has done a wonderful job of reviving the traditional Rogan painting in the Kutch region.
Internationally this art is doing important work to give new artists .
I have presented the President of the United States of America, Mr. Barack Obama, on the Tree of Life painted by Abdul Ghafur Khatri.
And Padmasri answered and said , Among them Shebir Saiyad of Marathawa was recognized as the servant of the mother of Gomata .
On hearing about the Tao Porchon-Lynch of the United States, you will be reminded of the communities.Lynch became a living yoga institution today.
Even at the age of 100, she has trained people in Yoga all over the world and has made 1500 Yoga trainers world over.
Popularly known as Lady Tarzan in Jharkhand, Jamna Tudo, Timber Mafia Tonu, and Naxalites fought valiantly and motivated 10,000 women to fight for the protection of trees and wildlife not only to save the 50 hectares of forest but also to save the 50 hectares of land.
Kisan Chachi of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, the story of Raj Kumari Devi is very inspiring.
Shed has been an example of women empowerment and making agriculture more profitable.
My dear countrymen, today I want to share with all of you, the feeling that I have been experiencing for a few days.
Wherever I go, I wish to see the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) and the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat scheme.
In the last five months of brother , Sodari Manulara , about twelve lakh poor families have been found from this myth .
I have seen how this scheme is bringing about changes in the lives of the poor.
Even if you are not able to take care of the treatment , if someone is suffering from difficulty then tell them about this technique .
This technique is the desire of such poor families .
The time of testing in my favorite country , schools has come .
In some weeks coming to various students of the country the arrangement of board tests are started .
My heartiest greetings to all the students who are going to appear for the exams, their mentors and teachers.
A few days ago, a big program of discussion on examinations was organized in the Town Hall format in Delhi.
Students, their parents and parents can view the entire recording of the program in YouTube.I congratulate all my Exam Warriors on the upcoming exams.
My dear countrymen, while talking about India, there is no question of festivals.
There will not be any day in our country without any significance, without any festival.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago I went to Kashi and there I got the opportunity to spend some time with my Divyang brothers and sisters.
It is said that I will make you prime minister .
Apart from listening to me , people remember many times apart from listening to Mann Ki Baat .
I was really impressed by seeing the power of that Divya brother .
My dear countrymen, it is a unique experience for me to connect with you all through Mann Ki Baat.
In a way, through the medium of radio, I will face crores of families every month.
Often, talking to all of you, reading your answers, hearing your comments on the phone, it seems that all of you are treating me as an individual in your families.
This is a pleasant experience for me .
Friends, Elections to the democracy are such a big festival.
The next two months we were standing in all the competitions .
I myself will be a candidate in these numbers.
The next day is the Sunday of the month of May , by honoring the healthy democracy system .
Man ki Bat, January 2019
It is said that Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji was no more .
Shiva Kumar Swamiji had dedicated all his youth life to the society .
Lord Basaveshwara taught us that it is like going to Kailash, a Shiva residence, to fulfil your duties while working hard.
The Swami Temple of Shiva is walking on this garden .
He is a church .
For giving food , shelter , education , economic knowledge to people only he has played his life for his entire life .
The rails are continuously peaceful that he is the most important thing in life .
Definitely the organization of animals , agricultural vegetation is done by Siddhganga Math .
The worshipped Swami Giri had also heard a poet of that contribution .
Dr. Kalagaji presented the entire life of Shri Shiva Kumar Swamiji and the aim of Siddhaganga Mutt through this poem.
Once I offer my tribute to this Mahatma.
My beloved country , 1950 , January 226 our country came into the embrace of the kingdom of our country .
On that day our country has become a Ganesha country .
Yesterday we celebrated our Republic Day with great fervor and pride.
But I want to say something .
The whole world is surprised to see how many arrangements are done in India .
You must have heard about Gujarat.
In a beautiful place of Gir forest only a poliling market is held for one Ooty .
With the purpose of getting the opportunity to use his Ooty for one Ooty , with the purpose of getting the opportunity to use his Ooty , how many accidents the hair of the workers go far away .
This is the beauty of our Ganesha country .
I am giving so many accidents to keep our Ganesha strong .
I also say that in how many types of activities participating , independent , independent , innumerable incidents of all the states , the rest of the workers have also been impressed .
The responsibility of all that is responsible for us .
I believe that in large numbers our young operators enroll their names , with their participation they give more strength to our Republic .
My dear countrymen, many great men were born on this holy land of Bharatgarh and they have done some wonderful and unforgettable things for humanity.
On 23rd January, India celebrated his birth anniversary in a different manner.
I got the opportunity to start a museum built in the memory of the Mahavirs which provided their participation in the freedom movement of India .
Do you know that many rooms are closed in the Red Fort of Independence ?
How beautiful museums have been fulfilled in all the rooms closed .
NetajiSubhash Chandra Bose Ki, a museum in the Indian National Army, another 1857 -Eighten Fighty Sen, Indias First War of Independence.
In every room of these museums, our glorious history is full of miracles.
It was at this very place that the British Government led the Indian mother's son Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Delo, Major General Shahnawaz Khan, who was also present on the occasion.
While displaying memories related to Netaji in the Kranti Mandir of the Red Fort , one of the members of the Netaji had presented me a rare cap .
At times it is necessary to keep on repeatedly in different forms for the new generation about the beauty of our officers , patriots .
Last month on December I went to Andaman Nicobar island .
The creator of 75 years where Netaji had flighted the Trivarnapattanam , right at the same place Trivarnapattanam again .
In October 2018, the people were surprised to see the tricolor flying in the Red Fort because there is a habit of flying only 15 August .
Azad Hind Sirkar had flighted in the completion of 75 years .
Subhash Bab is always remembered as a soldier , a expert driver with a expert .
Netaji files have been asked for a long time to be publicized.
It's fun for me to say we can.
I remember even more on the day of coming to the whole family of Netaji 's family .
We told many stories about Netaji . Netaji had glorified the devotion of Netaji .
It gives me great pleasure to make an attempt to develop some places associated with some great leaders of India .

Man Ki Bat, November 2018
On the 3rd of October 2014, on the occasion of Vijayadashami, Mann Ki Baat had started with a journey through Mann Ki Baat.
The journey of Mann Ki Baat, ours, is completing 50 bags with today.
That is why it is our Golden Jubilee episode that is, today is the golden jubilee of Mann Ki Baat.
This time, the phone calls from all of you and the answers presented by you all have often referred to the celebration of Golden Jubilee.
Ashok Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar and Vikas Yadav from Patna.
He asked what is the whole week , people consider you to be the most latest technology , social media , mobile phones .
But why have you done the medium of radio to meet people ?
I have to tell you a story .
This was done in 1998 .
It was the time when I was working as a member of Bharatiya Janata Party in Himachal Pradesh.
Can we call a bomb in India
I said I don't understand.
Then he said , Behold , listen to radio , the same thing has been discussed in radio .
When our Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji came forward and declared that the molecular probes were conducted on that day, how much is the use of this tea on radio.
I used to estimate the power of radio .
It is natural for me to turn my eyes towards the most powerful medium after I became the Prime Minister.
The figures coming in this survey are very interesting .
There has also been a wide range of discussions on the Indo-Pacific.
This is a very good example of the positive attitude of the people of our country , positive emotions .
Some people also shared their experiences that the spirit of voluntary service has also increased due to the Mann Ki Baat.
People are coming forward in a big way for the service of the society and this is a big change.
I am very happy that because of the Mann Ki Baat programme, radio is becoming more popular.
The answers to every episode of Mann Ki Baat, online lectures, phone calls, etc., are clearly visible.
Modi comes and goes, but this country will be stable and our culture will continue to endure for ever.
These small stories of the country of 130 crore people of the country are alive forever .
All these give new inspiration to this country , with new enthusiasm they do the highest peaks .
My experiences also participate with water as well .
Thereafter, it will gradually move towards a change in terms of household, social media and whatsapp.
He said that the younger generation will also be taught about the setting up of their own homes, and at times the impact of phone calls on the Prime Minister.
From a small village in Haryana to a SelfieWithDaughter and not only in the country but also abroad, which government can have the power to do so
Many a times, Mann Ki Baat has also become a mockery, but I have always had 130 crore countrymen in my mind.
They are all my mind .
Man Ki Bat is not the word of the government , it is the word of the society .
Mann Ki Baat is an appeal of India, a glorious India.
There is a kind of spirituality in your question .
The biggest honour of 50th Man Ki Bat Talluku is that besides one Prime Minister you ask a question of a nearby person , this is the democracy .
If you want to answer your question easily then there is no need to be made.
Assam Man Ki Bat is a very easy task for me .
Every time people come in front of the Manki Bat .
MyGov, Narendra Modi Mobile App has a toll-free number 1800117800.
The people who have phoned the number will record their message with their throats.
Before the beginning of Man Ki Bat I try to read more northern , more details themselves .
I hear a lot of phone calls myself .
I will read the ideas and inputs sent by you during my journey to Mann Ki Baat.
Every moment all the people of my country are in my mind . Therefore who read anything north , the situations of those who read north , their feelings become part of my thoughts .
This north is not only the pieces of Kait .
Actually the real things that is , the name of the person , the name of the person etc . is done .
In Mann Ki Baat, the throat, examples, emotions and excitement are the people of my country and I thank everyone who has participated in Mann Ki Baat.
Their north , expansive expansions are not able to read , then the number of northern , expansive people is in lakhs .
There will also be an effort to convey unstinted answers and suggestions to the relevant sections of the society.
I also express my gratitude to all my colleagues from radio, Doordarshan, other TV channels and social media.
Because of their trouble many people can reach Manki Bat .
Akashwani Vrindananda program is spread in many languages .
Some people are listening to the voice of the monastery near the throat in the province language as well .
Similarly they are changing the Nrandra Modi along with those thirty minutes .
I urge all of you to listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme in your language.
It is believed that everyone is aware that less coverage has been done, or that the news about those cases is against them.
But the media has changed a lot of things in Mann Ki Baat into its own.
The media has worked in a new way by providing a new dimension to many things like cleanliness, road safety, drugs free India, selfie with daughter etc.
If you do not have any support then the journey of this Man Ki Bat was incomplete .
"Thank you very much for your phone call, Mr.
If you want to say the truth then there is no secret with me .
We do not stop the old things of our own life , it is easy to understand anyone in front .
Sometimes our bird sanctuary provides the biggest obstruction of the conferences .
Recognizing , not confessing , trying to understand something instead of every reaction is my first priority .
I have been trying to talk to the youth in various programmes or through social media.
I am trying to understand , thinking .
It is a very good thing to question the youth .
They are expert in multi tasking .
If we pay attention to the reasons around us , social entrenchment i . . , start ups , sports , or any other part of the society has brought big changes in the society .
If the question is courageous , adventurous dreams then it is young .
They can bring about positive changes in the country by giving them freedom to express the ideas of the youth on the ground and they are also doing so.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to Vineeta Ji, I would like to talk about the Statehood Day in Mann Ki Baat tomorrow i.e 26th November.
This day is very special because we have accepted the constitution and today we are asking for it in the 75th year.
Blessed is the most blessed for your suggestion .
Within three third three storeys all this great empire has given us a very wide , expansive kingdom .
The sea shore built by an extraordinary speed is also an example of Time management Co , Productive Kei .
This also inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities during the record time .
The Constituent Assembly is in sync with the great talents of the country, each one of them committed to provide a Constitution that empowers the people of the country and empowers the poorest of the poor.
Our Constitution describes in detail the rights and responsibilities, the specialty of our Constitution.
This synergy in the lives of the citizens of the country will take the country forward.
On completion of 60 years of Indian Constitution in 2010, we threw the book of Constitution on the elephant in Gujarat.
In the youth an attempt to encourage the state government , to give them the opportunity of the state .
We will complete seventy five years as a Republic in 2020 and we will complete seventy five years of our independence in 2022.
My beloved country , if you talk about the council of the kingdom , then this original man standing at the center of the kingdom is unforgettable with Mahabubhar .
Praswamy Baba Saheb is in Narnaar . The democracy of India has not come out of the price .
What is the cost of the cost of Ganesha that is , what is the cost .
India First - This is the original mantra of Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar .
On the second time the worshipers of Babasa Saheb Ambedakar were worshipped .
Guru Nanak Devji had always been associated with the category of people .
He had always seen the way of truth , karma , service , mercy , self-confidence .
The country will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in the coming year, and the joy of these festivals spread not only in the country but in the entire world.
All State Governments and UT Governments have been asked to celebrate this festival in a grand manner.
Similarly Guru Nanak Ji is celebrated in all the countries of the world .
Apart from this, a special train will also be run connecting all the holy places related to Guru Nanak ji.
When I attended a meeting related to this, I remembered the Port of Lucknow.
Because of the earthquake coming in 2001 the Gurudwara also got injured rapidly .
But the state government, along with the local people, revived this gurudwara and said that it would prove to be an example today.
Government of India has taken a major decision to construct Kartarpur corridor so that the pilgrims of our country can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak in Kartarpur.
Come, let us move ahead with this journey.
Manki Bat , October 2018 .
On the 31st of October 31st day of October the favorite Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel Garden of all of us .
Just like every year, the youth of the country is ready to participate in the Run for Unity, which is being run for Unity.
Now the weather is also pleasant .
I request all of you to participate in large numbers in the Run for Unity, which is being organized for unity.
Six and a half months before Independence, on 27 January 1947, the world's leading international journal Time Magazine brought out a reform on the paper cover by Sardar Patel.
In their lead story, this journal has given India the status of a magazine.
But this is not the India that we see today.
India is divided into many parts .
There were approximately 550 national heritages in the country .
The interest of the British towards India had decreased but they wanted to leave India in pieces .
Time magazine has also made other stores of man 's life in his business .
In the floods in Ahmedabad in 1920, he started a series of relief work and guided the Bardoli Satyagraha.
Sardar Patel Garud had fulfilled the impossible work of making the country comprehensively .
We will naturally remember Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel ji who was bound by the unity of India.
Located on the Narmada River in Gujarat, the statue is double the height of the Statue of Liberty of America.
This is the biggest statue of the world 's largest statue .
Every Indian is proud that the world's highest statue is in our country.
Not only this the Sardar Patel situated in the earth is now increasing the beauty of the sky .
It is natural to see this statue of every Indian .
I am confident that people of every corner of India will consider this place as the most favorite place to visit.
My dear brothers and sisters, Yesterday, all the people of our country celebrated 'Infancy Day'.
I salute all those involved in the Indian Army.
I am also making their adventurous games for the families of our soldiers .
But do you know why all our countrymen celebrate this infantry day
On this day, our Indian soldiers rescued the Kashmir Valley from the moorings of the Kashmir Valley.
This historical incident is also directly related to Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
I once read the old interview of an important Indian army officer of Sam Manekshaw .
During the interaction, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw remembered the days he was Colonel.
At that time, in October 1947, military battles had started in Kashmir.
In one of the meetings, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had recalled his anger over the delay in sending troops to Kashmir and in that meeting, Sardar Patel had not been able to delay any delay in the fight against the army in Kashmir in his own way.
The cost of my favorite country , sports , who does not like anyone .
In the world of sports, spirit, strength, skill and capability - all these are important.
These are a sports for the success of a game .
How important is the construction of any country .
The country that has these qualities in its youth, that country will not only develop economic, science and technology but will also emerge as a player in the field of sports.
These are my two times .
First, the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta got the opportunity to meet our para athletes.
Our Para Athletes created by the record by India achieving a total of 72 medals in these games have made India proud.
I got the opportunity to meet these talented para athletes themselves.
Similarly, there was an opportunity to meet the winners of the Summer youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina.
You will be happy to know that our youth has shown their talent more than ever in the yoreth Olympics 2018.
In these competitions, our country won 3 more medals in addition to the 13 medals in Padu Mix event.
This time it will be remembered for all of you that even in the Asian Games, our country has made its mark.
How many times I climb this far in a few minutes , see whether it is more important than ever , like using substances .
India has set new records not only in the field of sports but also in the field of sports as we never imagined.
To spend his life coming out of the orphanage he did the work of cleaning DTC buses and watering in Dhabal near Delhi's road.
At the same time Narayan is participating in the international competitions , golden plates of India .
Not only this , see the increasing capacity in the sports of India .
India has never achieved any Olympic medal in Judo, Senior Level and Junior Level.
But in the European Olympics the history of Tababi Devi has created the history of silver .
The 16-year-old young player, Tababi Devi, resides in a village in Manipur.
If the father go to the hire , then the mother selled fish .
Many times there were no money for food in their house .
In such a situation also the courage of Babab Devi has not been decreased .
History has created the history by gaining neck for the country .
Every youngster is inspired by the New India.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that in 2017, we successfully organized the FIFA Under-17 World Cup.
The whole world has given it a very successful tour.
We have also created a new agreement on the number of viewers in the FIFA U-17 World Cup.
More than 12 lakh viewers from different stadiums across the country enjoyed watching these football competitions and encouraged the young players.
This year, India had the privilege of hosting the Mens Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The hockey world camp starts on 28 November and runs on 16 December .
Any kind of sports playing Indian Indian Indian or some game is definitely interesting .
There is a golden history of India in hockey game .
Hakiki Mantra is known worldwide about Major meditation .
After that, it has been decided to go a long way in the game of Hockey by calling from Balvinder Singh Senior, Lesley claudis, Mohammad Shahid and Udham Singh as Dhanraj.
Today our Team India games are inspiring to new generations of hockey players with their industry and success.
Watching the emotional competitions is a good opportunity for games .
On going to Bhubaneswar all of you must watch hockey matches , encourage your players .
My dear countrymen, a lot of people are coming forward to organise social programs voluntarily, and all of them are going to be an inspiration for all the people of the country.
It is our tradition that lasted for thousands of years and today we are able to see the legacy of this heritage everywhere in the society and in every field.
But in this new era, new generations are coming forward to do this work with new zeal, new hopes and new dreams.
Its name is 'Self 4 society ' . Mygov , other IT , electronic scientists of the country do not motor their employees to do social programs , so that they do not give them the right opportunity .
All Indians will be proud to see the enthusiasm and zeal with which they have seen to run this programme.
From IT to Society, I am not, we are not, um, age and the journey from self to society.
Some children read , some elders are reading .
Some pay attention to cleanliness , some help the rails .
There is no feeling behind all these things, there is only a sense of dedication and a sense of resolve.
A young man himself learned Velchair Basketball to help the Divyangs team.
Mission mode activity i . . this desire , is the feeling of surrender .
Definitely pride .
The spirit of I am not, it inspires all of us.
My dear sisters and brothers, This time when I see your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, a interesting comment was written by Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pondicherry.
He said, What could be said in MyGov is the great example of Indian tribal traditions, customs and nature and living in harmony with nature.
Mansh Guru , I congratulate you for proposing such a thing before the category of Manki Bat .
This is an opportunity to inspire us to look back on our glorious culture and past.Today, the entire world, especially the western countries, is discussing ways to protect the environment.
Our India also faces this problem .
We have to look at our history and our contacts once again for the solution.
It is in our tribal culture that we have to understand the life style of our tribals and live in harmony with nature.
Our tribal brothers and sisters consider trees , plants , fruits and goddesses .
The tribals of Bhil cut in the middle of India especially in Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh region of Madhya Pradesh worship Ravi , Arjun trees .
In the desert area like Rajasthan Vishnoi society has seen how to protect environment .
Especially in the matter of preserving trees they are ready to give their life soldiers but one tree does not let harm .
It is believed that the people of Mishmi tribe of Arunachal Pradesh are related to tigers.
The tigers are considered to be their tails .
Even in Nagaland, tigers are considered as protectors of forests.
The Gond tribe in the Central India will stop fishing in some areas of the Cathan river during the breeding season.
Adivasis build their homes with natural resources, which are not only solid but also environment friendly.
In south India a small cut of smoke residing in the solitary areas of Nilgiri Peeth is made of small things available in the traditional places of their villages .
My dear brother, brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal communities believe in living together and peacefully, but if someone destroys their natural resources, they will not be afraid to fight for their rights.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, I am reminded of the extraordinary contribution that we have made for the society and institutions.
Seeing small , due to those works there is a very deep effect .
Just a few days ago, I had read about Gurbachan Singh, a brother of Punjab.
A common Ratu Guru Baban Singh has married a son of labouring .
Before this marriage Guru Babachan had done the marriage of the married daughter to the parents of the parents , but one of my guests .
But all of you will be astonished at the condition that a common brother Gurubachan asked that this is the true strength of our society.
One such example is the family of Shri Gurbachan Singh ji.
I read about another small village near Nabha in Punjab, Kallar Mazra.
Why is this village, which is called Kallar Mazra, a village where the people of the village gather instead of burning the rest of the paddy straw in the field, so that the soil is exposed to the soil and how much technology is needed for it.
Congratulations to brother Gurbachan Singh ji.
I congratulate the people of Kallar and all those who try to keep the environment clean and clean.
All of you have been leading the Indian tradition of clean living as true representatives.
The drops and drops play a very important role in creating a positive environment like swab , small precautions , good work , positive work and always .
May there be peace in life, in heart, in me, in thee, in every part of the world.
The 11th of November, 2019 is special for India as the first World War on November 11, 2019 was concluded.
After the end of the war, the 1st century will be completed by the destruction of the massive destruction that took place.
The First World War is an important event for India.
If you want to say properly then we have no relation with the war .
However, our soldiers fought with valour, played a big role and sacrificed a lot.
On the coming of war the Indian soldiers had seen the world .
Our soldiers have seen their bravery in difficult terrains and adverse situations.
The only purpose behind all this is to restore peace.
World War I saw the destruction of the world.
According to the estimation approximately one crore soldiers , other forts have lost their lives .
Therefore the world knows how important is the world .
In the last bridge the meaning of peace has changed .
This is the peace , goodwill that is not only the war .
From acute pain the weather has to change the social judgment of social development , economic development .
Nirodh is the true sign of the development of the person .
My dear countrymen, there is a difference between our North-East states.
The region is blessed with immense natural beauty and people-to-people contacts.
This award for the best policy making in this field is similar to Oscar in that field.
Besides, Sikkim won this award for crossing fifty one Naminated Policies from twenty five countries.
For this I am telling many congratulations to the people of Sikkim .
My favorite country is October .
There are many changes in the environment as well .
Dhan curtains, Diwali, Bhaiya Duj, Chhat. In another way, the month of November is the month of November.
Best wishes to all the people of the country on these festivals.
I would like you all to take care of your health as well as your well-being during these festivals.
These festivals also provide an opportunity to make new decisions.
I want to make these festivals an opportunity so that you can walk ahead in your life with a mission mode and make a strong resolve.
Your development is an important part of the country's development.
If you have developed so much that the country will progress as much as the country .
My best wishes to all of you.
