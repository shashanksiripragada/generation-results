Mann Ki Baat October, 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to you.
Today is the holy day of Diwali.
Nowadays, Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The specialty of this festival is that not only the Indian community, but the governments of many countries, its citizens and the social organizations of that country celebrate Diwali with joy and enthusiasm.
In this way, India's micro-world is showing up there.
Friends, The festival tourism in the world is an attraction.
In our country, every region has its own diversity, and people of other countries have a special interest in it.
Therefore, in India, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in the promotion of festival tourism.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided to do something differently for this Diwali.
I had said - Come, let us all celebrate Diwali this time, let us celebrate India's women power and its achievements, that is, let us honour India's Lakshmi.
Just see, a lot of inspiring stories have appeared on social media soon.
My mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took charge of five children.
Today we have five brothers in good work.
My greetings to Rameshi, your mother.
On Twitter, Geetika Swami, who is active in Twitter, says that she was headed by the daughter of the bus conductor, Maj. Kushbu Kanwar Bharatlakshmi, who led the Al-Viman section of the Assam Rifles.
The poetess Tiwari belongs to her daughter Bharat Lakshmi and her own strength.
She is proud that her daughter is a fine painter.
That girl got a good rank in the CAT exam.
At the same time, Megha Jain writes about an old 92-year-old man who has been delivering free drinking water at Gwalior Railway Station for years.
Megha Ji, the humility and compassion of this Bharat Lakshmi ji is very inspiring.
Many such stories have been shared by people.
You must read, be inspired, share things with you like this.
The sentiment of that poem, the words of it, are now written in the 17th century, is a message to us.
How great are the words, how great is the imagination, how great is the thought in this poem of Kannada language
Painida Parmegondon Himayatanupida Bhrigu Parchidananda Parchidanandanida Janjaulida Suttttru It means that the hill King Himself became famous due to his daughter Parvati, Bhrigumuni due to her daughter Lakshmi, King Jankaraj daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride.
It is due to the greatness of these daughters that our society has a strong personality and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
I can never forget my visit to the Gurudwaras in Wankuvar and Tehran.
I understand a lot of things related to Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji who is associated with you, but it also requires many episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
He stood firm against many evils like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji brought his message far and wide to the world.
He was the most traveling man at that time.
Going to different places, everyone's heart was overwhelmed by his simplicity and humility and the behavior of the common man.
The great religious journeys of Guru Nanak Dev Ji have been called Udasi.
He took the message of harmony and equality to the north, the south, the east and the west, and saw people, saints and monks everywhere.
The famous Sant Sankardev from Assam is also believed to be an inspiration from him.
Rajgir, associated with Buddhism, also went to holy places like Gaya.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji went to Sri Lanka in South India.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had found a solution to the water problem there.
There is a famous place of Guru Nanak Ji in Bidar which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji.
During a similar journey, Guru Nanak ji travelled in Uttar Pradesh and Kashmir and the surrounding areas.
This has established a strong link between Sikh devotees and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji went to Tibet and the people there considered him as Guru.
He is also a priest in Uzbekistan where he has gone.
He has also travelled to Islamic countries during his visit, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He took shelter in the minds of lakhs of people, they followed his teachings with due respect and still obey.
A few days ago, diplomatic representatives from around 85 countries went to Amritsar via Delhi.
They had a darshan at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
The diplomatic delegation also had the opportunity to visit the Golden Temple and learn about the Sikh tradition and culture.
After that, many ambassadors shared the pictures of those places on social media and wrote about the best experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you all will remember the 31st of October.
That day marks the birth anniversary of SardarVallabhbhai Patel, the Iron Man of India, who laid the foundation of unity in this country.
Sardar Patel had the amazing ability to unite people and also to be emotionally attached to those who differed.
Sardar Patel had seen every small thing in depth and studied.
He was a personality of critical analysis in the truest sense.
In addition to this, the organization has also done an excellent job.
He has gained expertise in planning and war strategies.
When we read and hear about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, we will see how deep his preparation was.
In 1921, thousands of people from all over the country had come to participate in the Congress General Assembly in Ahmedabad.
Pateljik was responsible for making all the arrangements related to the Mahasammelan.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
It ensured that no one faces any problem in water.
He interacted with the farmers and asked them to prepare Khadi bags.
The farmers made bags and sold to the representatives.
Because the shoes were kept in these bags, the delegates were not afraid to steal the shoes.
On the other hand, there has been a lot of increase in the sales of Khadi.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing the crucial role in the Constituent Assembly.
He spoke of the great importance of ensuring fundamental rights, so that there is no chance of any discrimination based on caste or creed.
Friends, We know that as the first Home Minister of India, SardarVallabhbhai Patel had done a commendable job in uniting the country.
SardarVallabhbhai's specialty was to take a look at everything.
After the partition of India in 1947, the eyes of our neighbour fell on Lakshadweep and they sailed there with the flag of that country.
As soon as the attention was paid to this, Sardar Patel did not waste any time and soon started a tough task.
He also directed the brothers of Arcot, Ramaswami, Arcot, Laxman Swami and other brothers from Tiruchirapalli to reach Lakshadweep and raise the Tricolor flag on Lakshadweep first.
Soon the tri-color flag was flagged off and the land was demolished watching the dream of the neighbor of Lakshadweep to capture it.
Sardar Patel had instructed his brothers and sisters to ensure all possible assistance for the development of Lakshadweep after this incident.
Today Lakshadweep is playing an important role in India's development.
This is a very attractive tourist destination.
I hope that all of you will also visit these beautiful islands and beaches.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October 2018, I had dedicated the Statue of Unity to the nation and the world in memory of Sardar Patel.
It's the tallest statue in the world.
Two times the height of the Statue of Liberty in America.
The tallest statue in the world makes every Indian proud.
The head of every Indian is raised with pride.
You will be happy to note that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists have visited the Statue of Unity.
The people of that place are now starting the cultivation of Dragon Fruit, and I am confident that this will also become a major source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, for the country, for all the states and for the tourism industry, this Statue of Unity is a subject of learning.
We witness the development of a place as a world-renowned tourist destination in a year.
People come from all over the country and abroad.
Several initiatives have been taken in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as travel facilities, accommodation, guides, eco-friendly arrangements and so on.
The government also plays its part.
Friends, A few days ago, there was no Indian who could not be proud of the fact that the Statue of Unity was given a place among the top 100 tourist destinations in the world.
I hope you're going to meet the Statue of Unity with some time away from your valuable time.
However, my appeal to every Indian who has been taking time to travel, to visit at least 15 tourist places, and to stay there at night, remains the same.
Friends, As you are aware, every year since 2014, we celebrate Rashtriya Ekta Diwas on 31st October.
On this day, we give a message that the unity, integrity and security of our country should be protected at all costs.
On 31st October, the Run for Unity is being organised every time.
People from all walks of life from all walks of life will participate in this programme.
Run for Unity is the symbol of this country and going in the same direction, we want to achieve the same goal.
Similarly, there is a special interest and enthusiasm among the people about Marathon.
Runphone unit is also a beautiful opportunity.
Running is beneficial for mind, intelligence and body.
Therefore, not only for the body but also for the mind and the cultural unity of India and to take India to new heights.
So even if you live in a city, you can find out where the Run for Unity is going.
I hope that all of you will also be able to run your own fitness for Indias unity on 31st October.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel instilled in us the thread of unity in the country.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been active and vigilant in strengthening the unity and integrity of the country.
If we look around ourselves, we will find many examples of the constantly striving to increase the affinity of each other.
But sometimes the problems of the society, its contribution and the early removal of the memory are common.
A lot of people in different ways went to the field.
Each of the parties was playing a game of their own advantage from the surroundings.
What kind of language do you speak to warm the atmosphere?
Attempts have been made to burn them in different voices.
We remember how some commentators and commentators had just said something to be important for themselves, what irresponsible things were being said about themselves.
Paying rich tributes to the dignity of the court, the Vice President said that an atmosphere of stress was never allowed to develop anywhere in the society.
These things have to be remembered, and this gives us a lot of strength.
Those days, those moments provide a sense of duty to all of us.
This is an example of how strong the voice of unity has given the country.
It was a big blow to the country.
I pay my respects to that honour today.
My dear countrymen, today, if a story of homelessness is heard far and wide, if one can hear the story of every village, from the north to the south, from the east to the west, and from every corner of India, then it is about cleanliness.
Every person, every family and every village got inspired to experience cleanliness in their own way because this effort for cleanliness is the effort of 125 crore Indians.
The beneficiaries of this scheme are also 125 crore Indians.
But it is also a pleasant, attractive wonder.
I'd like to hear you too.
The world's highest battlefield, the temperature is 50-60 degrees minus.
Only the name of the oxygen in the air.
In such a situation, staying in the midst of all these challenges is a very brave thing.
In such a totally contradictory environment, our brave-hearts are not only struggling to exaggerate our border but also performing a programme called Swachcha Siachin.
These Siachen glaciers are the source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, by carrying out a cleanliness campaign here, it means ensuring clean water to the people living in the valley, using water in rivers like Nubra, Shyok and Nubra.
My dear countrymen, the festival is an occasion to awaken the spirit of one and all.
If there is a Diwali, especially if there is something new, if there is something new, if there is something new in the market then there is no dearth of family.
I had once said that I should try to buy local products.
If we get the things we need in our village then we dont have to go to Talluk.
There is no need to go to the district if you get to Talouk.
As far as we try to buy local products, Gandhi 150 will turn himself into a great opportunity.
We have to buy something that we have given the shape of our Khadi weavers, who were taken with the hands of our weavers.
I urge you to buy local products along with the good wishes of Diwali.
Look, we can see how important we can play in fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
But sometimes fire is caused due to carelessness.
There may be burns.
I appeal to all of you, to control yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Many good wishes.
Thank you very much.
Man Ki Bat, September 2018
There will not be any Indian who doesnt feel proud of our Armed Forces, or about the soldiers of our Army.
Every Indian, every region, every caste, every community or any language, is eager to express their happiness and their support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1.25 billion people of India celebrated the day of our military invasion with great pride.
We recalled the surgical strike in 2016, when our soldiers gave a befitting reply to those who showed the arrogance of terrorism against our nation.
Our Armed Forces exhibitions have been organized in different parts of the country, with the intention of knowing more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation, what are our strengths.
They wanted to tell us how capable we were and how our soldiers laid down their lives to protect the people.
The day of Parakram Parv reminds the youth of the glorious tradition of our armed forces.
It inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also attended a programme at Jodhpur, the land of heroes.
We are sure that our army will respond to those who try to keep the atmosphere of peace in our country without any hesitation.
India always stands with commitment and dedication for peace.
In the two world wars of the 20th century, more than a lakh of our soldiers made the supreme sacrifice for peace.
It must be remembered that it was when we didn't have any connection with that war.
It was under the attack by our soldiers for peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest number of UN peacekeeping forces in the world.
For decades, our brave soldiers played an important role in establishing peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, things in the sky are different.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
I congratulate all the Air Warriors and their families who are serving the nation from the bottom of my heart.
In 1947, when the Pak army launched an unexpected attack, it was the Air Force that ensured that the Indian soldiers and equipment reached the battlefield with all their might, to protect Srinagar from its invaders.
The Air Force also responded in 1965 to the enemy.
Who knows about Bangladesh's freedom struggle in 1971
In 1999, the role of the Air Force was to free Kargil from the clutches of invaders.
In Tiger Hill, the air force carried out a bomb attack on enemy bases day and night.
I am grateful to the Air Force for the commendable work that our Air Force personnel have been doing in saving lives or rescuing people from accidents.
India can proudly say that in the Indian Army, the Armed Forces contribute not only to the strength of men but also to the strength of women.
The whole country was worried about how to save Tommy.
You know Abhilash Tomy is a brave hero.
He is the first Indian to travel the world with a small boat without the help of modern technology alone.
For the last 80 days, he has been on his way to the Golden Globe in the South Indian Ocean, but he was threatened with a terrible sea storm.
But the brave Indian Navy has been fighting the crisis for several days in the sea.
He lived in the middle of the sea without eating and drinking.
I didn't agree with the defeat of life.
A wonderful example of courage, determination and valour - when I rescued Abhilash from the sea, I spoke on telephone.
His courage, valour, determination and the strength to fight the crisis will surely inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, everyone knows what is the significance of October 2 for our nation.
On 2nd October of this year, there is an even greater significance.
For two years from now, we are going to organise various events around the world on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have inspired the entire world.
Later, in 1945, when the freedom struggle became strong, he re-considered those thoughts and prepared a new version.
Pujya Bapu had put forth his thoughts on several issues related to the rights of farmers, villages and workers, and cleanliness and education.
It is also known as Gandhi Charter.
Pujya Bapu was a mass organizer.
Bapu's specialty was to connect and involve people, which was his nature.
It has been felt by everyone as one of the greatest specialities of his personality.
He convinces each and every person that the person is the greatest, the greatest, the most needed person in the country.
His greatest contribution to the freedom struggle was that he made it a mass movement.
In the freedom struggle, as per the call of Mahatma Gandhi, people from all walks of life and all walks of life devoted themselves to the cause of freedom.
In that, Gandhiji says, I give you a mantra.
If you lose your suspicion, you feel that you're going to miss him.
My dear countrymen, this mantra of Gandhiji is still equally great.
Today, the rising middle class of the country, the rising economic power of its people and the growing purchasing power of the country, one thing has to be thought of.
Can we remember revered Bapu for a moment when we go to buy something?
Can you remember the mantra of our revered Bapu?
Can we think of which of the citizens of the country will benefit from the things I buy
Whose face would it make fun of?
If you buy it, who's going to benefit directly or indirectly?
I will be more happy if the poorest of the poor gets the benefit.
This is Gandhiji's mantra, this is Gandhiji's message and I believe that a small step taken by you in the life of the poorest and the weakest person will bring about a big change.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji said that freedom would be won if we clean the surroundings, he probably didn't know how it was.
But it happened that India got independence.
Similarly, we can feel that how a big contribution is being made by us in the economic development of our country, in the economic empowerment and in the strength to fight against poverty.
But I believe that if I do that then it will be the real patriotism of today's era.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastri used to keep even the old and torn clothes of Khadi, because someone's hard work was hidden in it.
He used to say that all these Khadi clothes are made of hard work and should be utilized in every corner of the country.
This feeling of love for the country and of the people of the country was filled with the feelings of a small and long Honour.
In two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri Ji along with our revered Bapu.
As soon as the name of Shastri Ji comes, our countrymen will receive a lot of respect in our hearts.
His compassionate personality makes the people always proud.
On the other hand, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji's specialty is that he was a very humble personality inside.
His slogan Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan shows his unique personality.
He gave a clarion call to the jawans and farmers of the country to reach the peak of victory over the difficult period of about one and a half years, as a reflection of his selfless service to the nation.
People from all walks of life from across the country are associated with this Shramdaan on the 15th May.
If you didn't make a phone call to the subject as to how much facilities you had after the construction of a toilet, then even the people associated with cleanliness would not have noticed this kind of thing.
I would like to especially thank you for your phone call.
The closing ceremony of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October, 2018, to mark the commencement of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Bapu.
My dear countrymen, there is a Sanskrit saying - , , , , , : , , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , , : , : , , : , : , ) , : , : , : , : , , : , , : , ) , : , : , : , : , : , , , : , , : , : , , , )
In the Constitution given by Babasaheb Ambedkar, several provisions have been made to protect the basic rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was constituted on 12th October, 1993.
A few days later, the Commission is completing 25 years.
The Human Rights Commission has not only protected human rights but has also enhanced human dignity.
Our beloved leader, the former Prime Minister of our country, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has clearly stated that human rights are no longer an option for us.
In this 25-year journey, the Institute created an atmosphere of ideas and faith among the people.
I think this is a very promising event for a healthy society and for the best of democratic values.
Today, Human Rights Commissions have been set up in 26 states along with the work of human rights at the national level.
As a society, we need to understand and work on human rights.This is the basis for Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas Sabka Vishwas.
My dear countrymen, the month of October marks the birth anniversary of Jai Prakash Narayan, when the birth centenary year of Rajmata Vijayaraj Scindia falls, then may it not be remembered.
These great personalities have inspired all of us and salute them.
31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar saheb and it will be discussed in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, but in a few years on the birth anniversary of Sardar saheb, on 31st October, there is a competition called Run for Unity in every small and big city of India, in every village, in every street.
This year, the Run For Unity will be organized in our villages, towns, cities and cities.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the whole country.
On 31st October, through the Run for Unity programme, we have to emphasize on every section of the society, on the thread of unity in the whole country.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
Today, the entire country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan.
My best wishes to all the people on this auspicious day.
Raksha Bandhan is considered a symbol of the mutual love and trust of our brothers and sisters.
This festival is a great example of social harmony for centuries.
In the history of the country, this one protective shield is a series of stories on the thread of faith of people from two different countries and religions.
In a few days from now, the festival of Janmashtami will be celebrated.
Best wishes to all the people on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami.
Friends, Apart from Raksha Bandhan, Sanskrit is also celebrated on the occasion of Shravan Poornima.
I congratulate all those involved in nurturing this great heritage and taking it to the common man.
We are extremely proud that Tamil is the oldest language in the world and has played a major role in the spread of Sanskrit language and knowledge since time immemorial.
You all will be happy to know that the residents of Muttur village in Shimoga district of Karnataka are still speaking in Sanskrit language.
Therefore, it is possible to describe in a minute or minute, even the subject.
At the same time, it is very easy to understand because it is connected with our soil and our heritage.
For example, it is said to show the importance of the Guru in life - Ekampi Akshamatshu Guru, Shishyaam Prabodhini, Nasti Tadvidyum, Yad-Dhatavya Nrini Bharat.
Sarvepalli Radha Krishna.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as Teachers Day across the country.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers on the occasion of Teachers Day.
At the same time, I appreciate your dedication towards science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, the year arrives with a new hope for our hardworking farmers.
Rain provides relief to plants, trees and dry reservoirs that burn in extreme summers.
But sometimes it rains and devastating floods.
Nature has come to a point where it rains more than once in a place.
We have already seen that the severe flood in Kerala has severely impacted the lives of the people.
Today, the entire country is with Kerala in this hour of crisis.
We have sympathy for those who have lost their families.
Even though there cant be a solution for the lost life, 1.25 billion Indians want to assure the bereaved families that they are with you in this hour of grief.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity recover as soon as possible.
I am confident that with the courage and fortitude of the people, Kerala will emerge.
Damages that are left are unfortunate.
But in times of crisis, we can see so many facets of humanity.
Wherever there was an accident, whether it was in Kerala or in any other state of India or in the district or region, everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and Kashmir to Kanyakumari were doing something of their own to bring the lives of the people back to normal.
People of all age groups, in all walks of life, are playing their role.
They are ensuring their role in minimizing the hardships faced by the people of Kerala and sharing their sorrows.
We know that the jawans of the Armed Forces are leading the rescue operations in Kerala.
They tried their best to save the people affected by floods.
My dear countrymen, this time we were examining the suggestions given by Mann Ki Baat.
The subject written by more and more people from all over the country was Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the favorite of all of us.
Several names like Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swathi from Sonepat, Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Dream Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar have been requested to write on the Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov for the various pictures of Atalji's life.
On August 16, the country and the world mourned the death of Atal ji.
14 years ago, the Prime Minister assumed office as the leader of the nation.
In a way, he has been away from active politics in the last 10 years.
There was no place in the news, it didn't appear in public life.
The gap of 10 years is huge but even after 16th August, the country and the world have seen that the duration of the period of 10 years in the minds of common people of India has not even set a gap of one minute.
The love and respect that Atal ji had with him, the more sorrow the whole country has spread, the more it shows his vast personality.
India will always remain grateful to Atalji for the 93rd Constitution Amendment in 2003.
This change has made two important changes in Indian politics.
First, the size of the Cabinet in the States is 15 of the total number of Assembly seats.
Second, one-third of the limit fixed under the Prevention of Corruption Act has been changed to two-thirds.
In addition, specific guidelines have been laid down for disqualification of participants.
For many years, the political culture that had been created by a large Cabinet in India, which was formed by a large Cabinet, was not to divide the departments, but to please the political leaders.
Atalji changed it.
His step was to save money and resources.
In addition, efficiency.
It is the vision of a person like Atal ji that has led to this change and our political culture and healthy habits have developed.
Atalji was a true patriot.
There was a change in the time of presentation of the budget during his reign.
Earlier, after following the tradition of the British, the budget was presented at 5 pm because it was the time of the Parliament to begin in England.
In 2001, the timing of the presentation of the Budget was changed from 5 pm to 11 am.
One more freedom was created by the Indian Flag Code during the reign of Atal ji and it was authorized in 2002.
In order to flag the national flag at public places, the Departments have included it.
It's a good thing, it's a good sign of democracy.
For a healthy democracy, developing good habits, continuously striving to strengthen democracy and taking the discussions forward with an open mind will be a good tribute to Atal ji.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfil his dream of a developed and prosperous India, I pay my tributes to Atal ji for all.
A few days ago, the Monsoon Session of Parliament ended.
You will be happy to know that productivity of the Lok Sabha (Productivity) is 118 and that of the Rajya Sabha is 74.
The Lok Sabha passed 21 Bills and Rajya Sabha 14 Bills as a result of the efforts of all the Members to hold the Monsoon Session this year, more than in the interest of the Party.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will be remembered as a Conference on Social Justice and Youth Welfare.
In this session, great bills of interest for the youth and backward communities were passed.
For many decades, the need to set up the OBC Commission was rising, like the SCs and STs.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has fulfilled the resolution of setting up of the OBC Commission this time and has given it constitutional mandate.
This step will take the goal of social justice forward.
The amendment bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has also been passed in this session.
The Act provides for greater protection for the welfare of SCs and STs.
The group will also act as a deterrent to the perpetrators and prevent them from committing crimes.
No kind of injustice or cultured society will tolerate any kind of injustice against the woman power of the country.
The country is not ready to tolerate the criminals who commit crimes.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, 2019 and the Department has ensured strict punishment.
You must have read in the newspaper a few days ago that the victim of rape had been sentenced to death by the court of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh for two months.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had completed the trial in five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
The Rajasthan court also took a quick decision in this regard.
The Act will play a pivotal role in preventing crimes against women and girls.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
But in this session of the Rajya Sabha, it could not be passed, and I assure the Muslim women that the whole country stands with their full strength for their justice.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country on this occasion.
My dear countrymen, now the attention of crores of people is focused on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every day in the morning, people in the newspaper, in television, in news, and on social media are searching for an Indian player who won the medal.
The Asian games are still going on.
Best wishes to all the medal winners for the nation.
Among the medal winners for the country, our daughters are so many and this is a very positive sign.
The young medal winners will have 15-16 year olds.
A good sign is that most of the medal winners live in small towns and villages and this success has been achieved through hard work.
I once again congratulate the medal winners in the Asian Games and wish the rest of the players the very best.
Best wishes to everyone on the occasion of National Sports Day.
Hello, Bhavanaji, I respect the child's thinking.
We have seen the construction of houses, houses and buildings with stones, but can you imagine that about 1200 years ago when a rock was turned into a magnificent, large and magnificent temple, perhaps it would be difficult to imagine.
However, the Brihadeshwara Temple at Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, where this incredible combination of architecture and engineering can be seen.
In Paan area of Gujarat, the pedagogy known as the Rani ki door, built in the 11th century, will surprise everyone.
Indias land was a laboratory of engineering.
He is the President of India, Dr.
M.
He is revered in that part of the country and the rest of the country remembers him with great respect and dedication.
It is in his memory that September 15 is celebrated as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, the engineers in our country have shown their different identity throughout the world.
Now as we celebrate Engineers Day, we must think of the future.
We've got to run workshops there.
Recently, disaster management has become a major concern.
The world is facing natural calamities.
In this situation, what kind of structural engineering should be there
How can we set a priority in making garbage free
When we celebrate Engineering Day, we have to think about it.
See you tomorrow.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
Sometimes rain shows its liking in India due to its diversity and diversity.
But why do we blame the rain?
V.
A team of 12 football players from Thailand were taken to the cave while their coach sailed.
It takes a few hours to go in and out in the cave.
Because they didn't find any other way, they sought refuge in the cave on a small rock - not for a day or two, but for eighteen days.
If the children see death in front of you, you can imagine what the moments will be like when you have to face it with your own hands every moment.
On the one hand, they were facing an accident on the other hand, and on the other hand, all the people of the world were coming together to express human values.
People from all over the world have been praying for the safety of these children.
But when the last good news came, the world was calm and happy.
But I think this incident is in a different way.
All of them joined the mission as a team.
I think it's important to learn and understand the restraint of everyone.
In this initiative, a soldier's life was sacrificed in the navies of Thailand.
The whole world is amazed that despite such a difficult situation, they have not given up hope in a deep, dark cave with so much courage and patience.
This shows that miracles take place when humanity unites.
It was the specialty of Neeraj ji's poems that energised hope, faith, determination and self-confidence.
All that Neeraj ji had said for us Indians is a combination of strength and inspiration.
It must be dark.
Tributes to Shri Neeraj ji.
Namaste Prime Minister, My name is Truth.
I have been an alumnus of Delhi University this year for the first time.
During our school board examinations, you talked about the stress of examinations and education, what is your message to students like me now
The month of July and August are very important for the farmers and for the youth.
Because it's called the peak season of college.
This is the time when lakhs of youngsters like Satya are coming out of school and going to college.
In case of vacancies arising out of COVID-19, the Commission has decided to hold bye-elections to the Council from 1st April, 2020 to further elaborate the details of cooperation and to oversee the implementation of this Memorandum of Understanding.
The children come from the shade of their parents to the shade of professors.
I am confident that my young friends will be very excited and happy from the beginning of college life.
For the first time we have to move out of the house, get out of the village, get out of a safe environment and become a regulator.
For the first time, so many youngsters leave their homes and give a new direction to life.
Many students would have joined their colleges and some would have prepared to join.
I have to tell you to stay calm, enjoy life, enjoy the joy of the soul of life.
There is no choice but to learn through books, but there must be a habit of finding new things.
The price of old friends is very high.
Friends from the childhood, who do not care about it, but who find, create and maintain new friends, must be conscious of their own way.
Learn new things, acquire new skills and learn new languages.
Now as far as the college season is concerned, a student from a very poor family of Madhya Pradesh, Asharaam Chaudhary, was watching the story of how he managed to overcome the difficult challenges of life.
There are many such students from poor families who have come from challenging environments, who have been inspired by their hard work and dedication.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of PMs address in the 15th Episode of Mann Ki Baat 2.0 on 28.03.2020 My dear countrymen, Namaskar. The 15th Episode of Mann Ki Baat 2.0 on 28.03.2020, was celebrated on 15.03.2020.
If we look around, we can see several such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country inspires me.
It was a coincidence that once in the city of San Jose, which is known as the Technology Hub of the United States, I was interacting with Indian youth.
I asked them how they can use their talent for India and how they can do it on time.
I requested you to convert brain drain into brain gain.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji, made a different effort in accepting this challenge.
With the help of their professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji put together a smart gaav app.
This app not only connects the people of the village with the world but also enables them to know about any information on their own mobile phones.
The village residents of Dhatukpur village in Rai Bareilly, the village head, the district magistrate and the CDO encouraged the people to use the app.
This app is bringing about a digital revolution in the village and all the development works in the village, recording, tracking and monitoring are being done easily through this app.
This app has a village phone directory, news section, event list, health center and information center.
This app is also beneficial for the farmers.The Grammar of the app and the FACT rate among the farmers is in a way a market for their produce.
If you look at this incident, you will see that the youth of America is living in the midst of the lifestyle and the thoughts there.India has left many years ago, but it knows all the corners of its village, understands the challenges, understands the spiritual relation with the village.
But sometimes due to lack of time, sometimes due to distances, sometimes due to the environment, a thin layer of rust gets covered on it, but if a small stone touches it then everything becomes visible once again, and takes it back to the past.
Santoshi, thank you very much for your phone call.
Of course, Pampur is a wonderful pilgrimage.
Friends, Asha Ekadashi is celebrated on 23rd July this year.
Rampur is a sacred city of the Solapur district of Maharashtra .
About 15-20 days before Asha Ekadashi, pilgrims travel to Poorvpur with their teeth.
Millions of visitors participate in the Yatra, known as Vari.
Pilgrims will arrive here on a visit to Vithoba and Pandurang, the place of Lord Buddha.
God blesses the poor and the deprived and the oppressed.
People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense respect and reverence.
Going to the Vittoba temple in Pampur is a unique experience of its magnificence, beauty and spiritual bliss.
I want to tell the listeners of Mann Ki Baat that if they get a chance, they must take part in a tour of Purpur once.
Innumerable sanctifications such as Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram are still present to the common man in Maharashtra.
I have the strength to fight against the blind faith. This tradition will continue to inspire every corner of India.
The message of harmony, love and brotherhood is received from all the relevant customs.
With respect to the blind faith, the mantra is given to the society to fight.
Lokmanya Tilak was a personality full of courage and confidence.
He had the power and wisdom to show the British rulers their faults.
He was feared by the British as he would try to commit treason thrice in 20 years.
It's not a small thing.
I would like to present before you an interesting incident related to Lokmanya Tilak and one of his statues in Ahmedabad.
At that time when he arrived in Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40,000 people came here to welcome him over a hundred years ago and during this visit Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to talk to him.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was influenced by Lokmanya Tilak.
Naturally, the British were unhappy and the Collector continued to deny the permission.
However, Sardar Saheb remained steadfast in his belief that even if he had to give up his position, the statue of Lokmanya Tilak would continue to be established.
Finally, the statue was built and it was inaugurated on 28th February, 1929 by none other than Mahatma Gandhi.
The Ganesh Festival has been started as a result of the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak.
The Ganesh Festival, celebrated with traditional venerated and festive fervour, has become a powerful medium to promote social awakening, social consciousness, empathy and equality among people.
It was an era in which the British were ready to fight.
It is clear from this that even today our young generation is interested in our ancient heritage and our heroes in history.
Today, in many cities and in every street you will get to see Lord Ganesha.
This is a good opportunity for our youth to learn about leadership, organization and to develop their skills.
This time also, all the decorations from the statue of Ganeshji should be environmentally friendly and it should be environment friendly and competitive in all the cities.
I'll take all this to the people.
Lokmanya Tilak gave a slogan, 'Swaraj is our birthright, we will achieve it by instilling confidence among the people.
Even today, it is time to say that Swaraj is our birth right.
Every Indian should have good results of good governance and development.
This will make a New India.
50 years after Tilak's birth, the same day i.e. on July 23, another son of Bharat Mata was born.
He sacrificed his life thinking that we can breathe the wind of freedom.
I'm talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
These lines have inspired many young people like Ashfaqullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad and many others.
Chandrashekhar Azad's courage and his spirit of freedom inspired many young people.
Azad's life was home, yet he never bowed his head to foreign rule.
A few days ago, in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship held in Finland, India's brave woman and farmer daughter Hima Das created history by winning gold medal in the 400m race.
In response to my letter to another daughter of ours, Ekta Bhyan, I e-mailed by stating that preparations for the Asian Games are underway in Indonesia.
Unity in e-mail: I am proud to have received the tricolour at its peaks and at the moment it marks the most significant moment in the life of any athlete.
Unity, we are all proud of it.
The name of Ekta Desh has been illuminated.
World Para Athletics Grand 2018 won the Ekta Gold and Vengla Medal in 2018.
In the name of your courage, I bow down to Ekta Bhyan and Yogesh auti and Sundar Singh Ji.
I wish you all the very best in this month of August and in this month of August, for many centuries of festivals.
Once again, we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, a cricket match was held in Bengaluru.
You must have clearly understood that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
The two teams performed well in the game.
This year, Balur Rashid Khan from the side of Afghanistan also performed a good show in the IPL.
I remember President Ashraf Ghani on Twitter tagging me and saying, The people of Afghanistan are proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to my Indian friends for creating a platform for our players to showcase their talent.
Rashid Khan represents the major players in Afghanistan.
The Indian team has set an example for the whole world.
When the Indian team bought the trophy, the Afghan team took part in the international competition and took the photo together.
My best wishes to the teams of India and Afghanistan.
I am confident that we will continue to participate in sports with a similar sportsman spirit.
My dear countrymen, on the 21st of June, this fourth Yoga Day has been celebrated with a different theme.
To see the whole world come together.
On the high snow clad peak in Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China have together performed yoga.
Yoga unites people by breaking all boundaries.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from over 100 countries have made this occasion a big festival without discrimination based on caste, religion, region, colour and gender.
While people from all over the world are so excited about this, it is natural for them to have twice the enthusiasm in India.
It is a matter of pride for the country that 1.25 billion people have practiced yoga on the safety, water and sky of our country.
Some of the brave men and women performed yoga at the submarine and some performed yoga at the snow-clad mountains of Siachen.
Our air warriors, in the middle of the sky, performed yoga at a height of 15,000 feet and strengthened everyone.
They've done yoga in the sky, not on the plane.
Yoga has been practiced in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high-rise buildings and playgrounds.
Yoga has transcended the barriers of caste, creed, region and has brought the entire world together.For centuries, we have believed in the VasudhaivaKutumbakam.
Our sages, ascetics and ascetics have literally practiced yoga's meditation on any subject.
More and more people make this a part of their lives.
My dear countrymen, this time in Mann Ki Baat, many of you have written to me on MyGov and NarendraModiApp that they should talk about Doctors Day on 1st July.
That's right.
We only remember the doctor when there's a problem.
But it is a day to celebrate the achievements of our doctors, and to express gratitude to them for their service and dedication to society, on this occasion.
The doctor's role is not limited to treating the disease.
Today the doctor has the expertise of the doctor and he has a great experience about the general lifestyle and how it affects our lives.
With their talent and skills, Indian doctors have made a mark for themselves all over the world.
The medical fraternity is known for their hard work and also for resolving issues related to the medical sector.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I extend my best wishes to all our doctors and friends on the occasion of Doctors Day on the 1st of July.
My dear countrymen, we are fortunate to be born in this land of India.
India has a rich history of not having a history of one month or one day.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It's true that I'm coming to Maghar on the 23rd.
Do you know why he went to Maghar?
At that time there was an agreement that those who died in Maghar would not have access to heaven.
Those who die in Kashi will have a heaven on their own.
Maghar was treated as impure, but Sant Kabir did not believe it.
In today's era, they are the same source of inspiration.
That is, the real pious saint knows and understands the pains of others.
He who doesn't feel the pain of others is a cunning man.
At that time, there was turmoil and turmoil in the world, and he gave a message of peace and harmony.
He brought the world mind together and worked to resolve the differences.
His words are true even after centuries.
Similarly, Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev ji is the Guru.
He has served crores of people and has been a source of inspiration for centuries.
Guru Nanak Dev ji taught us to eradicate caste based discrimination, to see mankind as one and move away.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say, 'The service of God is serving the poor and the deprived.'
The 500th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to be a part of it with enthusiasm and zeal.
I urge all of you to think about the new ideas, new suggestions and new ideas about how Guru Nanak Devji's 500th Prakash Parv should be celebrated in the society and throughout the world and how we should celebrate the 500th Prakash Parv with great importance.
There is a history related to Punjab.
The year 2019 marks the 100th anniversary of the tragic event that has devastated the entire humanity at Jallianwala Bagh.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Raman Kumar from Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Syama Prasad Mookerjee on his Birth Anniversary.
In this programme, he has written to the people that I should tell them about Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
Thank you very much for the first time.
Dr.
In 1937, after receiving the invitation from Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation of the Calcutta University in Bengali.
It was for the first time that someone was speaking in Bengali at a conference in Calcutta University when the British ruled.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
In a way, he laid a strong foundation for India and for industrial development, and built a strong platform.
India's first industrial policy, which was announced in 1948, marked his ideals and vision.
It was his dream that India should be self-reliant in all spheres and skill and prosperity.
He also wanted the MSMEs to focus on handloom, textiles and cottage industries.
The All India Handicraft Board, the All India Handloom Board and the Khadi Village Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950 to provide financial and organizational support to the small scale industry for their proper development.
Indigenisation needs to be done in the defence production of India, he added.
Syama Prasad Mookerjee was one of the greatest motivators of India for which he had to sacrifice his life at the age of fifty-two.
Come on.
People spoke about their ideas, their happiness, and their achievements.
In remote villages, girls provide services from public service centres to the elderly in the villages from pension to passport.
One of the sisters from Chhattisgarh is engaged in the business of making ice-cream with the Sitamarhi.
Lakhs of youngsters across the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras as well as delivering affordable medicines in nearby villages.
A young man from West Bengal was searching for employment two-three years ago and today he has successfully started his own business.
Not only that, he employs 10 and 50 people.
School students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on key issues like waste management at school tinkering labs at their young age.
There are some in the society, and there will be no peace without exposing them to pessimism, without telling them about failures, without trying to build confidence, without compromising on others.
In such an environment, when ordinary people come to know about the ideas and the new enthusiasm and the events that took place in their lives, it is not the priority of the government.
Even the incident of a small child in a small village at that time can become an inspiration for 1.25 billion people.
With the help of technology, when I spent time with the beneficiaries through video bridge, it became very comfortable and inspiring to do something.
A new happiness, a new enthusiasm, a new inspiration, is being provided to the poorest of the poor.
I am very grateful to the people.
40-50 lakh people are connected to this video bridge and have given me a new strength.
We can smell good.
One thing came to my notice the other day and that was a very different experience.
He has been successful in making schemes related to farmers, and in increasing the income of the farmers.
In a way, farmers across the entire network from crop production to marketing have a big role to play, as well as an effort to ensure double the income of the farmers by establishing the share of farmers.
We've built a seed bank for that.
Women's looking for things in the Vittobank, and they're linked to this.
Some people may not know, some may not know, some may not know, some may not know, but crores of people constantly do some good work, and many may I wish you all the very best.
My dear countrymen, GST is going to be a year of implementation.
One Nation One Tax was the dream of people, and today it's really changed.
There are people from different political ideologies, people from different states, people from different states, people from different states, but the decisions taken in the GST Council so far have been unanimously taken.
Prior to GST, there were a lot of taxes in the country and according to this system only one type of tax is levied across the country.
GST is a victory of honesty and a celebration of honesty.
Earlier, there was a complaint related to tax related inspector raj in the country.
In GST, IT, Information Technology and Information Technology have been replaced by Inspector.
From return to refund, everything is being done online through information technology.
GST was perhaps the largest tax reform program in the world.
Such a big tax reform has been implemented in India. It is because the people of the country have adopted it and it is because of the strength of the people that the success of GST can be ensured.
Generally, I thought it would take 5-7 years for such a big reform, for such a large population to achieve its fullest success.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Hello. Hello.
Navika Sagar Parikrama - Yes, I would like to say something about them.
These six daughters of India, their group has returned to India on 21st May 2020, covering the entire world in the INSV Tarini in the sea for over two hundred and fifty days.
The entire country welcomed them with great enthusiasm.
Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to see these daughters and listen to their travel experiences.
I once again congratulate the world for once again conveying the courage of those daughters, for increasing the glory of the Navy, and for increasing the glory of India, especially the daughters of India are not at all bad.
Who doesn't want adventure.
If we look at the evolution of the human race, we can see that progress is born from the womb of any adventure.
Development is rooted in courage.
On 16th May 2020, 5 tribal children from a Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisha Dhruve, Pramesh Ali, Umanand Madavi, Kavidas Kathmode and Vikas Soyam entered the highest peak of the world.
These children of Ashram School started their training in August, 2017 and were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youth were selected under the leadership of Mashin Shaurya.
He made the country proud by conquering the Everest as per his name.
I convey my best wishes to those who are associated with Chandrapur school and to these young boys.
Recently, a 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak was the youngest Indian girl to climb Everest from Nepal.
I extend my heartiest greetings to all those bravehearts, especially my daughters.
They tag each other and challenge them.
Everyone has joined this Fit India Movement.
Film people, people associated with sports, ordinary citizens of the country, soldiers of the army, school teachers joined in to hear the sounds of it from all sides.
If we're fit, India's fit.
Captain Virat Kohli of the Indian Cricket Team has challenged me and I have accepted his challenge and this is a good thing.
Such a challenge will not only make us fit, but will also encourage others to stay fit.
My dear countrymen, many times in Mann Ki Baat, you have heard me talk about games, sports persons, about something or the other.
Last time, the heroes of the Common Wealth Games interacted with us through this programme.
"Chhavi Yadavji, thank you very much for calling on the phone.
It's true that the games that had been played on every street, all the children's lives, are falling apart today.
These games were particularly part of the summer season.
Sometimes in the afternoon, at night, after dinner, the children used to play peacefully for hours together.
Outdoor and Indore.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games.
The same game is known by different names in different places .
I am from Gujarat.
One of the games in Gujarat is known as Chamal-Esto.
It's playing with a bowl, or a squirrel, or a squirrel with 8:8 size square board.
This game was played in almost all the states.
In Karnataka, it is known as Chaukabara in Madhya Pradesh, Attu in Kerala, Pithamalai in Maharashtra, Champal in Tamil Nadu, and many more such as Changpa in Rajasthan.
But while playing, one can understand that even though people in every country do not know the language, yes, the people of every country do not know the language.
I'll tell you we're playing this game too.
There are people who don't play coils and kids when they are kids.
Playing games in children, villages and cities.
It has been called by various names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh it was surrounded by Gotibilla or Karra Billa .
In Odisha, it is called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Vitidalu.
Some games have their own weather, season.
Like a season to fly the silk.
When everyone flies in the air, when everyone plays, they can express our different virtues without hesitation.
The big ones will be serious, but when they play, the boy who's hiding in them comes out.
Traditional sports, along with physical fitness, promote our rational thinking, concentration, awareness and vigour.
At the same time, we also know our culture and traditions.
Many games make us aware about society and the environment.
By mobilizing people, we can create a great history of our traditional games.
This time the theme is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I appeal to all of you, that considering the spirit of this theme, do not use polythene and low quality plastics, we should try to reduce the adverse impact on the nature of plastic waste, on the wild life, and on our health.
The World Environment Day website of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (WED-India) 2018 has received a very attractive response from the World Environment Day website, seeking inputs on how to implement them in a day-to-day manner.
When it gets so hot, when the rains do not end, when it gets extremely cold, all the experts like global warming and climate change start talking.
But what's the point of just saying?
All this is essentially a change of climate and its outcome.
Our culture, our traditions have not taught us to fight against nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature and we have to stay connected with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi advocated this in every life and every step.
Today, India speaks of climate justice, India has played a pivotal role in the COP21 Paris Agreement, and we have brought the world together through the International Solar Alliance.
How can we move forward on this issue
What can we do with something new?
The rainy season is coming.
It has been reported that around the world, preparations are being made to celebrate IDY on 21st June.
The world has been understanding Yoga for Unity again and again in the last few years.
By doing yoga, we always have the courage to wait for us like our father.
If these qualities are shared by a friend, then the yogi achieves success in all forms of fear.
I once again appeal to all the people to promote our heritage of Yoga and to build a healthy, prosperous and happy nation.
My dear countrymen, today is the 27th of May, the commemoration of the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
Salute to Panditji.
The memory of this month is associated with another person, Veer Savarkar.
In May 1957, Indians demonstrated their strength to the British.
The brave-heart wrote without fear that what happened in 1857 was not a rebellion but was the first struggle for independence.
Savarkar's life was full of specialities.
Moreover, he was a great poet, social reformer and always gave importance to harmony and unity.
Our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had written a very good description of Savarkarji.
Savarkar brought poetry and revolution together.
He was a sensitive poet and a brave revolutionary.
If there is a desire to do something, if there is a resolve then success can be achieved under all the conditions.
This is not just a matter of the Seeker, but you will find it in every corner of India.
If you look around, you will see how people lose their resistance.
When we go to a tea stall, when we enjoy tea there, and when we go to a tea stall, we may have noticed that a few people talk about it in the neighbourhood.
These discussions can be related to politics, society, cinema, sports, players and the problems of the country. This is the problem that can be solved by doing so.
You will be surprised to know that he was the light of education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He opened a school called Asa-Ashwan for the children living in the streets and slums and for this this poor tea seller pays fifty percent of his income.
He is making all the arrangements for education, health and food for every school going child.
I'm D.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his hard work and dedication and giving a new direction to the lives of the poor children.
He made the darkness of their lives void.
There's a lot of things going on around you.
There will be countless incidents.
Come, let's promote good.
The moon waits for a few days.
I hope that everyone will celebrate Eid with enthusiasm and on this occasion children will get a lot of gifts especially on this occasion.
May this Eid further the spirit of harmony and friendship in our society.
Best wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
We'll meet again next month at Manki Ba.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th to 15th April 2018.
It was attended by 71 countries including India.
When such a big event takes place, then imagine the atmosphere there when thousands of players from all over the world take part.
Who can stay away from it in an environment full of enthusiasm, zeal, hope and resolve to achieve success
India is a record-breaking player in shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis and badminton.
India won 66 medals including 26 Gold, 20 Silver and 20 Bronze.
This victory will make every Indian proud.
It's all in the same feeling.
In order to express that sentiment, the words will be deficient.
But I'd like to hear you from those players.
It was my dream to be one of the best players of India and Manipur.
Do you know that all the restaurants that took part in this time from India have won medals
ManikaBatra won all the medals in the medals won by them.
She is the first Indian woman to win a gold medal for India in the individual table tennis.
India won the highest number of medals in the shooting.
A 15-year-old shooter Anish Bhanwala is the youngest player to win a gold medal for India at the Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only Para Power Lifter who won the Commonwealth Games for India.
This time it is special that more than 20 women have won medals.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting or shooting, women have done wonders.
The last battle in the badminton is between two Indian players, Saina Nehwal and P.K.
He was with Sindhu.
Despite the competition, everyone was eager to get two medals for India.
The players took part in the games from different parts of the country, from small towns.
In every situation, they have the role of their powerful friends.
Last month, in Mann Ki Baat, I had called upon the people, especially the youth, to become Fit India.
Come, co-operate with Fit India, and lead the Fit India Movement.
I am very happy that people are joining this programme with great enthusiasm.
Shashikant Bhosale shared his own picture of the swimming pool, My Wepan is My Body, My Elements Water, My World Is Swimming...
Shri Dhaval Prajapati has shared his own picture of trekking and said, For me travel and trekking is the Fit India.
It was a matter of great happiness for us that many of us present here, are inspiring our youth for Fit India.
Shanima Kalakaran has shared a video on Akshay Kumar Twitter.
You must also see that he's doing an exercise with wood beads.
He says that this exercise is very good for the outside and the stomach muscles.
There's another video in circulation.
In that he's playing volleyball with people.
Many youngsters have shared their experiences related to the Fit India Movement.
I think such initiatives are very beneficial for all of us and the entire country.
And one more thing is definitely going to be said - 'Yoga' is the name of a free India movement.
Yoga has a special significance in the Fit India Movement and you too must have started preparations.
The world has now recognized the importance of International Day of Yoga on June 21.
You'll be ready right now.
Not only your city, your village, your village, your colony, your school, your college, everywhere everyone, every age, man or woman, should make an effort to connect with yoga.
Today, there is no need to say in India or anywhere in the world how Yoga is beneficial for the complete development of the body, for the development of the mind and for the balance of the mind.
You must have seen that my animated video has become very popular.
They've shown a teacher very minutely through an animation.
You will also benefit from it.
I would like to invite you for a new job.
Many youngsters are spending their time studying something new these days.
Nevertheless, the internship offers a new experience in its own way.
Beyond four walls, one gets an opportunity to experience life in a new way to escape from paper, pen and computer.
My young friends, I invite you for a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India - Ministry of Sports, Ministry of Human Resource Development and Ministry of Drinking Water have jointly launched the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
If college students, youth from NCC, NSS, Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan, if they want to do something for the country, if they want to do something for the society and the country, if they want to join it for the change of society, if they want to be the reason then they can join it and if they want to do something for the society with positive energy, this is an opportunity for those who want to do something for the society.
It will also support and strengthen the cause of cleanliness and will be happy that on 2nd October, on the occasion of the 100th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we have done something before that.
The best members, who have done a good job in college and who have done a good job in the university will be rewarded at the national level.
Not only this, the UGC will give two credit points to those who do very well.
I once again urge the students, students and the youth to take up internships and avail this benefit.
You can go to MyGov and register for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope that our youth will come forward in this campaign for cleanliness.
I am eager to know about your efforts in this regard.

I would like to appeal to the people that how many people in every corner of our country are doing the best and what are the best things
I have seen the stories of the youth who have been selflessly engaged in the education of the poor children the day before.
A big program has been started for the education of street children of Delhi and children residing in the slums with these young friends.
The condition of the children who were begging on the streets or working on small jobs forced them to go out for this constructive work.
The youth and teachers associated with this programme have been engaged in this massive effort to bring about social change by 2 hours from their busy life.
Brothers and sisters, similarly, some farmers of the hilly areas of Uttarakhand are the source of inspiration for the farmers of the country.
They have not only made a concerted effort, but have also changed the fate of the region.
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, mainly Ragi, Chaulai (Amarnath), corn or barley are being cultivated.
Being a hilly area, farmers didn't get the right price for them.
This biscuit with excess of iron is beneficial to pregnant women.
These farmers formed a cooperative movement in Munar village where a biscuits factory was set up.
With the courage of the farmers, the government also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being supplied not only to Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kaisani in about 50 Anganwadi Centres.
The annual turnover of the group has gone up to Rs 10-15 lakh under the guidance of the farmers and more than 900 families have been provided employment opportunities so that the employment of the people in the district is reduced.
Don't we think water conservation should be social responsibility?
How to protect every drop of rain
We know that water conservation is not a new subject in the minds of Indians.
The subject of the book is not the subject of the language.
Our ancestors have lived this life for centuries.
They gave priority to the importance of every drop of water.
They're looking for new ways to save every drop of water.
In Mannar Kovale, Chiranmahadevi, Kovilpatti, Pudukottai etc., there are large rocks present and several ponds today are similar to the tourist centres.
But do not forget that these big stores are living examples of the efforts of our ancestors.
Ranike Bawadi at Adalaj, Gujarat and Patna are the UNESCO World Heritage Sites and it is worth seeing.
These ponds are in a way water temples.
If you go to Rajasthan then you must visit Chandbadi in Jodhpur.
It is one of the largest and most beautiful ponds in India and is located in water deficient areas.
Rainfall at most places with heavy to very heavy falls at a few places and extremely heavy falls ( 20 cm) at isolated places very likely over interior Tamil Nadu.
In the last three years, everyone has done some work in their own way in the field of water conservation and water management.
In 2017-18, Rs. 64,000 crore was spent on water conservation and 55 of the total expenditure i.e.
About 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefited by this kind of water conservation and water management scheme in the last three years.
Sasur, which had dried up with the help of people from around 40-45 villages, has revived the Khadi River.
Be it animals or birds, farmers, fields or villages, this victory is so blessed for all of us.

His majesty was that of a brilliant personality and a multifaceted personality.
I had a habit of listening to it, but I didn't know the language, but it became my habit to wake up early in the morning and listen to Rabindra Sangeet on radio...
You must have been impressed by Rabindra Sangeet and his poems.
On this occasion, I pay my respects to Rabindranath Tagore.
The entire world is celebrated with great reverence and respect to the month of Ramzan.

India has shown the power of compassion, service and sacrifice and we should be proud of the land of Lord Buddha. He has shown the way to millions across the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of our responsibility to strive towards the path shown by Lord Buddha, to resolve and live upto it.
Lord Buddha is the driving force of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Today, this is the most needed human value in the world.
Buddha's inspiration is immense in the social vision of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Baba Saheb had said - My social vision was enshrined in three words - freedom, equality and brotherhood.
The roots of my vision are in religion, not in political science.
I accepted them from my guru, Lord Buddha.
Baba Saheb strengthened the Constitution with millions of Dalits, oppressed, exploited, deprived and marginalized people.
There is no greater example of compassion than this.
This compassion for people is one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
The advice of Lord Buddha has been traditionally received anywhere in Asia.
I am very happy that the Government of India is partner in the reconstruction of many Buddhist temples, including the centuries-old magnificent Ananda Temple in Myanmar.
Today, there is a panorama of conflict and human suffering all over the world and the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to end hatred with compassion.
I convey my best wishes to all those around the world who believe in the principles of compassion and respect for Lord Buddha.
I pray for the blessings of Lord Buddha to carry out my responsibility for a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings for the entire world.
The people of India spread all over the world had a new confidence.
It was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May 1998, a nuclear test was conducted at Pokhran, Rajasthan on the western end of India.
It is now 20 years old and it was celebrated on the occasion of Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
India's experiment has been successful and India's ability to science and technology has also been demonstrated.
The day is marked as an exhibition of military might in the history of India.
Lord Buddha has shown the world that the strength of the soul is essential for peace.
Similarly, when you gain strength as a nation, you will be able to live peacefully.
In May 1998, it was not only important for the country to conduct a nuclear test, but it is also important to know how it was conducted.
India's land is the land of great scientists, India with a strong leadership, India with new goals and heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave a mantra: Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan.

My dear countrymen, this time and again, a large number of letters, e-mails, phone calls and suggestions have been received from all of you.
I read about the online course on Sanskrit at Komal Tagore MyGov.in.
I am very happy to see you, an IT professional, a love of culture.
I have asked the concerned departments to inform you about the efforts being taken in this direction.
I also appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat, who are associated with Sanskrit, how to take forward the suggestion made by Komalji.
I request you all to water the animals during summer.
Shakal ji, I've brought your feelings to every audience.
Shriman Yogesh Bhadresh ji has said that I want to tell the youth about their health.
He feels that our youth are physically weak when they are making a mark in ASEAN countries.
Prashant ji, the Central Government has also shared those photos on social media and on the Narendra Modi App.
Listen to it. Repeat it, get into friends.
I have written to you some of the things that are in my mind on the Gratitude Cards that Angha, Jayesh and many other children have left behind in the book "Exam Warriors".
There are so many letters, so many phone calls, opinions, and so many things that I have read and heard, I have touched my heart.
Even if I talk about them, I'll have to talk for months.
He said about the water for animals in summer.
There are letters from the farmer brothers and sisters about the things that are going on in the country from the Kisan Melas to the agriculture sector.
Some people have been made aware about water conservation.
In the festive season, letters will be given to our festivals, our culture and our traditions.
Why dont you change these things, your experiences, these examples are full of inspiration, energy, self-confidence and the zeal to do something for the country.
This will include the power to change the entire country.
When I can clearly see the immense willpower of this country when a rickshaw driver of Karimganj in Assam, Ahmad Ali has built nine schools for the poor children due to his willpower.
When we heard the story of Dr. Ajit Mohan Chowdary in Kanpur about screening the poor and providing free medicines to them, we got an opportunity to understand the mutual relationship of the people of this country.
13 years ago, a car driver from Kolkata, Saidul Laskar, died due to lack of treatment.
After 12 years of accumulation of this money, Saidul Laskar's massive efforts were finally shown.
Due to his hard work and determination, a hospital with 30 beds each has been constructed in Puni village near Kolkata.
I would like to introduce a lot of inspirations to my country.
Today, the whole world has changed the perspective of India.
We are moving forward among all castes and there is a belief that our country is moving forward.
This self-confidence, positivity will help us to realise our resolve for a New India and dream come true.
My dear countrymen, in the coming months, it is very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
That's why a lot of letters have come from agriculture.
This time, I have made a video of the discussions with the farmers on DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan, and all the farmers should also contact DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan.
In his letter, the Prime Minister said, "Toforget how to die the earth and to save the soil, to save the agriculture and the farmers, to show how much interest Mahatma Gandhi had for himself.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had a strong discussion on the need to protect trees, plants and trees and also adopt good agricultural practices.

In one of his speeches in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh stressed the need for farmers to use new technology and innovate.
I had visited the Krishi Unnati Mela organized recently in Delhi.
My discussions with the farmer brothers and sisters, the scientists there, my experiences related to farming, my understanding of the new innovations related to agriculture, all these things are very pleasant to me.
But I was most impressed by the efforts of Meghalaya and the farmers there.
This very small state has been doing a great job.
In the year 2015-16, our farmers in Meghalaya had a record production of five years ahead of that.
When I was given a detailed account of the MSP then the MSP of all the crops will be calculated based on the MSP and the cost of the hard work done by other workers, the cost of the farm produce will be four times more than the cost of the machinery, the cost of the machines or the cost of the machinery, the cost of the seeds and the cost of the crop, the cost of the irrigation, the cost of the soil and the interest paid on the working capital, the interest paid on the land will not only benefit the farmers who are self-sufficient but will also benefit from the hard work of their families.
In addition to this, a massive effort is being made to bring about agricultural market reforms in the country so that the farmers get fair price for their produce.
Efforts are being made to connect rural markets to wholesale markets and global markets.
My dear countrymen, this year, the centenary year of Mahatma Gandhi will begin.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our resolve.
And how can 1.25 billion people pay the best tribute to Gandhiji by working shoulder to shoulder
I request you all to share your views on MyGov.
What should be the logo of Gandhi 150?
Slogan, spell, or what the festival should be?
Today, the country is moving ahead with traditional systems in the field of health.
Everything related to health in the country was just the responsibility of the Ministry of Health.
Today, all the departments and Ministries, be it the Ministry of Swachhata, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, or the State Governments, are working together for a Swasth Bharat - Swasth Bharat, with a focus on preventive and cost-effective healthcare.
Immunization is the cost-effective and easy-to-use healthcare.
The more we are aware of the preventive steps taken by us, the better will be the benefit of the person, the family and the society.
If life is to be healthy, then first thing is cleanliness.
As a nation, we have taken the challenge together and as a result, within four years, the sanitation coverage has doubled, and nearly 80 percent.
Besides, extensive work is underway for setting up of health and wellness centres across the country.

People from all over the country and the world have enthusiastically participated in the last three International Yoga Day.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do Yoga on our own and motivate the entire family, friends and everyone to practice Yoga.
Inspire children, youth and senior citizens to practice Yoga in new ways.
On TV and electronic media, several programmes related to Yoga are being organized throughout the year.
Can we prepare a new spirit of Yoga as a movement from now on to the day of Yoga
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga.
I will share the video with you so that we can practice Asanas and Pranayama together.
It'll be a great help to them.

My dear countrymen, April 14th, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar on his birth anniversary.
Years ago, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke about industrialization of India.
For him, industry was a good medium to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when we successfully launch the Make in India initiative in the country, Dr.
In keeping with his vision, today the Smart Cities Mission and the Urban Cities Mission are being launched in the country, to provide all types of facilities, good roads, water facilities, health facilities, education and digital connectivity in the big cities and small towns of the country.
Baba Saheb had great faith in self-reliance and self-reliance in self-reliance.
He wanted that no person should be left out of poverty every day.
At the same time, he believed that his poverty would not be removed only because he had given something to the poor.
Today, initiatives like MUDRA Yojana, Start-up India and Stand-up India are giving birth to our young entrepreneurs.
Several River Valley Authorities, various Water Commissions, are all born in Babasaheb Ambedkar's vision for the development of the country.
Today, there is a historical effort for waterways and ports in the country.
He stressed on the importance of the Federalism and the federal system of working together between the Centre and the States for the growth of the country.
He has shown that there is no need to be born in a large or rich family to reach the top, but in India, the poorest of the poor can have dreams, can make efforts to realise those dreams and can achieve success.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Accordingly, there will be special programmes in all parts of India on subjects such as rural development, poor welfare and social justice.
I urge all of you to participate enthusiastically in this event.
My dear countrymen, in the coming days, many festivals are taking place, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavira, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi.
It is a day to remember the sacrifice and penance of Lord Mahavira on his Jayanti.
The life and vision of Lord Mahavira, the messenger of Ahimsa will inspire all of us.
Best wishes to all the people on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti.
When we talk of Easter, we remember the inspiring advice of Jesus Christ and always convey to the mankind the message of peace, harmony and compassion.
In April, Baisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and western India.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science and they have written a few things in writing.
We see the colour of the sea blue, but we understand from our experience that water is not colourable.
Have we ever thought why the water in the river or the sea is colored?
The same question arose in the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This is the question that gave birth to a scientist in modern India.
Now when we talk of science, the first thing is that of Bharat Ratna C.
One of his inventions is known as Ramon Effect.
It's said he found the truth of light skating on this day, which is why he received the Nobel Prize.
This country has also produced many great scientists in the field of science.
India is proud of Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose, Hargovind Khurana and Satyendranath Bose.
The Bosons Party, popularly known as the Satyendra Nath Bose, has been named after them.
Recently, I had the opportunity to attend a programme in Mumbai, the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It was a pleasure to know about the wonders of science.
Through Artificial Intelligence, Robots, Bots and other devices with fixed purpose are being used for manufacturing.
Now machines make their intelligence more smart through self-learning.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor and the poor.
I asked the scientific community how Artificial Intelligence can be helpful in making the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters easier in this programme related to Artificial Intelligence.
Can we use Artificial Intelligence to better predict natural hazards
Can farmers help in farming
Can Artificial Intelligence help us make healthcare more accessible to everyone and help us treat diseases in a modern way
A few days ago, the Prime Minister of Israel, along with him, had the opportunity to attend the inauguration of the iCreate in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There, a young man talked about developing a digital device.
I think we can use Artificial Intelligence for many such things.
Science and Technology is called uality Nutrition.
Any machine is doing what we want.
But what we want to do with the machine depends on us.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered the bulb, failed many times in his experiment.
Once when he asked about it, he replied: I sought 10,000 ways to find the bulb.
That is, Edison made his failures even more powerful.
Fortunately, I am fortunate today to be in Aravali, the workplace of Maharshi Aravind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, and raised many questions about the British India.
The idea of asking questions again and again is very important to know the truth.
This is the true inspiration behind scientific inventions.
Why, don't you stay calm until you get the answers.
My best wishes to the scientists and all others associated with science on this occasion of National Science Day.
Friends, In times of crisis, I receive a lot of messages on every subject like security, accident and others. People write to me about it.
Shri Ravindra Singh from Pune and Shri Narendra Modi on mobile app have been on security at work places.
He writes that in our country, where factories and construction work is going on, safety norms are not good.
On March 4, 2020, India is celebrating the National Security Day and therefore the Prime Minister urged people to be aware of the safety concerns of the people.
When we talk of public safety, two things are very important one and two things are very important: initiative and preparation.
One thing is necessary at the time of accident - safety living disorder and the other is important in daily life - safety in environment life .
If we are not aware of safety in our daily lives, if there is no such alertness, and if there is a danger, it is difficult.
We must have often written on the boards that we see on the road. If there is no awareness, the danger will definitely be harmed, the joy and laughter will be lost, the safety will be ensured without leaving the world as soon as possible.
I am told that the fire brigades in the cities with fire brigade should go to every school once a week or once a month and perform a mock show in front of the children.
Therefore, there will be two benefits - the fire brigade will have the habit of being alert and the new generation will also be able to know about it.
On the issue of disasters, India is a land of diversity, geographical and climate.
The country has faced many disasters like natural calamities, chemicals and industrial accidents.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is at the forefront of dealing with accidents in the country.
NDMA is rapidly reaching out for rescue operations in various accidents such as earthquakes, floods, cyclones, landslides etc.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives due to heat wave.
The number of deaths due to heat wave in 2017 has come down significantly to about 220.
This shows that if we prioritize safety, then we can achieve security.
There are innumerable people who are doing this kind of work in the society, social organizations, alert citizens - I congratulate all those who are reaching out with the help of rescue teams in the moment of crisis.
The number of heroes who don't know such names is no less.
Our fire and rescue services, the National Disaster Response Force, the Armed Forces and the paramilitary forces have come to a standstill, and are helping the people save their lives.
We have to make a community conscious of the accident.
In our culture, we cherish values, often talk of safety values, but we also have to understand the values of safety.
We have to make it a part of our lives.
In our normal life, we travel hundreds of times by plane, and in the air-hosts inside the air, we see early warning of security.
We might have heard it a hundred times, but if someone leaves us on a plane and asks us where everything is, where is the life jacket How to use it
Therefore, our ears on the plane have a hearing attitude, but we don't think these warnings are for me as well.
Similarly, every aspect of life is being covered.
We can't think of security for anyone else.
If we are all aware of our safety, it will also include the feeling of social security.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, the emphasis was given to the villages on the theme of 'Swachh Bharat' - 'waste to wealth' and 'waste to energy'.
The objective of this Gobar-Dhan Yojana is to make the villages clean, to bring about wealth and energy through the conversion of livestock and farm waste to compost, bio-gas etc.
The number of livestock in India is the highest in the world with about 300 million cattle and their dung production per day is about 3 million tonnes.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Gramin, it is also moving forward in this direction.
The Gobardhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in keeping the village clean.
I invite you to be a part of this peoples movement, Clean Energy and Green Job, and come forward to convert the waste of your village into wealth and convert dung into wealth.
My dear countrymen, till now we have heard about many kinds of festivals like Music Festival, Food Festival, Film Festival etc.
However, as a unique initiative in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the first garbage festival was organized in the state.
The objective of the festival, organised by the city of Raipur was to create awareness about the importance of cleanliness and to sensitize the city about the unique methods of creative use of garbage and recycling of dung.
During this festival, a number of events were organized, in which a wonderful crowd of people participated.
Inspired by the program at Raipur, various garbage festivals were organized in other districts.
Everybody has done a lot of things in their own way and shared new ideas on cleanliness, held discussions and recited a poem.
The importance of garbage management and cleanliness was presented in a very fresh manner and I congratulate the people of Raipur city, Chhattisgarh, its government and the administration.
International Womens Day is celebrated every year on 8th March.
A lot of programmes are being organized in our country and around the world.
On this day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar has been conferred on those who have done exemplary work in various fields across the country.
Today, the country is moving towards women led development beyond women development.
On this occasion, I am reminded of Swami Vivekanandas words.
He said that the idea of perfect womanhood is complete freedom.The idea put forward by Swamiji 25 years ago reflects the spirit of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is the duty of all of us to ensure equal participation of women in all spheres of social and economic life, which is our responsibility and responsibility.
We are a part of the tradition that we recognize men in the name of women.They were known as Yashoda-Nandan, Kausalya-Nandan, Gandhari-Son.
Today, our women's strength manifests self-confidence and self-confidence in their work.
They have taken the country and the society forward and have set a new goal.
Finally, our vision of a New India is an equal partner in the overall development of a women power, strong and capable nation.
There are many examples of what can be done by women power and if you look around, you will find some such stories that inspire life.
I got something from Jharkhand.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, 1.5 million women in Jharkhand have to be considered as less than the number - 1.5 million women have been mobilized and swachhata campaign has been launched for one month.
These women in Jharkhand have shown that they can make the campaign of cleanliness in normal life and the culture of cleanliness as normal people.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, in three villages of Elephanta Island, it was reported in the news that 70 years after the independence, the people there were so happy about it.
You know that Elephanta Island is at sea ten kilometers from Mumbai.
This is a very attractive tourist spot.
I congratulate the government and the people there.
I am happy that now the villages of Elephanta and the caves there will see the light of electricity.
This is not only a new beginning of electrification but also a new beginning of development.
May there be light in people's lives, happiness in life... and a moment of greater joy and enthusiasm than this.
My dear countrymen, we celebrated Shivratri the same day.
The specialty of this month is the growing season of the month of March, when the whole of the land, the wheat that is flourishing, and the other golden crops, and the mango that blossoms.
This month is also the month of Holi and this month is also the month of Holi for all.
On March 2, 2018, everyone will celebrate Holi with joy.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much, Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat 2018
For the first time in history, rulers of 10 countries participated in the celebrations.
He will also pay attention to the commemoration of Kalpna Chowla, on February 1, 2019.
They went on to draw inspiration from millions of young people around the world, despite having lost their near and dearness to us in the accident that occurred on the Columbia space shuttle.
We have lost Kalpana Chowla at such a young age. It is a sad thing for all of us.
It is a matter of great happiness that the women of India are moving fast in every field and increasing the pride of the country.
The respect that women have received in our country in ancient times, their place in the society and their contribution has made the whole world astonished.
There is a long tradition of Indian scholars.
Come on, tell me about Bei Bacho, Bei Pado.
However, in the olden days, the scriptures - "Dashputra, Sammanya, Dasaputra, Karmdakshin" - "Abhiyan, Availability, Martha, Availability, Availability, Availability, Availability, Availability, Availability, is a virgin.
That is, a daughter is equal to ten sons, ten sons and you will get the daughter in a daughter.
This shows the importance of women in our society.
That is why women in our society have been given the status of strength.
This woman power unites the entire country, the entire society and the entire family in the framework of unity.
Be it the learning and devotion of the sages of Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee, Akkamahadevi and Meerabai, be it the administrative skills of Ahilyabai Holkar, the courage of Rani Lakshmibai, the strength of women inspires us.
May the dignity of the country be enhanced.
Prakash Tripathi set many examples.
He writes that the brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has been inspiring to fly the fighter aircraft on Su-30, here today.
Under the leadership of Vartika Joshi, she has written about the journey of the entire world to INSV Tarini.
He said that the three brave women, Bhavana Kanth, Mohana Singh, who were pilots of the Chaturvedi Aever War aircraft, and trained in Sukhoi-30 were also present.
In Delhi, the women led by Pratibha Vajpayee are proud to fly to San Francisco, USA and to fly to Delhi and to Air India's Boeing jet.
Remember all women...
These women who have won the first female Merchant Navy Captain, first female train driver in the passenger train, first female firefighter - fire fighter - first female bus driver, first woman in Antarctica, first woman in Everest, first woman in Everest, first woman in every field - women who have attained fame and made extraordinary achievements by breaking the identity of our women power society.
He said that through hard work, grit and determination, all obstacles and barriers can be overcome and a new path can be set.
It is not only the people of our country who are present here, but it is also a source of inspiration for the future generations.
A new zeal and inspiration will be given to them.
We have also prepared a book on these women who have been engaged in this thing - so that all the people of the country should know about this woman power and you should take inspiration from the work done by them in their lives.
This is available for e-books on the Narendra Modi website.
Women power has a great role to play in the active transformation of the nation and society.
When we talk of women empowerment, we want to talk about a railway station.
You must be wondering that what is the connection between railway station and women empowerment
Mt. Munga station in Mumbai is the first station in India for all the workers.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Dantewada in Chhattisgarh is a affected area.
Violence, attacks, bombs, guns, pistols - all this is a terrible atmosphere that the Maoists built there.
In such a horrible place, tribal women are becoming self-reliant by driving the e-Orientics.
In a short span of time, many women are associated with it.
In addition to this, it will also strengthen the environment protection.
The district administration has played an important role in the success of these women, from the fact that they have provided grants to them, to the time they have laid the foundation stone.
Continuous efforts have been made in our society personally and socially for centuries against social evils and vices.
A few days ago, it started in Bihar.
The state has finished 10000 kilometers long, the world's largest human chain, to eliminate social evils from the state.
Through this stretch, a social conscience is awakened against the evils of child marriage, dowry system etc.
The state has resolved to fight evils like dowry and child marriage together.
Ladies and gentlemen, Young men, mothers and sisters, all of them took part in this battle of Self-Reliant India.
The humanitarian crisis that began at the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna took shape without being confined to the border of the state.
In order to ensure that everyone in the society gets the benefit of development in the right way, society must be free from the evils.
Come, let us together pledge to free our society from the evils, create a New India, a strong and capable India.
He was earlier not aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
However, now we have come to know about the Jan Aushadhi scheme where you have started buying trees and the price of the wood has come down by 75.
In the last few days, a lot of people have been writing to me about this thing and I have been talking about it.
The objective of this scheme is to make healthcare available to anyone and to increase the ease of living.
The number of trees available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras is 50 to 90 per cent less than the number of branded trees sold here.
That is why quality trees are available at a lower price.
More than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras are being set up across the country.
There is also a new employment opportunity for those who want to earn personal employment.
Cheap shops are also available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and at Amrit stores in hospitals.
The only aim for this is to provide affordable and quality healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country, thereby creating a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi App.
I am aware that the citizens of Akola had organized a cleanliness camp to clean the river Morna under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morna river flows for 12 months prior to the time of the monsoon and the ali was flowing only during the rainy season.
It is painful that the river is full of kahupul and pola.
A lot of waste is being thrown out of the river and its banks.
On 13th January, a day before Makar Sankranti, on the first leg of Mission Clean Morna, in fourteen kilometers of the area, both sides of the river Morna were cleaned.
More than 4000 people from Akola, more than 100 NGOs, college-school students, cooks, elders, mothers, sisters, all joined this mission of Mission Clean Morna.
On 20th January, 2018, this cleanliness campaign will continue every Saturday morning till the river Morna is completely clean.
If someone comes out to do something, it's not impossible.
A big change can be brought about through public participation.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district administration, the municipal authorities, the people who participated in this movement, your efforts will inspire many people of the country.
Dear fellow citizens, You must have heard of the Padma Awards these days.
There will be news in newspapers and TV about this thing.
It is the usual practice to give Padma Awards every year, but this method has remained unchanged in the last three years.
Any citizen can name anyone.
The process has been made online and there is transparency in it.
In a way, the selection process for these awards has been completely changed.
Normally, Padma Awards are given to those who are not present in cities, in newspapers, on TV or in conferences.
Arvind Gupta was awarded the award by Kay.
As a student of IIT Kanpur, I have dedicated my life for making toys for these students. You will also be happy.
He has been making toys from things left to grow in Ku-i for four decades.
He also tried to motivate them to carry out scientific experiments with useless abandoned material.
For this purpose, films made in 18 languages in 3,000 schools across the country will be encouraged.
Awesome life, awe inspiring, awe inspiring our lives.
There's a similar story from Sitava Jodha from Karnataka.
The goddess of women's empowerment is not forsaken.
For the past three decades, they have made significant contribution in transforming the lives of countless women in Balgaw.
When she was seven years old, she dedicated herself as a votary and dedicated her life only for the welfare of Pitt Devadasis.
Not only this, the Dalit has done an unprecedented work for the welfare of women.
Due to this interest, not India, the whole world is respected.
The exhibition will showcase his films in countries such as Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
He was also awarded the Padma Shri by Shri K.K. Majnu Shyam for his talent abroad.
You will be surprised to know about the story of Lakshmiku, the tribal woman of Kerala.
Living in a place called "Lakshmiku Kallar" where the tribal community resides in a well-equipped cottage at Idumkoh.
It's about 500 green trees that make up their memory.
There is special importance of making a snake bite.
Lakshmi Ji continues to serve the society with her knowledge of the Greens.
The nation has been honored with the Padma Shri for recognizing the world renowned personality and contributing to the society.
Her husband died without treatment at the age of 23 and was inspired to build a hospital for the poor.
Thousands of poor people are being provided free treatment at the hospital where they are being built with hard work.
Sometimes we should invite them to schools and colleges to listen to their experiences.
There should be some efforts of the society beyond awards.
My dear countrymen, every year on the 9th of January, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
On January 9, Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in South Africa.
On this day, let us celebrate the unbreakable bond between Indians living in India and around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we have planned a programme to invite Parliamentarians and mayors from all over the world and from India.
Members of Parliament from India and Mayors of Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Bri, Suriname, South Africa and America participated in the event.
I am happy that the people of India, living in different countries, have served those countries and they have maintained their strong relationship with India.This time the EU has sent me a calendar.
Our people of India live in different countries of Europe - some work related to cyber security, some are dedicated to Ayurveda, some are dedicated to the society through their music.
January 30 is the day of remembrance of Pujya Bapu on the new path for all of us.
We pay our homage to the great martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the defense at 11 o'clock.
They're not just principles.
My dear countrymen, with the best wishes of 2018, end my speech.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2017
This is the last episode of Mann Ki Baat in the year 2017 and today is the last day of 2017.
I shared a lot of things with you this year.
The year will change after a few hours, but the sharing of these ideas will continue.
On the occasion of Christ, all of us remember the noble teachings of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ gave utmost importance to the spirit of service.
We see the essence of servitude in the Bible.
Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhans used to say that one has to live with reverence.
The extraordinary life full of courage and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh ji is a source of inspiration for all of us.
In this attempt, he had to lose a lot of things personally.
It was indeed a privilege for me to be present at the Prakashotsava organized in Patna Sahib on the occasion of the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh in the beginning of this year.
Let us make a decision in our minds that we will learn from the great lessons taught by Guru Gobind Singh ji and strive to build our lives by learning from that inspiring life.
January 1, 2018, i.e. tomorrow...
Tomorrow is a special day for me.
But when I say something special, I repeat, it's really special.
We welcome the voters of 21st century and the voters of New India.
This whole of India is eager to welcome you as voters of the 21st century.
You must be proud as a voter of the 21st century.
Your vote will be based on New India.
The power of vote is the greatest strength of democracy.
Vote is one of the best things to bring about a progressive change in the lives of lakhs of people.
You don't just have the right to vote.
You can become the creators of the 21st century by thinking about how India should be in the 21st century, what your dream should be in the 21st century India.
The youth of New India is about enthusiasm, zeal and energy.
The dream of a New India is being fulfilled by these bright, skilled and powerful youth of our country.
When we talk of New India, it is about an India free from casteism, communalism, terrorism and the scourge of corruption.
A free India from dirt and poverty.
New India, where everyone gets equal opportunities, where everyone's aspirations are fulfilled.
New India is the power that leads us in peace, togetherness and harmony.
My young friends of New India should come forward and analyze what a New India will become.
How can we realize our dreams by 2022
How can we make an India that our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi had made the freedom struggle a peoples movement.
My young friends, we need to organize a mass movement to create a grand and divine India of the 21st century.
A peoples movement for development, a peoples movement for progress, a capable and strong India.
Today, many opportunities have opened up for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth is coming forward and winning.
I want the youth of this New India to know about the schemes that open up such opportunities at one place and once they are 18 years old, they should have a natural understanding of the world and these schemes, and a system that can be used to benefit from it.
There is nothing impossible for a person full of positive thoughts and enthusiasm.
There is a saying in English too - Pessimism Leaders to Weakness, Optimism to Power.
The tweets and responses received were truly encouraging.
It was a very pleasant experience.
Some shared some positive stories that had a positive impact on their minds.
Some shared their personal gains.
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket 1, Phase 1, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyotirendra Wade.
I'm talking from a place called Bondal.
As per my husband's instructions, he received an insurance premium of one rupee per month.
He died in an accident.
So we know what's our position.
My name is Anand Jadhav.
The National Highway will be going through our village of Disarma from 2017 onwards.
My name is Satish Bawani.
Our area lacked water and in the last 40 years we were dependent on the military pipeline.
Now I've got a special pipeline.
It was our biggest achievement in 2017.
There are many such things in their own way that positive changes are taking place in the lives of people.
In fact, this is the New India that we all build together.
Recently, I came to know about the inspiring story of a passing-in-charge of the Administrative Service from Kashmir, Amjad and Bashir Khan Khatak.
He was removed from the clutches of terrorism and hatred and was at the forefront of the Kashmir Administrative Service Examination.
You will be surprised to know that in the 1990s, the terrorists had burned his heritage house.
His family would have to flee from the land of their heritage, where terrorism and violence were more.
He chose a different path for himself, a way of serving the people.
He escaped the opposite environment and wrote the story of victory himself.
Today he is not only an inspiration for Jammu and Kashmir but for the youth of the country.
No matter how bad the environment is, Anju has shown that a positive step can eliminate the consequences of despair.
Last week, I had the opportunity to meet some girls from Jammu and Kashmir.
It was spirit, enthusiasm, energy, dream and resolve.
As long as I spent with those kids, I was inspired.
This is the strength of the country, these are my youth, these are the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, while discussing the famous religious places of the world and not just of my country, it is natural to mention about the Sabarimala temple in Kerala.
In this world famous temple every year crores of devotees come to receive the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami .
How big a challenge can it be to save such a large number of devotees who come here and stay in such a great place without garbage
Is it an area of mountains and forests , or is it an area of special importance ?
A police officer named Vijayan started a programme called Punyam Poonkavan, under which a self-reliant awareness campaign has been started for cleanliness.
Any devotee who comes here has made a habit of not completing his journey without any physical effort in relation to cleanliness.
There are no big people, no small people in this movement.
All devotees consider it a part of Gods worship and devote some time towards cleanliness, working and cleaning the garbage.
In every morning, the sight of garbage dumps here is surprising and all the pilgrims are participating in it.
No matter how big the celebrity is, no matter how rich the officer is, no matter how big the officer is, everyone participates in the cleanliness drive as a common devotee and goes ahead with the cleanliness drive.
There are many such examples before us.
The holy dip in the cleanliness drive at Sabarimala becomes a part of pilgrimage for all devotees.
There, the resolve for cleanliness along with the harsh conditions is also going on simultaneously.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October, 2014, we took a pledge on the birth anniversary of Bapu that Swachh Bharat and the pious occasion of Swachh Bharat would complete the incomplete mission of Bapu.
Bapu's entire life worked and worked hard for this one thing.
In the rural areas and urban areas, change has been seen through peoples cooperation in a big way.
The Swachh Survekshan 2018, the worlds largest survey, will be conducted between 4th January and 10th March, to assess the impact of sanitation in urban areas.
This survey will be conducted in more than 4000 cities among the people.
I'll talk to the citizens and get their feedback.
He will also review the use of the Swachhata App and the up-gradation of various service centres.
Whether the city has made all the arrangements to make the city's cleanliness a people's habit or not
Don't let the government clean up.
Every citizen and the organizations of the citizens has a big responsibility.
I urge all the people to participate enthusiastically in the Swachhata Survey, which is going to take place in the coming days.
Try to ensure that your city is not left behind and that your village and village are not left behind.
On the basis of this survey, cities will be ranked - if your city is more than one lakh people then in the country's ranking, if there is a small population of less than one lakh, then it should be your dream that you make efforts to achieve the highest rank in local ranking.
Come, with this resolution, once again remembering Bapu, let us make the best efforts with the determination of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, some things may seem small to us, but as a society, there is a far-reaching effect on our personality.
Today, in this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share one such thing with you.
For decades, injustice was being done to Muslim women, but no one even discussed it.
There are no such laws in many Islamic countries.
But Muslim women of India did not have the right to go to Haj without male participation.
I have directed the Ministry of Minority Affairs to ensure that all women who apply to go alone are allowed to go to Haj.
I would like to especially urge the women who have applied for going alone to the Haj pilgrimage to get rid of this menace and take special care of them.
India's development journey has progressed on the strength of our women power and on the basis of their talent.
I firmly believe that we will continue to move forward and we want our women and men to get equal rights and equal opportunities and continue to work together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic day for us.
26th January, 2018 will be remembered in a special way.
Leaders from ten ASEAN countries will visit India as Chief Guests at the Republic Day celebrations this year.
This time, there will be not one but ten Chief Guests on the Republic Day.
This has never happened in the history of India.
The year 2017 was special for the ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years and India's alliance with ASEAN was completed 25 years in 2017.
It is a matter of pride for all Indians that on the 26th of January these great leaders from 10 countries of the world will come together.
My dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals, in a way our country is the country of festivals.
There's not even a day that doesn't connect with the festival.
We just celebrated Christmas, the New Year is coming.
May the coming New Year bring happiness, joy and prosperity to all of you.
Let us move forward with a new zeal, enthusiasm, joy and a new resolve, let the country move forward.
The Makar Sankranti is celebrated in the month of January, when the sun is moving towards northern India.
This is a celebration of nature.
All festivals like Sankranti in Rajasthan, Magh-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu are special in their own way and they have their own importance.
These festivals are celebrated between 13th January and 17th January.
The names of all these festivals are different but the basic elements are the same.
My best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, my dear countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
They are older than us and are witness to every step and every era in the country.
Before leaving for a foreign tour, I had the privilege of talking to Didi on the phone.
It was like a loving conversation with a brother-in-law.
I don't usually talk about personal conversations like this.
Modi ji - Latadi, Namaskar.
I'm speaking to Narendra Modi.
I convey my best wishes to you all on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Modi ji and Didi.
I pray that Didi's health is good, and the blessings of Didi all of us are with us.
Before I went to America, I was calling for Didi to sign a certificate.
I was very happy to hear that Lata ji's phone calls were coming.
When will you go back?
Everyone at home...
I think it is because of the blessings of my parents and the blessings of the listeners.
You don't know what you are.
I know that as soon as you come, the image of India is changing.
Modi ji- Yes
She was very happy with this love of Modi ji and Didi.
I am extremely grateful to Modi ji and Didi for understanding me all the time.
I once again wish you the very best on your birthday.
Modi ji - I was delighted to visit Mumbai this time.
Modi ji - but I will come soon.
Modi ji - Please come home and eat something from Didi.
Late ji, of course.
I'm going to be lucky.
Modi ji - Namaste Didi.
Lata ji.
Modi ji - greetings to Didi ji - Namaste
Modi ji - Namaste
My dear countrymen, from this day of Navratri, the time of festivities has come once again with a new zeal, enthusiasm, new zeal and new resolve.
Over the weeks, festivals are celebrated across the country.
On the festive occasions, the family members will come together.
This is what we call the darkness at the bottom of the lamp.
Perhaps, there is not just a word in this saying, an order for all of us, a vision, an inspiration.
On the one hand, many houses are illuminated while on the other hand, on the other hand, there are some windows around them where darkness is spread.
When this darkness disappears, the real joy of these festivals is when the light shines through the dim light.
They collect clothes, sweets, food from people's homes, find and transport them to the needy.
This time, will you try to light the darkness at the bottom of the lamp with a sense of freshness and determination in this season of festivals
Smiling on the faces of many poor families, doubling your happiness in the festive season, your face will shine bright, your light will shine bright, your Diwali will shine brightly.
Can we welcome Lakshmi this time in a new way
In our culture, daughters are considered Lakshmi because daughters bring good fortune and prosperity.
There will be many daughters in our midst, who have made the name of the family, society and the country glorious, through their hard work and dedication.
Can we organize a programme to honour these Lakshmis of India on this occasion of Diwali
We have many daughters and daughters who do extraordinary things.
Our society must recognize and respect such daughters and be proud of them.
We all together have organized a mass movement Selfie with Daughter and this too can be propagated in the whole world.
Similarly, this time we are going to organize a mass movement called Bharat Ki Lakshmi.
Encouraging the Lakshmi of India is strengthening the path of prosperity for the country and the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, I have said beforehand that through the Mann Ki Baat programme, I have had the privilege of being directly and indirectly interacting with a large number of unknown people.
A student from Arunachal, far away, sent me a very interesting letter from Alina Tamang.
My country is Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when my results came in, people asked me if I had read the book Exam Warriors.
After that my experience was very good.
I thought I'd be very good if I had read that book before the exam.
And this little girl has given me a job too.
But I have a request that you can help me.
I'll read it all.
I must try to think about it and write about it in my own way, in my words.
I once again express my gratitude to the young friend of Arunachal Pradesh, Alina Tiang, a student of Arunachal Pradesh.
Look.
Just as the issue of victory in the US Open was discussed this time, the speech of Runner Up Daniel Medvedev was also discussed and there was good publicity in the social media.
I saw that speech, and I saw the game.
The simplicity and maturity of Danne Md. Dave ji, 23 years old, was inspiring everyone.
Of course it attracted me too.
Just a few moments ago, he had failed in the final match with Raphael Nadal, a 19-time Grand Slum winner and a legend from Tennys.
If there was someone else in this situation, he would have become sad and disappointed.
His words were warmly welcomed by the audience.
He also praised the great Dandin champion Nadala Basin, and said how Nadal has inspired lakhs of young people to play tennis and how difficult it was to play with him.
It was to see the spirit of the man who failed in one game and the humility of the winner.
If you do not listen to the words of Danon Medvede, I would like to tell all of you, especially the youth that I would like to watch the video.
People from all walks of life, every age can learn a lot from it.This is a great moment beyond victory.
Victory is not a big deal.
Life's victory.
It's very beautiful in our country's sciences.
The thinking of our ancestors is certainly commendable.
It is said in the scriptures: Vidya Vinaya, Harathy, Chetahmsi, Kasya, Manjusya, Kanchenjunga, Janayati, Loksya, Logananandam. It means that if a person is qualified and humble together, his mind cannot succeed.
In fact, this young player has conquered the hearts of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, the thing that I am going to say now is for your own good.
There will be debates, but there will be disagreements, but there will be a lot of benefits if some things stop before growing up.
When it becomes very large, it becomes very difficult to stop some things once it becomes very widespread.
But if we stop it at the beginning with a lot of caution then we can save many things.
The practice of intoxication of tobacco is largely due to nicotine.
Eating as a child affects the growth of the brain.
But today I would like to tell you about a new topic.
You might be aware that in India, e-cigarettes have been banned recently.
Apart from ordinary cigarettes, e-cigarette is an electronic tool in a way.
A kind of chemical smoke is produced when nicotine content is heated in the e-cigarette.
It is a perfumed chemical that doesn't make it smelly like other cigarettes.
It has been observed that even if the father is a chain smoker at home, he tries to prevent others from smoking in the house and wants children to not get addicted to cigarettes and bidi.
He also wished that no one at home should smoke cigarettes.
He knows that smoking and tobacco causes a major loss to the body.
But the issue of e-cigarettes is completely different.
People dont know much about e-cigarettes.
It is totally unaware of the danger, and therefore, at times, e-cigarettes get access to the house as if it is just a curious one.
You know, if someone smokes around us, we can smell it.
He has a cigarette pack in his pocket, but it smells like it.
But this is not the case with the e-cigarettes, so that many children, young people, who do not know, or feel proud of being a fashion, often walk around with their books, offices, pockets, and so on, and become a victim of it.
The younger generation is the future of the country.
This new method of intoxication is prohibited in the country so that our youth does not get destroyed, the dreams of our families do not get disturbed, the lives of our children do not get ruined, this habit of e-cigarettes is prohibited in the country so that there is no root in the society.
I appeal to everyone to shun the ill-effects of tobacco and avoid misunderstanding about e-cigarettes.
You remember Fit India, don't you?
Fit India does not mean an hour or two in a gym every morning and evening.
Stay away from it for Fit India.
Our Bharat Mata, our country is a multi-faceted Vasundhara ji.
Many human lives are flourishing on this planet.
India was the birthplace of extraordinary people, the land of Karmabhoomi.
They are dedicated for themselves, not for others.
Such a great personality is being honored at Vatican City on October 13th.
This is a matter of pride for all Indians and on the 13th of October the Pope Francis will declare Mariam Thresia sacred.
Sister Mariam Thresia, in her short life of 50 years, worked for the welfare of mankind is an example for the whole world.
My dear countrymen, as we celebrate Gandhi150, as well as 130 crore people, not only India but the whole world is proud that we have taken a pledge to free India from single use plastic.
India is taking a lead in the field of environment protection so the entire world is now looking towards India.
I am confident that all of you will also be a part of the movement to eliminate single use plastic on October 2.
Each and every place, people play their part in it in their own way.
But a young man of our country has done a very different thing.
When I turned my attention to his work, I called him and tried to understand and understand his new method.
He said that it could be beneficial for the country and the people.
Shri.
When I heard the word Ploging for the first time, it was a new word.
Maybe there's some use in foreign countries.
But in India, Ripudaman Dalvi had given a big boost to this.
Come, let's talk to him.
Our India will take 130 crore steps to get rid of the Single Use Plastic, if 130 crore people take one step in this direction.
Ripudaman, once again thank you very much.
Many congratulations to you, your team and this new concept.
I'd like to remind you of something in advance.
But it's time for some people to start training and plan some programmes.
My dear countrymen, by 2022, I had said from the Red Fort on 15th August, that you must visit 15 places in India.
Make a plan to stay at least one night or two nights in at least 15 places.
You see, understand and feel India.
My dear countrymen, once again, my best wishes to all of you on the various festivals of India, full of diversity.
Yeah.
On the occasion of Deepavali, you should also keep in mind that people do not face any problem while bursting of garbage or making any kind of fire.
I need to be careful about that.
Together, let us celebrate festivals with great enthusiasm, new dreams and a new resolve.
Best wishes once again.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Namaskar to my dear countrymen.
Just a while ago, I had the opportunity to interact indirectly with the girl child from Karnataka.
He urged the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country at a function organized by the Times Group on the occasion of Vijay Karnatak, the Childrens Day.
Then they published the selected letters.
I was very happy to read those letters.
These little children know the problems of the country.
They also know about the ongoing discussions in the country.
Kirti Hegde from Uttarakhand, while appreciating the Digital India and Smart City programmes, the child says that there is a need to bring about a change in our education system and the children today do not like classroom readings, they do not want to know about nature.
If we give children the knowledge about nature, perhaps it will be of immense benefit in the future to protect the environment.
Rida Nadaf, a child from Laxmieswar, writes that she is proud of being the daughter of a soldier.
Which Indian will not be proud of our soldiers
And it's very natural to be proud if you're a soldier's daughter.
Irfan Begum from Kalburagi has written that the school is 5 kilometers away from home, so we have to leave home early and it is too late to return home.
He said that he does not want to spend time with his friends and he wants to have a school nearby.
But I liked what the newspaper did to bring the letters to me, so I could read those letters.
It's a good experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today is 26/11.
November 26 is our Constitution Day.
It was on this day in 1949 that the Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India.
The Constitution came into force on January 26, 1950, so we celebrate that day as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the spirit of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They worked hard for nearly three years to build the Constitution of India.
Those who read about this discussion feel proud of what was the thinking of those who were dedicated to the nation.
Can we imagine how hard they have worked to build the Constitution of our country which is diverse
When the country is free from the shackles of slavery, how much sense and foresight they have shown.
It is not a matter of touching life, it is not a matter of nature.
Equality for all and compassion for all is the hallmark of our Constitution.
It is our duty to literally adhere to the Constitution.
Be it a citizen or a ruler, we have to move forward with the spirit of the Constitution.
The message of our Constitution is that no one should be left behind in any way.
In this Constituent Assembly, 17 different committees were formed based on important issues.
The Drafting Committee of the Constitution was chaired by Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
He played an important role.
On the 6th of December, we remember and bow down to him on his Jayanti.
Baba Sahebs contribution in making the country prosperous and strong is unforgettable.
15th December is the holy day of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Sardar Patel became the son of a farmer and a steel man of the country, and performed a remarkable job in uniting the country with a single thread.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
The Council was headed by an Advisory Committee constituted for basic rights, fundamental rights, welfare of minorities and tribals.
I remember and salute the brave citizens, police and security personnel, and all those who lost their lives.
This country can never forget its sacrifice.
Today, terrorism is taking a terrible shape in all parts of the world, in a way, in a day-to-day event.
We in India have suffered a lot due to terrorism in the last 40 years.
Thousands of innocent people lost their lives.
Terrorism has challenged humanity.
This is the land that has given the message of non-violence and love to the world through Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavira, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi.
Terrorism and terrorism are making a cruel attempt to wipe out our social relations.
Therefore, it is the need of the hour to make the human powers more alert.
My dear countrymen, we all celebrate Navy Day and Navy Day in December this year.
You all know that our culture grew on the banks of the river.
This country has an indivisible bond with the great seas and our planet.
When we look back to history, 800-900 years ago, during the period of erosion, the Cholas were considered as the most powerful naval forces.
Their Navy played a major role in the development of the Cholas nation and making them the economic superpower of the time.
A number of examples of the expeditions and expeditions undertaken by the Chola Navika Sagar Parikrama can be seen in the crew.
Very few people may be aware that the majority of the naval personnel in the world were allowed to board warships very late.
But in the Chola Navy, a lot of women played a significant role 800-900 years ago.
Women even participated in the war.
The Chola authorities were well aware of shipbuilding.
When we talk of the Navy, who can forget the capability of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Navy to make it.
The Konkan coast was in the country of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud Janjira and Swarna Durga associated with Shivaji Maharaj were either on the sea shore or were surrounded by sea.
The Maratha Navy waited for the safety of these forts.
There were large ships and small boats in the Maratha Navy.
Their navy was capable of attacking any enemy and protecting the country from the enemy.
How can we not remember Kanhoji Angre while talking about the Maratha Navy
He took the Maratha Navy to a new level and built Naval Bases at various places.
After independence, our Indian Navy showed its valour on various occasions in the freedom struggle of Goa, or in the India-Pakistan war of 1971.
When we talk of the Navy, it is war, but the Indian Navy has come forward in the same manner as in human affairs.
The ship, Sumitra, immediately helped rescue the people and handed over many fishermen stranded in the sea to Bangladesh safely.
In May-June this year, when there was a massive flood in Sri Lanka, the three ships of our navy reached there immediately and helped the government and the people there.
On 21 November 2017, when a merchant vessel was stolen in the western Gulf, INS Trikand arrived for assistance.
Our Navy has done a commendable job in delivering health services to the people of Fiji, in providing immediate relief, and in providing humanitarian assistance during disaster to our neighbouring country.We, the people of India are always proud of our security forces and are deeply honoured.
Be it the Army, the Navy or the Air Force, every Indian salutes them for their bravery, valour, valour, bravery and sacrifice.
They sacrifice their youth for the country in order to lead a peaceful and peaceful life of over 1.25 billion people.
The Army Flag Day is celebrated on 7th December every year.
This is the day to take pride in the soldiers of the country and to pay homage to them.
I am happy that the Ministry of Defence has decided to organize a programme from 1st December to 7th December, 2018 to reach out to the citizens of the country to inform people about the Armed Forces and to sensitize people about the Armed Forces.
Every week, children and adults should wear the flag.
There must be a movement of respect for the army in the country.
You can get to know about the army by calling the soldiers in schools and colleges.
This can be a great opportunity for our new generation to learn about the army.
This opportunity is for the welfare of all the jawans of our armed forces.
This money is being used as a service to the families of the soldiers who have been martyred in the war through the Army Welfare Board to assist the injured soldiers in their rehabilitation.
Let us also contribute to their well-being.
I would like to say something to our farmer brothers and sisters.
Earth is a great part of the Earth.
Everything we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the food chain is connected to the entire soil.
Imagine what will happen if there is no soil that produces crops in this world.
When you think about it, you're afraid.
It has been thought about in our culture a long time ago and therefore we have been aware of the importance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, on the one hand, there is a natural effort to keep the soil, devotion and gratitude towards the soil, while on the other hand, scientific projects have been part of life to keep the soil nutritionally.
Two things were important in the lives of the farmers of this country: devotion to soil and maintaining soil in a scientific way.
We are proud that the farmers of our country are connected with tradition, are interested in modern science, try and take appropriate decisions.
I have heard about the farmers of Tehu village in Bhorad block of Hamirpur district in Himachal Pradesh.
There has been a decline in the yield and therefore the income has also come down and the productivity of the soil has gradually come down.
Some of the farmers in the village understood the seriousness of the situation and they duly evaluated their soil about the advice they received on how many fertilizers, other fertilizers, micro nutrients and bio-fertilizers were given.
You will be surprised to know about the health of the soil and the progress made by the advice given on what to do.
At the same time, the quality of soil has increased.
If we want to think of the crops then first we think about the pastor as well and when we want to protect the mother earth then the farmers feel that if we want to save the land then we will also be able to save the land.
Our farmers have created more than 10 crore soil health cards in the country to know the soil well and accordingly.
We have faith in the Mother Earth, but have you ever thought how much chemicals like urea could harm the Mother Earth's health?
In all scientific ways, the use of urea has proved to be a serious loss to the mother due to excessive use of urea.
Can our farmers make a decision that half of the urea used in the fields today will be consumed by us in 2022 when we will be 75 years of our independence
Global warming and climate change are all beginning to happen.
There was a time when the winter started before Diwali.
Now that the start of December, the winter has started to move slowly.
The 8-year-old boy, who had no speech, made Whistle his weapon.
At 5 a.m. in the morning, he entered the village's house, started vaccinating the people with a whistle and began teaching to stop defecating in the open.
This boy, who went out of 30-40 houses every day and taught us about cleanliness, made the village Kumhari free from open defecation.
The little boy, Tushar, did an inspiring job in promoting cleanliness.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters are determined, capable and brave.
Every minute we get to learn something.
Today they are working well in all spheres.
In the field of sports, in any competition or social initiative, our divyang people are no less than anyone.
You all will remember that our Divyang sportspersons had won 4 medals at the Rio Olympics through their outstanding performances.
Various competitions are being held across the country.
Recently, the 17th National Para Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in this event and displayed their skills.
One of them is Jigar Thakur from Gujarat and 80 percent of his body is non-musk.
He was selected for the Sports Authority of India 2020 Paralysis.
He is one of the 32 Para Swimmers trained at the Centre for Excellence, Gandhinagar.
Greetings to Jigar Thakkar I convey my best wishes to him.
Today, Divyangs can reach every field and pay special attention to opportunities.
It is our effort to make the country capable and an inclusive society.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-e-Nabi will be celebrated.
It is on this day that the prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb was born.
My heartiest greetings to all my fellow citizens.
This suggestion is very good, but I feel that something can be incorporated and changed with this suggestion.
The elders in our village always say that.
Remember your sorrows, do not forget the joys.
Can't you have your share in this?
Come, let us share good thoughts on the Narendra Modi App, MyGov or on social media, on positive India (Hashtag Positive India).
Let us remember the events that inspire others.
It's a good idea to do good to remember good things.
Good things will give you energy to do good.
Let us together see the power and outcome of this conjugation.
I'll have a chance to say a lot of things.
Prime Minister, 29th October, 2017
In Chhath Puja the sun and water are important but the utensils made of bamboo, mud and banana are essential items related to its worship.
In this festival of faith, the message of worshipping sunrise and sunset is filled with unique culture.
The world will respect and worship the originators.
But the Chhath Pooja Stupa conveys to all those who are steadfast in their prayer.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also embedded in this festival.
Before Chhath, people clean the entire house and join in performing duties like rivers, lakes and banks of ponds, places of worship i.e.
The festival of Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja is a celebration of the importance of environment protection, prevention and discipline.
It is natural for anyone to feel proud of this great heritage of India.
You must have felt happy to hear that so much business has been done in one store of Khadi and handloom.
On the occasion of Diwali, there has been an increase of about 680 in the sales of Khadi gift coupons.
The total sales of Khadi and handicrafts have registered a growth of about 90 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year.
Today it shows that youngsters, women, and people of all age groups like Khadi and handlooms.
With this, I can imagine how many families of the poor, the families of the poor, and the families of those who work in handlooms have benefitted.
He says we should also remember our brave security personnel.
I think we need to supply the sweet home to the young.
With the brave security personnel deployed along the border, I once again got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali.
This time, I have had an unforgettable experience in celebrating Diwali with the security forces in the Gurukul sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our security forces are protecting the country from the harsh and harsh conditions on the border and honouring all the jawans in our security forces for the sake of fighting, dedication and sacrifice.
If we get a chance, we must listen to their proud stories to understand the experiences of our soldiers.
Many of us do not know that the jawans of our security forces are playing an important role in not only establishing peace on our border but also in the world.
As UN Peacekeepers, they are bringing glory to India all over the world.
The United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world on October 24, the same day.
Everyone remembers the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace in the world and their constructive role.
We believe the VasudhaivaKutumbakam the whole world is one family.
Due to this belief, India has been actively participating in various important initiatives of the United Nations since the very beginning.
India has always given importance to gender equality and the declaration of human rights of the United Nations is a living example of this.
In its opening remarks, it was proposed that all men were born free and equal, and as a result of the efforts of Indias representative, Hansa Mehta, the phrase has been accepted as independent and egalitarian.
It seems like a very simple change, but a healthy thinking is visible in it.
United Nations Peace Missions are Indias biggest contribution to the United Nations.
India has always been active in UN peacekeeping operations.
It's the first time many of you know this.
More than 16,000 Indian security personnel have served in UN peacekeeping missions.
Now about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations and India is the third largest in the world in this regard.
Till August 27, Indian soldiers have served in nearly 50 UN peacekeeping missions in 71 UN peacekeeping missions across the world.
These missions have been spread across many countries across the globe like Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Congo and South Sudan more than 20,000 patients have been treated by the Indian Army and many have been rescued.
Indian security forces not only saved the people of different countries but also won their hearts with the help of pro-people measures.
Indian women have also played a leading role in the establishment of peace.
Many people do not know that India is the first country to send a women police force to the United Nations Peace Mission in Libya.
This step of India has become a source of inspiration for countries around the world.
After that all the countries started sending their women police teams.
You will be surprised to know that India's role is not only in peace but also in training and training of the Peace Keeping Force in about 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave pacifists brought the message of peace and harmony to the world.
The Peace Mission's actions are not simple.
The soldiers of our security forces have to pass through difficult terrains and work.
You'll have to live among different people.
It is important to know and understand different situations and different cultures.
We have to change ourselves according to the local needs and circumstances.
Today, when we remember our brave UN Peacekeepers, who would be remembered by Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria who fought for peace in Congo in Africa and sacrificed his all.
Remembering him, every Indian will be proud of him.
In 1989, at the age of seventy-two, he was commanded by Operation Force Command, Namibia and served in the country's independent institution.
The head of the Indian Army, General Timmaya led the United Nations Peace Keeping Force in Cyprus and sacrificed everything for peace.
India, as a peace loving nation, has always spread the message of peace, unity and harmony across the world.
We believe that everyone must live in peace and harmony and move forward to build a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our holy land is illuminated by the great men who have selflessly served humanity.
Sister Nivedita was one of those extraordinary people who called 'Bhagini Nivedita'.
Even though Margaret Elizabeth Noble lived in Ireland, she was known as Nivedita.
The phrase Nivedita means complete dedication.
Later, he dedicated his name to the nation and named it after him.
Yesterday was Sister Nivedita's 150th birth anniversary.
With the influence of Swami Vivekananda, she was ready to devote her life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita felt hurt in the atrocities in the British rule.
The British not only enslaved our country but they also tried to enslave us mentally.
They have been constantly striving to create a sense of despondency among us by portraying our culture and ethos.
He reiterated the pride of Indian culture, which has been enunciated by Bhagini.
Subrahmanya Bharati's 'Putamai Mahila' (New Woman) revolutionary poem is famous for women empowerment.
It is said to be an inspiration to God.
Jagdish Chandra Bose, a pioneering scientist from the time of his departure, worked in close coordination with the Indian Council of Medical Research.
They helped propagate Bose's research through articles and conferences.
India's special beauty is that spirituality and science are complementary to each other in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Jagadish Chandra Bose have been a powerful example.
Hundreds of people died in 1899 when a terrible plague broke out in Calcutta.
Sister-in-law started cleaning the sewers and tracks without treating their own health.
Sister Nivedita who left for serving the poor despite living a comfortable life.
Inspired by their sacrifices, people have come forward to cooperate in the service of others.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on the occasion of the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
Children are the greatest heroes in the making of a New India.
You are right about the fact that earlier the diseases which used to occur only for the elderly and the diseases that occurred due to the evening of life have started to appear in the children.
It is surprising to hear that children are also afflicted with diabetes.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today, these diseases are said to be lifestyle disorder.
The main reason behind occurrence of such diseases in young people is the lack of physical activity in the lifestyle, the changes in food habits and the lack of physical activity.
Society and families need to pay attention to this.
If you think about it, you'll see there's no need to do anything special.
It is only necessary to make the small things used in the right way and practice them in the right way.
Instead of the children climb up the elevator and climb up or descending, they'll get used to climbing stairs.
After dinner, the whole family will try to take the kids to work.
Yoga for Young India Yoga for Youth
I'm saying it because I'm used to saying that a person of any age can do it easily.
It is easy to learn without any effort and because it can be done anywhere, it is said that it is all good.
This is not necessary, especially for equipment and fields.
There are several studies going on in terms of how Yoga is beneficial in diabetes control.
We need to make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of our lives, rather than being a medium of therapy.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, good news has been brought about in the past few days from the playground.
In different games, our players made the country proud.
In hockey, India won the Asia Cup hockey crown by playing well.
Our players played very well and that is why India became the Asia Cup champion after 10 years.
India had earlier won the Asia Cup in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to the support staff who helped the entire team and my countrymen.
After hockey, India has also heard good news in badminton.
Badminton star Kidambi Shrikanth, with his excellent performance, honored the Indians by winning the open crown to Denmark.
After Indonesia Open and Australian Open, Super Series Premier is crowned.
I convey my best wishes to our young friends for this achievement and for boosting India's pride.
Friends, this month itself, FIFA U-17 World Cup was organised.
Teams from all over the world came to India and all of them displayed their skills in the field of football.
I had a chance to go to a game too.
There was a lot of enthusiasm for players and visitors.
The World Cup competitions were successfully held and all the teams performed their best.
India was not able to win the crown, but the young players of India took it upon themselves.
The whole world including India enjoyed the festival of sports and the tournament was an attraction and an attraction for the football lovers.
The future of football is beginning to look bright.
I once again wish all the players, all those who have worked with them and all the best wishes.
Some people send pictures of the tasks related to this, some of which are related to the collective efforts of the youth.
A team from a non-governmental organization called the Ecological Protection Organization (EPSO) set out to clean the Chandrapur Fort.
In this 200-day operation, people continued to clean up the fort as a group, without feeling tired and tired.
I was astonished to see the photographs that I would like to tell those who were frustrated when they saw the dirtiness around, whether it was sad or not, whether it was a dream of cleanliness. You can see the enthusiasm, the zeal and determination of the youth of the Ecological Protection Organization in these pictures.
If you see it, your despair will turn into confidence.
This massive effort for cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, association and nervousness.
My dear countrymen, all of us will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on the 4th of November.
By eating together and eating together, there was a feeling of oneness and equality in the minds of people.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji gave three messages for a meaningful life - , , , , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : )
Guru Nanak Dev wrote to tell him what he had to say.
In the coming year 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th birthday of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
Come, let us try to move forward on the path of his message and his teachings.
My dear countrymen, two days later, on 31st October, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We all know that he laid the foundation stone of modern Akhand Bharat.
We will be able to learn a lot by travelling in the extraordinary life of that great son of Mother India.
His skill led him to bring his thoughts into action.
SardarVallabhbhai Patel had done a bit of a task that laid the foundation of India on a single thread.
He assured them that crores of Indians should be brought under the ambit of One Nation, One Constitution.
He was able to overcome all odds and overcome all odds.
He set a goal, moved forward with determination and towards that goal.
He could have done this work of uniting the country.
Everyone was an equal nation in his dream.
I would like to say that SardarVallabhbhai Patel's words always inspires us.
These words of Sardar Saheb are still a source of inspiration and inspiration for our vision of a New India.
That is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
I urge all of you to participate in this festival of mutual harmony as well as the Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Diwali, with a new resolve and a new resolve, all of you will return to your daily lives.
I wish all the countrymen the very best in fulfilling their dreams.
It has been three years since the launch of the Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio.
Today's 30th episode.
When I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I can say a little about those who send their minds from all corners of the country, but I get plenty of treasure.
Most of them inspire me.
Some things are about bringing about reforms in government matters.
Sometimes there are individual complaints and sometimes attention is drawn to social problems.
Whenever I say Mann Ki Baat, I remember one thing that Acharya Vinoba Bhave has said.
Today, I am sure that after three years, social scientists, universities, researchers and media experts will deliberate on these issues and will highlight the gaps in each subject.
I am sure that this discussion will go a long way in making Mann Ki Baat more fruitful and give a new energy and a new momentum to it.
In Mann Ki Baat, I had said that we should not waste food as much as we need.
But letters came from all corners of the country, from social organizations, and from youth that they are doing this thing beforehand.
After that, many people have come forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Since then, Selfie with Daughter program has become a big movement not only in India but all over the world.
This is not just a matter of social media.
A new self-confidence has become a matter of great pride for every girl.
All the parents started trying to get their own daughter to get selfie.
All the girls started to feel that you have importance and importance.
The other day, I was having a discussion with the Department of Tourism...
I told the people who are going for tourism that wherever they go, they should send photos related to 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'.
Millions of photos and pictures of every corner of India, in a way, have been made available to the people working in the tourism sector.
In Mann Ki Baat, I realized how big this small event is making.
It has been three years since the events of the last three years have come to light.
The country is moving forward in the right direction.
This is a big capital for any country and a great power.
I salute the people with my heart.
Once I had talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat and said that Khadi is not a garment, but a thought process.
The interest towards Khadi is increasing in the form of domestic shawls, blankets and carpets.
Since the prices of Khadi are rising, therefore, the houses of the poor are directly linked to employment.
Since 2nd October, Khadi rebates are being paid and is getting cheaper.
This will give strength to the poor of our country, we will have to do it.
Due to increasing interest towards Khadi, the people working in the Khadi sector have been encouraged to think of new ways in terms of taxation, for the people who are associated with the Khadi and Village Industries.
How can we bring new technology, how can we increase productivity, how can we bring about solar energy
The ancient heritage has been decayed for 20, 25, 30 years... and we must think about how to revive it.
We have been involved in a variety of activities.
Many people were provided employment opportunities.
The Khadi Gramodyog department revived its training wing at Pampore in Kashmir and there was a lot of contribution from Kashmir to the sector.
The resumption of this training centre will enable the new generation to innovate and manufacture new products.
Khadi products are being offered to the common man and others as gifts.
We can feel the way things are naturally encouraged.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat last month, we had decided that for the 15 days prior to Gandhi Jayanti, we will celebrate the Swachhata Festival across the country.
It is said that they will connect with the people through cleanliness.
Our Honble President started this and the country joined it.
Today, all the people, men and women, cities and villages of the country have become a part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
I express my gratitude to the Hon'ble President.
People from all sections of the country have taken it upon themselves and everyone is connected with it.
Be it the people in sports, people in the film sector, education sector, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, government employees, police or soldiers, all these things are related to this thing.
A change has been brought about in the public places to curb the menace of illicit deposit taking activities and the workers have started putting some pressure on them.
It seems to me that in the first four days of the Swachhata Hi Seva movement, more than 75 lakh people have joined me by launching more than 40,000 initiatives.
This time we have seen one more thing that we clean a place and keep others alert and careful not to get dirty.
But if cleanliness is to be a habit then it has to become an emotional one.
This time, along with 'Swachhata Hi Seva', there have been festivals too.
More than 2.5 crore children participated in the Swachhata-related article.
Thousands of children drew colorful pictures.
When it comes to cleanliness, I do not forget to thank the media persons.
They have taken this movement forward with utmost purity.
They have joined in their own way and contributed in a big way in creating a progressive environment.
A few days ago, someone focused on the work of 18-year-old Bilal Dar from Srinagar.
On the issue of Brandy Ambassador, you will think that he will be a hero in sports.
If there is plastic, polythene, used bottles and other garbage, then the bill will be removed, thereby generating some income.
He went to other places and taught people the lessons of cleanliness, inspired them and followed them till the results were realized.
Bilal Dar is a young boy, he is an inspiration for all those who are interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must recognize that the history of the future is born from the womb of the present history, and when it comes to history, it is natural for me to remember the great men.
In the month of October, we remember many great men.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, who led us, who guided us for the 21st century, who had suffered so many hardships for the country, in the month of October this year.
It is also the centenary year of Nanaji and Deen Dayaljisa.
What was the focal point of all these great men?
There was a general saying - to live for the country and do something for the country.
Gandhiji, Jai Prakash Ji and Deen Dayal Ji showed not only the advice but the way of their life also showed that these places were far away from the corridors of power but they lived with the people and worked for them.
Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Mahatma Gandhi talked about the man who stood at the last end of the society.
Sardar Saheb brought the country together.
We have to run for unity and take the unity forward.
You can feel the diversity of India, touch it, smell it.
You can see that in the development of your personality, these diversity of our country will serve as a big lesson.
Holidays are the days of Diwali and we have the habit of traveling somewhere in the country.
Travel for tourists is natural.
But it is a matter of concern that we dont see our country, we dont know its diversity, we dont understand it, we dont know it, we dont know it, we dont want to go abroad under the influence of colour.
The people of West India do not know what is there in Eastern India.
How diverse is our country!
If you notice the words of Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam Ji, when they have gone to India, they have found a new inspiration to see, understand India, to live and die for them.
All these great men have travelled far and wide.
At the beginning of their work, they tried to know and understand India.
They tried to make India self-reliant.
As a student, can we try to convince our different states, different communities, people, their lifestyles, their traditions, their food habits to learn and understand their perspectives
The value addition to tourism is not just because we look at it, but by knowing it as a student and trying to become a part of it.
As per my experience, I would have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts of the country.
In more than 450 districts, I might have had a night stay.
Today, when I fulfill this responsibility in this India, the experience of those journeys is of great benefit to me.
I get a chance to understand things.
I appeal to you, that you have not felt the unity of diversity of India as a symbol of our great strength.
It has a dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many types of food are there ?
If you spend your whole life every day in different ways, you'll never have to.
This is the strength of our tourism sector.
Not just going out of the house during this holiday, it is important not only to get out of the house for a change but also to learn, understand and achieve something.
Within India, the diversity of crores of people is inherent.
Your life will become even more enriched by these experiences.
Your thoughts will be wide-ranging.
Who has a greater guru than experience?
Normally, the travel time from October to March is the same.
People are leaving.
I am confident that if you go this time, you will take this call forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share pictures.
Please send a photo on the subject of Hash tag IncredibleIndia.
If you are able to interact with people on the way, send pictures of it as well.
Not only the buildings, but also the beauty of nature and the life of the people there.
Write a good article about the trip.
Send to My Gov and send it to NarendraModiApp.
I believe that the seven best tourist destinations in your state, which have been identified by you, will be good enough to encourage every Indian to know about the seven places or seven things that are going on in India.
If you can, you have to go to the seven places.
Can you give me some information about it?
Make films on such good places, make videos, create publicity and encourage them - the government will approve the things you have identified.
You can also become an inspiration for promoting tourism from the month of October to the month of March.
I invite you for that.
I have a deep impact on my mind.
I'm a man like you.
You must have noticed one thing that happened the previous day, a divine example of women power and patriotism was witnessed by the people.
This is an extraordinary fact that the husbands of wealth and property have served the Mother India and have sacrificed their lives.
Can we imagine what the mood will be if we do not have life at this young age
But the wife of martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadik, who was also dedicated to this difficult environment, made a solemn pledge in her mind and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months, trained and changed his life to realise his dream.
His wife took a firm decision and joined the army.
Let us be proud of our mother power and it is natural for all people to respect these heroes.
I convey my best wishes to the two sisters.
They are inspiring and inspiring millions of people of the country.
Many greetings to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, amidst the festival of Navratri and Diwali, there is a great opportunity for our young generation.
FIFA Under-17 World Cup is taking place in our country.
I'm sure the football is all around.
People of every generation will be interested in football.
My dear countrymen, this is Navratri.
It's time for Durgabai to be worshipped.
The atmosphere is full of pure and pure perfumes.
There is an atmosphere of spirituality, festival and devotion all around.
It is believed to be the festival of Shakti Sadan.
As India completes 75 years of its independence in 2022, try to realize the dream of our freedom fighters, resolve of 1.25 billion people, tireless efforts, industriousness, resolve and prepare a five-year roadmap for achieving it, let us move forward with a strong resolve.
Thank you so many.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of PMs address in the 11th Episode of Mann Ki Baat 2.0 on 27.08.2017 My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
My heartiest greetings to my dear countrymen.
On the one hand, when the country is immersed in festivals, on the other hand, it is natural for the country to quench the reports of violence from any part of the country.
Our country is a country of Buddha and Gandhi, a country of Sardar Patel, who sacrificed his life for the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors have accepted the values of public life, non-violence and mutual respect, that is a part of our minds.
We have been talking about Ahimsa Paramodharma since childhood.
I have said from the ramparts of the Red Fort that in the name of faith, whether it is faith or political belief or faith in traditions, no violence will be allowed.
The constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar gave us has the provisions to provide justice to every person.
This country is never allowed to allow those who take the law, who walk on the path of violence, whether it is a person or a society, nor any government.
Everyone will have to bow down before the law.
The law will determine accountability and punish the guilty.
Our country is full of diversity, not just in food habits, lifestyles, dresses.
We can see diversity in every aspect of life.
Even our festivals are full of diversity.
Due to our millennia old cultural heritage, looking at cultural traditions and social traditions, even if we look at the historical events, there will be no day without a festival in 365 days.
If you look at all our festivals, you will find that there is no festival associated with the timeless nature.
Everything is directly connected to nature.
Many of our festivals are associated with farmers and are directly related to those engaged in fisheries.
Today, when I talk about festivals, first of all, I would like to tell you about 'Michami Dukadam'.
Yesterday, Samvatsari was celebrated in the Jain community.
In the community of Jains, we are celebrating 'Kutush' in Bhadra month.
The last day of the 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' is the anniversary of the celebration.
This is a truly surprising tradition.
The Samvatsari Festival is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
It is also known as the Kshamani festival and on this day there is a tradition of wishing each other a 'Michami Dokadam'.
In our sciences, 'forgiveness, bravery,' i.e., the land of the patient.
The one who forgives is a hero.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say: Forgiveness is the specialty of a strong person.
Referring to the importance of patience in the Marchant of Venice written by Shakespeare, he wrote: 'Mercises is a tyves Blessed, It Blust Him that is a merciful and forgiving one gets the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, this is the time when Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in every corner of India.
Ganesh Chaturthi marks the culmination of ten days.
This festival is also a symbol of unity, equality and cleanliness.
Greetings to all fellow citizens on the auspicious occasion of Ganesh Festival.
It is a time of celebration in Kerala.
One of the colourful festivals of India, Onam is Kerala's main festival.
It is socially and culturally important.
Onam reflects the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival not only conveys the message of love and harmony in the society but also instills a new spirit, a new hope and a new faith in the minds of people.
Now this festival is becoming a part of the celebration of festivals.
Navaratri festival in Gujarat and Durga Puja festival in Bengal have become an attraction in a way.
Our festivals are such an opportunity to attract foreigners.
Let's think about what we can do about this.
A few days later, Idul uha will also be celebrated.
While festivals are a symbol of devotion and faith, we have to make them a symbol of cleanliness in a new India.
My dear countrymen, the definition of being modern is changing.
Various kinds of tests are being carried out in every family.
Look at how big the change is, how happy the change is.
As I said, the entire country is full of intellectual awakening.
I'm glad to know about someone's new invention.
It is said that an engineer has collected some special kind of soil and mixed it and therefore he has been trained to create a Ganesha idol.
In a small pot of water, it melts into the water.
He didn't stop this much.
It will be three years before the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission and the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission on 2nd October.
The results are already visible.
The percentage of toilets was 39 and now it is 67.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have been declared Open Defecation Free.
Many people have lost their lives.
But after the floods, when the water came out, garbage was spread all over the place.
We can create an environment of cleanliness throughout the country.
After the construction of the toilet, you can name your own name and the name of the family you helped on the portal.
In this, you can write articles in different languages and there is no age limit.
You can make short films on your own mobile.
We can make a 2-3-minute short film that inspires cleanliness.
In any language, it can be a silent picture.
Make yourself a partner in this.
You can see how bright this October 2, which is the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti.
After 15 days of this filthiness, let us think about how pious we can feel when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October and pay homage to the venerable Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today, I would like to express my special commitment to you.
I look forward to your message with as much enthusiasm as you wait for Mann Ki Baat.
I am eagerly waiting for everything that you say gives me an opportunity to learn.
There's a chance to change what I do.
Several things of yours are useful to me to think from a new perspective.
'Prime Minister, I'm talking to you from Pune.
Once I went to the mall with her for shopping.
She spent two thousand rupees for a sari, and spent 450 rupees for a pizza.
But the driver of the auto driver who was going to the mall was argued for Rs. 5.
On return, he bought vegetables on his way and on his name, he saved the premium of Rs 4-5.
I felt so bad.
We pay the money in big places without questioning the price, but we also argue for a few rupees with our brothers and sisters who depend on us.
I don't believe them.
You must talk about it in Mann Ki Baat.
Madam, I am grateful to you all for sending a great message through this heart-breaking phone call.
I am sure that if my people too have this habit of treating the poor, they will definitely give up.
My dear young friends, 29th August is celebrated across the country as Sports Day.
This is the birthday of the great hockey player, Major Dhyan Chand, who has done magic in hockey.
His contribution to hockey was unwavering.
I am saying this because the young generation of our country wants to connect with sports.
Games should be part of our lives.
If we think that our country is a young country in the world then we should see our children in sports as well.
Sports is called physical fitness, mental alertness, personality enhancement.
What more do you want?
Sports is, in a way, an important medicine for the unity of mind.
Youth Affairs and Sports Ministry has developed Sports Talent Search Portal to identify and nurture talent.
Any child from across the country who has made any impact in the field of sports can upload the video and if he wants to have his own personal identity (Biodeta).
The portal will be uploaded tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports for selecting budding sports persons.
I am happy to inform the youth that FIFA U-17 World Cup is going to take place in India from 6th to 18th October.
24 teams from all over the world are going to make India their home.
The enthusiasm and zeal of the six girls working in the Navy inspires us all.
These six girls left for the ocean in a small boat called INS Tarini.
It is known as Navika Sagar Parikrama.
They will return to India after a gap of several months across the world.
This is the first time in the world that these six children travel boldly in the midst of waves in the sea.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to these girls.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we also celebrate Teachers Day.
He was the President.
But he told himself to be a teacher.
He was a scholar, a diplomat, he lived as the President of India, but in every sense he was an enthusiastic teacher.
I salute him.
The great scientist, Albert Einstein said that this is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken my in creative expression and knowledge i.e., one of the greatest qualities of a teacher is the joy of creation and knowledge among his students.
Can we make a pledge this time when we celebrate Teachers Day
Can we organize a movement like a mission?
Teach to transform, due to power, honey to end change, teach to strengthen and learn to lead.
Can we take this mission forward with this resolve
Let everyone make a pledge for 5 years and show the way to achieve it and feel happy to succeed in life by achieving it in five years.
To this end, create an environment for our schools, our colleges, our teachers and our educational institutions.
When we talk of change in our country, we remember a teacher in society as we remember a mother in our family.
Teachers have a great role to play in transforming.
There must have been an incident in the lives of all the teachers that helped to bring about a change in the lives of one person through their hard work.
If we work together, we can play a big role in transforming the nation.
Go ahead with the mantra to teach for change.
Greetings to the Prime Minister.
My name is Dr. Annya.
I live in Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre at Harvard University.
As a researcher, I am particularly interested in the scheme of financial inclusion and related social projects.
I would like to ask whether you can say that after three years of this Jan Dhan Yojana, which was launched in 2014, India is economically more secure and more powerful than it is capable of providing the facilities and facilities to our women, farmers, workers, villages and slums
It was launched on 28th August, 2014 with a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, 28th August, 2020 will mark the completion of three years of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
Bank accounts have been opened for 30 crore new families.
It is more than the total population of many countries of the world.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, our poor have deposited nearly Rs 60,500 crore in banks.
With the help of Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, with a nominal premium of Rs. 1 or Rs.
When that poor person suffered the loss of life due to a poor family, some families got Rs. 2 lakh in a few days due to insurance of one rupee.
I have seen hundreds of examples of how a project has transformed the life of a person, how it fills new energy and how it fills new faith.
They can motivate the new generation through interviews with such people.
My dear countrymen, I once again wish you the very best, on the auspicious occasion of Miracle.
Thank you so much.
It is a specialty of the human mind that the rainy season attracts the mind a lot.
The changing climate and the environment result in very adverse conditions.
In the last few days, in some parts of India, especially in Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal, people have been facing difficulties due to this year.
State Governments are also making efforts to provide assistance to those affected by floods in their own way.
Citizens working with social organizations, cultural organizations and service spirit are doing their best to help the people in this environment.
Army, Air Force, NDRF, Para Military Forces etc., on behalf of the Government of India are putting their lives at stake to help the flood victims.
People's lives are getting worse due to the flood.
The NDRF team was deployed.
Climate warnings are almost accurate due to technological advancements and advancements in atmospheric science and the need to be used for risk-taking, training on dos and donts, sensitization of volunteers, crowd management, etc.
If we gradually change the course of our actions according to climate change, we will be able to prevent major disasters.
When I am preparing for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country are preparing for it as much as I can.
I heard your address on Chartered Accountants Day, which impressed me so much.
Similarly, Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced on this day last month.
I am very happy to note that in the North East, in the remote hilly areas, in the forest areas, a person who lives in the forest areas, was afraid of the correct address and now he has started to understand the facts.
It is seen how much time has been reduced to reach from one place to another and how much time has been spent on highways.
The speed of the trucks has reduced pollution.
Goods are fast reaching targets.
The speed with which this change has been made, the speed with which this change has been made, the speed with which new registrations have been done, the whole country has developed a new faith.
Once again, I am confident that financial experts, management experts and technologists will come up with a model of research on Indias implementation of GST and write the paper.
A case study will be created for all the universities in the world.
Because such a massive change, with the participation of crores of people in such a big country, we have been able to successfully implement it at the peak of success.
The world will learn about it.
All States have a role to play in the implementation of GST and all the States have a responsibility.
All decisions and decisions were taken by the States and the Central Government together.
How big a dream One Nation - One Tax has come true
I have seen in the matter of GST how the officers worked with dedication and dedication from the village to the centre, how a cordial atmosphere was created between the government and the traders, between the government and the consumers, and how they played an important role in increasing their trust.
I heartily congratulate all the Ministries, all the departments and all the officers of the Central and State Governments involved in this work.
GST is a perfect example of the success of India's social power.
It's a history.
In a way, it is an initiative of social reform.
I once again salute the crores of Indians who have made such a great effort to succeed.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of revolution.
On August 15, 1947, the country was free.
In the month of August, several incidents related to the freedom struggle are associated with it.
This year we are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
Our new generation must know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, people came together with the struggle for independence and suffered hardships.
The essence of history inspires us to build a magnificent India.
The people of India united against the British rule.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians were engaged in the struggle with the mantra of Do or Die.
Lakhs of youngsters across the country have come forward to pursue their studies.
They got out of the way when they heard the sound of freedom.
While on 9th August, Mahatma Gandhi had given a clarion call for Bharat Chhodo, the British Government had put all the great leaders in jail, at that time, the second generation-led Dr.
Many great men like Lohia and Jay Prakash Narayan were leading the battle.
There was a lot of enthusiasm behind this success there was a talent of the people, there was a determination of the people and there was a struggle of the people.
This effort, which took place from 1857 to 1942, reached its climax in 1942.
In 1947, the uit India Movement had started in 1947.
I'd like to connect you with its mathematics.
We got freedom in 1947.
Today is 2017.
About 70 years.
Governments are gone.
Success.
Expectations are up.
From 1942 to 1947, it was a crucial year to make a resolve.
From 2017 to 2022, five years have come before us to achieve our goals with determination.The 15th of August, 2017 will be celebrated as a day of resolve.
May there be crores of resolves.
We will try to fulfil crores of resolutions.
We have to make a pledge on that.
2017 should be the year of our dream.
This will be a part of the resolution of the month of August.
Today, it is not necessary to work or die, rather it is to work with the vision of a New India, to work with the mind and the body to achieve success.
Any decision that can be made in the next five years has to be taken.
Social dialogue can be organized for youth organizations, student organizations, NGOs etc.
Let us bring forth new ideas.
Where do we want to be a nation?
What will be my contribution as a person?
Using technology, come up with videos, post, blogs, articles and new ideas.
Make this goal a mass movement.
The Prime Minister said that the launch of uality uiz is also going to be done on the Narendra Modi App.
This problem is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to introduce them to the freedom fighters.
You must spread this message to the people.
This time also, I invite you to share your views on MyGov App or on the Narendra Modi App.
I will read it myself and try to talk about it as long as it is available on August 15.
I'd like to finish it in 40-45-50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I would like to say one more thing today.
There is a socio-economic science in India's economy.
We must never underestimate it.
Our festivals and festivals are not just occasions for happiness.
Our festivals and celebrations are an effort of social reform.
They connect the individual and the society.
Thousands of workers like Rakhi makers, Rakhi sellers, sweets sellers, etc. are associated with this festival.
This is why the families of our dear brothers and sisters live.
We light lamps on Diwali, it is not just a festival of lights, it is a celebration, it is not just a celebration, it is a celebration, it is a celebration, it is a celebration, it is a celebration, it is a celebration, it is a celebration.
It is directly related to the poor families who make earthen lamps.
But today when I talk about festivals and the economic condition of the poor associated with them, I would like to talk about the environment as well.
When I see that the people of this country are more aware than I am, and more active, then I think.
Over the last one month, alert citizens have written to me about the environment.
They requested that the Ganesh Chaturthi marks the birth of Lord Ganesha, who has given us an opportunity to turn it into an eco-friendly Ganesh festival.
I'm grateful to the alert citizens.
This time I'm saying this in advance.
I'm sure you'll be with me in this case.
This will help the artisans and poor artists to build idols, which will provide employment to them.
The sweat of the poor will be filled.
Come, let us connect our festivals with the poor, connect them with the economic status of the poor, let us make the happiness of our celebrations an economic festival of the poor, let us try this thing.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly watching the educational sector of the country, the economic sector, social sector, the sports sector, the daughters of our country excelling in the field of education.
We, the people of this country are proud of our daughters.
The day before yesterday, our daughters and sisters have performed wonders in the World Cup.
There was pressure, tension on their faces.
I've judged things differently in the conversation.
I said, look, there is a lot of hope in this era of the media.
Whether you win or not, you have won the hearts of 1.25 billion people.
The young generation of the country, especially our daughters, are really doing a lot of work to increase the glory of our country.
I once again heartily congratulate the younger generation of the country, especially our daughters and convey my best wishes to them.
My dear countrymen, I once again remind you of the August Revolution, the 9th of August reminds us of it again and again.
The year 2022 also marks the 75th anniversary of independence.
Let all the countrymen resolve, let all the countrymen prepare plans for 5 years to dream.
We have to take the country to new heights, take it, get it.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
Let us move forward with the belief that the future of the country will be bright.
The weather is changing.
Rainfall at many parts of the country has made the weather pleasant.
Heat wave conditions in the past few days have provided relief in the heat wave conditions.
Regardless of the busyness of life, whether in life or in public life, the onset of monsoon changes our mentality.
Today, Lord Jagannath's Rath Yatra is being celebrated in many parts of the country with great respect and happiness.
Now, in many parts of the world, Lord Jagannath's Rathotsav is being celebrated.
Those who have learnt the teachings of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, may be aware of the fact that he praised the temple of Lord Jagannath and the traditions of that place because they include social justice and social equality.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
In English, a word called 'Ggarnet' must be known to a very few people, which means that no one can stop it.
If you look at the meaning of this Jagannath ji, then this word is derived from Lord Jagannath ji's chariot.
From this, we can understand how the world has given importance to Jagannath's Rath Yatra in its own way.
The holy month of Ramzan was celebrated with reverence and reverence.
Now Eid is here.
On the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, greetings to all.
The month of Ramzan is a month of holy charity, a month of sharing happiness.
In this holy month of Ramzan, I came to know of a inspiring incident at Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
The families of our Muslim brothers and sisters who have come here for nearly 3500 years, live in that small village, in a way the brothers and sisters of the Muslim family, who are present here in large numbers.
On this occasion, the villagers have decided to come together to build a toilet.
These 17 lakh rupees will be spent on the other needs of the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for making this holy occasion of Ramzan an opportunity for the good of the society.
Each of their actions inspires a lot.
The most important thing is that they have made Mubarakpur open defecation free.
Three states of our country - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala - were already declared as Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana were also declared this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration, authorities and the general public of these five states.
That's what changes the habit of the body and mind.
That's the same thing about cleanliness.
Some bad habits are part of our nature.
I noticed a very good thing the other day and I'd like to tell you that.
This is happening in the Vijaynagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
What was the target?
In 100 hours, 10,000 toilets will be constructed in 71 Gram Panchayats.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to learn that the common man and the government have successfully completed 10000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages have become Open Defecation Free.
In-Lum, letters and the Akashwani way.
Shri Prakash Tripathi, while recalling the times of Emergency, wrote the 25th of June as a reminder of the period in the history of democracy.
This awareness of democracy is commendable.
Democracy is not just a system, it is also a culture.
The Prime Minister said that the nation is proud of its accomplishments, and is proud of its accomplishments.
There is a need for constant awareness about democracy, so we need to remember the things that affect democracy.
And then move forward in the direction of the good things of democracy.
June 25, 1975, was the night of an unforgivable democratic belief.
In a way, the government has been making the country a lover.
They beat the voices of protest.
President's Secretariat PRESS COMMUNIUE The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, passed away at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (October 3, 2018).
The judicial system has not been able to escape the terrible shadow of an emergency.
They've made the press completely useless.
Todays journalistic field students and those associated with democracy are constantly trying to increase the awareness of the people towards democracy by re-emphasizing the timeless period.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
A year after declaring an emergency, Atal ji had written a poem, describing it as the mind-set of those times.
My dear countrymen, today every Indian is proud to receive his head all over the world.
The 21st of June, 2017 has been jointly organized by the Government of India.
People from the sea to the mountains welcomed the sun's rays early in the morning and performed yoga.
There should be no Indian who doesnt feel proud of it.
He said that Yoga was not there before, but when it came to the mainstream of Yoga, Yoga became an inseparable part of the world.
Most of the countries in the world have made Yoga Day an opportunity.
In China, people practiced yoga at a height of 2400 metres above the sea level in the world heritage site of Machu - Pashuli in Peru.
People in France performed yoga under the shade of the Eiffel Tower.
The event was held at 70 places in a small country like Singapore and a week-long event was organized.
10 stamps on International Yoga Day were released by United Nations General Assembly.
Yoga Sessions with Yoga Masters were organized at the United Nations Headquarters.
It was attended by officials from the United Nations, and diplomats from all over the world.
This time, Yoga has once again made the world record.
Around 50,000 people in Ahmedabad, Gujarat have together made Yoga a new world record.
In Lucknow, I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme.
Our Armed Forces, BSF, ITBP, CRPF, CISF, all are engaged in Yoga and other activities along with their duties.
Some TV channels also broadcast it.
Honble Prime Minister has also mentioned in Kerala recently, that instead of giving gifts to books at different places, good books should be given as a memorable gift.
It started in your rule in Gujarat, but in the recent past, the use of buns is more visible.
Can't you do anything?
Can't you do anything in the country to implement the book instead of the book?
It was also said that Khadi should be hand-in-hand to promote Khadi.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this program continued, but after leaving, that habit had disappeared.
But in this programme in Kerala, I was once again conscious of this.
Now a notification has been issued in this regard.
Let's gradually make it a habit.
Buffalo's life is too short.
After getting it in hand, you're leaving.
Even if we welcome Khadis her hand, it will benefit many poor families.
The cost will be low and it will be useful in the right way.
It has been several years, but the Cales given by Mahatma Gandhi have been preserved by ueen Elizabeth.
There are lots of letters, people send letters.
I read a letter the other day, and I think I should tell you about it.
In the south of Tamil Nadu, a family from Madurai sent me a letter.
You want to know what that letter was.
Keeping in mind the education of the children, we thought of some financial inclusion, some financial assistance for the family.
For this, I took loans from the bank under the Mudra scheme and started the work of supplying some goods from the market.
This means that the government departments will look after the registration on e-mail.
They've written to me that it's very interesting.
They say, "I have received money under the Mudra scheme, I have listed what can be given to me in business, e-Jam, I have received orders from the Prime Ministers Office, from the PMO.
'It was a new news for me too.
They mentioned about what they had purchased in the PMO - two thermos, and 1600 rupees.
This is empowerment.
This is an opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
It has transparency and empowerment, it has industrial entrepreneurship.
Government e-Marketplace- GeM.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga, and on the other hand we are proud of the talent that we have in space science.
Today, India is not only on earth but also in the environment.
Two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Nano satellites along with the Cartosat-2 series satellite.
These satellites were not only of India but also of 15 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
This Nano-satellite initiative of India will help in the field of agriculture, farming and natural resources.
We will remember that just a few days ago, ISRO successfully launched the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) GSAT-19.
This was the heaviest satellite ever launched by India.
The newspapers in our country compared it to the weight of an elephant.
From this, we can only imagine what our scientists have done in the field of space.
On 19th June, thousands of days of the Mangalyaan Mission were completed.
When we successfully realized the mission, this mission was targeted for 6 months.
Recently, India's badminton player Kidwai Shrikanth Indonesia has enhanced the pride of the country by winning the Open.
T.
We had the opportunity to connect with Usha School of Athletics at the inauguration of the synthetic track.
The more we connect with sports, the more sportsman spirit it increases.
Sports play a very important role in personality development.
The importance of sports in holistic personality development is immense.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If our family and children are interested in sports, they should be encouraged.
We all have to dream for the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season and the continuous festive season, together this time, is a new experience.
I once again convey my best wishes to all of you and in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I wish you all the very best.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of PMs address in the 11th Episode of Mann Ki Baat 2.0 on 28.05.2017 My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan is beginning.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramazan, I convey my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and the world, especially the Muslim community.
In Ramzan, prayers, charity, charity etc are very important.
Ours is a country where those who believe in God, those who deny God, those who worship idols, those who oppose idolatry, are living.
All ideologies, all forms of worship, all types of traditions, all forms of tradition, all form of art of living together.
The message of religion, caste, creed, sect and traditions to all of us is a message of peace and harmony.
This holy month of Ramazan will help us to move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony.
I once again wish you the very best.
I am very happy that a lot of people have come to know about me.
I was very excited to tell you what you wanted to say to me.
We didn't read everything, we didn't hear everyone's messages, we got so much information.
But I was watching it all together some tried to learn music some tried to learn new words some tried to learn new things and some tried to learn new languages through YouTube.
I'm so glad a phone call wants to listen to you.
I'm speaking with the Diksha knife.
I've left my reading habit.
But during this holiday, I decided to read something.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized that how many freedom fighters had to struggle for independence and how many sacrifices were required and how many freedom fighters had spent years in prison.
I take inspiration from Bhagat Singh, who had suffered a lot of sacrifice at a young age.
Therefore, I request you to send a message to the new generation on this subject.
I am glad that the new generation wants to tell our history, our freedom fighters and people who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Several great men sacrificed their youth in prisons.
During the freedom struggle, the great men who had been in prisons had done a lot of work on the basis of literature.
Their valour became the strength of India's freedom struggle.
Years ago, I once visited Andaman Nicobar.
He went to see the Cellular Jail.
This is the birth anniversary of the brave Emperor.
The brave-hearts wrote a book, 'Maesi Janathe' at the jail.
The poems were written on the prison wall.
He was locked in a small cell.
A 'light and sound show' that is being held there is a great inspiration.
People from all the states of India, who speak all the languages, spent their entire life in this Cellular Jail in Andaman, observing Kala Pani.
My dear countrymen, June is the first Monday of 5 months.
What's the connection with nature?
Connecting with nature is to take care of a good land.
Where is it better than Mahatma Gandhi's words?
Mahatma Gandhi had often said that we need to take care of the unknown world and we need to take care of it. That is, we need to think of the invisible world as well.
Nature has a power...
You must have experienced that when you get tired, pour a glass of water on your face.
When we are tired, when we open the doors of the house, when we breathe in the wind, we feel a new energy.
When we come in contact with these five elements within our body, a new energy and a new energy is created in our body.
We've experienced all this, but we don't take care of it, we don't take it in a thread.
When you come in contact with nature, you must remember that there is no new spirit inside you.
Therefore, June 5th, the global movement to connect with nature must be a movement for each one of us.
We feel the virtues of protecting the environment of our ancestors.
If we protect the environment, it will benefit the future generations.
The Artha Veda is one of the greatest guiding principles of environment, written thousands of years ago.
Mother Earth is said to be the Son of God.
It is said in the scriptures that 'Nirmalam' in us is the source of our planet.
The Earth is our mother, our children.
In our country, many festivals, many cultivators are associated with the environment.
The love for nature is a part of social life, whether it is educated, uneducated, urban poor, rural communities, tribal communities, or the love for nature.
We need to look at it with new words and describe it as a new justification.
There are some interesting news stories from the states.
In most of the states, there is a big initiative in the field of tree cover since the rainy season has started.
Millions of trees are planting.
Schools and social organizations, NGOs and Governments are leading the way.
This time too, we have to encourage woodworker, give our contribution in that too, my dear countrymen.
21st June is a special day for all over the world.
This day is celebrated as World Yoga Day.
In a short span of time, the name of 'Yoga Day' has reached every corner of the world and has connected people with each other.
On the one hand, many disruptive and disruptive forces of the world are distorted, when India is a great contributor to the world.
Through Yoga, the world is getting integrated with the framework.
Just as the body connects mind, intelligence and soul, today Yoga unites the world with one another.
Two days ago, on the occasion of Yoga, I wrote letters to all the government and leaders of the world.
Last year, I had announced some competitions related to Yoga and some awards.
Some steps have been taken in that regard.
I got some suggestions about this and I congratulate those who have sent these suggestions.
We've got a very interesting ending.
Grandpa, grandma or grandma, parents, parents, parents, men and women will meet together and upload the picture.
This session of yesterday and tomorrow will be an opportunity to give a new dimension to Yoga.
This film will be yesterday, today, tomorrow, and it will be a pleasant tomorrow promise.
I invite you all.
There's still about three weeks left to be a World Day.
This is in a way a healthcare scheme.
I invite everyone to be part of this.
When you entrusted me with the responsibility of being the Chief Servant, I got the opportunity to talk to the Red Fort in Delhi for the first time on 15th August and I talked about cleanliness.
Since then, I have visited various parts of India today.
What is Modi doing, where is Modi going?
I am grateful to him for this kind gesture.
You'll understand the phone call.
Prime Minister, I am speaking Naina from Mumbai.
Modi ji, wherever you go, I regularly see that people are paying special attention to cleanliness in TV and social media.
Be it in Mumbai or in Surat, on your call, people have collectively taken up cleanliness as a mission.
Not only the elderly, but the children are also awake to cleanliness.
There are many places where children are found to be guilty of dirtiness.
A few days ago, I visited Kutch in Gujarat.
What is a matter of greater happiness than that cleanliness is also connected with my journey
It may be the habit of making all the preparations to welcome the Prime Minister, but now cleanliness is a big thing.
It is a pleasure and inspiration to anyone who wants cleanliness.
Modi ji, when you decide your journey, ask those who invite you, what level of cleanliness will be there when you invite me
I'll decide whether or not I'll come and see how many tons of garbage you offer to me.
The idea is very good, but I'll have to think.
Instead of giving gifts, it is said that we will clean up such garbage and make it an initiative.
Many people can be saved from the disease.
What a great humanitarian thing.
Behold these wastes as wealth and as a source of wealth without regard to waste.
Don't look at it as dirt.
If we look at these garbage dumps as wealth then new methods of waste management will come up before us.
Young people associated with start-ups will also come up with new schemes and come up with new tools.
The Government of India, in collaboration with the State Governments, is determined to set up a major initiative in the field of cleanliness and sanitation with the help of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).
On World Environment Day, June 5th, around 4,000 cities across the country are going to have a pool of resources to collect waste and liquid waste.
There are two kinds of garbage, one green and the other blue.
Cooking waste, vegetable skins, food wastes, eggs, leaves, etc., are liquid wastes to be stored in green nests.
It's all useful in the field, and I remember what to do with green grass, when the land is fertile.
The second is for paperless vessels, metal articles, glasses, clothes, plastics, polythene, broken dubs, rubber goods, etc. which are a type of dry waste.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has entrusted the responsibility of the World Health Organization (WHO) to the World Health Organization (WCO).
Brothers and sisters, Today I would like to tell you something very happy that in relation to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, I have been informed that the Reasi block in Jammu and Kashmir has been declared open defecation free.
I congratulate all the people of Riyasi Block and the rulers there.
I congratulate the mothers and sisters there.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, the survey is being conducted in all the sections of the society, whether in newspapers or on TV or on social media.
Three years ago, you entrusted me with the responsibility of being the main servant.
A lot of surveys have been conducted and a lot of opinion polls have been conducted.
I see all this in a very healthy way.
We've tried to change this three-year work in every way.
People from all walks of life have analyzed this.
This is a very good way of democracy.
Governments should be responsible for democracy and people should be given account of their actions.
I thank those who gave different, great opinions.
Creative criticism strengthens democracy.
A nation that awakens, a vibrant nation needs this assessment.
My dear countrymen, I am an ordinary citizen like you and as an ordinary citizen, the impact of all good and bad things is there in me as an ordinary citizen.
As I said, the impact on my mind as an ordinary citizen is important.
Two days ago, in Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Honourable President, Honble Vice President, Honble Speaker Madam, a book on Mann Ki Baat was released in which, as a person, it is a matter of great enthusiasm as a common citizen.
I am grateful to the President, the Vice President and the Speaker Madam, for finding out the time and giving importance to Mann Ki Baat, and for giving it an exalted status.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given a new dimension to it.
Some friends had also discussed with me during the course of the book on Mankind's birth anniversary.
He said that he would like to sketch up all the issues that he discussed in Mann Ki Baat, and to express his love without paying a single rupee.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, the next time when Mann Ki Baat has been announced, the entire country is covered with rains, the weather has changed, the results of the exams come, the new life is about to begin.
In this situation, let us move forward by expressing our love for nature.
My best wishes to all of you.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of PMs address in the 11th Episode of Mann Ki Baat 2.0 on 30.04.2017 My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Namaskar to my dear countrymen.
The curiosity of children, the ambitions of the youth, the experiences of the elders, and so on.
Generally seeing others is the nature of people.
On the train, on the bus, when someone gets coughing, the man who's nearby says, "Let's do this."
Advising and suggesting is in our nature.
At first, when suggestions were received regarding Mann Ki Baat, when they heard the voice of advice, when they got something to learn, their team always felt that it was a habit for many people to send it.
But when we tried to analyze it closely, the truth was filled with the mind.
They do more than those who speak, and those who try to come to me, and really do something.
They are engaged in the work of their intelligence, their strength and their ability to work in harmony with the environment.
When this matter came to my notice, I thought these instructions were extraordinary.
Last time, in Mann Ki Baat, I had expressed concern about wasting food.
This is an example of how things are being done with the cooperation of the society.
This is the end of April and this is the last day.
May 1 is the founding day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
On this occasion, my best wishes to the people of both the states.
Nature and all rules of sports have been changed.
The heat in May-June in our country had to be felt in March this year itself.
Many people have sent their suggestions on what to do during this summer while receiving feedback from people about Mann Ki Baat.
Everything is public, not new, but it will be very useful to repeat it at the right time.
Many friends like Karthik and others are concerned about the birds.
They said that water should be kept in a bowl on balcony and terrace.
In the family, small children are seen to be very enthusiastic about this.
If they ever notice why they need water, they'll go and check if they put a bowl and there's water in it ten times a day.
Watch out if the birds are coming.
We think this is a game, but in reality it is a good experience to awaken the mind of the child.
He lived till he was 103.
On the occasion of his 100th birth anniversary, the Bohra community has taken a big step to protect the demons through the Burhani Foundation.
I got a chance to start it.
They distributed nearly 50,000 meals to the people all over the world.
They got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Many times when the newspaper makers, milk producers, vegetable vendors and post-manu are reaching the door of the house, we forget to ask them whether they want water or not.
Young friends, I would like to tell you something.
Many of our young generation are happy to live in a very comfortable condition.
Parents feed them with safety.
However, I would like to tell you as a friend of yours how your vacation will be.
New places, new experiences, new skills...
Sometimes you watch something on TV, or you read it in a book, or you listen to it from your acquaintances... and you feel the same thing yourself.
Let's go out of the comforts, let's do the test, let's go.
We're from a middle-aged family, happy family.
You will find that you never had the joy of playing in life.
Have you ever thought how big a change would come about in the lives of such children in the society when they get the opportunity to play with you
This experience will teach you many things.
Go to the forest.
Sometimes summers are organized, and personality development camps are organized.
We are engaged in several development projects.
Everyone will be busy with their world because of technology.
Social life is a culture, it is a power.
Another thing I said about skill, you want to learn something new.
It's a time of competition.
There will be hard work to buy as many high marks as possible, during holidays, any coaching will go to class, and next exam will be worrying.
But keep in mind, whether the inner man is removed from the evils of humanity.
Can we pay more attention to skill development
Get away from technology and spend some time with you.
Learn a musical instrument, learn about 5-50 sentences of a new language Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi, Hindi and English.
Try to learn something you don't know, you must be doing something good.
New places, new cities, new villages...
But wherever you go, look like a curious person, understand, discuss with people, ask them... it's a different pleasure to see them.
Try and fix the place yourself.
Don't waste too much time on the journey.
Go to one place and spend three to four days there.
Then he went somewhere and lived there for three to four days.
It's gonna teach a lot of things.
Share the pictures where you're going.
Share your experiences with India through Hashtag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Indian government has also given you a good opportunity.
The new generation has almost come out of the routine.
They don't need money notes.
They are beginning to believe in digital transactions.
You can do this too. Have you ever thought of making money out of it
There is a scheme of the Government of India.
You must have downloaded the BHIM App.
Ten rupees will be deposited in your account from the government.
If you add 20 people in a day, you can earn 200 rupees by the time it's late.
Merchants and students can earn through it.
The project is scheduled to be completed by 14th October 2018.
You have a role to play in building a Digital India.
You will be a guardian of New India.
Holidays on holidays and an opportunity to earn money.
Digital introduction and earning.
Usually there is an atmosphere of hatred towards VIP culture in our country.
However, now I have come to know that it is so deep that no matter how big a person in the country, the government has decided that he will not travel by vehicle with a red light.
In a way, it became a symbol of VIP culture.
The experience shows that while the red light is in the vehicle, it enters the minds of people and intelligently forms the VIP culture.
Now the red light is gone, so no one can claim that the red light on the head has gone.
A very interesting phone call has been received.
I understood people were worried about the red light.
The government wants to talk about banning red beacon light.
I read in the newspaper, every Indian is a VIP in line.
I was so proud of it.
Thank you for that.
Instead of VIP, it means Every Person is Important, Everyone is important.
Let's work together.
My dear countrymen, I always wish to remember our history, our culture and our traditions again and again.
It will give us energy and inspiration.
This year, we are marking the 100th birth anniversary of the 1.25 billion Indians, Ram Anusandhan.
We've been engaged in other things just as we remember them for centuries.
Centenary is very important for other countries of the world.
By way of self-discipline, society moved away from those who considered it untouchables.
A thousand years ago, he made a strike to enter the temple and successfully entered the temple.
How fortunate are we to have created great men in our society in every era to eradicate the evils of our society.
On the occasion of the 100th birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya, we can draw inspiration from the idea of strength in mobilizing social unity.
The Government of India will release a stamp on the memory of Swami Ramanujacharya on 1st May 2020.
I bow to Swami Ramanujacharya and pay tributes to him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, 1st May is also an important one.
Very few people know that today we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the benefits and dignity of the workers.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is memorable.
Today, while talking about Baba Saheb and Ramanujacharya, I am reminded of the great Karnataka Sannyasin of the 12th century and Jagat Guru Basaveshwara, the social reformer.
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to attend a function.
I had the opportunity to release his speeches.
In the 12th century, in Kannada, he has deeply touched upon teaching and learning.
In Kannada, he said Kayakave Kailas.
This means that through your hard work, you can reach the shrine of Lord Shiva in Kailasha.
I mean, by doing so, you can earn heaven.
I often call it Shramevev Jayate.
I often remember the words of DatappanthThangdeji, the founder and thinker of the Indian Muslim League, about the importance of employment.
Today, when we talk about the workers, it is natural to remember Dattopant Tengadi.
My dear countrymen, a few days later, we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People from all over the world will celebrate Lord Buddha.
The life of Ashoka in India is an excellent example of his journey from the war to Buddha.
It is my good fortune that on this great festival of Buddha Purnima, the United Nations is celebrating Vesak Day.
This time it's going on in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will get the opportunity to pay tributes to Buddha in Sri Lanka.
We will get an opportunity to renew his memories.
My dear countrymen, in India, an effort has been made to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas is not only in India but also in the global context.
Especially for our neighbouring countries.
India South Asia Satellite will be launched on 5th May.
The capacity and associated facilities of the satellite will help meet the economic and developmental priorities of South Asia.
It will be helpful in designing natural resources, in the field of tele-medicine, in the field of education, or in the connectivity of deeper technology or in the field of people-to-people contact.
This is an important step by India for enhancing cooperation with the entire South Asia.
An invaluable gift.
This is a great example of our commitment to South Asia.
26th March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
A historic fight against injustice, a tremendous victory for the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
Today, on this great day, I wish all the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh the very best on the occasion of Independence Day.
Rabindranath Tagore- His memories are traditional to all of us.
The National Anthem of Bangladesh was also composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
One of the most interesting things about Gurudev Tagore was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913 but he was also given the title of Knighthood by the British.
In 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among the great men who had fought a revolt when the British massacred in the Jallianwala Bagh.
It was an incident that deeply impressed the mind of a child aged 12 years.
The boy who had been laughing at fields and playgrounds as a kid made a new inspiration in the life of the cruel massacre of Jallianwala Bagh.
The boy, who was 12 years old in 1919, is a favourite of all of us, the inspiration of all of us, Shahid Bhagat Singh.
On 23rd March, Bhagat Singh and his friends Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British.
We know that even at the time of death, it was a pleasure to serve Bharat Mata on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
All the dreams of life were dedicated to the freedom of India.
These three heroes are inspiring all of us today.
We cannot describe the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru through words.
The three of them were afraid of the British Empire.
The British were in jail, their weights were fixed, but the British were thinking about what was going on.
That's why, on March 24, they were sentenced to death on March 23.
They did it without anyone knowing it extraordinary.
Later, his body was brought to Punjab and burned by the British without any knowledge.
When I got the opportunity to go there for the first time a few years ago, I felt a special kind of vibration in that land.
I will certainly tell the youth of the country that if they get a chance, if they go to Punjab then they will definitely go to the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
It was a period when freedom fighter and its intensity were rising.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the youth of the armed revolution.
In India's freedom struggle, Gandhiji's thoughts and his style were visible in Champaran.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave a new inspiration to the country.
We cannot judge the satyagraha of Champaran based on the image that Mahatma Gandhi had in our minds today.
A man who returned to India in 1915 was only two years old.
It was just the beginning.
Let's imagine how hard he had to suffer at that time and how hard he had to work.
Champaran Satyagraha was an occasion to realise the power of Mahatma Gandhi and the ability to make the country a peoples movement.
Mahatma Gandhi, through his conduct, mobilized and motivated the poorest of the poor, the illiterate, to fight against the British Empire.
This is a wonderful power that shows us the Champaran Satyagraha so that we can realise the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But when we think of Mahatma Gandhi a hundred years ago, when we think of Gandhiji by Champaran Satyagraha then it is a matter of great learning for any person who starts his public life.
The 1.25 billion countrymens desire to change, the effort to change, is the solid foundation of the New India.
New India is not a government's resolve, it is not a manifesto of any democratic party.
New India is a call to 1.25 billion people.
It is the idea that 1.25 billion people come together to build a grand India.
There is an idea among 1.25 billion people, there is an enthusiasm, a resolve, a desire.
Like silent servants, they do as they do, as they pray.
There are many who go to hospitals everyday and help the patients.
There are many who run for blood donation as soon as they know.
If someone's hungry, there are many who think about providing food to them.
We can say that our country is a Bahuratna Vasundhara.
The concept of service to humanity lies in our veins.
If we look at it socially, how powerful it would be if we engage in it.
When we talk about New India, we should think about it, we should think about it, we should think about it, we should think about it from a different perspective.
If 1.25 billion people decide, if we decide the path with determination, if we take one step after another then the dream of the 1.25 billion people of New India will come true in our dream.
All this is not possible through the budget, through government schemes, with government funding.
If we decide to comply with the transport laws, if all the citizens decide to discharge their duties with full responsibility, and if all the citizens decide that they will not use petrol or diesel one day a week...
These are small things, you can see that in this country of 1.25 billion people, the dream of a New India is being fulfilled directly.
This means that every citizen must follow his civic duty and perform his duties.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you.
For the past few months, people in our country have been participating in the digital revolution of Digital Payments and there is a curiosity about how to transfer money without money.
Even the poorest of the poor is trying to learn that. Slowly people are moving towards doing business without currency.
After the cancellation of the notice, there have been several modes of digital payment.
It has been only two and a half months since the launch of BHIM App, but more than 1.5 crore people have already downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
1.25 billion people, if they wish, do not wait for one year.
It can be done in six months.
We can do this in our daily lives.
You will be a brave warrior in the battle against black money and corruption.
A number of DigiDhan Melas have been organized to educate the people and sensitize the public.
100 programmes are planned across the country.
80-85 events are in progress.
It also had gifts.
About 12.5 lakh people have received prizes for the consumers.
70,000 people received gifts for traders.
Everyone is determined to move forward with this method.
April 14, 2020 Dr.
As has been decided earlier, on the 14th of April, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb, this Digital Mela is going to be over.
When we complete 100 days, we make a big program.
There's an arrangement for Mega Nursery.
Let us also launch the BHIM App in the days to come, on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Let us play our part in reducing the cost of payments that are paid in cash.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that every time Mann Ki Baat reaches out to the people, I get a lot of suggestions, but every time the need for cleanliness arises.
For the first time, many congratulations and best wishes to you all for your victory in the 11th class from Dehradun, the daughter of Gayatri, the Prime Minister said.
I'd like to tell you my own Mann Ki Baat.
I have to say that people need to understand the importance of cleanliness.
I pass through a river every day, in which people put lots of garbage and pollute the river.
Brothers and sisters, Look at the pain of the river getting polluted to a boy who is in class Ith.
How angry the child is on seeing garbage in that river.
I see this as a good sign.
There has been a new awakening in the country since the launch of the cleanliness campaign.
There is also an increase in hatred for dirt.
Be it awake, active participation or public participation, it has a lot of importance.
I want to tell all those who hear Gayatri ji's words in my Mann Ki Baat today that the message of Gayatri is a message to all of us.
The things that we see fill in the plate, we can't eat it all.
It doesn't matter to anyone.
When mothers serve our children in our homes, they tell them to take it only for you, son or daughter.
Second, if you save a little from it, it is also a financial profit for the family.
Thinking for society is a good thing, but it is also beneficial for the family.
I do not insist on this, but there must be a greater awakening.
I know the youngsters who are doing a great job in this regard.
They have created a mobile app for this purpose.
People call when they find out there is such a food, and they eat it and use it properly.
This hard work is being done by the youth of our country.
We can see people like this in every state of India.
We can inspire that their lives do not survive.
Just serve as much as you can.
Look, it's the way of change.
Those who are vigilant about health always say- Keep your stomach empty, keep your plate loose.
On the issue of health, 7th April is the World Health Day.
The United Nations has set the goal of universal health coverage by 2030.
This time the United Nations is focusing on Depression on World Health Day on 7th April.
We are also familiar with the word 'Disaster', but if we make the meaning of the word, some people call it depression.
According to an estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world are suffering from depression.
Creating a psychological eco-system is the way forward.
The first mantra is to open it rather than cure depression.
Tell your friends, parents, brothers and teachers what is in your mind.
Sometimes isolation, especially the children living in the hostels, is very difficult.
Our family is a beautiful family, a large family is interconnected, and therefore the chances of depression are lessened.
Otherwise, when everyone gets out together, don't come, I don't come, you tell me to stay alone.
Let those who can talk to him openly be with him.
Inspire him to talk with laughter, and bring him out what's so bad inside you.
It's a good solution.
Depression causes both physical and mental illness.
Diabetics, as diabetes is the master of all types of diseases, do not lose all ability to fight, to fight, to courage, to decide.
If you do not feel open in front of your family then seek help from someone with a sense of service around you.
Help with your heart, share your happiness.
If you try to understand the sorrows of others, if you do it with a sense of service, then a new confidence will emerge in you.
If you connect with others, if you help someone, if you serve selflessly, you will be able to reduce the burden of your mind.
Yoga is also a good way of keeping the mind healthy.
Yoga helps a lot in getting rid of stress, freedom from mental stress and the path to happiness.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga.
A few days ago, the central government has taken a major decision.
The number of women working in our country is increasing day by day and it should be welcomed that their participation is increasing.
The responsibility of the family and the financial responsibilities of the home are also due to which the newborn has to be treated unfairly.
Therefore, the central government took a major decision.
India has taken such a big decision for these sisters.
My dear countrymen, April 5 is the death anniversary of Ram Navami, and April 9 is the birth anniversary of Mahavir Jayanti and April 14 is the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
May the lives of these great men inspire us, and strengthen our resolve towards a New India.
Two days later, on the occasion of Chaitra Sukladi, on the occasion of New Year and on this New Year, many greetings to all of you.
This is the beginning of farming after spring and it is time for the farmers to get the benefits of their hard work.
This New Year is celebrated in different ways in different parts of our country.
New Year marks the beginning of the New Year in Gudi Padva in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, Chedi for Sindhis, Chand in Kashmir, Navreh in Kashmir, Samvatsarpuja in Awadh region, Jud-Sheetal in Mithila in Bihar, and Satuwani in Magadha.
India is such a diverse country.
My best wishes to you all for this New Year.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of PMs address in the 11th Episode of Mann Ki Baat 2.0 on 26.02.2017 My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
After the dawn, new leaves are beginning to appear in the trees.
Flowers are blooming.
The gardens and gardens are green.
The fowls of the birds are drawing their hearts.
Not only flowers, but also bright fruits in the sun are seen on the branches of trees.
Manga's flowers are beginning to appear in spring as a result of the summer.
Amir Khusro has made a very interesting account of the changing times.
Amir Khusro writes: Fool Rahi Sarasam Sakal Ban, Ambava Fude, Tesu Fluecool Bole, Dar-dar (doggers flower bloom somewhere in flower pots, sing flowers on tops) and make fun of human beings when the skins become comfortable.
Vasant Panchami, Mahashivratri, and Holi are all filled with joy in human life.
Many people are not aware of the achievements of ISRO in the field of space technology.
So, they are saying that we need to know about the launch of 104 satellites and the launch of the Interceptor Missile.
Shubha ji, I express my gratitude for remembering India's glorious achievements.
The role of technology and science is to deal with poverty, prevent diseases, connect with the world, acquire knowledge, and help in fighting poverty.
February 15, 2017 is a proud day for India.
Our scientists have given the opportunity to raise the prestige of India in front of the world.
We all know that in the past years, many unprecedented missions have been completed successfully.
After the success of Mars Orbiter Mission, ISRO has set a world record in space the other day.
Through the ISRO mega mission, 104 satellites of different countries like USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE and India have been successfully launched.
Together, 104 satellites have been launched in the space, making India the first country in the world.
It is especially heartening to note that this is the 38th time that PSLV has successfully launched.
This is not just an ISRO, but an entire history of India.
The world is astonished to see the cost-effective, efficient environment mission of ISRO.
The world has lauded the success of Indian scientists with an open mind.
Brothers and sisters, One of the 104 components is the greatest.
As soon as our satellite arrived, we sent some pictures.
It's starting to work.
It is a matter of great happiness that our young scientists and our women scientists have led the entire mission.
Such a role of youth and women is a very important part of ISRO's success.
I convey my best wishes to the scientists of ISRO in the name of the people of the country.
They have always set their goal of bringing environmentalists to the service of the nation, for the common man. They have been laying new feathers in their crown, as they are daily.
India has successfully tested the Ballistic Interceptor Missile in the field of Security.
You will be happy to know that only four or five countries of the world can achieve this goal.
Indian scientists have shown this by themselves.
The advantage of the missile is that it can be destroyed even if it is located at a distance of 2000 kilometers.
When we see new technologies, we feel happy to see new scientific discoveries.
Enlightened human beings have played a big role in the development journey.
Attempts to know the universe, the creations and the human mind are continuously going on.
New science, new technology and new technology are born out of it.
All new forms of technology and science give birth to a new era.
My dear young friends, we often talk about the hard work of science and scientists, and I have often told our younger generation that passion for science should increase.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Todays scientists are becoming the cause of a new change in the lives of the future generations.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say: There is no science that did not break from the sky in its true form.
All science is developed and built on the experiences.
Pujya Bapu also said, I heartily appreciate the spirit, hard work and dedication with which he led the quest for modern scientists after truth.
Science seeks to use that philosophy to meet the needs of the common man, what the medium should be, what the technology should be, because it is considered as the most important contribution to the common man.
It was also deliberated how to identify, showcase and inform people, how such innovations can be useful to the common man, how to produce more, how to use it commercially.
Sometimes the problems show the importance of science in finding peace.
All the systems are compatible with technology.
In a way, technology becomes an inseparable part of our lives.
In the last few days, the Digi-dhan scheme was very important.
Especially, the younger generation has become used to making digital payments over their mobile phones.
I see this as a good sign.
The Lucky Grahak Yojana and the Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana have been supported in our country in the last few days.
For nearly two months, 10,000 rupees per day are being given the award.
Through these two schemes, the beginning of making digital payments a mass movement in India has been accepted across the country.
Under this scheme, more than one lakh consumers have received a reward of Rs.
More than 4000 traders received an award of Rs. 50,000.
Farmers, traders, small shopkeepers, and workers who are employed in other professions, both domestic and foreign, are actively participating in this event.
When asked if young people come or old people come, they said that those who have received prizes are 15 years old and those who are 65-70 years old.
Shri Santosh ji from Mysuru received a gift of Rs.1000 under the Lucky Grahak Yojana, just like he wrote on the Narendra Modi App.
Then I thought they deserved a thousand rupees I got, and I gave them that thousand rupees.
I am very happy, Happy, Your name and work gives us happiness.
You have done an inspiring job for everyone.
In Maharashtra too, a young friend, Pooja Namade is a Post-Graduate student and shared his experience with others about how he feels happy to use the RuPay card e-wallet in his family and how much money is available for them.
On completion of 100 days of the Lucky Grahak Yojana, 14th April Dr.
It is Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
On the 14th of April, a big award ceremony worth crores of rupees is going to take place.
It's only forty-five days left.
You can't do this thing by remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Baba Saheb Ambedkar on his 125th birth anniversary.
Remembering him, you must teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM app.
Teach them how to sell money, especially to small traders nearby.
This time, on Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary, the BHIM App will be of special importance.
Go home and get everyone together and take 1.25 billion hands to the BHIM App.
This campaign, which has been going on for the past two-three months, has been successful in many townships, many villages and many cities.
The farmers of our country have been struggling hard to produce food grains this year.
All the indicators tell us that our farmers have broken all the records in the past.
On seeing the harvest in the fields, today Pongal and Baisakhi are celebrated.
More than 2.75 lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country this year.
The farmers of my country heard the voice of the poor and in about 290 lakh hectares of agricultural land, different varieties of pulses were grown.
The government is constantly trying.
A few days ago, a programme of senior officers from 23 states, led by Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India, was held in Telangana.
We can see the wealth from waste.
It's proven.
If there is a standard twin toilet for a family of six members then it is filled in about six years .
After that, the dirt can be sent back to the second pit.
In six to twelve months, dirt in the pit is completely rotten.
It is safe to handle such sludge. As fertilizer, the most important fertilizer is NPK.
Farmers know NPK fertilizers very well.
Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium - which are completely nutrient-rich and are considered to be a very good fertilizer in the agriculture sector.
Just as the government has taken this step, others will have taken similar steps.
Several departments at the government level are regularly observing Swachhta Hi Sewa.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, in association with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, is going to strengthen the cause of Swachhata.
In the second fortnight of March, two ministries - the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR, RD GR) and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation are leading the Swachhta Abhiyan.
We all know that every citizen of our country, whatever he does, will be proud of the fact that the whole country has reached a new height and confidence will increase.
I once again congratulate all the players on the team.
The country is proud of our Divyang friends.
I have always believed that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, determined, courageous and emotional.
Every minute we learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or environmental science, the women of our country are no less than anyone.
We are moving ahead in unison, taking advantage of it and bringing glory to the nation.
In the last few days, our women have won medals in the Asian Ragi sewans trophy.
My best wishes to those players.
World Women's Day is being celebrated on 8th March.
Today it's not just the government program.
The thinking of the people towards the ancient rituals that were going on for years has changed.
It's nice to hear the news that the girl was born was celebrated.
In a way, a positive attitude towards the girls has become the cause of social recognition.
A special mass movement in Gudallur district of Tamil Nadu has stopped child marriage.
So far, about 175 children have been prevented from getting married.
The district administration has opened bank accounts for more than 50,000-50,000 girls under the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.
In the Katwa district of Jammu and Kashmir, under the Convergence Model, all sections of the society have been included in the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao programme.In addition to organizing Gram Sabhas, the district administration is also making efforts to adopt orphaned girls and ensure their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, a mass movement is being organized for the education of girls in every village, every home, under the 'Harghar Dastak' program.
Rajasthan, our child, our school - Apana Bacha Apana Vidyalaya, a project to re-skilling and re-skilling girls who had been deprived of education, has been implemented.
In short, BetiBachao, BetiPadhao scheme is taking different forms.
I see this as a good sign.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
On the one hand, when our country takes pleasure in the rains, on the other hand, festivals and fairs are held in every corner of India.
It's going to be like this till Diwali.
Perhaps, our ancestors have played the role of Tuchakra, economy and social life in an environment where there is no obstacle in society.
In the last few days, we have celebrated many festivals.
From the life of Shri Krishna, we can find solutions to the problems of today.
Despite all this importance, take up the job of the charioteer in the battlefield.
Maybe lift the mountain itself, maybe eat the leaves.
That is, Krishna feels a new form in every aspect.
So today, while talking to you, my attention is drawn to the two greedy ones.
One is Mohan of Sudarshan, and the other is Mohan of Charka.
Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan left the Yamuna beach and settled on the seashore of Gujarat in Dwarka city Mohanan, born on the sea shore of the Yamuna, reached Delhi at the end of the day.
Whether it is the importance of selfless service or the importance of knowledge, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna by smiling at every step of our lives.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
A new landmark has been established in the history of mankind.
The spirit of service, the spirit of service, the duty towards service, has always been a part of Mahatma Gandhis life.
He set an example in his life through the path of service.
For Mahatma Gandhi, the individual, the society, the human and the humanity - this was everything.
He stressed on the importance of social integration of Africa, in the Phoenix family of Africa, in the Tolstoy farm, in the Sabarmati Ashram, or in the Wardha.
It is my good fortune that I got the opportunity to go and bow down in many great places related to the venerable Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi had given importance to organization with the spirit of service.
We have to bring in the spirit of social service, social growth and social mobilization in our practical lives.
In true sense, this is a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and a real tribute to him.
There will be many such occasions and we will also gather together.
What is Gandhi 150?
What can we play as an individual in this endeavour
Think of what value addition can be yours.
Ladies' club.
Let us continue to work in the Ladies Club of modern times, but let all the members of the Ladies Club come together and work together.
We can do a lot of things.
Develop old books, distribute them to the poor and provide them knowledge.
130 crore people will have 130 crore ideas and 130 crore initiatives.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I had visited Dandi in Gujarat.
The Salt Satyagraha in Dandi, during the freedom struggle, was a great turning point.
At Dandi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
I urge you to visit any place related to Mahatma Gandhi in the future.
It could be Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Champaran, Wardha Ashram, and places related to Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
When you go to a place like this, you must share your film on social media and motivate others.
This time at the Indian Pavilion at Venice Binale, there are exhibitions showcasing a lot of interest related to the memories of Gandhiji.
Among these, the Haripura Panels were particularly fascinating.
You must remember that there was a great conference of the Congress in Haripur in Gujarat and the events chosen by Subhas Chandra Bose as the President have been recorded in the history.
This art exhibition has a very beautiful past.
Before the Haripura Convention of the Congress, in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi invited the then Principal of Santiniketan Kala Bhavan, Nandalal Bose.
He wanted the people of India to showcase their art forms and the exhibition of their art forms at the Maha Sammelans.
His art was also a tribute to the Constitution as well as to Nandlal Bose.
Nandalal Bose visited the villages near Haripur and later painted some pictures depicting the life of rural India.
These priceless artefacts have become a great topic of discussion in Venice.
Once again, on the occasion of Gandhiji's 100th birth anniversary, I convey my best wishes and appeal to all Indians to take a pledge.
For the country, for the society, for others, something has to be done.
This will be a good, real, meaningful tribute to Bapu.
Dear sisters and brothers, In the last few years, we have been running a cleanliness drive in the country for nearly two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will start on 11th September.
This time, we have to give special importance to plastic.
I recalled from the Red Fort on 15 August that it was with great enthusiasm and zeal that 1.25 billion people organised a mass movement for cleanliness and emancipation.
Similarly, we have to stop single-use plastic.
People from all sections of society have a lot of enthusiasm about this.
Many of my brothers and sisters in the business world have placed a board in front of the shop, in which those who want to buy the goods have to bring in the bag.
It will also save money and play their part in protecting the environment.
This time, on 2nd October, when we mark Bapu's 100th birth anniversary, we not only dedicate to him an Open Defecation Free India, but also lay the foundation for a new mass movement against plastics across the country.
We can turn it into fuel.
What is greater inspiration than Gandhiji?
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit dialects are in a way enlightened.
We will get what we want in our lives.
I would like to say something great through a Sanskrit translation.
This thing has been written centuries ago but today it is also very important.
There are three gems on earth - water, food and Subhashitmui - Pashan Khandushu Ratnasmanjya - which means on earth there are three gems - water, food and sweetness.
Stupid people call the stone a gem.
Anna had great respect in our culture.
We have also turned the knowledge about food into science.
The awareness about the need for nutrition has been made popular across the country through modern scientific methods.
People are fighting malnutrition through new and attractive ways.
Under this, during the harvesting season, the employees of Anganwadi workers collect one grain each from the people.
This grain is used for cooking hot food for children and women.
After that, the person becomes committed to this goal and becomes a warrior of that mass movement.
We all must have heard about an event called Annaprashan in every part of India.
It's being run on the occasion of feeding the young ones first.
It's not liquid food, it's hard food.
People are donating their food at places.
When there is a birthday or a day of celebration in the family, the family members prepare nutritious food, tasty food, take them to anganwari or to a school, and feed themselves to the children from their families.
We share our happiness and share it with others.
It is a good combination of service and happiness.
Friends, There are many small things like this that we can successfully fight against malnutrition.
Today, the poor and the rich suffer due to lack of knowledge about nutrition and malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated all over the country as a nutritional month.
You too, must be a part of it, add a new agenda, and share it with you.
It means that if you can save someone from malnutrition, then we can save the country from malnutrition.
Every last week I've gone, every where I've seen people, man vs.
I have never thought that there would be a chance in life to touch the minds of youngsters all over the world.
What's happening?
He went to Bhutan last week.
Since the time I have got the opportunity to go wherever I got the opportunity to go as the Prime Minister, since then I have got the opportunity to sit with everyone due to the observation of International Day of Yoga.
There should not be a single big leader in the world who doesnt discuss Yoga with me and this is my experience across the world.
The channel is planned to be telecast in 165 countries.
It is my firm belief that this episode of Discovery Channel will be extremely helpful in familiarizing the world with India's message, India's heritage, India's sympathy for the nature in its cultural journey.
Today, people want to know about the steps taken in our country for climate protection and clean environment.
Have you been shooting many times, what happened?
I ask you very curiously.
Look, there's no secret.
There's a question in the minds of many, so let me tell you the secret.
It's no secret.
The truth is that technology has been effectively used in the conversation with Bear Grylls.
Whatever I say, it was being translated into English, and he used to listen to the small equipment that had no stomach in the ear of Bear Grylls.
That is, even though I was in Hindi, he used to hear it in English, so the conversation was easy, this is the wonder of technology.
After this show, many people talked to me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You and I must go to places related to nature and wildlife.
I have said this before, and I repeat, we have to go to the north-eastern part of India.
You have to spend some time there.
My dear countrymen, in India, the concerns and concerns about the environment are naturally reflected in the thinking of protecting nature.
Last month, I had the opportunity to release the Tiger Senses to the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
It's only half of it a few years ago.
In the context of tigers, a Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010.
He expressed concern over the decline in tiger numbers in the world.
With the year 2022, the number of tigers in the world will double.
But this is a New India, we are at the cusp of rapid transformation.
We doubled our tiger numbers in 2019.
Not only the number of tigers in India, but the number of protected areas and community reserves has doubled.
Several steps have been taken one after the other in the Gir forest.
In 2007, it was decided to appoint female guards.
In order to promote tourism, infrastructure has been enhanced.
When we talk about nature and wildlife, we talk about conservation.
We need to think of compassion more than protection.
There is a lot of good advice in our science.
Listen to what our scientists have said centuries ago, we are forced and killed by tigers in the absence of forests and forests.
My dear countrymen, who is this historic address delivered by Swami Vivekananda on 11th September 1893
This Indian youth saint, who has captured the human race across the world, established India's glorious personality in the world.
On the 11th of September, 1893, the words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda made the world obliged to change the vision of India.
Come, let us try to live with the real power of India that Swami Vivekananda saw on the face of India.We have everything inside us.
But I won't go into its details now.
Wait till August 29.
In order to get rid of plastic, all of us work together at home and abroad with all our might.
I am confident that this movement will also be filled with social media.
Come, let us move forward with a new zeal, with a new resolve and a new strength.
Let us move forward with a spirit of service and joy within.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of PMs address in the 11th Episode of Mann Ki Baat 2.0 on 25.01.2017 My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
My dear countrymen, greetings to everyone.
On January 26, 2019, our Republic Day was celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm in all parts of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duty of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, and our commitment to democracy, is a cultural festival that awakens the future generations to democracy and to democratic responsibilities.
But still, no matter how much discussion is going on about the duties of citizens, rights of citizens in our country, no matter how deep and extensive the discussion is.
In a couple of minutes, it reflects a social outlook, a resolve and a reverence for the martyrs.
We have a natural respect for the army, the security forces in our country.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the brave jawans and their families, who have been honoured with various gallantry awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
Can you do one thing, especially to appeal to the youth and to involve them in social media with great enthusiasm
On the one hand, while we were happy to hear the joy and enthusiasm of January 26, the brave soldiers of our army who were guarding the security of the country in Kashmir came out with a brave message.
I pay my tributes to all those brave soldiers and salute them.
My young friends, you are well aware of the fact that I regularly clarify my mind through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
The months of January, February, March and April are the days of examinations for all families.
When I was talking about this subject, many teachers, parents and students sent me a message, asked questions, asked suggestions, said pain, pointed out the problem.
After seeing all these things, I would like to share with you the thoughts that have come to my mind.
I received a telephonic message from the Creator.
Listen, Creator says, Sir, I want to tell you that there is a very frightening atmosphere in our home and neighborhood and society at the time of the exam.
It is because of this that children are motivated instead of being encouraged.
There are very few people who are happy for the exam.
Exams for more people are an opportunity for stress.
That's when the good thing happens inside us, that's what comes out.
A sense of strength is felt on the occasion of the festival in society.
Shows the best.
At the time of the exam, the entire family, among friends, should create a festive atmosphere between the neighbors.
You can see pressure becoming a plaster, pressure becoming happy.
The atmosphere of enthusiasm makes the mind burdenless.
Look, look, change will come.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kachchh to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, the examinations will be conducted in these 3-4 months.
You must understand that the power to call memories is the silentest in mind.
If you're in tension, all doors will be closed, what's in there won't come in, what's in there won't come out.
There is an obstacle in thought process, and so it becomes a burden.
I would like to say from my experience that if there is stress, we will be forgotten, if there is peace, if there is peace, we will not be able to imagine these things then it will be very beneficial.
It's not that you don't know, it's not that you've studied hard.
But when you are under stress, your knowledge, your knowledge, your learning, your mental stress, all these things are suppressed.
Life seems to be a problem.
The exams that you will write will appear to be the exams of the entire year.
P.
J.
If he had been disappointed with that failure, had he failed with his life, would India have had such a great scientist, would he have been able to get such a great President
Therefore, competition has increased, and there has been an increase in stress among students.
Mark and mark sheets have limited access.
It's not everything in life.
Life goes on and depends on how much knowledge you have gained.
If you believe in these things, the Mark Wall will follow you, and you will never need to go after the market.
You should benefit from knowledge, skill, self-confidence and determination in life.
Look at his experience, knowledge and success.
Therefore, the burden of the market stops us from going in the right way.
But if you focus on the market, you will slowly limit yourself to limited things, just to market it.
This is a very psychological battle.
In fact, the competition is not useful in leading life, but is to compete with oneself to move forward in life.
How's the better day to come than last day?
How's the better chance to come than one happened?
You must have seen it in the playground, and you will get to know about it quickly, so you can give an example here.
The specialty of their lives is that they are competing with themselves in the case of most of the winners.
Didn't sleep because of the stress of the previous exam, are you sleeping?
Second, you're worse than him.
Third, it's equal.
Just keep in mind how to do better than what you did before.
Sundar has expressed his views on the role of parents.
He said that the role of parents is crucial in this regard.
Because mothers are more vigilant about the future of children in the home, their work is non-stop, they make things easier.
When you learn to accept it, most of the problems will end there.
So I want to tell the parents that you sometimes do this to the children.
Have you ever felt the need to give children the exams of laughter
Take care, the atmosphere will change.
A very interesting phone call came.
Because I did something like that when I was a kid, and I tried to get fucked up once I was a kid.
I made a lot of preparations for that.
I tried to find the way, and I lost a lot of time for that.
"You're right.
Sometimes when you don't believe in yourself, you can look at the person who is next to you and check if I'm right.
Maybe we're right, and the next one's written is wrong.
And we'll write it wrong and dig our own hole.
That's not very good with the cockroaches.
It's kind of a lie, so don't do it.
The cockroaches make you worse, so don't shit.
"What is the Prime Minister asking the children to play at the time of exams, I will get angry.
It is generally believed that students are not interested in studies if they focus on sports.
This understanding is wrong.
This is the basis of problems.
If there is a need for holistic development, there is a life outside books and understand that it is very wide.
It's time to learn to live.
It's time to create life.
This is called maintenance.
In my view of the exams, three things are important in my view: proper rest, secondly sleep for the body, thirdly intellectual functions and body a large part.
Therefore, the rest of the body needs an opportunity to work.
Have you ever thought about seeing the sky, seeing the plants and trees, and making your heart happy while sitting in front of you
Deep breaths are very quick to stress.
There is no need to be firm in the room to breathe deeply.
Some people feel that they sit late at night and study much - that's not right.
You must sleep as much as you want.
So you won't lose time to study.
A local girl who came to see me asked, "How many hours do you sleep?"
I asked you back, brother, are you a doctor?
He said that during elections, the voice of your speech and your closing voice is related to sleep.
If you sleep enough, you'll get some rest for your Vocal Code.
He gave me a big medicine that didn't think of sleep, Vocal Code and my voice.
Doesn't mean only to sleep.
So don't do that.
If you can, follow it, don't do it.
Or it'll be a burden, and I advise your family's parents not to be burdened with them.
Keeping in mind your resolve and your talent, go to your exams.
My best wishes.
Celebrate exams to make all exams successful.
Then the exam won't be a test.
Go ahead with this spell.
My dear countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years on February 1, 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the Coast Guard personnel and jawans of the country for their service to the nation.
Coast Guard has commanded 126 ships and 62 aircraft built in our country and is the 4th largest Coast Guard in the world.
In keeping with this motto, the Coast Guard jawans have been tirelessly working round the clock to protect the maritime and coastal environment of the country.
Last year, the Coast Guard jawans carried out a major task of cleaning the sea coast of our country with their responsibility.
Thousands of people participated in it.
It is indeed commendable that they have also thought of coastal sanitation along the coasts.
Only a few people know that in our countrys Coast Guard, not only men, but women also play a successful role in shouldering responsibility.
Our lady officers of the Coast Guard are not only pilots and Observers, but also commanded by the Hovercrafts.
Maritime security is an important issue in the world today, and therefore, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the great work of India's maritime security, I extend my greetings and good wishes to all.
1st February is the spring festival.
Spring is recognized as the best.
Spring is known as the King of Tuckers.
It is the festival of Vasant Panchami Saraswati in our country.
This is considered an opportunity to admire learning.
Not only this, it is also a celebration that inspires the heroes.
This is the inspiration of Mararang de Basanti Chola.
Thousands of greetings to my countrymen on the auspicious occasion of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, the spirit of Mann Ki Baat has also given a new dimension to it in its own way.
Since last month, Mann Ki Baat has started to be heard in regional languages immediately after my Mann Ki Baat.
I once again congratulate Akashwani for this thing and I congratulate the countrymen for this thing.
Mann Ki Baat offers me a great opportunity to connect with you.
100 greetings.
Today is an occasion to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in life.
Jesus Christ said, "It is not for our benefit to the poor, but for our recognition."
Saint Luke has said, Jesus Christ not only served the poor but also praised the service done by the poor. This is true empowerment.
A story related to this is very famous.
Because others gave them a lot, but the widow gave them everything today, 25th December.
Two days ago, I got the opportunity to launch several development projects in the holy land of Malaviya Ji in Banaras.
I laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Care Centre at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi.
The cancer care centre that is being built here will be of great benefit not only to eastern Uttar Pradesh but also to the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country can never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we have also enhanced the pride of the nation in terms of absolute power.
As a leader of the party, as a member of Lok Sabha, as a Minister and as a Prime Minister, Atal ji established great ideals.
I bow to Atal ji on his Jayanti and pray for his health.
As a worker, I got the opportunity to work with Atal ji.
Many memories are appearing in front of your eyes.
When I had tweeted this morning, I had shared an old video on how I had got the good opportunity to meet Atal ji's affectionate year as a minor activist.
Today, on Christmas Day, the people of the country are going to get the benefits of two schemes as a Christmas gift.
In a way, this scheme was launched on the second day of November.
The atmosphere of anxiety has been created around the country, whether in villages, cities, whether educated or illiterate, whether it is cashless, how to deal with cash, how to buy things without money.
Everyone wants to learn and know each other.
In order to encourage this, to strengthen mobile banking, and to become a habit of e-payment, the Government of India is launching several incentive schemes for customers and small traders today.
This will continue for 100 days, not just for one day.
Every day, 10,000 people receive Rs. 1,000 each.
In a hundred days, millions and millions of families will get a gift of millions of rupees.You will be entitled to a gift from Narco when you use digital payment methods like mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay cards, UPI, USSD etc.
The Digi-dhan Vyapar Yojana is primarily meant for traders.
This scheme is meant for all sections of the society, especially the poor and the middle class.
Therefore, it will be available to buyers who buy more than Rs.50 and less than Rs.3000.
Those who buy goods worth more than Rs. 3000 will not get this award.
For the poorest of the poor, it is possible to purchase and sell goods through USSD as well as through common phone so that they can all become beneficiaries of the scheme.
These 30 crore people will soon be part of the gift scheme.
I know that the young people of the neighborhood will know about this thing and if you ask them, they will tell you everything.Your family will have children who are studying in 10 or 12, they will tell you this thing in a beautiful way.
Just like you are sending the message of WhatsApp on a mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, knowledge about how to use technology, how to make e-payments, how to make online payment is now becoming increasingly popular in the country.
Cashless transactions have increased 200-300 times in the last few days.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to encourage this.
The business community can very well imagine how big this decision is.
Digital payment trader is also giving relief in income tax to encourage online payment system instead of currency in his business.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
It is said that the Government of Assam has decided to grant 10 rebate to make property tax and license fee digitally paid.
With 75 percent of its customers having at least two digital transactions between January and March, 2020, the rural bank branches receive a reward of fifty thousand rupees from the government.
As on 31.03.2017, 100 digital transactions will be given to the villages under the Umbrella Scheme "Panchayat for Digital Transactions" from Government.
He also announced the Digital Krishi Sinchai Yojana for farmers, under which Rs 5000 will be provided to the first 10 farmers of the country for purchase of seeds and fertilizers.
While congratulating the Government of Assam in this regard, I also congratulate all the governments who have started this kind of initiatives.
Many organizations have adopted successful methods to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers in the village.
About fertilizer, GNFC- Gujarat Narmadawali Fertilizers Chemicals Limited (NFL) has installed more than 1000 POS machines at fertilizer outlets to facilitate farmers and in a few days more than 5 lakh POS machines have been delivered to 35,000 farmers through digital payment mode which is just a matter of two weeks.
The most interesting thing is that the fertilizer sale of GNFC has gone up by 27 in comparison to last year.
A country like India should be at the top in this field.
Our youth have made great strides in start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
With new ideas and new technology, with new schemes, this sector should give importance to our youth.
In such a scenario, we can become a partner by strengthening the campaign to save the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, every month, I urge people in Mann Ki Baat to share their views and tell you what to say.
MyGov and Narendra Modi App had thousands of ideas this time about 80-90 per cent of the fight against corruption and black money and when I saw everything, I felt that the refugees could be given three times more.
Some people explained in detail about the difficulties being faced by people and the inconveniences that they are facing.
It's a good thing for the good of the country, for the good of the country, to do such a pious thing, and to find out all the new ways of deceit and deceit.
I am grateful to the people for writing so many letters and helping me.
A feeling like the one written by Gurumani Kevala is evident in every corner of the country.
We can recognize it.
When people suffer, when they suffer, who are the people who do not have any pain?
I feel the same pain as you are.
If 1.25 billion people stay together, nothing is impossible, people are a reflection of God, and I clearly understand that the blessings of the people are the blessings of God, every moment.
I thank the people, salute the people, for participating in this great campaign against corruption and black money.
The law is the same to everyone.
Whether it be a person or an organization or a political party, everyone must abide by the law and must abide by it.
Those who are not able to directly support corruption and black money are trying their best to find out the shortcomings of the government.
This government belongs to the common man.
They are constantly trying to get the feedback of the people.
What is the problem of the people, what is the law, what is the problem, what is the solution to it
As a sensitive government from time to time, looking at how many laws have to be changed, keeping in mind the convenience of the people, the aim is to reduce the difficulties faced by the people.
On the other hand, I had already said that this is an extraordinary fight.
For 70 years, all kinds of strengths have been incorporated in black money transactions involving fraud and corruption.
What is their strength?
When they are determined to fight such people, they are adopting new methods to defeat the government on a daily basis.
When they follow new methods, the government also has to adopt new ways to defeat those methods.
If you do this, I will keep 10 because it has been decided that the corrupt, the thief and the thief will not be able to face black money.
On the other hand, there are letters from a number of other sources of information about the kind of frauds that are taking place and how new methods are being invented.
In this regard, I would like to heartily congratulate my dear countrymen.
There is a lot of information available from the common man about the number of information available in the government system.
Probably success comes from the fact that ordinary people are awake.
Can anyone imagine how dangerous my country's vigilant people face to face with such a weak power
There are so many friends who write letters that they say, "Modiji, don't be weak, don't stop, don't stop, how hard a footstep can be, but if we leave, we need to reach the destination."
I would like to especially thank those who have written these letters because they have faith and blessings in their letters.
I took it out, created a powerful Benami Wealth Law.
In the coming days, the law will start doing its work.
Whatever you have to do for the country and for the people of the country, it will be a priority.
My dear countrymen, I had said in Mann Ki Baat last year that our farmers had broken the record in the last year in farming despite these difficulties.
It is a good idea for the agriculture sector.
Recently, in the World Economic Forum, India has been named proud in many areas.This is the result of our constant efforts and hard work of our people.Indias rise in global rankings through various indicators.
Indias ranking in the World Banks Doing Business Report has improved.
As per the Global Investment Report released by Dutch, Indias ranking in the top-prospective Host Economy for 2016-18 has improved to 3rd.
India ranks 32 in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have moved up 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index has gone up by 19 ranks in 2016.
Even after reviewing several other reports, the same manner of progress is being made, and India is moving forward at a fast pace.
But in such a situation, it gives a lot of happiness to see some good things happening at times.
The government is committed to the Divyang people.
I have personally tried to accelerate this move.
My aim was to get the rights and dignity of the Divyangjans.
When we won 4 medals in the Olympics, our Divyang brothers and sisters have been strengthened for our efforts and for our faith.
They not only raised the pride of the country through that victory, but also surprised people with their talent.
Our Divyang sisters and brothers, like every citizen of the country, have immense wealth and strength.
I am very happy that after passing the law for the welfare of the Divyangjans, the opportunity to get employment for the Divyangjans will increase.
The Government has increased the reservation limit to 4 per cent.
Through this Act, special departments have been made in the field of Divyangjan's education, other facilities and complaints.
The extent to which the government has been sensitive towards the divyangs is evident from the fact that in the last two years the government has organised 4325 390 camps and distributed equipment to 5 lakh 80 thousand divyang brothers and sisters at a cost of Rs 352 crores.
The Government has also passed a new law in accordance with the requirements of the United Nations.
There were seven types of Divyangjans before.
Talasmia, Parkinson, salty people are also associated with this group.
In the last few weeks, news that had come from the field of sports has made us all proud.
It is natural for all of us to feel proud as Indians.
The Indian Cricket Team has won 4 positions against England.
Of these, some of the young players played a commendable role.
Test Captain Virud Kohli gave a good leadership with good batting.
The Indian Cricket Team's Offshore Wooler R.
Junior hockey team created the World Cup.
The Junior hockey team won the World Cup after 15 years.
Congratulations to the youth for this accomplishment.
This is a good sign for the Indian hockey team.
Our women were surprised last month.
The Indian women's hockey team also won the Asian Champions Trophy. A few days ago, in the Under-18 Asia Cup, India's ASHA team won the medal.
Cricket, I heartily congratulate all the hockey players.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
We were celebrating Diwali last month.
Some wrote poems, some drew pictures, some painted cartoons, some made videos.
I mean, how many houses had become like a military post.
Still, when I see these letters, I am astonished to see how emotional and visionary it is.
With the participation of all of you, the book is being prepared by giving you an insight into the country's army and the security forces.
A young man wrote to me and said, "Our soldiers should walk on the border in all the festivals like Holi and Diwali.
At every moment, the security of the country is at its peak.
But at the time of the festival, you will remember the house.
But to be honest, it didn't happen this time.
It's a celebration, it's not at home.
It was a feeling that we are celebrating Diwali with 1.25 billion Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the soldiers, the strength of the army is about 125 crore times.
A few days ago, the chiefs of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir came to see him.
They were the people of Jammu and Kashmir 5th Conference.
There were about 40-50 people from every village in the Kashmir valley.
I got a chance to talk to them for a while.
But as the conversation progressed, things such as the situation in the valley, the legal system, and the future of the children were natural.
I am very happy that those village heads who came from the valley of Kashmir have fully fulfilled their promise to me.
They went to the village and made people far away aware.
About 95 percent of the students from Kashmir participated in the exam during the board exam a few days ago.
The presence of so many children in the board exam indicates that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education for a bright future.
Addressing the nation at 8 pm on 8th November, it was said that a big step has been taken to bring about change in the country.
The more important it is, the more important it should be implemented, the more I felt it would have to face various difficulties in our normal life.
I have said that it will take 50 days and that is a big decision to come out of the impact of this decision and we will be able to return to normal after 50 days.
The notes of 500 and 1000 rupees, such a big country, so many currency, crores of rupees and this decision is being watched carefully by all the economists and the entire world.
India's 1.25 billion people are trying to overcome difficulties and win.
There can be a question mark in front of the world.
India is full of 1.25 billion people.
I am confident that this decision will prove to be a win-win situation for our country.
The responsibility for it is the citizens of this place, you all are the ones who have been able to give this path of success.
All over the country, Central Government, State Governments, all the components of Local Bodies, 1 lakh 30 thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank branches, more than 1.5 lakh post offices, more than 1 lakh bank friends, are working round the clock with dedication.
In spite of various types of mental stress, they are all calm and working, considering it as a national service and an effort to make a great difference.
Starting in the morning, he is working without knowing when the night is over.
Despite all this hardship, the officials in the bank and the post office are working.
When it comes to humanity, it seems they are in two steps ahead.
There was an accident in Khandwa:
Suddenly there was a need for money;
When he came to the notice of an officer of the bank there, he felt very happy to know that he had gone to the old man's house and provided enough money for his treatment.
A number of such stories are available daily on TV, in the media, in the media and in the media.
Attempts are being made to save the money by misguiding the poor, putting money in their accounts, or by making them do something else.
But please don't play with the lives of the poor.
He said, "Sir, Namaskar, my name is Ashish Parare.
Madhya Pradesh is located in Tarali village of Tharali Taluk of Harda district.
This will inspire people, and a cashless economy is essential for nation building.
I am with the country in this regard.
I'm very happy you've withdrawn 500 and 1000 notes.
I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart because no one thought that you would take such a big step when you called your father's day.
The notes of 500 and 1000 were withdrawn and taught good lessons to the black money and the corrupt.
There will not be a better day for every Indian.
People from many countries of the world have also learnt to talk about 'Chai Pe Charcha'.
But I didn't know we'd get married in a tea-sketch.
I can see that on November 17, a marriage took place with a tea paper church in Surat.
In Surat, Gujarat, a girl gave only tea to those who came to her wedding.
We didn't make a procession, there were no food arrangements - because the notes were withdrawn, causing some trouble to the money.
In a crisis, people find the best ways.
People find their own ways.
You see this change.
Big people with contacts, who don't want to ask them, they are the ones who don't pay properly, their dues are much left.
If all municipalities have 50 percent of the land.
But this time, on the 8th of this month, all of them ran away to close their old notes.
In 47 cities, 3,33,500 crore transactions were done in the same period last year.
You will be astonished and happy to hear that this week, 10 thousand crore rupees have been allotted in hand.
There will be many examples of this kind which can have a direct impact.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages, our farmers are the strength of the economy of this country.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economy, every citizen is fighting it amidst difficulties.
There is considerable progress in providing loans to them under the Mudra scheme.
Under the MUDRA scheme, lakhs and crores of rupees have been given to these small businesses because crores of people run these small businesses and the pace of business worth crores of rupees has increased.
But it was natural for them to face difficulties in this decision.
But now our small traders are using technology, through mobile app, mobile banking, using credit cards, and are serving the consumers through trust and trust.
I would like to tell these small traders that this is an opportunity for you to enter the digital world.
You can also download the Bank App on mobile phones.
You also have a POS machine to use credit cards.
I invite you for that.
I am confident that this technology can be implemented in the entire business of your village.
You can't be exploited.
I know that for you, the youth of my country liked my decision.
I know that you support this decision.
I know that you are playing a very important role in taking this matter forward in a fruitful manner.
Friends, You are my real soldiers and my good friends.
This is a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India. This is an opportunity to take the country towards economic prosperity.
My young men, can you help me?
Your family may not know the elders, your parents, your aunt, your uncle and mother.
You know what the app is, you know what online banking is, how online ticket booking is.
For you, it's all normal, you use it.
But today, the country wants to do a great job of building a society without a look.
It's true that there's not a hundred percent society that doesn't look.
But can't we be converted into a group that uses some notes?
Once you start building a few-eyed society, the blinded society will not be far away.
You know how many opportunities are there for a bankless society, for digital banking or for mobile banking.
All banks are providing online facility.
All banks in India have mobile apps.
Every bank has its own wallet.
Wallet means e-Pares.
There are many types of cards available.
Crores of poor families in India have RuPay cards under the Jan Dhan Yojana.
The number of RuPay cards that were used in a very short span of time has gone up by 300 times since the 8th of this month.
Prepaid card is also available to pay the money from the bank as the prepaid card is available on the mobile phone.
Not only this, technology is becoming more and more simple than it requires a smart phone.
I have stressed upon the need to make these arrangements more simple.
All banks try to do that.
My young friends, despite all this, there is a generation that does not know anything.
I know you're all working on this great thing.
I can see your creative messages on the WhatsApp - slogans, poems, short stories, cartoons, new ideas, games and so on.
However, my dear young friends, I would like to tell you once again that I need your help in this regard.
Your mobile phones will also have the technology to spend online expenses.
Not only this, teach us how to use this technology, how to download the bank's app to at least 10 families in half an hour, an hour, and at least 2 hours a day, how to spend the money in your own account, how to pay the debtor.
Once you teach people how to use RuPay card, the poor will bless you.
If the common man is taught all this, he will probably get rid of all the worries.
If all the youth of India are involved in this thing then I dont think it will take much time.
Within a month, we will be able to present a new India to the world.
You can do this through your mobile phone, go to 10 houses daily, and connect 10 houses daily.
I invite you, come, come, not just support, but we can be the army of this change, change and rest.
We will take forward this fight against corruption and black money in the country.
That country made a revolution.
My dear young friends, I once again urge you to take forward this movement.
I appeal to every school, college, university, NCC, NSS, as well as all of you to do this thing together.
Let's take this forward.
We have the opportunity to do good service to the nation.
Don't miss this opportunity.
You must have seen that the most famous artist of this century, Amitabh Bachchan, Swachhata Abhiyan is moving forward with a lot of heart.
Cleanliness seems to have spread in his molecule, that's why he remembered his father's birth anniversary and the subject of cleanliness.
He has written a lines of a poem written by Harivamsarai ji - "Mun-body, a heart full of joy, a penance, a life of penance, that is me."
Swachhta Abhiyan flows like blood in the veins of his son Shri Amitabh ji.
He has written to me through the poetry of Harivamsarai - a clean body, a clean mind, a clean India, that is me.
I respectfully bow down to Harivamsarai Ji.
Thank you very much.
Deepavali is celebrated in every corner of India with fervor and happiness.
India is a country that celebrates some 365 days in any corner of the country.
We have seen the courage to end the unprecedented festivals.
Changes in festivals have been adopted naturally as per the requirements of the times and the society.
Do it through festivals.
All these things have been linked with festivals in a scientific way.
Today, the entire world is discussing about the environment.
Be it trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains or birds, festivals responsible for all.
That is, in our country, there was a tradition of celebrating holidays with the help of the universe and science.
Today, as I said, when we celebrate Diwali, this festival of ours also provides information and information.
This Diwali, Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamya, is a message to go out of darkness to light.
Cleans all the parts of the house.
This habit and tradition must be broadened and broadened.
Diwali is no longer confined to India's borders.
In a way, in every country of the world, in a way, the festival of Diwali is celebrated.
Many governments of the world, MPs and their rulers are being part of the Diwali celebrations.
Whether it is the eastern or western countries, whether it is a developed country, or a developed country, whether it is Africa or Ireland, the festival of Diwali is there.
In a tweet, the Prime Minister of Canada is lighting a lamp to Diwali.
In London, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, joined the entire community in celebrating the festival of Diwali, in which he participated.
What's in that picture...
The Prime Minister of Australia has conveyed his greetings to the Indian community on the occasion of Diwali and has called upon the people of various cities of Australia to join in the celebration of Diwali.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had arrived in New ealand the other day.
He said that he has to come back at the earliest to participate in the Diwali celebrations.
This festival of lights is indicative of the fact that the festival of Diwali is also an inspiration to take the world from darkness to light.
Parents are requested to ensure that the elderly stay at home when the child is buried, take care of them and avoid any confusion in their mind.
The festival of Diwali is going to last for a while in our country.
Chhath Puja is a big festival in the eastern part of India.
Whether I talk about Diwali or about Chhath Puja, in fact it is an opportunity for all of you to greet you on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
At the same time, it is also an opportunity to express gratitude to the countrymen and to express gratitude.
Due to the incidents that have taken place over the past several months, our soldiers have laid down their lives for peace and peace.
When we are celebrating Diwali, our jawans face all kinds of hardships, some in the deserts, some in the Himalayas, some in the Himalayan peaks, some in the industry, some in wait for the airports, and some in the deserts.
How many responsibilities are responsible!
Words, birds, scales, colours, countless imaginations...
I can imagine how proud the soldiers of my country are.
I swear by the fact that you are happy and smiling, and this is the reason why I sleep peacefully because I bow down to you, because I bow down to you, the harbor and the flower of Indian origin, I bow down to you and I bow down to you and I bow down to you in the same way, I bow down to you.
My dear countrymen, a sister Shivaji, who is home to her parents and husbands and is full of young people, has given me a message on telephone.
Come on, let's hear what the military family says.
- Namaste Prime Minister, I am Shivani Mohan.
The launch of the message to Jawan for Diwali is a big boost to our military brothers and sisters.
I'm from a military family.
My husband is also an army officer.
My father and my husband's father were officers in the army.
That is, my family is full of soldiers.
The officers of the border areas receive good messages that are very encouraging and the army circle encourages them.
Army officers, Soldiers and their families and their wives make a lot of sacrifices.
In a way, the entire army comes with a very good message and wishes to you on Diwali.
My dear countrymen, we can see that the soldiers are standing on the border and in every aspect of life.
Whether it is natural calamities or be it the legal system or be it faced with the enemy or be it the courage to bring back the misguided youth, our jawans work in every aspect of life with a national spirit.
First it was Sikkim, now Himachal Pradesh and Kerala will be like this on 1st November.
The name of his village is Banda.
He came there and was discussing the construction of toilets.
Some families didn't have access to toilets because of financial hardships.
Vikas Thakur played a significant role in strengthening the Swachhata Abhiyan by giving Rs 1000 each to 57 families in their own pocket.
This has given Himachal Pradesh the strength to make Open Defecation Free.
Vamlakudi is an tribal village where there is no way to reach the forest in Kerala and there is no way to reach there.
People don't go there.
The cadets, volunteers of the National Service Scheme, and engineering students have decided to join hands to build toilets there.
Things are going on at a rapid pace in all the states.
I just picked up something.
I would like to congratulate all the citizens of these states for their role in the role of participants in this great endeavour, in eradicating the darkness from dirt and filth.
My dear countrymen, there will be a lot of government schemes and after the first project, if another such scheme comes up then we will have to give up the first project.
But generally no one pays attention to these things.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always shown us the way.
You decide on this criteria.
Now we have to face the rising aspirations of the poor of the country, which is the need of the hour.
Now there is a toilet for the girls in the schools and the boys have a toilet.
It is no longer possible to do it in the 21st century and to remain blind in the village.
Therefore, to free the village from darkness, the work of providing electricity to that village is going on successfully.
Efforts are being made to provide a smoke free life to 5 crore families and we are moving towards victory.
Small traders, small businesses, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, buyers and sellers, all of them have been caught in the trap of robbers.
Successful programmes such as MUDRA Yojana, Stand-Up India, Jan Dhan Account etc.
Direct deposit of money into Aadhaar linked bank and direct benefit transfer to the beneficiary.
This is an opportunity for ordinary people to get rid of middlemen.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great man of this country who made India's unity his life supreme.
On one hand, 31st October marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, on the other hand is the birth anniversary of the vibrant Mahapurush of the country's unity.
I hope he has succeeded in it and he has brought everyone together.
On the same day, let us say that Indira Gandhi was condemned and the destiny of our nation was inexhaustible or unfortunate.
Just in the day of the birth of that great man who lived all his life for unity, in the day of Sardar's birth, the cruelty done to the fathers, a shield in history presents us with pain.
We should stay away from the thoughts of the roots, from the works of the roots and the country.
The journey of Sardar Saheb started in the fight for the farmers.
He was the son of the farmer.
Sardar Saheb had played a major role in making the freedom struggle a farmers one.
Now and then, we often hear the name Amull.
Some people are aware that today, people from outside India and India are familiar with all the products of Amul, but the idea of a Co-operative Milk Producers Union is that it is the result of Sardar Saheb's divine vision.The Kheda district was once known as Karara district.
He gave importance to this thinking in 1942.
What was that, in the form of Amul which is based on the well-being and prosperity of the farmers, we can clearly see it before us.
I respectfully bow down to Sardar Saheb.
On this day of Unity, on 31st October, wherever we may be, we must remember Sardar Saheb and make a pledge of unity.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is a part of this festival of Diwali and this is a festival of lights.
The knowledge and advice given by Guru Nanak Dev Ji is a guiding light not only for India but for the entire humanity today.
Guru Nanak Devs message of service, honesty and goodness for all.
When Guru Nanak Dev Bhai Lalo was his colleague here, he was full of malice, casteism and dogmas.
If we want to move forward with the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas then who can be a better guide than Guru Nanak Dev Ji
Guru Nanak Dev Ji also pays homage on the occasion of this festival.
My dear countrymen, once again, many congratulations to all of you on the occasion of this Diwali, in the name of the jawans of the country.
May your dreams and resolutions be fulfilled in every sense.
May your life be in peace and comfort.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of PMs address in 11th Episode of Mann Ki Baat 2.0 on 25.09.2016 My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
In the last few days, we have lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri sector of Jammu Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
This loss is not only for those families who lost their son, lost his brother and lost his husband.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We are proud of our army.
There are many opportunities for paras and political leaders to speak.
All the parents want all the schools and colleges to be fully operational.
Farmers also want their crops, crops, etc., to reach all over India.
I mean, the financial business also wants to be on the right track.
Over the past few days, business has started to work.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the path to peace, the path to progress and development for our problems.
We need to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that together we will find peace on all the issues and will prove the right path for the future generations of Kashmir.
The safety of the traditions of Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
The government will have to take some steps to ensure that the law is enforced.
I would like to tell the security forces that the power and rules of ours are meant for peace and tranquility to the common people of Kashmir and our security forces should follow them in the right way.
Sometimes those who think differently, they come up with new ideas.
From social media, I have had the opportunity to know a lot of things in recent times.
It gives us an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of people from all corners of India, which encourages the power of democracy.
A few days ago, a child named Harshavardhana, in the 11th grade, presented a different thinking before me.
He wrote, "After the Uri terror attack, I felt very sorry, I wanted to do something.
But I don't know what to do, a small student like me can do.
Yes, the child has presented it with a creative perspective.
But when the war of 1965 was fought, we were led by Lal Bahadur Shastri and there was a passion, anger and patriotism throughout the country.
Everyone wanted to do something, thought to do something.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried his best to touch this emotional level of the country in a very good way.
He inspired the common man of the country to work for the country with the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
Lal Bahadur Shastri has shown that there are other ways to express patriotism between the noise of the bomb and the gun.
When Mahatma Gandhi led the freedom struggle, and when the struggle was strong, and the movement needed a step forward, it used to be very effective in turning that power back to creative things in the society.
Let us and the army discharge our responsibilities, let the rulers discharge their duties, and if we, the countrymen and all the citizens play a constructive role in the spirit of this patriotism, then the country will surely scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.K.
When Karthik wrote to me through the Narendra Modi App, the athletes who went to the Paralympics wrote history, their performance was the victory of human spirit and human spirit.
Not only you two, but all of us in the country have taken a emotional connect with our players who participated in the Olympics.
Probably more than sports, Para Olympics and the achievements of our players have completely changed the human outlook and the vision of Divyangjan.
I will not forget the words of our victorious sister Deepa Malik.
When I won the medal, the sister said that through this medal, I defeated disability.
These words have great power.
This time, 19 lieutenants from our country, including three women from our country participated in the Para Olympics.
In comparison to other games, will power and determination are more important than physical fitness and sports skills in Divyangjans games.
You will be surprised to know that our players have won 4 medals in the highest ever medal tally so far - two gold, one silver and one bronze, and two gold medals in the category after 12 years.
He was losing his hand because of an electric shock.
Just imagine, a man, at the age of 23, won a gold medal once again at the age of 33, if he had won a second gold medal then what a great thing he would have done.
Marriappan Thangavelu won a gold medal in the Haijam.
Thangavelu was only 5 years old when he was right.
Poverty and his determination were not hindered.
He's not a living city, nor a middle-class family.
Whether it is difficult to lead a life full of difficulties or physical hardships, she won medals for the country with determination.
If it's a light lamp, it's been decorated with a variety of stamps.
Varun C.
She won Vengla Medal at the highest level in the city of Hijam.
It is also important that in our country, in our society and in our neighbourhood, we draw inspiration from our Divyang brothers and sisters.
Our compassion has also been enhanced and our vision for the Divyangjans has changed.Several people are aware of the immense contribution that has been made in this Paralysis this time.
A few days ago, Olympics were held in the same place.
Can anyone imagine that the Divyangjans have broken even the records of the common Olympics
It happened this time too.
In the coming days, India is making an effort to make a smooth transition for ParaOlysis.
My dear countrymen, last week, I had a wonderful experience at Navsari in Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
I told the people there, and people were astonished.
At that time, I had the opportunity to release a book, which included success stories in the lives of some Divyangjans.
It has been a very exciting episode.
I believe that the setting up of world records on the soil of Navsari by the Government of India is a very important thing.
In 8 hours, 600 Divyangjans were able to reach out to the machines that could not be heard.
I found a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It means the country has taken 125 crore steps towards cleanliness.
We have been moving in the right direction and we have been able to see how good the result is and what is happening with a little effort.
Therefore, all the ordinary citizens, rulers, government officials, bus stands, railways, schools, colleges, religious institutions, hospitals, poor villages, farmers and women, all play their part in the cleanliness drive.
Friends from the media also played a creative role.
In order to respect the health and the honour of the caregivers, especially the mothers and sisters, a squirrel needs to be removed in an open space.
Hence, the Open Defecation Free (ODF) movement has begun.
There is a healthy competition between the states and the districts.
The States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will soon be able to achieve the goal of Swachhta by 2022.
Come, let's move forward with a firm resolve.
In particular, in the recent past, I propose to present a scheme for our young friends, who are using technology in a big way.
The government of India has given you a number - 1969 - the right to know what is in your city about cleanliness.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the birth centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019, we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
By calling this number 1969, you will not only be able to understand the status of construction of toilets but will also be able to apply for construction of toilets.
You benefit from it.
Not only this, a Swachhta App has also been launched to know about the complaints related to swachhta and the redressal of the grievances.
You should make maximum use of this, especially the new generation.
The Government of India has also requested the corporate world to come forward.
Those who want to work for cleanliness, sponsor the young professionals.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Fellows.
In today's era, health is linked to cleanliness and cleanliness is essential to a revenue model as well.
Waste to wealth should also be a part of it.
Therefore, along with the Cleanliness Mission, we must also turn to Waste to Compost.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to prepare to buy compost from garbage.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors from cities and Commissioners from across the country are going to have detailed discussions on cleanliness and sanitation.
What can we do with technology?
How can we increase employment opportunities
Discussions will take place on all such issues.
I see new news about cleanliness coming.
Recently, I was informed in a newspaper that students from Gujarat University of Technology have gone to 107 villages to take up awareness campaign for toilet construction.
A team led by Wing Commander Paramvir Singh led the Swachhta message from Devprayag to Gangasagar about 2800 Kms from Devprayag to Gangasagar.
Each and every department of the Government of India has prepared a time table for one year.
I would like to appeal to the people that they should not hesitate in taking up the work of these departments at their respective places.
These days, everything related to cleanliness is going on.
First, after conducting survey of 73 cities, the sanitation status was presented to the public.
Now it is the turn of more than 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh.
With this, we are lagging behind, and next time we are confident of doing better in every city.
On October 2, this is the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It has been two years since the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
This will also light the lamp of Diwali in the homes of the poor.This time, on October 2, it is Sunday.
On that day, cant we be self-sustainable in cleaning garbage It will take two hours and four hours directly to participate in it.
In the memory of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something serious for the country.
In collaboration with O.O., the Joy of Going Week is being observed in various cities from 2nd to 8th October.
There is a way to collect food, clothing and other essentials to those in need.
That Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's centenary year begins today.
His contribution to public welfare, the principle of Antyodaya.
Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about the welfare of the last person.
How can the poor get the benefits of development
Let us focus on how the poor can benefit from the development of the society, the government and everyone.
I salute our revered Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji, who was an inspiration for all of us, who was blessed with our spiritual heritage.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on the occasion of Vijayadashami, I started Mann Ki Baat.
I have made sincere efforts to ensure that the work done by the government in Mann Ki Baat should not be done away with.
This episode of Mann Ki Baat should not be broadcast on political affiliations and accusations.
How does the common man in this country inspire me?
This means that Mann Ki Baat will not be held in less than 15-20 minutes earlier, but a new opportunity for social change has also emerged.
What else can be better than anyone?
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of PMs address in the 11th Episode of Mann Ki Baat 2.0 on 25.08.2016 My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
My dear countrymen, Tomorrow, 29th August is the birthday of the hockey wizard, Dhyan Chand.
He played an important role in making India a gold medal in the Olympic Games held in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
Those we love cricket have heard the name of the brandman.
He spoke about Dhyan Chand, about his score on He score and light runs (which he earns as much as he runs).
Dhyan Chand Ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and patriotism.
Once during a game in Kolkata, an opponent had played with a hockey match on the head of Dhyan Chand.
So there was 10 minutes left to finish the game.
It was said that Dhyan Chand had scored three goals in 10 minutes and responded with the goals.
My dear countrymen, whenever it comes to Mann Ki Baat, many suggestions are received on MyGov or on Narendra Modi App.
It's full of diversity.
But this time everyone has expressed their desire that I must say something about the Rio Olympics.
I am hopeful that the common man will continue to feel so close to the Olympics, and the Prime Minister of the country should say something about it with great enthusiasm.
There is so much love and enthusiasm among the citizens of India about sports without cricket.
Our daughters have once again proved that they are no less than anyone.
It seems that girls from all over India have taken up the mission of making India proud.
On MyGov, Shri Shekhar Thakur wrote that we could perform better in Olympics.
Prime Minister wrote, "Best wishes, First of all, I congratulate you on winning two medals in Honourable Modisar and Rio.
But I would like to invite your attention to whether our performance is good or not.
Our parents continue to focus on teaching and academic subjects even today.
Even today, the society considers sports to be a waste of time.
This thinking needs to be changed.
There is a need to enhance the spirit of the society.
No one can do this better.
We can't deny that we could not perform such a demonstration as we expected.
In some ways, even though our players have done well in India, the excellent performance performed here has not been expected there.
We only got two medals on the medal list.
But if you don't get a medal, you will notice that in many ways our players have shown a good performance.
You see, in the shooting, Bindraji secured the fourth position, and he lost a medal in a very short span of time.
This is what happened in Tennessee about Sania Mirza, Rohan Bopona and the pair.
We performed very well at the athletics programme.
For the first time in 32 years after the shooting, the Simple Babar Trek and Field Final was adjudged the best in the world.
It's a pleasure to know that after 36 years, the female hockey team arrived at the Olympics.
For the first time in the last 36 years, men have reached out to the Look Out stage in hockey.
Our team is very strong.
The performance of many players, such as Aditi Ashok, Dato Bhokanal and Annu Das was very good.
But, my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But if we do the same thing as we have done, perhaps we will be disappointed again.
We will prepare a roadmap on how we can be better.
The plan is to be prepared in a far-reaching manner - 2020, 2024 and 2028.
The state governments should also make such committees and what can be done in the field of sports, what can be done by each of our states
States should choose one or two of their own which can be strengthened.
I also appeal to the Sports Associations that they should conduct a thorough investigation.
I appeal to every citizen of India to share their thoughts on the subject of interest with me through the Narendra Modi App.
We're ready.
My dear countrymen, September 5 is the Teachers Day.
I spent a lot of time with the students on Teachers' Day and spent time like a student.
I learned a lot from little children.
For me, September 5 was Teacher's Day and Teaching Day.
But this time I have to go to the G-20 Summit so I have decided to express my feelings in Mann Ki Baat.
There's a teacher as much a place as a mother has in life.
I've seen teachers worrying about their relatives more than their own.
They sacrifice their lives for their disciples, for their students.
Now, after the Rio Olympics, we have been talking about Pulla Gopichand around us.
On Teachers Day, I salute Pulla Gopichand, his Tapasya, and his dedication to sports, and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
We always feel the contribution of teachers in our lives.
On 5th September, 2019, the former President of India, Dr.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan ji's birthday is being celebrated on Teachers' Day.
I remember a lot of stories from my teachers, because in our small village teachers were our heroes.
Even today he seems to teach me in the classroom.
Even today, I can say he's offering me a caraspondence course.
When he was 190 years old and his handwriting, he would be surprised to know that even at this age, he would write such beautiful letters.
Because my letters are so bad, and if you look at someone's good letters, I'll feel great respect in my mind.
My dear countrymen, Ganeshotsav is approaching.
Lord Ganesh brings about a change in the lives of our country, of our society, of our family, of each one of us.
Lokmanya Tilak started the Ganesh Festival and made this religious festival an occasion for awakening the country.
Even today, Ganesh Festivals are taking place not only in Maharashtra but in every corner of India.
All the youngsters are making a lot of preparations for this festival and will be very excited.
Some people are still trying hard to comply with the sentiment that Lokmanya Tilak had put forward.
Discussions are held on public issues, articles are held, flowers are held.
In its view, the topics touching the society are presented in a very artistic manner.
In a way, the Ganesh Festival is a major step towards public education.
Lokmanya Tilakan Swaraj was our birthright.
But we live in a free India.
It is true that festivals are the strength of the society.
The festival marks a new dawn of the life of a person and of a society.
Life is impossible without a festival, but it has to be shaped over time.
This time, many people have written to me in a special way about Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
Use Ganeshji made of mud in the village pond.
Statues made of plaster of Paris are not suitable to the environment.
He and many others have expressed a lot of pain.
I request you and I to make sculptures of Ganesh and Durga Devi and return to our ancient traditions.
Ganeshan is a vagabond.
So we don't have to make a disruptive Ganesh.
I don't know how much you accept this saying, but it's not just me, many people say it.
Many such institutions work hard to create a blend of kerosene and are spreading it.
Ganesh Utsav is an environmentally friendly social service.
The environment doesn't cause any serious damage to the river if it's made up of a river in the lake and merges into it again.
My best wishes to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna will be declared Mother Teresa on 4th September.
Mother Teresa used her whole life to serve the poor of India.
It is natural for every Indian to feel proud that Mother Theresa, who has served the poor all her life, is being given the status of a Saint.
On the 4th of September, the Government of India, under the leadership of our External Affairs Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj, is sending an official delegation to India for the benefit of 125 crore people.
We learn something every day from saints, sages, monks, great men.
We keep getting something, we keep learning and doing something good.
My dear countrymen, how big a change is being brought about when development becomes a mass movement.
Manpower is considered to be another form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments, has made a successful effort to clean the Ganga and to connect the people with it.
On the 20th of this month, a meeting of the village heads of the Ganga was held in Allahabad.
I wish all the concerned Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India the very best in implementing this idea.
I also express my gratitude to the Chief Ministers of those five states and the Chief Ministers for their great work in cleaning the Ganga with Jan Shakti.
My dear countrymen, there are times when I feel like touching my heart, I pay a special tribute to those people who have created these ideas.
On 15th July, more than one lakh students from more than 1700 schools of Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh have come together to write letters to their parents.
Some wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi and some wrote in Chhattisgarh.
In that letter, she told her parents that they needed toilets in their homes.
They asked for the same. Some people wrote that even if they did not celebrate their birthday this year, they would certainly have to make toilets.
This is what inspires us.
A 16 year old girl from Koppal district of Karnataka, Malma, who made a pledge against her family.
The family was not financially capable.
And the child stood firm on the curse.
The Chief of the village, Mohammad Shafi, who saw that he was performing the Satyagraha for the Malma Shauchalaya, arranged 18,000 rupees and made a toilet within a week.
The power of a girl named Malma and the village head like Mohammad Shafi is highly appreciated.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is the dream of every Indian.
It is the resolve of some Indians.
Some Indians have made it their goal.
The website also contains information about the same.
The winners of the Short Film Competition will be rewarded on Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October.
I want to tell the TV channels that you too have to make a film like this and compete with it.
Creativity will also give a boost to cleanliness, new slogans, new methods will be introduced, new inspiration will be given.
It all happens through the association of people and ordinary artists and there is no need for a big studio or a big camera to make a film.
Many may feel that the President will launch a radio channel.
But it's not a regular radio channel, it's a big step.
Bangladesh is in our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living in the same cultural tradition.
The Akashwani Maitri and the Bangladesh Barrier will share their programs and people from both sides will enjoy the programs of Akashwani.
Akashwani's contribution in building personal relationships is immense.
It was inaugurated by the President of India.
I express my gratitude to Bangladesh for their cooperation in this regard.
I convey my best wishes to Akashwani for their participation in foreign affairs.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the job of Prime Minister, but I am also a man like you.
Sometimes some emotional events touch my heart.
Such incidents inspire us to do something for the people of India.
I bow down to millions and millions of mothers of India who had toil hard to help others.
My dear countrymen, last year we had to suffer due to shortages, but this month of August was full of difficulties due to continuous rains.
There have been floods in some parts of the country again.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the Local Self Governments, the Social Institutions and the citizens have made a lot of efforts to do whatever possible.
But there were some other stories about the flood that I heard more about.
The month of August this year will remind us of the power of unity and of the great change that can be brought about when we move forward together.
August 2016, 2016, when there was a strong political divide, the parties which did not have an opportunity to oppose each other, almost 90 parties of the country and all the parties in the Parliament together passed the GST Act.
Its credit is for all parties.
This is an example of how big things can be done if all the parties come together in one direction.
Similarly, all the political parties of the country came together in one voice to discuss the developments in Kashmir and the situation there.
I believe in the strength of 1.25 billion people.
This morning, I had the opportunity to spend some time with the young people of Delhi.
In the coming days, I hope all the youngsters of our country shall be filled with excitement and enthusiasm for the Olympic Games.
The whole world will be in the game.
In the coming days, each one of us must do something to encourage our players wherever they are.
I am sure you will convey the message that you have sent to the athletes on the Narendra Modi App website.
Come, let us together try to enhance the dignity and self-esteem of all our players and appreciate their efforts.
On this occasion, while talking to you about Rio Olympics, I can tell you a poem by sending me a student from Punjab Central University, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay.
There are several other poets like this who have written these poems, some will write them down, some will write them down, some will have done the musical composition of the poems.
I wish to share with you the poetry that Suraj had sent me.
I am reminded of the passing away of the former President, Mr. Abdul Kalam, a young man named Mr.
Therefore, Shri Angadi has been encouraged to write down the steps taken by your government to realise the dreams of Abdul Kalam.
The coming century will be guided by technology.
If someone tries to hold it, then it will appear in new dresses far away and if we want to take technology along, we should be more prepared.
Therefore, we should also adopt research and innovation as the lifeline of technology.
The scope of employment generation has been enhanced due to the presence of a range of innovations, experiment and entrepreneurship.
If we set up the second generation of innovation, then our children will join it.
Therefore, the Government of India has launched the Atal Tinkering Labs.
10 lakh and another Rs. 10 lakh for implementation over the next 5 years.
Similarly, the incubation center is directly related to innovation.
If we can build self-reliant incubation centres as much as possible then we can create an institutional mechanism for start-ups, startups and startups to innovate.
Construction of new incubation centres and upgradation of old age is essential.
In our daily lives, we have to deal with many problems.
The mind wants to recover quickly when the disease occurs, so it eats some antibiotics.
You'll be free for a while, but you'll have to stop taking antibiotics without taking the advice of the doctors.
As long as the doctor doesn't write, we don't eat antibiotics.
We don't have to travel through the pathways like this.
And this war will go on, it will take years to prepare new medicines and carry out scientific research.
Until then, these diseases will continue to create new problems.
Therefore, we need to be ever vigilant about this.
Brother, take this antibiotics.
The doctor will tell you to eat 15 pills in five days.
The courses are to be completed by taking pills every day as advised by the doctor.
Even if we take more and more medicines, it will be beneficial for the virus.
Therefore, it is a matter of great concern that the number of days the doctor prescribes that one should follow the same course.
In medical terms, it's called antibiotics.
Therefore, it is also important to follow the rules of use of antibiotics.
Our government is committed to combat antibiotics.
You may have seen a red line in the area where the details of these antibiotics have been sold today.
I beg you to take care of it.
I wish to add one more thing on the subject of health.
I am concerned about the lives of pregnant women of our country.
If there is lack of blood during and after pregnancy, if there is any infection related to cervix or high blood pressure then it can not be said that what kind of problems are destroying their lives.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has been implementing a new mission in the last few months, i.e. Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Under this campaign, every pregnant woman on the 9th of every month will be provided free screening at Government health centres.
I mainly appeal to the gynecologists that on the 9th of every month, this service is not available for the poor mothers for free.
I'm sure you'll be a part of this.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is concerned about climate change, global warming and climate.
Community discussions are taking place in the country and the world.
India has been focusing on this for centuries.
Krishna Bhagwan is talking about the trees in the battlefield of Kurukshetra.
It has also been mentioned in the Shakuracharya that there is no medicinal plant or plant without medicine.
He who donates the tree, that tree, like his own offspring, grows the world and the world.
Therefore, parents who wish their own good, should plant good trees and protect them like kids.
Whether it is Geeta, Shakaracharya or the Asana of Mahabharat, there are some people who have shown their lives in these ideals, even in today's generation.
A few days ago, I noticed a daughter from Pune, Sonal, for example.
It touched my mind.
The festival of Mahabharat states that the tree is fulfilling the responsibilities of the entire world and Sonal has taken up the task of fulfilling not only his parents but also the wishes of the society.
Kisan Ghandu Maruti Mahatri from Narayanpur village in Kejunar Taluk, Maharashtra married her grandson Sonal in a very inspiring manner.
I saw the picture on social media.
I didn't see the groom's procession in the marriage, but it made me wonder that the plants were the only ones that were visible.
It was the scene that touched the mind.
Sonal is a graduate of Agriculture and this idea belongs to her.
You can see how nature has shown its way by giving Mavin Tai to those who are married.
In other words, Sonal's marriage has become an eternal story of natural love.I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Shriman Mahatraj for this innovative effort.
It can become a natural mass movement of trees and plants.
I am told that the Maharashtra government has planted nearly 1.5-2 crore trees across the state on July 1 this year and has decided to plant 3 crore trees next year.
It is not easy to plant 2.5 million saplings in Rajasthan.
Those who know about the soil of Rajasthan will understand how hard it is.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its green cover by 50 by 2029.
Gujarat and Van Mahotsav have a vibrant tradition.
This year, Gujarat has given many names such as Maav forest, Ekta forest and Shaheed forest to celebrate forest festival and plant millions of trees.
But for me, the journey to South Africa was a pilgrimage.
When it comes to South Africa, it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When we hear the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness in the world, it is the face of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
During my visit to South Africa, I had visited the Pooni settlement, known as Sarvodaya of the residence of Mahatma Gandhi.
I got the opportunity to travel by the train on which Mahatma Gandhi had travelled, from the Pier Martburg station, and this was the occasion when Mohandas ji was brought to power to Mahatma Gandhi.
I would also like to say that this time I have got the opportunity to meet many great people who have come here to give equal opportunities to their youth and society at large.
Nelson Mandela fought shoulder to shoulder and fought for 20-22 years and spent 20-22 years in prisons with him and thus inculcated the spirit of youth among them.
I have had the good fortune of seeing the close friends of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Ahmad Kathta, Mr. Lalu Chiba, Mr.
Even after such a great penance, one could not see the emotions like possession, possession, etc.
That is, the spirit of duty - the sign of duty enshrined in the Gita - I have seen the same in them.
There is no mantra of equality and equal opportunity for any society and government in this regard.
Their thinking is very natural.
They told me about an incident that the architect from Bangalore speaks.
I read the story of a woman who was cheated by a woman's fraud in an email worth Rs 11 lakh and then committed suicide.
As a woman, I feel very sad about their family.
I'd like to know what your opinion is about such a cheetah fraud mail.
He left everything within a few minutes.
You'll be confused sometimes.
They're gonna be as good as the story.
But recently, I had a very pleasant experience.
A few students from Aligarh have come to me.
The boys and the girls were very excited.
They came as a big album, and they had fun on their face.
Artistic painting was done at the station.
Not only this, in the rural areas, plastic bottles and oil containers were also collected, which were filled with soil and planted by them.
Then on one side of the railway station plastic bottles have been constructed and a new dimension has been given to them .
My dear countrymen, with the rainy season, the festive season has arrived in our country.
Just imagine, why can you give her a gift that will protect her life and not just be a woman who cooks food in our house
There must be a woman in our house who sanitizes, who will be the daughter of a poor mother.
This is the true meaning of Raksha Bandhan.
My dear countrymen, many of us were born in the post-independence era.
I was the first Prime Minister to be born in the post-independence era.
May the entire nation energised the entire nation in the spirit of our freedom struggle.May the spirit of freedom be blown up again.
Let's all create this atmosphere.
And the celebration of Independence Day should not be a government event but a peoples movement.
It should be our own festival like Deepavali.
I would also like you to take inspiration from patriotism and do some good work in this regard.
The pictures are definitely being sent to the Narendra Modi App.
To create an environment at home.
You might want to present those things in your mind as much as possible from the Red Fort.
As your representative, as your Chief Servant and as the Chief Servant, if I want to say these things in the Red Fort, I invite you.
I do not want the words from the Red Fort to be of the Prime Minister.
And now the platform of technology is easier for you to carry things to me.
I am grateful to Akashwani for performing 'Man Ki Baat' in regional languages at 8 pm.
Many of these suggestions help my government in its work.
There are also reports of a week delay in starting of monsoon and our concern.
Heat wave conditions in most parts of the country.
Climate change enhances these problems.
The forest area is low, the trees are cut.
In a way, man destroys nature and destroys himself.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
Discussions are taking place on the environment around the world.
You would be aware that in the last few days, the forests of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu Kashmir and the Himalayas have been on fire.
I have had the opportunity to interact with the Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha in the last few days.
I listened carefully to what every country has to say.
There has not been any such intense discussion in this regard even before the actual amount of funds that the Central Government has given and how much it has been spent.
In a way, in many areas, water conservation, environment, drought mitigation, animal protection and drought-affected areas, the Government of India has shown excellent work for the entire country.
I asked NITI Aayog to adopt best practices and take steps to implement them in other states.
Some states, especially Andhra and Gujarat, have fully leveraged technology.
Now I want to take the successful tests of the states through NITI Aayog to other areas.
In such cases, Jan Bhagidari is a key element of success.
If there is a comprehensive plan, then with the help of appropriate technology, the time-bound completion of the provisions can bring about a paradigm shift, I believe.
Irrigation is also important.
They aim to cover over 2-3 lakh hectares of land in a year on micro-irrigation.
Chhattisgarh has launched LokSuraj Jal-Suraj Abhiyan.
In Madhya Pradesh, about 22,000 ponds have been added under the Ballaram Talab scheme, which is not a small figure.
In some states, small canals have been constructed and projects for water conservation of 10 to 20 kilometers have been started.
It's a great experience.
I would like to say that not a single drop of rain water is available till June, July, August and September.
Now we have to think as to what should be the place of water conservation.
God has provided water according to our needs and nature has fulfilled our needs.
When we see plenty of water, we become careless and when the rainy season is over, we are afraid of water and how long will it last
During the last few days, the media had pointed out the problems of water availability.
I believe that media should provide guidelines for water conservation, enlarge its scope and also participate in ways to address water scarcity.
I invite them for that.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a New India.
We have to make a transparent India.
We have to take our projects to every corner of India without any parallels.
Make some changes in our old attitudes.
But today the situation has completely changed.
The world sees a view that never grows into a cashless society.
With electronic technology, money can be sent and taken from anywhere in the world.
When we come together, we can emerge as a money society.
You may have seen that along with the Jan Dhan account, the RPA CARD has been provided.
In the days to come, this card can be used as a credit debit card.
There's no need to take money or count or anything from the pocket.
Bank on Mobile - Universal Payments Interface Banking Transactions - PIB can change the system regularly.
How easy will the money transaction be through your mobile phone
Probably, if this is easy, the RPA CARDs don't have to walk with them all the time.
Moreover, the Post Offices have also been activated for banking services.
Illegal transactions will last forever.
The impact of black money will be greatly reduced.
So, my countrymen, I wish we could start this.
Once we start, we will be able to move forward very easily.
Today, if anyone thought about it 10 years ago, we'd have so many mobile phones in our hands.
That's why we don't have money and become a society.
It would have been better if it had happened without a call.
My dear countrymen, sometimes when we come to Olympics, or when we start playing, we lose our heads.
Maybe we got the silver.
In order to encourage our athletes who are going to take part in the Rio Olympics, there is a need to increase self-reliance and enthusiasm in their own way.
In the last one week, we were all worried about the results of the elections, especially what will be the impact of Assam.
Encouraging sports to our athletes and encourage them to take up sports, these things give everyone a lot of courage and strength.
India should make a mark in front of the world with the spirit of sportsmanship, not by putting everyone on the threshold of winning medals.
The results of the students who have worked hard throughout the year and have appeared in classes 10 and 12 are coming one after the other.
I want to tell those who could not succeed, that there is a lot to do in life.
A Mr. Gambhir from Madhya Pradesh...
He presented one of his major problems to me.
33% were not happy in the market.
Everyone told me that I had lost 90 percent of the market due to lack of 4 marks.
I don't know what I felt like a load in my mind.
I read your letter seriously.
I think, perhaps this pain is not only yours.
Millions and millions of students, like you, are also living in an environment that is radiant.
Can we find satisfaction in all things and lead the society towards peace and satisfaction
Your relatives, assistants, friends, these 89.
I have written 'Anand Giri Goswami' from Jodhpur, which is almost the same subject.
He says that my neighbour does not approve of our results.
If I had improved a little, I wouldn't remember the entire poem, but a poet I had read a long time ago that I painted the pain of life's canvas.
Some said it would be better if it were snow instead of blue.
Some people said it would have been better if they were there instead of putting these records here.
By the way, it would have been nice if I saw a picture of my pain when at least one or two people blew their tears.
Everyone was talking about the tupa.
Crores of students like you are the same.
You are capable of meeting the needs of the people.
I'd like to tell you this much and don't lose balance in such a situation.
Everyone expresses their needs.
But, be steadfast in your stand and try to do something more beautiful.
But if we are not satisfied with the availability, then the new target will never be fulfilled.
The strong foundation of victory is the basis of great success.
The discontent created out of victory cannot be a stepping stone to victory.
It's happening everywhere in life.
You must have heard of Santoor's musical instrument.
There was a time when the Santoor musical instrument was associated with folk music in the Kashmir valley.
But a person named Pandit Shivkumar took it as a great musical instrument in the world.
Shehanai - all over the world of our music has been in very limited space.
Most of the Maharaja's Darbars had a place at its entrance.
But when Ustad Bismillah Khan handed over it to Shehna, it became an unprecedented musical instrument.
It is true that the cost of prevention is very low, but the cost of recovery in case of an illness is very high.
If someone can help the poor, it is only for cleanliness.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga.
There is a special acceptance of Yoga in the whole world and respect and faith in it.
Yoga gives strength to the world under stress, to lead a balanced life.
Every person should spend 20-25 minutes in his life or 30 minutes in Yoga.
For this, 21st June is our motivation.
Sometimes a social environment becomes the reason for bringing about a change in the life of a person.
I hope you will take the initiative wherever you are on June 21.
In your neighbourhood, in your city, in your villages, in your schools and in institutions, if necessary, do it even in the office.
Start a month from now, and look, you'll be a partner on June 21.
I am going to participate in this programme in Chandigarh this time.
My dear countrymen, through this programme Mann Ki Baat, I am constantly getting connected with you.
Long ago, I had given you a mobile number in which you could call a missed call and hear Mann Ki Baat.
But it's made more simple.
Now you only need four to listen to Mann Ki Baat.
1922 If you call the miss, you can hear Mann Ki Baat wherever you are, in any language.
My dear countrymen, once again my greetings to all of you.
Don't forget the water I said.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
Mann Ki Baat is an occasion for me and you to come back as ever.
This time too, a lot of letters, comments, phone calls have been received, a lot of stories, suggestions, motivations...
People are discussing books on science, technology, new inventions, history, culture, business, life history and so on.
People requested me to discuss many other books as well.
But I don't have to say that I can't spare time to read so many books.
Let us start a regular book corner on the Narendra Modi App and write it and discuss it when we read a new book.
You can propose a name for this book corner.
I would like this book corner to become a live platform for readers writers and readers.
Several experts have made good efforts in the field of water conservation.
People are sharing information about traditional practices.
For example, in the village of Ara Karon in Ormachi Block, a little away from Ranchi in Jharkhand, the enthusiasm shown by the villagers towards water conservation has become a model for everyone.
The beautiful state of North East India, Meghalaya has become a state with its own water body.
I congratulate the government there.
Haryana needs very little water, but the emphasis is on agriculture which is not lost for the farmers.
I especially congratulate the Government of Haryana for their interaction with the farmers, for taking them out of traditional farming and for encouraging them to cultivate some water.
Now is the time for festivals.
Festivals are being held during the festive season.
Let's use these fairs for water conservation.
People from all sections of society come to the fair.
In these fairs, the message of water conservation can be delivered in a very good manner, be it exhibitions, street plays, or be it festivals, we can convey the message of water conservation very easily.
Friends, certain things in life fill us with enthusiasm.
Especially the achievements of the children and their actions give us a new energy.
That's why I want to talk about some children.
They are Nidhi Baip, Monish Joshi, DevamshiRavat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aranyatesh Ganguly, Hritik Alamada.
If I talk about them, you will be filled with pride and enthusiasm.
We all know that the word cancer is something that scares the world.
After winning the game, he becomes a champion after winning the medals.
But even before participating in the competition, it was a rare opportunity for them to become champions.
They're champions of life.
World Children's Winners Games were held in Moscow this month.
In this competition, competitions such as shooting, chess, swimming, running and football were held.
All these champions in our country won medals in tournaments.
Some of them have won medals in more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, you must have been proud of India's success in space beyond the skies.
Chandrayaan-2.
Sanjeev Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.K. from Telangana.
In terms of space, 2019 is a good year for India.
Our scientists launched ASAT in the month of March.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this.
On July 22, the country saw the arrival of Chandrayaan-2 from Sriharikota in the air.
The launch pictures of Chandrayaan 2 have filled the masses with pride, enthusiasm and joy.
Chandrayaan 2 mission is unique in many ways.
You will be happy to note that Chandrayaan 2 is totally Indian.
But always remember that within us is the ability to survive.
I have great hope that Chandrayaan 2 will inspire the youth of the country towards the world of science and innovation.
At the same time, science opens the path of development.
We are waiting for the eternity of September when Lander Vikram Rover Pragyan lands on the surface of the Moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to inform the students and the youth of the country about a very interesting competition.
The young minds of the country want to invite the youth of the country to the quiz competition, the curiosity in space, India's science mission, science and technology will be the main topic of discussion.
I urge my young friends and students to take part in this quiz, and through your participation, it will be a memorable and memorable one.
I especially urge the school and parents to do their best to make their school a success and motivate Principals and teachers.
Encourage all schools to join.
This will be a historic event in their lives for the students who are winners.
But for this, we have to participate in the quiz, get the highest marks and win.
Encourage more and more friends.
Dear friends, You must have noticed one thing.
Our Mann Ki Baat Swachhta Abhiyan has picked up momentum from time to time.
When they went on skill-training from the walls of the Over Bridges and the schools to the huts, the people joined them and it became a big movement.
You must have seen how Prayag was decorated with street paintings on the occasion of Kumbh.
Yogesh Saini and his friends played a big role in that.
We need to develop a culture of wealth from waste to wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward from garbage to gold.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very interesting word in MyGov.
Shri Mohammad Aslam ji was a resident of Shopian, Jammu Kashmir.
It is a matter of great happiness that he has written Mann Ki Baat.
I was actively involved in organizing the Back to Village for Community Mobility programme in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organized in the month of June.
I think it's important that such programs be organized every three months.
Also, an online monitoring system is required.
From this programme, one can understand the indomitable spirit and enthusiasm of the people of Kashmir towards joining the mainstream of development.
For the first time in this programme, large officers have come directly to the villages and even those officers who have not seen the villagers have come to their homes to understand the obstacles in development and to resolve the problems.
I asked them how to increase the income of the people.
The Prime Minister said the service of the officers has an impact on the lives of the common man and the villagers have expressed their concerns with open arms.
Several issues related to literacy, male ratio, health, sanitation, water conservation, electricity, water, girl child education and issues of senior citizens were discussed.
Friends, This event was not a government event for the officer to travel all day in the village and return to the village, but this time the authorities spent two days and one night in the panchayat, so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
Several initiatives have been taken to make this programme more attractive.
Under the leadership of Khelo India, sports has been conducted for children.
The Minister also distributed sports kits, job cards for the National Employment Guarantee Scheme, casteism and Scheduled Tribes certificates etc.
Such programs and peoples participation in them also tell us that the strength of progress is greater than the strength of bombs and guns of our brothers and sisters in Kashmir.
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred on the path of development and want to obstruct the path of development cannot achieve their goals.
My dear countrymen, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandra, the winner of Jnanpith award, spoke about the greatness of the month of Shravan in his poetry.
In it, he said - "Hodige Madige Aguedu" - "The Aragra Earth Magna means that the relationship between the rain's prey and the current is different, and the earth is scorched in its beauty.
People of different cultures and languages in India celebrate Shravana month in their own way.
When we look around in this weather, it seems as if the earth is covered with greenery.
We can see a new energy all around.
On the other hand, a lot of people fast on the other hand and eagerly wait for festivals like Janamasthmi and Nagapanchami.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a symbol of the love and affection of our brothers and sisters.
As a matter of devotion, this time more than 4 years of Amarnath Yatra has been attended by devotees.
From 1st July till now more than 3 lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than 60 days of this journey in 2015, this time only 28 days participated.
I especially congratulate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hard work for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
People returning from the journey change the spirit of the people of the state and the feeling of belonging.
All these houses are very helpful in the journey of pilgrimage in the future.
On the other hand, heavy rains have occurred in several parts of the country.
My dear countrymen, it is very difficult to decide where to begin Mann Ki Baat and where to stop it.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
There is no dearth of festivals in our country.
Many a times, it seems that India is a land of economic security through festivals.
Festivals change as an opportunity for economic security for the poor in the society.
You know that I use technology very well, so I get a lot of knowledge.
Ganesh V.
The Sawleshwar Walker wrote me this season is the tourist season.
A lot of national and foreign tourists are coming here.
People are celebrating Christmas holidays.
There are times when we hear things getting disappointed from every corner of the country.
And in the midst of that, millions and millions of people do something good in their own way, just like cowherds. This is the power of the country.
Every day, education and employment create new opportunities.
When the whole world is attracted to Yoga and celebrates International Yoga Day, we have believed and honoured the strength of India.
This spirit inspires us when we see India's vastness.
Today, the word swachhta is heard everywhere in the house.
People's participation in it is increasing.
That's a way of service.
I too have made small efforts in my own way.
I can't do it all alone.
My dear young friends, on the 15th of August, a preliminary discussion on Start-up India and Stand-up India was started at the Red Fort.
Later, the same was discussed in the departments of the Government.
Can India become a start-up capital
It was discussed whether we can start new startups, new innovations, start-ups, in the manufacturing sector, services and start-ups to provide a great opportunity for the youth of the states.
If you think so, it's wrong.
Youth from any corner of India are talented and they should be given an opportunity.
Start-up India and Stand-up India should not be confined to few cities alone.
It should spread to every corner of India.
I also urge the State Governments to extend it.
On the 16th of January, I will have a detailed discussion with you.
I will welcome your suggestions.
My dear young friends, January 12 is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
There are millions and millions of people like me who are inspired by Swami Vivekananda.
Since 1995, the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated on January 12, as the National Youth Festival.
This year it is being celebrated in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12th to 16th January 2018.
A mini-India is going to be built there - a young India.
In a way, you can see a drop of dreams.
We can see the power of the decisions.
Can you share your suggestions on this youth festival with me
I think this is the result of your initiative.
Dalipji, thank you a thousand.
You're a person working in this field?
That's why you can understand that you've had to face a lot of trouble.
Sometimes the disabled, sometimes the disabled, or the disabled, or the differently-abled, how many words
Each word has its own significance.
This year, the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
I hope you take it.
Have we started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan
It will help in developing all types of infrastructure and bringing them to ease.
Be it school, hospital, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, parking, lift, braille, all these things need innovation to make it easier.
Technology is needed, a system is needed, and sensitivity is needed.
The effort is on and the public participation is on.
People like it.
You don't have to remove the files before that.
Actually, the plans are meant for the common man and the dalits.
In the recent past, the Government of India has made an inquiry into the benefits of the schemes to the right beneficiaries.
In our country gas cylinders are being subsidized.
It was not checked whether they were keeping the accounts properly.
Therefore, the government has made some changes in this.
The mission is to provide Aadhaar card to the largest Direct Benefit Transfer scheme in the world through the Jan Dhan account, and directly credited into the bank account of the beneficiary.
I am proud to say that this Guinness Book of World Records has been ranked as the worlds largest successful Direct Benefit Transfer scheme.
The Aadhaar camp on the one hand, the Jan Dhan account on the other, and the list of beneficiaries compiled by the Central and State Governments, and the linking of Aadhaar with the bank account on the other hand, has been going on.
Now money is being deposited directly into the bank accounts of the workers in many places.
There were also complaints about scholarship of students and efforts have been made to resolve them.
About 40 crore rupees have been directly transferred to the accounts of the beneficiaries through various schemes.
The projects are covered under Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme from around 35 to 40.
My dear countrymen, January 26th is the golden moment of the Indian Republic.
Two days in the Parliament, a special discussion on the Constitution was held.
It was a good experience.
We are more aware of our duties in the most part of the election time and we are convinced that voting is our duty through advertisements and wall writings.
Why cant we talk about our duties in everyday life as in the time of elections
Can we meet on the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 26th January and hold discussions on duties in schools, colleges, villages, cities and organizations
If 1.25 billion people take one step after another and fulfil their duties then it will be an unforgettable history.
At least we'll start the discussions.
You might have got a chance to go somewhere.
Festivals have their own importance in social life.
News of natural disasters continues to come from every corner of the world.
We must never have thought or imagined about these difficulties.
Now we are experiencing this thing as to how rapidly the impact of climate change is increasing.
The central government is also working with them shoulder to shoulder.
But when we see such misery in the environment, we have to think about the need for change.
That's a good start.
Today, I received a phone call from Jalandhar, Punjab, from where I am speaking from Lakhwinder Singh, in Jalandhar district of Punjab.
Lakhwinder Singh, I was very happy to hear your questions.
The main reason for my happiness is that you are doing organic farming.
Moreover, along with organic farming, you are well aware of the problems of the farmers.
But it is not right to think that this is happening only in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the nature of all of us Indians that we traditionally follow the method of burning the residue of crops.
First of all, we had no sense of loss.
Everyone does, we do.
Secondly, they didn't train how to do this.
Well, you're right.
But these are not real.
The remains of the crop are precious.
Second, they burn the surface of the earth with fire.
We can't live even if the heart is strong.
Similarly, if we burn the residue of the crop, it burns not only the skin of our mother Earth.
It can also be used as the food of animals, which protects our land.
Not only that, put the same earth's fertilizer there, it's double the profit.
Once I got the opportunity to talk to the farmers who are engaged in the farming of bananas.
They shared a good experience.
Hector had to spend five thousand, ten thousand, and fifteen thousand rupees a year to remove the remains of banana after harvest.
The remains of the banana remain the same until people bring the tractor.
However, some farmers buried these residues of bananas in the soil with 6-8 inches of it.
Last time I discussed organ donation at Mann Ki Baat.
He also spoke of the helpline for organ donation.
Among the dignitaries present on the occasion were renowned filmmakers like Ravin Tandon and others.
With organ donation you can save many precious lives.
In a way, organ donation offers eternity.
Transplanting organs from one body to another gives a new lease of life.
What else is a greater donation than this?
On 27th November, a national level registration of organ transplant was started for organ donation to wait for organ transplants.
I am confident that there will be widespread awakening in every constituency and in the truest sense, the best help is given to the needy.
For this, everyone has to come forward.
December 3rd is the International Day of Persons with Disabilities as I have mentioned earlier.
Persons with physical and mental disabilities are endowed with indomitable will and courage.
They feel sad when they're abducted.
When little trouble comes, we start crying.
When we think of how they live, we feel the slightest pain.
How do they live?
Their determination, their way of life and their enthusiasm to convert crisis into opportunity is commendable.
Today, I would like to mention Javed Ahmad.
His age is 40 or 42 years.
In 1996, the terrorists shot him in Kashmir.
He was a victim of a terrorist's gun and survived miraculously.
But one of his kidneys was destroyed and one part of the intestine was lost.
There was a serious damage to the spinal cord.
He's never lost his ability to stand on his own feet, but he failed.
The wound of terrorism didn't beat him.
How can we improve the commutation of physically challenged persons, how to put in place systems in public places and government offices
Is Javed's life capable of inspiring every corner of India
On 3rd December, I specially remember Javed Ahmad's life, his penance and his dedication.
Because of lack of time, I only talk about Javed, but in every corner of India, the same kind of diyas of inspiration are being lit.
Our country is so big.
There's a lot of things that depend on the government.
Over a period of time, experience changes our perspective on governmental practices.
They are doing a lot of social work in India.
Millions of people may be working around us in this way.
If you see the sick people in love, what's the pleasure?
Are they participating themselves in the joys of the society?
I congratulate all the ASHA workers of India in the name of 'Jamuni'.
While discussing e-books, one of the young students of class 8 or 9 or 10 of the nearby schools will be asked to know about what is happening here.
And, in fact, you are becoming a good teacher of a society.
I extend a warm welcome to all of you for the nation-building process.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is concerned about climate change.
A friend who led me to share this extraordinary experience sent me an ink to see and feel it.
But if they say something like that then there will not be any other educated person.
They are engaged in the work of providing light to the poor in their area using solar energy.
They fought against darkness and degraded their name.
They built a plant of solar energy in a group of women.
They pay a rent of Rs 100 per month to the local residents.
We know what big people in the world are doing about climate change.
Thank you very much for the news.
But the beginning is very good.
In a short span of time, Rs. 40,000 crore (Rs. 42,000 crore) have been transferred to 66 lakh people under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Be it the labourers who are engaged in labour, the journalists, milkmen or those who are employed in the labor class, this will be of immense benefit to them.
Abhishek also shared his happiness.
There are so many things that come to me.
The other is from Mumbai to Shailesh Bhosale.
8.5 Lakhs under MUDRA Yojana.
I had said at the time of our Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that through that scheme, new entrepreneurs are coming up.
However, Shylesh Bhosale has been successful in this process.
However, many people don't know much about the scheme.
How's the structure of the program?
How should Logo be?
But, I hope so many more suggestions.
A lot of basic projects are required.
The award will be given to those who are active participants.
And so many other gifts have been announced.
My dear brothers, the winter month is beginning.
Make a good family atmosphere and celebrate it as a festival and come together to exercise.
Through the Exercise, you will be able to understand the extent to which Chaitanya was born.
The body will become more dynamic throughout the day.
If there's a good weather, you're gonna have to be good.
My dear countrymen, once again, my best wishes to you.
Jai Hind.
On 3rd October last year, for the first time, I got the opportunity to present Mann Ki Baat.
One year through Mann Ki Baat.
Our ancestors used to say that the voice of the people is the voice of the people.
From my experiences in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I can say that this idea of our ancestors is very powerful and true because I have experienced it.
A lot of things started moving from the bottom to the government.
And, it is true that the government's basic principle is that the information should come from the bottom to the top and the guidelines come down.
Had anyone ever thought that such Mann Ki Baat would be a source of knowledge
Then it happened.
So, Mann Ki Baat provided an opportunity to express the strength of the community.
One day I said self with daughter and the whole world was astonished.
It was a silent revolution.
People from every corner of India have sent lakhs of pictures.
We have so much heritage that perhaps the tourism department of the Government of India or the state government has not even thought about it.
Mann Ki Baat has become a platform for the government and people have taken up the task without spending a single rupee.
I was happy to mention Gandhiji in my first Mann Ki Baat in October last year.
On Gandhi Jayanti, I had urged the people to celebrate the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October, by promoting Khadi products across the country.
There was a time for the nation as Khadi.
Can't it be turned into Khadi for fashion as a change of time?
I had expressed my desire to buy Khadi to the people and do something.
After that, I would like to say this thing with happiness that the Khadi sale has almost doubled.
This wasn't done by public advertising.
This is not the cost of expenditure of lakhs and crores.
A experience of manpower and a victory.
Once in Mann Ki Baat, I told you, the poor man's house smokes wood, the children cry.
Shouldn't they get gas cylinders?
Today I can say this thing with great happiness that 30 lakh families of our country have given up their LPG subsidy.
I have seen a retired school teacher on the channel, standing in queue to refuse a widowed female subsidy.
It's hard for the middle class to leave the subsidy to the low-lying people.
However, such persons have given up their subsidy.
Is this a silent revolution?
Can't we show strength in this?
Governments must also include the lesson that what is happening within the framework of our government, there is a great power - strength, vibrancy and determination, outside this framework.
What else would you like to be happy?
I thought about conducting a new experiment this time in Mann Ki Baat.
There will not be any place in India where people dont call.
It's a pleasant experience.
People of all ages have sent messages.
I wanted to listen to some messages on my own and I liked it too.
My team is taking action on the rest.
All the departments of the government will definitely consider your suggestions.
But one thing surprised me and made me happy.
Sometimes it seems that we are all infidel.
But my experience is different.
These fifty thousand people spoke in their own way.
This can be gauged from the fact that the common man in the country is thinking constructively, and is it an asset for the nation
Probably there are only one or two phone calls from serious complaints.
It was heartening to note that more than 90 per cent of the energy was supplied by us.
They must be listening to the radio.
From Alwar in Rajasthan, Acharya sent me a message.
My message to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, is that you please request the people of India to use the maximum possible opportunities for Diwali through this Mann Ki Baat programme.
This will not only benefit the environment but will also provide employment opportunities to thousands of potter brothers and sisters.
I believe that this sentiment of yours, like the 'Pawan Acharya', will continue to spread and reach every corner of India.
I would like to tell the countrymen that if we implement the same thing in the coming festive season, then it will lighten their homes and spread the light in the homes of the poor.
My dear countrymen, on Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army.
With our forces that protect the sea-carriers.
50 years of war with Pakistan in 1965.
An exhibition titled Shauryanjali was organized at India Gate, New Delhi.
What wasn't there?
If you want to make history, then it is necessary to know and understand the nuances of history.
History connects us to our roots.
If we lose any connection with history then the possibility of making history is also completely ignored.
Don't be as fast as I am.
I went back in two and a half hours.
The kid's right.
And I have heard more and more criticism.
I have never felt that there was a bad feeling in me that even in the good parliament that I see there is a discussion on India's cleanliness.
Secondly, on the one hand, the Parliament, on the other hand, a child of this country, both of them talk about cleanliness, and on the other hand, what is a greater good fortune for a country
This revolution of ideas creates an atmosphere of hatred towards dirtiness and has created an awareness about cleanliness.
This will force the governments to work.
We Indians have to take this task forward as we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, to realise the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi said?
When there is an opportunity to choose between cleanliness and freedom, I will first choose cleanliness and then independence.
Gandhiji gave importance to cleanliness rather than freedom.
Gulshan Arora, from Delhi.
It is in this context that we want to know about the birth centenary of Deen Dayal Ji.
My dear countrymen, the lives of great men always inspire us.
Our work is not an assessment of the way our great men followed the thought process.
Every person who lives and dies for the country is an inspiration for us.
These days, there are occasions for many great men to remember.
Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay on 25th September, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on 2nd October, Jai Prakash Narayan on 11th October, and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
On 2nd October, I would particularly like to share one more wish.
Even if you take advantage of it, give your hand as much importance as you can.
A lot of work is done by our weaver brothers.
We will reach the homes of the poor widow who makes khadi.
Therefore, it will certainly be Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) to provide a house to every one of you and a place for your body.
Look, the sales were almost doubled last time.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy about one thing.
I share it with you.
When I went to Calcutta in May, the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose had come to see me.
Everything was arranged by his son-in-law.
I have had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with my family and friends of Subhas Chandra Bose.
My name is Bhargava Kanade.
I would like to inform you that in future, the participation of the younger generation will increase and the participation of the younger generation will also increase in government elections and governance in the future.
He said, Bharagavi has said about the inclusion and voting of the Electoral Roll.
The percentage of voting is increasing and I particularly want to congratulate the Election Commission of India in this regard.
A few years ago, we saw that our Election Commission was working only as a regulator, but it has changed a lot over the last few years.
This is a very good change, but it does not matter that only the Election Commission has been working.
Generally, I would like to say that on the election day, first voting and then drinking water.
One, a 7 year old student studies in class 7 at Kshittij Pandey, Kendriya Vidyalaya in Banaras Hindu University.
I wish that there is a need to increase the interest of science in the children of our country.
9 years old.
When she asked her father, she said she's been saying all this since she was 5.
I asked, where did you learn?
So I wanted to share it with you.
We're doing a lot of things on TV that you see and don't know through newspapers.
What's the problem to do once a month?
All the Airmen have to wait for half-three-hours.
It's a month's launch right now.
Starting from Germany, the citizens of India were sensitized on the subject of freedom struggle through radio.
The launch of Azad Hind Radio was done through weekly news bulletins.
He telecasted all the languages English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushtu and Urdu.
I too have completed one year in the form of Mann Ki Baat through Akashwani.
We'll meet at Mann Ki Baat next month.
May your instructions continue.
The government is benefitting from your suggestions.
It's going to start a good change.
Your partnership is valuable and invaluable.
I once again wish you all the best.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of the text of PMs Mann ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 30.08.2015 My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
My greetings to you and I have the opportunity to present before you what is in your minds.
Onam is celebrated far away by the people of South India and on this occasion the entire country celebrated me with the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The Government of India has launched new schemes for social security for the common man.
In a short span of time, all my friends have adopted these schemes.
At the sacred festival of Raksha Bandhan, I had requested our sisters to implement the safety measures.
I see this as a good sign.
My best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, a year ago, I had made Jan Dhan scheme available to a large number of people to talk to you.
The main source of savings is in the banking sector and in order to reach the poorest of the poor, Bank Mitra scheme has been formulated.
Today, more than one lakh bank friends are working across the country.
This has provided employment to the youth.
You will be happy to know that in the last one year, more than one lakh to one thousand financial awareness camps have been organized for the banking sector, for the poor to connect with it.
I have put these things in front of you and it's your duty to continue this relationship.
All our accounts must be efficient.
In the last few days, I have had the opportunity to meet the scholars of Sufi traditions.
Her voice and her conversational style, that is, the simplicity and humility that are reflected in the Sufi tradition - are the rhythms of music.
I've been invited to participate, and it's a matter of great pleasure for me that they invited me to Bodh Gaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodh Gaya.
There will be a chance to go to Bodh Gaya with these scholars from all over the world.
It will be a pleasant moment for me and my dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again wish to tell you what is in my mind.
A long time ago, I have referred to these topics.
You must have heard me in the Parliament, you must have heard me in the General Assembly, you must have heard Mann Ki Baat.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, There is nothing to be afraid of.
I don't give any such opportunity.
We had an ordinance in place.
Tomorrow, August 31, 2018, the tenure of the Ordinance is expiring.
I've decided if the term is over.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan I would like to remind you that this is not just a slogan but a mantra for us.
I want to tell you something else.
Two days ago, the war of 1965 completed 50 years.
Whenever we remember the battle of 1965, we always remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
He will also remember his motto Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
At the same time, it is natural to remember all the martyrs of India's tri-color and its glory.
I salute all those involved in the 65th war victory.
We salute our heroes.
Such moments of history are inspiring us.
Just last week, as I had the opportunity to interact with the people of Sufi tradition, I had the opportunity to interact with leading scientists of the country for hours and hear their views.
India has done well in various fields of science and I am very happy.
In fact, our scientists do great things.
How do we get this kind of research into common people?
How to use these principles on a practical basis?
I had said in Mann Ki Baat last year that we should guide our students to science.
After this discussion, I felt there were many opportunities and possibilities.
I would like to tell my dear young friends something special.
Recently, India has been home to so many guests from all over the world.
Why not connect our festivals with cleanliness
It was a good start this year.
There is a shortage of food grains, oil seeds and pulses in our country.
The poor need food grains to eat and oil is required to cook vegetables.
However, this time the crops are producing lot of happiness, this year there has been an increase of about 50 per cent in food grains and 33 per cent in oilseed.
I especially congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters who have been responsible for this thing.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The more the farmer of the country has a relationship with the land, the more is the relationship between the soldier and the country.
In the Kargil war, each of our soldiers has sent a hundred enemy soldiers.
It is the result of their collective sacrifices that India has been able to speak before the world today.
Today, on Kargil Vijay Diwas, my 100 greetings to our brave soldiers.
Sree Chitraragavachari in Chennai has sent a number of suggestions.
I believe that all of you will send good instructions.
I would like to clarify my point of view on one thing.
I do not want to give any advice, but at the same time, there is no way for the State Governments, the Central Government or the local bodies to get rid of their responsibilities.
Two days ago, I witnessed a vehicle accident in Delhi, and the scooter was trapped inside the road even after 10 minutes of the accident.
He didn't get any help.
Similarly, many people write to me on such topics. You talk about road safety issues and make the general public aware.
My dear countrymen, may there be a lot of people, I dont remember the names of all, I had a lot of concern about it.
In our country, every accident takes place every minute.
There is one death every four minutes in road accidents.
The most disturbing is the fact that nearly one-third of those who die are young people between the ages of 15 to 25 and each death takes the entire family.
One more interesting thing is that a small group of government officials from the Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, their work has touched my heart.
'Brother No. 1' means an excellent brother can give his sister a toilet as a gift on Raksha Bandhan.
I urge all such brothers and sisters to make toilets in their sisters so that the entire district, mothers and sisters do not have to defecate in the open.
Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh is a small village where workers live.
The people of that village have started and completed the work of constructing toilets in the last few months.
Now no one in that village will have to defecate in the open.
Bhavesh Dhakka writes to me from Guwahati about the problems of the North-East.
It was also decided to organize a 7-day Camp in the States of Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim and a team of Central Government officials to visit the North-East.
The results of this effort will be realized in the days to come.
It is a matter of great concern that there is no bias towards science.
In a way, science and technology are the key drivers of growth.
Our IAS officers have come to a very large level by learning a lot and often they have to interact with students from schools and colleges that are close to two-four hours a week, and they have their own strengths.
We have started it and in the coming years our villages will get 24 hours of electricity.
The children of the village should not face any problem while studying during the exam days.
If we want to start small and big industries in the villages then we also need electricity.
Today, if they want to charge mobile, they want to go to the next village.
The facilities available in the cities should also be available to the villages.
That is why Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana was started.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk about every Indian.
Similarly, the months of August and September are our festivals.
We have a lot of festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
Several things had been said and heard about the things of 130 crore people sitting among the needy with their family members in a grand atmosphere.
Sometimes it becomes an inspiration for those who want their own things.
I was just my words, but I didn't feel like I didn't do it, it's you.
I felt empty.
Anyway, the last chance is here.
In a family environment, Mann Ki Baat, small and small things.
May this programme continue to inspire the spirit of a New India in a way, by instilling a new spirit in the society and in the life that leads to change.
There have been several messages in the past months in which people have said that lack of 'Mann ki Baat' is worrying.
Sometimes I feel that this is the journey from my 'self' to 'Sansthi'.
This is the journey from I to Nami.
For me, this conversation with you was in a way a part of the experience of my spiritual journey.
Many people asked a lot of questions during the election campaign why I had gone to Kedarnath.
For me, I had the opportunity to face me.
I went to see me in a way.
Sometimes, my thought process becomes a source of inspiration, and sometimes becomes a part of it.
When people put forward the challenges faced by the country and the society, they also suggest solutions.
In the letters, people explain the problems, but at the same time they say peace, some suggestions, some ideas, some things appear obvious or indirectly.
That is, in your words, I can feel a clue as to how peace is getting together for problems in a way.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror to the country and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of self-confidence, strength and talent among the people.
They have to unite that power and that skill, they have to be given an opportunity, they have to be implemented.
Mann Ki Baat has said that 130 crore people want to come together strongly and actively in the progress of the country.
You can imagine how happy my mind is when I analyze these things and how much energy I get.
This belief was the basis of your faith.
With this feeling, let us continue with Mann Ki Baat.
Therefore, the election was not for the country, it was not for selfishness, it was an election for the protection of democracy.
Probably no country in the world would have voted for democracy, not just for democracy, but for the rights, rights and needs of the people there.
Such an election was witnessed by the country in 1977.
In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India, more than 61 crore people voted, and this figure is common for us.
But considering the population of the whole world, more and more people than any other country except China have voted in India.
The number of people voted in 2019 is more than double the total population of the United States.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of Europe.
This reflects the vastness and diversity of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha Elections was the largest democratic election in world history.
You can imagine how much resources and manpower were required for conducting such an election.
This election is the result of the efforts of lakhs of teachers, officers and other officers working day and night.
About 3 lakh members of paramilitary forces have been responsible for this successful campaign of democracy and more than 20 lakh police personnel of different states have been performing their duties and have worked hard.
It was the result of their hard work that more and more people voted this time than before.
More than 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh electronic voting machines and more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines were required to vote in the country.
You can imagine how big the preparations are.
A voter should not be able to exercise his right to vote, that's why he did all this.
In a remote part of Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station was set up for only one female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the Election Commission had to travel for two days to reach there.
This is the right respect for democracy.
The highest polling station in the world is also in India.
This polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh .
In this election, the percentage of votes for women and men was almost equal.
Another interesting fact in this regard is that there are 78 women members in the Parliament who have made history this time.
I congratulate the Election Commission and the people associated with the electoral process and salute the alert voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have often heard me tell you about the book, the book that I do not want.
I said, "Use books instead of flowers" to welcome people.
Since then, people have started giving books everywhere.
His stories cover the entire spirit of India.
While reading the story of 'Nasa' written by him, my mind turned into an economic imbalance spreading in the society.
I remembered the days of my youth.
It came to mind as to how the entire night had been discussed on this subject.
If you are not aware of the stories of the son of Jamindar, Ishwari and Bir of the poor family, then you will not be able to understand when it comes under the influence of bad friends.
A sensitive child, a love for his grandmother, a feeling that he was right at a young age.
We can see that when we get to Grandma's house in the age group of 4-5 years and get to see the man-made sensation at the peak when we get to see him from the place where he gets to take the slippers from the venue of the festival.
Having lost his harvest, the farmer was happy that he wouldn't have to sleep in the field in the extreme cold.
Although these stories are from a century old, yet their relevance remains the same even today.
K.
Muraleedharan runs a small tea shop.
Today, this library is a guide for all, including tribal children.
In Gujarat, the peoples movement, called 'Vasche Gujarat', was a successful experiment.
Millions of people of all age groups participated in this initiative to read books.
In today's digital world, during the time of the Google Guru, I have found some time to request you, and I have to spend some time in your daily activities, with books.
You must write about the book that is being read in the 'NarendraModi App' so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat get to know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about the challenge not only today but also in the future.
I was reading your comments on 'NarendraModi App' and 'MyGov.... many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Apart from Pawan Gauri from Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Paraida from Bhubaneswar, many other people have written about the challenges related to water like Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf.
Water has great importance in our culture.
Bless you as a mother and be gracious to us.
Lack of water affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 per cent of the water is being consumed through the rains throughout the year.
Just 8 percent.
It's time to find peace to this problem.
We will find peace on this issue with the capacity, cooperation and determination of 1 crore 30 million people, with peoples participation, just like other issues.
Giving the maximum importance to water, the Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created in the country.
This will enable all water-related issues to be resolved.
A few days ago, I decided to do something different.
I wrote letters to villagers from all over the country.
I wrote that to save water, to collect water and not to lose every rain, the people of the village called a meeting and thought with the villagers.
I am very happy that they have done it and in thousands of panchayats on the 22nd of this month, they have done shramdaan.
The people of the villages resolved to collect every drop of water.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you the story of a sarpanch.
Listen to the words of Dalip Kumar Ravidas ji, "My name is Dal Kumar Ravidas ji. When the Prime Minister wrote a letter to us, we did not believe that the Prime Minister has written such a letter to us.
The people there are ready to play their part in water conservation once again.
I convey my best wishes to all the heads of villages and all the villagers for their enthusiasm.
The people of the village now feel that they are competing to build a temple for water in their village.
As I have said, positive and positive changes can be made through social efforts.
There is no single trick in the country to deal with the water crisis.
Several efforts are being made in different ways for this purpose.
But everyone's aim is to save water and save water.
In Punjab, drainage lines are being repaired.
This effort will help in avoiding flooding.
The construction of a tank in Timmypalli, Telangana has transformed the lives of the villagers.
Small ponds built on the agricultural land in Kabirdham in Rajasthan have become a big change.
I read about a social initiative undertaken in Vellore in Tamil Nadu where 20,000 women mobilized to revive the Naga river.
They also read about the women in Gawal who have made great efforts to collect rain water in collaboration with each other.
Several such initiatives are being taken together and I am confident that with a concerted effort, it will be possible to achieve the impossible.
When people come together, water will be preserved.
I say, the water is touching, and I say that a new life will be built with the touch of that touch of water.
To protect every drop of water, a 'Water Conservation Campaign' will be organized.
In this, we can talk about water-related issues as well as promote water conservation practices.
I would especially urge the distinguished personalities of various fields to undertake a separate campaign for water conservation.
Whether it is in the film field, in the sports field, in the media or in the media, people associated with social organizations, people associated with cultural organizations, people who tell stories and those who sing praises, all of them should lead this movement in their own way.
Creating society, uniting society, joining society.
Look, we'll see a change in our eyes.
I request all of you to share information on the traditional methods of water conservation.
If one of you has the opportunity to visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Pujya Bapu, there is another house behind Bapu's house where there is a 200-year-old water storage facility and it still has water.
There's a plan to stop the rain.
I always say that all the people visiting the Kirti Mandir must visit that water reservoir.
There are several such water bodies in different parts of the country.
All of you can also share your information using an hanshakti4alshakti hash tag.
My dear countrymen, I would like to once again express my gratitude to you and to the people of the world.
Everyone, whenever the sun rises in every corner of the world, those who love Yoga welcome the sun, it is a journey until the sun sets.
In a tweet, the Prime Minister said, People from all over the world, Prime Minister, people from all walks of life, and even the common man, how they have celebrated Yoga in their own country.
That day the world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that a healthy and sensitive person is required to build a healthy society, and this is what Yoga promises.
Therefore, spreading Yoga is an important part of social service.
Should such a service be accepted and respected
It was a matter of great happiness for me to announce the Prime Ministers Award for Excellence in Yoga for 2019, for the promotion and propagation of Yoga.
You cannot imagine how important it has played an important role in spreading Yoga about the great organizations around the world.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs various institutes and training courses.
Miss from Italy.
These are very inspiring examples before us.
If this is a matter related to Yoga then can Indians stay behind
The Bihar School of Yoga at Munger was also honored and they have been working with dedication for the past decade.
Similarly, he also honored Swami Rajarishi Muni, who established the Life Mission and the Lakulish Yoga University.
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll wait for your instructions.
For me, joining your thoughts is a great journey, it is only because of Mann Ki Baat.
Come, let's sit together, let's share the thoughts.
I'll listen to what you have in mind, keep it safe, understand it.
Sometimes we try to live with your feelings.
You must have your blessings.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Come, let us together share the happiness of Mann Ki Baat and carry out the responsibilities of our lives.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019.
Greetings to my fellow citizens.
These brave hearts sacrificed their lives for 1.25 billion Indians.
To sleep peacefully, these brave sons of ours kept the night day.
At the same time, the attackers were given a reply in their own language.
You must have seen what kind of actions were taken within 100 hours of the attack.
The army is determined to root out the terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, through the medium, we witnessed an inspiring response from their families, which would further boost the morale of the entire nation.
The emotions expressed by Shri Ramanujacharya, father of the brave Jawan Ratan Thakur in Bhagalpur in Bihar at this time of grief are a source of inspiration to all of us.
The nation salutes the indomitable courage of Smt. Prasanna Shah, a martyr of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
The only son of his own has been sworn to join the CRPF.
This is the feeling that we see in every home of our brave martyrs.
I want to tell the youth that they want to know the feelings expressed by these families and try to understand them.
It is an inspiration for the future of a vibrant India.
My dear countrymen, in the long run since independence, the war memorial waiting for all of us is being realized.
In this context, it is natural for people to have curiosity and excitement.
Onkar Shetty, from Karnataka's garment, Shri Narendra Modi, expressed happiness at the completion of the National War Memorial.
I was astonished and pained by the fact that there was not a National War Memorial in India for so long.
We need a War Memorial to preserve the saga of valour of our brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the nation.
I've decided that such a monument should be built.
I am happy that the decision to build the National War Memorial has been completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, i.e. on 25 February, millions of our countrymen will dedicate this National Military Memorial to our troops.
The country will make a small effort to repay the debt.
This new monument is built near the heart of Delhi, that is, India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I am confident that going to this National Military Memorial will be like visiting a place of pilgrimage.
The National Military Memorial symbolizes the gratitude of the nation towards the great martyrs of the post-independence era.
The design of the memorial shows the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The National Soldiers Memorial is designed in three dimensions, each of which is depicted in the journey from birth to martyrdom.
The flame of Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of a martyred soldier.
The second cycle shows the bravery and courage of the soldiers.
This article shows the martyrdom of the soldiers.
Of these, the names of the greatest martyrs of the country are inscribed in gold letters.
Then it's the safety cycle, which shows the safety.
In this circle, we can see a range of dense trees.
In October last year, I had the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was a reflection of the concern that the country should be grateful to the police personnel, both men and women, who are constantly striving for our security.
I am sure you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you come here, you must share the pictures taken from there in social media, be it inspiration to others, or be eager to see these holy places, or to see these monuments.
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, I receive thousands of letters and comments from you on various media.
It's a coincidence that on March 3, is the birthday of Jamshedji Tata.
The two personalities are from a very different family background who enriched the tradition and history of Jharkhand.
Paying tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata through Mann Ki Baat, it is in a way a tribute to the glorious history and traditions of Jharkhand.
These two great souls have not only enhanced the fame of Jharkhand but also of the entire country.
People are grateful for their contribution to the entire nation.
Do you know why the British were so cowardly?
Because even the British who built such a great empire were afraid of him, Mr.
Birsa used his traditional arrows and bows to shake the British rule with guns and cannons.
Birsa Munda has not only fought the British for national freedom but also for the social and economic freedom of the tribals.
He did this in his short life.
He lit up the darkness of the dark life of those who were denied the truth and were exploited, like the sun.
He sacrificed his life at the age of 25.
India's brave sons like Birsa Munda have been born all over the country.
There will not be any reason or place in the land of India without those who have contributed to this centuries long freedom struggle.
If the personalities like Birsa Munda make us aware of our existence, then the personalities like Jamshedji Tata gave us great institutions for the country.
He knew that India needed science and technology and that it needed to become an industrial hub.
Today, the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, called India Institute of Science, was a result of his vision.
Not only this, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekananda met on a ship while on a trip to the United States.
This discussion is said to have resulted in the setting up of the India Institute of Science.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister, Shri Morarji Desai, was born on 29th February.
As you all know, this day arrives only once in four years.
Morarjibhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai had the privilege of presenting the budget the most frequently in the Parliament of Independent India.
In the name of this, he had to pay the old age as well.
The then government arrested him and put him in jail.
But when he won the Janata Party election in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
It was through this 44th Amendment that the Act was enacted to publish the proceedings of the Parliament and the Legislative Assemblies in the papers.
Cabinet Cabinet approves MoU between India and imbabwe on Cooperation in the field of Traditional System of Medicine and Homeopathy The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval to Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Republic of India and the Republic of imbabwe on Cooperation in the field of Traditional Systems of Medicine and Homeopathy.
It provides that the President will have to declare a state of emergency as soon as the Cabinet has written and that the term of emergency shall not be extended by more than six months once.
Morarjibhai ensured that the killing of democracy by declaring an Emergency in 1975 would not happen in the future.
The generation will always remember his great contribution to the maintenance of the greatness of Indian democracy.
Once again, I pay homage to that great leader.
My dear countrymen, this time as well, there is a lot of enthusiasm among the people about the Padma Awards.
They bring a positive change in the lives of others in different ways by their hard work.
It has done a great job to bring a rare artistic closer to the new generation.
I have given a gift to the former President of the United States of America, Barack Obama for the creation of the Tree of Life, built by Abdul Gafoor.
Among the recipients of the Padma Awards, one of the recipients of the Padma Awards is the Shabir Sayyid Gomata of Marathwada region.
You will be surprised to know about Tao Porchon-ynch of America, where Linch is now a big institution for yoga.
My dear countrymen, this year there are 12 farmers out of those who have been awarded the Padma awards.
Generally, few people associated with the agriculture sector have reached the list of Padma Shri, who are directly involved in farming.
It is a living picture of a changing India.
My dear countrymen, today, I am going to tell you something very touching and it has been in my mind for the past few days.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme.
I have seen how much change it has brought about in the lives of the poor.
If you know anyone who is unwilling to treat because of lack of money, tell them about this scheme.
My dear countrymen, the exam time in schools is going to start.
In the next few weeks, examinations of different Boards, Class 10 and Class 12 will be conducted across the country.
My best wishes to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who are going to appear for the exam.
A few days ago, a grand Pariksha Pe Charcha was organized at the Town Hall in Delhi.
In this town hall, with the help of technology, I have been able to talk to crores of students, parents and teachers across the country and abroad.
In a way, on radio, I am talking to crores of families monthly.
Often, when I talk to you, when I read your letters, when I hear your comments on the phone, I think you are a part of my family.
This gives me a very pleasant feeling.
Friends, Elections is the biggest festival of democracy.
I have been telling you Mann Ki Baat for years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat January 2019
The nation received a very sad news on the 21st of this month.
Shri Shri Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji from Siddhaganga Mutt in Tumkur district of Karnataka is a Divyang.
Sivakumar Swamiji devoted his entire life towards social service.
Lord Basaveshwara has taught us - , , , , , That is, to perform our duties with utmost diligence and devotion is equal to being in the abode of Lord Shiva in Kailasha.
Sivakumar Swamiji was a follower of this philosophy.
He worked for the social, educational and economic development of thousands of people in his 111 years of life.
He was a scholar who excelled in English, Sanskrit and Kannada.
He was a social reformer.
He worked throughout his life to provide food, housing, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
His priorities were of utmost importance to the farmers.
Siddhaganga Math used to organize cattle and farming fairs on a regular basis.
I have had the privilege of getting the blessings of the venerable Swamiji several times.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem about Pujya Swamiji on this occasion.
Once again, I salute that Mahatma.
My dear countrymen, on the 26th of January, 1950, the Constitution was enacted in our country.
That day our country is for the Republic.
Yesterday, we celebrated Republic Day with great fanfare.
But I'd like to tell you something else.
25th January was the Foundation Day of the Election Commission, which is celebrated as National Voters Day.
People across the world are astonished at the massive electoral process in India.
It is natural for all the citizens of our country to feel proud of the Election Commission because our Election Commission has done it beautifully.
I must have heard of a polling booth for a single voter in Gir forest in Gujarat.
This is the beauty of our democracy.
I congratulate the Election Commission of India for constantly striving to strengthen our democracy.
I would like to congratulate the Election Commission, the security personnel and other officials of all the states for ensuring a free and fair election which is part of the electoral process.
This year, there will be Lok Sabha elections in our country.
This will be the first time that young people born in the 21st century will exercise their franchise in the election of Lok Sabha.
They have had the opportunity to bear the responsibility of the nation.
They are going to decide the fate of the country.
It is time to connect your dreams with the dreams of the nation.
I urge the young generation to register as voters when they are old enough to vote.
At the same time, we have to think that voting is our own duty.
If there is no reason to vote in life, then it has to be painful.
You should feel sad to see something wrong in the country.
Our country is a multi-faceted Vasundhara.
One of those great souls was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
On 23rd January, the entire country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different manner.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I had the privilege of inaugurating a museum dedicated to the heroes of India's freedom struggle.
Since independence in the Red Fort, some rooms and buildings have been closed till date.
Today, these closed rooms of the Red Fort have become a beautiful museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army.
Every stone in this museum has a scent of our glorious history.
Everywhere in the museum, stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle resonates and inspires us to go to history.
At the same place, the British Government had tried to prosecute the brave sons of Bharata - Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan - on the same day.
I have kept the hat in the museum itself and the visitors will also see the hat, and I will take inspiration from it.
However, the courage and patriotism of our leaders need to be re-emerged to the new generation in different ways.
A month ago, on 30th December, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had unfurled the tricolour flag 75 years ago. As a part of an event, I unfurled the tricolour.
Similarly, in October 2018, when the tricolour flag was hoisted at Red Fort, everyone would be surprised as it used to flag on the 15th of August.
It was celebrated on the 75th anniversary of the formation of Azad Hind Government.
Netaji secured a place in the hearts of every Indian through the slogans such as Delhi Chalo, Tam Mei Khoon Do, My tumm tum aadi dungga (Go to Delhi, give me blood, and I will give you freedom).
Over the last several years, there has been a demand that files related to Netaji should be made available to the public.
I'm glad we could do that.
I remember the day when Netaji's family members came together in the Prime Minister's residence.
We talked about Netaji and paid tributes to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am happy that an effort has been made to develop several places related to the great people of India in Delhi.
There are 26 Alipur Road related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar. Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir will be a source of happiness.
If you come to Delhi, you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, while talking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life in Mann Ki Baat.
In 1942, Subhas Babu had launched Azad Hind Radio.
I understand that this radio station has also broadcast weekly news bulletins in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu languages.
The radio station is being run by a resident of Gujarat M.K.
R.
Vyas played a great role.
General public liked the programmes broadcast by Azad Hind Radio.
These events were very inspiring for the warriors who were in the freedom struggle.
Drishyakala- Museum has also been set up at Kranti Mandir.
We have tried to explain Indian art and culture in a very interesting way.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum, where more than 450 paintings and other art works, which are three centuries old.
The Museum showcases excellent works of great artists like Amrita Sher-e-Gil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Roy, Silos Mukherjee among others.
I especially urge you to go there and watch the writings of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You might be wondering why I want to tell Gurudev Tagore's great writings about art.
Probably you might have heard about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician till now.
He has painted and painted animals and birds, and has depicted a lot of natural scenes, and furthering the human nature and art of Kanvas.
It is important to mention that Gurudev never gave names to many of his writings.
He used to think that those who watch the drawings he had painted, he used to understand the painting himself, and the message he had given him through his own perspective.
His paintings have been exhibited in European countries, Russia and America.
This great work of ours has given a message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through our thoughts and actions.
Sant Ravidas was such a great man.
19th February is the birth anniversary of Sant Ravidas.
Sant Ravidas ji's tales are very famous.
Guru Ravidas Ji was born in the holy land of Varanasi.
Through his messages, he has been trying to convince the hard-work and hard-work of the nation throughout his life.
In our space programme, many young scientists of the country have contributed to the space programme.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding rockets that have been developed by our students today are being launched in space.
On the 24th of January, the Kalam Sat was launched by our students.
A new record is also being set up in Odisha by students in sounding rockets.
In the last four years, space missions have been started for the space missions from the country's independence to 2014.
We have set the world record of launching 104 satellites through a single spacecraft.
We will soon be able to establish India's presence in the Moon through Chandrayaan 2.
Our country uses space technology to protect the lives and property of the people.

Our space programmes give children an opportunity to think big and go beyond the boundaries that are expected to be impossible to this day.
It's the vision of watching stars for our children and encouraging them to discover new stars.
The Khelo India Youth Games, held in Pune in January, 2020, saw participation of 6000 players in 18 games.
This time in Khelo India, players from all states have performed well in their own way.
The life of many medal winners is a tremendous inspiration.
Akash Gorkha silver medal was won in the wrestling event and I read that Akash's father Ramesh ji used to do the job of a watchman in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking lot with his family.
Similarly, Captain Sonali Harvey of Under-21 Mahila Kabaddi team in Maharashtra is a person who lives in Satara.
She lost her father at a very young age, and the brother and mother encouraged Sonali's talent.
It is generally seen that girls are not encouraged to take up sports like Kabaddi.
But Sonali Kabbadiki chose, and performed the best.
Abhinav Shaw, a 10-year-old from Asansol, is the youngest gold medal in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Akshaya Baswani, the daughter of a farmer from Karnataka won the Gold Medal in the weightlifting event.
When we talk of building India, we must remember that youth power is the concept of New India.
Speaking of these stories of Khelo India, it is important to remember that the creation of New India is not only the contribution of the people of the big cities but also of the youth, children and young sports professionals from small towns and villages.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard of many beautiful events named after you.
But have you ever heard of the competition to beautify the toilet?

My little friends, the days of the exam are approaching.

Mr. Anshulji, thank you for taking this matter into consideration.
For many families, the first part of the year is the exam season.
I would like to discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat today, but I would like to talk to students across the country during the Pariksha Pe Charcha 29th January at 11.00 a.m. on the 29th of January this year, along with students, parents and teachers.
This time, students from other countries are also participating in this program.

Some of these suggestions and suggestions I will definitely put before you during the programme to be held in the Town Hall.
You must join this programme.
You can see the live telecast of the app through social media or through Namo App.
My dear countrymen, January 30 is a memorable day for our revered Bapu.

Remembering Pujya Bapu, let us move forward with the resolve of fulfilling his dreams, building a New India and performing our duties as citizens.
This journey of 2019 can be successfully carried forward.
Best wishes to all of you. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, 2018 December
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
The year 2018 is about to end.
We are entering in for 2019.
Naturally, the discussion took place last year and the deliberations on the expectations of the coming year.
Whether it is the life of an individual, social life or the life of a nation, everyone has to look back and try to take as much care as possible.
This is the result of experience and the self-confidence of doing something new.
What can we contribute to bringing about change in our lives and to taking the country and society forward
My best wishes to all of you for 2019.
As a result of the resolve of the people of the country, the value of cleanliness has gone up by 95 per cent.
For the first time since independence, the Azad Hind Government had unfurled the tricolour at the Red Fort on its 75th anniversary.
The country has received the United Nations' highest environmental honour, the Champions of the Earth Award.
Indias efforts in the field of solar energy and climate change have been recognized globally.
The International Solar Alliance, the first edition of the International Solar Alliance, was organized in India.
Our country has had unprecedented improvement in the Ease of Doing Business rankings.

India has also performed well in the Para Asian Games too.
When the list of all Indian social efforts starts to be listed, our Mann Ki Baat 2019 will continue to be continued.
All this has been possible due to the tireless efforts of 130 crore people.
I am confident that this journey of progress and progress will continue unabated in 2019 and our country will continue to scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, we have lost some of our special relatives in December.
Dr. Jayachandra was known as the cheapest medicine for the poor.
Similarly, on December 25, 2018, the death of SulagittiNarsamma in Karnataka was reported.
SulagittiNarsamma was a midwife, a nurse who helped her in delivery of pregnant mothers and sisters.
They have served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the remotest parts of the country.
There are many inspiring people like Jayachandra and Sulagatti.
They have dedicated their lives for the good of all in the society.
When we talk of healthcare, we want to talk about the work done by doctors in Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some party workers told me that some young doctors in the city are holding camps and treating the poor.
Medical camps are conducted every month at the Heart Lungs Cractile Centre where free diagnosis and treatment is provided for many diseases.
Today hundreds of patients are availing this camp.
The zeal of these doctors who are selflessly serving others must be appreciated.
Today, I can say with great pride that the Swachh Bharat Mission has been a successful initiative only through social efforts.
A few days ago, some people told me that in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, more than 3 lakh people were involved in the cleaning work together.
This Mahayagya for cleanliness was attended by city corporations, service associations, school and college students, and the entire population of Jabalpur.
I'm the betterindia.
Whenever I get the opportunity, I definitely go to Thebettindia.com and try to know about such sources of inspiration.
I am happy that many such websites are conveying to us stories that are inspiring our lives.
The site com tries to spread positivity in the society and make the society more sensitive.
Similarly, many stories of your story.com Young innovators and success stories of entrepreneurs are telling us.
Combine positivity and viral.
I am confident that more and more people will learn about our heroes who are transforming the society.
It's very easy to spread Negative.
But, very good things are happening to us in our society. This is possible only because of the collective efforts of 130 crore people.
He is 12-year-old and lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
The brave-heart exercised his hard work and soul, learnt about the various facets of it and proved his worth.
I wish them a bright future for all the countrymen.
I convey my best wishes and best wishes to Hannah.
Similarly, the 16-year-old girl, Rajani, was also discussed in the media.
You must have read it too.
Rajni Junier won the gold medal at the Wrestling Championship.
As soon as Rajni had won the medal, she went to the nearby milk shop and drank a glass of milk.
After that, Rajni Medal was wrapped in a cloth and put it in a bag.
You might be wondering why Rajni drank a glass of milk.
The boy did it with respect to Jasmer Singh, who sells lassi in a paan stall.
Rajni said that his father suffered a lot and suffered a lot in bringing him to this floor.
Jasmer Singh works every morning before Rajan and his brothers wake up.
When Rajani expressed her desire to learn boxing, her father organized everything possible and encouraged her.
Rajnik wrestling was done with old gloves, because in those days the family's financial condition was very bad.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajani was never excited, and had to learn wrestling.
She won a medal from Serbia.
This month, 20-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni from Pune has become the fastest-growing man in the world on a bicycle.
The kid travelled 300 kilometres a day for 159 days.
The excitement of a child to ride a bike is indeed commendable.
Such achievements will not inspire us to listen to such talent.
My best wishes to our Annadata - Kisan brothers and sisters.
The fragrance of diversity, unity in diversity and feelings of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat are filled in our festivals.
There is no difference between society and nature in Indian culture and there is only one person and community here.
A good example of our close relations with nature is the calendar based on festivals, Panchangam.
It will have year-long festivals and knowledge about the planets and the stars' land.
It's decided on the basis of who's using the calendar.
In many regions, festivals and festivals are celebrated on the basis of planetary constellations.
Gudi Padva, Chedichand, Ugadi are all celebrated on the lunar calendar, while Tamil Nadu Puthandu, Vishu, Vaishkham, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh and Bihu are all celebrated on the basis of the sun-kunder festival.
In many of our festivals, the spirit of caring for rivers and water is evident.
The Chhath festival is associated with sun-charge in rivers and lakes.
Even on MakarSankranti, millions and millions of people are submerged in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals and festivals teach us the lesson of social values.
On the one hand, they have ancient importance on the other, and on the other hand, all festivals tell us the lesson of life and the inspiration to live with each other in harmony with each other.
I wish all of you the very best in 2019 and wish you all the very best in celebrating the upcoming festivals.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
People from all over the country and the world come and participate in the Kumbh.
The Kumbh Congregation is a peoples movement full of faith and devotion.
Together, crores of people from within the country and outside gather at one place.
The tradition of the Kumbh has spread to our great cultural heritage.
This time, you will also be eagerly waiting for the world famous Kumbh, which is being celebrated in Prayagraj from January 15th.
Saint-Mahal has already started arriving for the Kumbh.
There is also much evidence that UNESCO has included the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in the list to make sense that it is of global importance.
A few days ago, Ambassadors of many countries witnessed the preparations for the Kumbh.
It also raised the national flag of many countries.
People from more than 150 countries are expected to arrive at the Kumbh in Prayagraj.
This is a great learning experience especially for the youth.
I had gone to Prayagraj a few days ago and saw the preparations for the Kumbh enthusiastically.
This time, we are giving a lot of importance to cleanliness.
There will be cleanliness along with devotion in the operation and the message will reach far and wide.
This time devotees can also visit the Akshayvat after having a holy dip at the Sangam.
This Akshayvat, a symbol of the faith of the people, had been confined to the fort for hundreds of years, so devotees could not see it at all if they wanted it.
This time, entry is allowed for all.
All of you must also participate in the Kumbh, share pictures of various heads on social media so that more and more people get inspired to go to the Kumbh.
May the Mahakumbh of the Spiritual Kumbh become an important part of the Indian vision.
May the Kumbh of Faith be the magnificence of nationalism.
May the Mahakumbh of art, and the magnificence of creativity and creativity.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Republic Day on the 26th of January, there is a lot of enthusiasm in the minds of the people and on that day we remember the great personalities of our Constitution.
This year we are marking the 150th birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu.
The President of South Africa, Mr.
Siril Ramaphosa is the Chief Guest of the Republic Day this year.
Pujya Bapu and South Africa had an unbreakable bond.
Mohan, Mahatma was from this South Africa.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first satyagraha in South Africa with strong opposition to colour discrimination.
He founded the Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, from where the entire world and the flame of peace and justice flowed.
Bapu had the courage and inspiration to stay in prison for so many years.
Mandela wrote about Bapu, saying, "Mahatma is an integral part of our history, because here he started the probe tests.
It is here that he showed his firm stand for justice, where he developed the vision of Satyagraha and the methods of fighting.
He saw Bapu as a role model.
Bapu and Mandela are not only the inspirations of the whole world, but their ideals inspire us for building a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a conference of the DGPs was held at Kevadia, on the banks of the Narmada in Gujarat, where the Statue of Unity is the highest statue in the world.
Sardar Patel devoted his entire life towards the unity of the country.
He has always lived up to India's unity.
Sardar Saheb had believed that the strength of India depends on the diversity of this place.
Paying tributes to Sardar Saheb on his punyatithi, he paid tributes to Sardar Saheb through this award for unity.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the day of Guru Gobind Singh ji's birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna.
For most of his life, his karmabhoomi was North India, where he died in Nanded in the Maharashtra region.
In the birthplace of the motherland Patna, Karmabhoomi is North India, the last moment of life in Nanded.
In a way, the whole of India received his blessings.
After Guru Gobind Singh ji became a martyr, Guru Gobind Singh ji attained the status of Guru at the age of 9 years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had inherited the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus.
When he tried to suppress the voice of the poor and weaker sections, Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice at the clarion call to make the poor weaker and weaker, that is why he used to say - (Sawah Laks Ek Ladda Umchidio Som Mej Baja Tuda Umtbe Govind Singh Nahla Um.)
He was a divine figure full of heroism, valour, sacrifice and devotion.
He had supernatural weapons and science.
Apart from being a warrior, he also knew many languages including Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Parsi, Hindi and Urdu.
I once again bow to Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are many good things happening in the country, but there is no detailed discussion on these things.
As part of Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, health trips are being carried out across the country.
The event will be held till 27th January, 2019.
It is commendable that I go beyond this and try to awaken and educate the people.
When India becomes clean, it becomes prosperous.
Nutritious food is most important for good health.
To start this thing.
It is important to learn the lessons of importance of food as a child.
Come, let us move forward, let us move forward, let us change ourselves, let us change the country, let us move forward, let us move forward, let us move forward, let us move forward, let us move forward, let us move forward, let us move forward.
On MyGov, Shri Anshu Kumar from Delhi, Shri Amar Kumar and Shri Vikas Yadav from Patna were also present. Similarly, on the Narendra Modi App, Shri Monica Jane from Delhi and Shri Pranjit Sarkar from Bardwan in West Bengal and musicians from Nagpur asked almost the same question.
They say that normally people are connecting with you through modern technology, social media and mobile app.
I'd like to tell you a story.
It happened in 1998.
I was working in Himachal as the founding father of the Bharatiya Janata Party.
It was May.
It was a small daba.
I don't understand anything.
Seeing my reaction, he said, "Look, sir, listen to the radio.
Recently, Akashwani conducted a survey about Mann Ki Baat.
Some of these Facebook responses are interesting.
On an average, 70 per cent of those surveyed people regularly listen to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that Mann Ki Baat has developed a positive thinking in the society.
Mann Ki Baat has encouraged many people.
A wide range of discussions were held on India Positive.
I am happy to see that because of Mann Ki Baat, radio is becoming more popular.
This concern is true, if the leader gets Mike, millions and millions of people can hear him, what is he supposed to do?
Their finding is that there is no politics in this program.
When Mann Ki Baat started, it was decided that there should not be any politics in it, it should not be the government's interest and Modi should not be present in it.
It was from you that the most inspiration was given in the implementation of my resolution.
Little stories of 130 crore people will always be there.
This country will scale new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
When I read the letter, a feeling like that takes shape in my mind.
With two words, I share it with you and with my experiences.
When will a government be empowered to launch a selfie with a doctor from a small village in Haryana and spread across the country
Famous celebrities from all walks of life, celebrities, celebrities, even among the communities, have joined in and added to the new language that is understood by the present generation by changing the mindset of the society.
Mann Ki Baat is not about the government, it is about society.
Mann Ki Baat is a matter of India waiting for progress.
India's life is not politics, nor political power.
India's life is social justice and social strength.
There are thousands of points in social life, one of which is politics and politics.
If it's all political, it's not good for society.
Sometimes political events, those who work in politics, other talent of the society and the goals of their lives are being overcome.
- Thank you very much for Mr.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is an easy task for me.
Every episode of Mann Ki Baat reaches people's letters.
My efforts are to see as many letters as possible before Mann Ki Baat and to read comments.
I hear a lot of phone calls.
As the episode of Mann Ki Baat approaches, I read with great care the ideas and inputs you send during your journey.
So whenever I read a letter, the person who writes the letter becomes a part of my thoughts.
That letter is not just a piece of paper for me.
In the last 40-45 years, I have been leading the lives of a differently abled person, in almost every district of the country, and have spent a lot of time in far-flung districts of the country.
Efforts are also being made to focus on the instructions of the concerned departments in those letters which were not included in the Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to thank my friends from All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other TV channels and social media.
It is because of their efforts that more and more people are able to reach Mann Ki Baat.
The Akashwani team is ready to broadcast all the episodes in many languages.
In a voice that resonates with Modi ji in local language, some people convey the same sentiment.
So they become Modi for 30 minutes.
I convey my best wishes to them for their talent and skills.
I also request you all to listen to this programme in regional languages.
I would like to thank my friends in the media who are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat on their channels every month.
A person in politics is not happy with the media, he feels that he gets very little coverage and if the coverage is available, it is negative coverage.
Without your cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
I'll do what I do in every family.
It's easy to understand if we don't get in the middle of the old ways of our own life.
One does not understand that one has given up his thoughts and accepted the views of the other.
The specialty of today's youth is that they do not believe in themselves, if they believe in something then they leave everything behind and go after it.
Often people can hear about ideation among families to the youth.
In fact, the limit for talking to a large number of families and youth is very limited.
They talk about things that are being studied for a long time, or about habits and lifestyles and do not do that.
I have made efforts to constantly interact with the youth through social media and social media.
I try to learn from them what they're doing, what they're thinking.
They always have a treasure of ideas.
They are very energetic, innovative and focused.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I am trying to connect the problems of the youth and their actions more and more.
There are times when young people raise more questions.
I'm saying it's good for youngsters to ask questions.
We feel that the youth of today is very ambitious and thinks of a very big thing.
It is good to see big dreams and achieve big goals. Finally, this is the New India, New India.
Some people say that the youth want to do many things at the same time.
I'm asking you what's wrong with this.
Many things do at the same time, because they're capable of multi-tasking.
If we look around, be it social initiatives, start-ups, sports or any other area, it is the youth who bring about a big change in the society.
Young people have shown courage to ask questions and dream new dreams.
If we bring the thinking of the youth to the ground, if we give them an open environment to express it then it can bring about progressive changes in the country and they do it.
My dear countrymen, Vinitji has written on MyGov in Gurugram, that I should talk about Constitution Day in Mann Ki Baat.
Vineeta says, that day is very important as we enter the 70th year of our Constitution.
Thank you very much for this opinion.
In order to fulfill this historic mandate, the Constituent Assembly took two years and 11 months and 17 days.
Just imagine that within three years this great structure has given us such a vast and wide constitution.
Today's time management and productivity is an example of the fact that they have built the constitution at such an unprecedented speed.
This will inspire us to fulfill our responsibilities in a record time.
The Constituent Assembly was an amalgamation of the great talents of the country and each one of them was committed to give the Constitution to the country which empowers India and empowers the poorest of the poor.
On the completion of 60 years of the Republic of India in 2010, a procession was organized by the Constitution on Elephant Pass in Gujarat.
It was an occasion to inspire the youth about the constitution and to connect them with different heads of the Constitution.
We will complete 70 years as a Republic in 2020 and 75 years of our Independence in 2022.
Come, let us carry forward our constitutional values and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
He used to say that Indians belong to different backgrounds but we need to be a nation above all.
India First - India First - Dr.
It is proposed to be celebrated with great fervor in all State Governments and UTs.
Similarly, it will be celebrated in all the countries of the world.
Besides, a train will also run on the sacred places associated with Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
A few days ago, while participating in this meeting, I remembered the Gurudwara of Lakhpat Saheb.
The Gurudwara had suffered a lot during the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat.
We'll continue this journey.
As much as we connect with you, our journey will further deepen and make everyone happy.
Sometimes there are questions in some minds - what did I get with Mann Ki Baat?
Your great desires are my greatest desires.
Come on, let's go further through this journey.
31st October is the birth anniversary of our beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Like every year, the youth of the country is ready to run for the Run for Unity, the unity of the country.
Now the weather is very pleasant.
I urge all of you to participate in the Run For Unity with great enthusiasm.
About six and a half months before the Independence Day, the world's most famous international publication The Time magazine appeared in the cover page of the article published on 27 January 1947.
She gave a picture of India along with the main article and it was not as if we are seeing it today.
It was a picture of India that was torn apart in many parts.
There were more than 550 countries at that time.
India was deprived of the interest of the English.
He said that in the 1920s, how the rescue operations had been carried out during the floods in Ahmedabad.
It is said how Bardoli gave direction to Satyagraha.
From the farmers, labourers to the industrialists, everyone was able to believe in him and his loyalty and commitment towards the country.
On October 31, 2018, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will be special, and on this day, the Statue of Unity will be dedicated to the nation, paying a befitting tribute to Sardar Patel.
Located on the banks of the Narmada River in Gujarat, the height of this statue is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty of America.
It is the world's tallest and most prestigious statue.
Every Indian should be proud of the fact that the tallest statue in the world is in India.
Sardar Patel, who was associated with the soil, will also be decorated with the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, Yesterday, all of us celebrated 'Infinite Day'.
I salute all those who have been a part of the Indian Army.
I salute the families of the soldiers for their courage.
But do you know why we, the people of India, celebrate Infantry Day
This was the day when the jawans of the Indian Army came out of the soil of Kashmir and rescued the people of Kashmir from the intruders.
This historic event is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an interview to the great Indian military officer, Sam Manekshaw.
The interview was by Field Marshal Manekshaw who was the Field Marshal.
At that time in October 1947 military operations started in Kashmir.
October 31 is a memorable day for our former Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi.
India also paid rich tributes to her.
My dear countrymen, who doesn't like games and sports?
Spirit, strength, skill and stamina are important in the world of sports.
This is not the key to any player's success.
Recently, two memorable meetings were held in memory.
First is an occasion to meet our Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 in Jakarta.
Similarly, the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina were also present.
In the Youth Olympics 2018, our youth has shown the best ever performance.
We won 13 medals and won 3 medals in the Mixing event.
This is the story of Indian sports that touches new heights every day.
India is creating new records not only in sports but also in areas where nobody thought about it.
When he was 8, he lost his father.
He lived in an orphanage for the next eight years.
After leaving the orphanage, DTC cleaned the buses and worked as a waiter at the roadsides in Delhi to move the life vehicle.
Today, Narayan is winning gold medals for India in the same international events.
Not only this, India is scaling new heights of excellence in sports.
India has never won an Olympic medal in the Senior Lover or Junior Lovale in Judo.
But Tababi Devi made history by winning a silver medal in Judo at the Youth Olympics.
The 16-year-old girl, Tababi Devi, lives in a village in Manipur.
The child's father is a worker, and the mother runs a fish.
Sometimes the child's family had no money to buy anything for food.
Even in such a situation, the fort was not destroyed due to the inspiration of Babaji.
And that is why he made history by winning medals for the country.
There are countless such stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
The spirit of all the youngsters is at the core of New India.
My dear countrymen, we have successfully organized the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017.
The whole world appreciated it as a successful tournament.
This year, India has the privilege of organising the Mens Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will be held from 28 November to 16 December 2017.
In the minds of all Indians, whatever sports is being played, whatever sports is being played, whatever sports is being played, there will definitely be a chance for hockey.
India has bestowed upon great hockey players.
Whenever there will be discussion about the world hockey, the story of hockey will also be incomplete without these great players of India.
The whole world knows hockey wizard Major Dhyanchand.
Thereafter, the expedition was undertaken on a long journey of hockey from Balvinder Singh Senior, Lesley Clouds, Mohammad Shahid and Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillay.
Even today, the team inspires the new generation of hockey through the success of India's players, their hard work and dedication.
It's a good opportunity for sports lovers to watch exciting games.
You should not only go to Bhubaneswar and boost the spirit of the Indian team but also encourage all the teams.
But in the new era, in a new way, the new generation is coming forward to do these things with a new zeal, enthusiasm and new dreams.
Some teach children, some teach elders, some teach them about cleanliness, some help farmers.
There is no desire behind doing all this, but there is dedication, determination and selflessness in it.
A young Divyang person learned to play a wheelchair Basketball to help the Basketball team.
This enthusiasm is the work of this dedication in mission mode.
Will any Indian feel proud of it
My dear brothers and sisters, This time when I was looking at Mann Ki Baat's comments, I had a very interesting note from Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pondicherry.
He has written in MyGov that please tell the people of India and their lifestyles and traditions of co-existence with nature.
We need to learn from them what we need to make traditions a part of our lives for sustainable development.
Manish ji, I congratulate you for putting this subject in front of the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
It inspires us to look towards our glorious past and culture.Today, the whole world, especially the western countries, is talking about environment protection, looking for new ways for a balanced life-style.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees, plants and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The people of the Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh, especially of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship Alarm and Arjun.
In a desert like Rajasthan, the Bishnai community has shown us how to protect the environment.
Especially in the case of protecting trees, they don't have the courage to sacrifice their lives, but they won't allow even a tree to suffer.
They are expected to have direct links with tigers in Arunachal.
They're treated like their own brothers.
The presence of tigers in the Warli community in Maharashtra is bringing prosperity to them.
The Gauds of Central India have stopped fishing in some parts of the Cathan River during the period of fish breeding.
They see these areas as the basis of fish and they get good fish as they live in this custom.

My dear brothers and sisters, It is true that the tribal community believes in living in peace and harmony with each other, but if someone loses their natural resources, they will not hesitate in defending their rights.
It is no surprise that the tribal community was among our first freedom fighters.
Come on, let's express our respect for them.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat tells us about those who do extraordinary things for the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about Bhai Gurbachan Singh, a farmer brother from Punjab.
One common teacher was the marriage of Gurubachan Singh.
But, you will be surprised to know that an ordinary farmer like Bhai Gurbachan Singh told his father that the condition of the bride is the real strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told them that I would like to promise that they will not burn the vagabonds in the fields.
You can imagine the huge social strength of this thing.
It seems simple, but how vast his personality is, this incident tells us that there are several families in our society that make personal matters a matter of concern for the welfare of the society.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh ji placed such an example in front of us.
I read another village in Punjab about Kallar Major.
Instead of burning wicoils, the people of Malar Majraar mix it to the ground and use technology for the same.
Greetings to Bhai Gurbachan Singh.
Greetings to the people of Malharmajra and other parts of the country for their efforts to make the environment clean.
You are the real heirs of the Indian tradition of a healthy lifestyle.
May there be peace in all the three worlds, in water, on earth, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the fire, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the fire, in the air, in the plants, in the forests, in the forests, in the forests, in the forests, in the forests, in the forests, in the forests, in the fields.
May there be peace everywhere in the creatures, in the heart, in me, in the particles of the universe.
For India, the First World War was a big event.
Obviously, we had no direct connection to that war.
Yet, our soldiers fought valiantly, played a major role in the service of the nation and laid down their lives.
The Indian soldiers have shown the world that they are no less than anybody when it comes to war.
In the First World War, the world saw the essence of destruction.
It is estimated that more than one crore soldiers have laid down their lives, as much as the common man.
The whole world has understood the importance of peace through this.
In the last hundred years, the definition of peace has changed.
Today, peace and friendship are not just about fighting.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development to social justice, there is a need to work in convergence and cooperation with the world.
The development of the poorest of the poor is the real symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North East is different.
The natural beauty there is unparalleled, the people there are very talented.
Our North-East is now known for many good works.
The North East has made great strides in organic farming and organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award 2018 to promote sustainability.
Food and Agriculture Organizations are being provided.

In this, my best wishes to the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, October is the end of the month.
A lot of changes are visible in the weather.
November is the month of festivals, in a way, like Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhaidooj, Chhath etc.
