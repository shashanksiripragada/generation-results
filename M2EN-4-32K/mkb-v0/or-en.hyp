And in the five years from 1942 to 1947, this kind of mass mentality was created which was accomplished by the resolutions.
These five years were decisive.
Now I want to connect you with this math.
It was almost 70 years.
I'm just for a moment.

The families of our poor brothers and sisters are going on here only.

I convey my best wishes to all fellow citizens for the forthcoming festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly watching that our daughters are making a mark in the field of education, in the field of finance, in the social sector and in the field of sports and are scaling new heights of development.

Let us all work together, do something or the other.
The destiny of the country will be better for the future.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.

In this Ramzan, the people of the village jointly decided to build a toilet.
If our handwriting is bad, we have to work with utmost care for a long time to improve it.

Therefore, the middlemen will be eliminated and transparency will come.
Therefore, all the government departments are looking after those registered on e-Ge.
He wrote - On one hand I got the money under the Mudra scheme, my business started - I gave a list of what I could give to e-Ge and I got an order from the Prime Minister's Office.

Some have tried to learn new languages, some have started learning cooking, some have started learning dance and drama.
Some have written that they have started writing poems.
After that you will see that when you are in a natural state, you will get a new consciousness.
The earth is our mother, and we are her sons.

Thank you.
I had not even thought that the youth of our country has been doing this thing for a long time.
We have been aware of the fact that some social organizations have been doing this work for several years but I have come to know that the youth of my country are engaged in this work.
On this occasion, my best wishes to the citizens of both the states.
Both the states have made relentless efforts to scale new heights of development.
My best wishes to these two states.
A few days ago, Shri Jagatbhai ji has sent me a book from Gujarat - 'Save the Sparrows' in which he has expressed concern over the decline in the number of households and has described these things in a very beautiful way as to what he has done and what he has done for their conservation.
It was also mentioned in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy that we forget that the person who gives the news papers, the servant, the milkman, the milkman, the postman, or any other person who comes to our house, we should give him water glass in the summer.
However, most of them come to the notice of stay within the comfort zone and the examination has now been completed.
Hot summers and summers are comfortable.
However, as a friend of yours, I would like to give you some suggestions on how to harvest the summer.
I am confident that some of you will use it and will write to me.
In order to use summer, I say three things, if you do all three things then it is good or not, but if you do one experiment then you will certainly do it.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages and new areas.
Then go to another place and spend three to four days there as well.
You will get a lot of opportunity to learn from this.
I also hope to share some of the photos with me when you are going there.
Have you seen anything new
Thousands of years ago, he made a movement to enter their temple and brought them to the temple.
We are really fortunate that in every era great men have been born within us to eradicate the evils of our society.
In other words, 'Shram is Shiva' I often refer to 'Shramev Jayate'.
Thank you very much.
In every corner of the country, most of the families are engaged in testing for their children.
The most interesting thing about Gurudev Rabindranath was that he was not only the first person in the Asian continent to win the Nobel Prize in 1913, but the British also distinguished him in Knighthood, and when in 1919, the British founded the British at Jallianwala Bagh, Rabindranath was one of those personalities and great men who had his voice against the British Government and during this period a young child of 12 years had a profound influence on his mind.
The scene of Jallianwala Bagh massacre in the heart of a young child who was playing in a garden in Kishor, instilled a new inspiration in him and in 1919 the 12-year-old boy, Bhagat Singh, was the source of our inspiration.
Three days before today, on the 23rd of March, Bhagat Singh, his companions Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged on the gallows by the British Government and everyone knows that on the 23rd of March, there was a sense of satisfaction in serving Mother India on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru. There was no fear of death.
He dedicated all the dreams of life to the service of Mother India.
And these three brave martyrs are a source of inspiration for us today.
We cannot describe the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
A good beginning can be made for India.
India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022.
My dear countrymen, today I want to express my gratitude to you.
We can do this in our daily lives.
Brothers and sisters, How much pain is there in the mind of a student of class 11
He was very angry to see the filth of that river.
I consider it a good sign.
I wish that the 1.25 billion Indians get angry with the filth of the country.
Once I feel angry, when I ask you to do something or the other, we will start doing something or the other against filth.
It is good that Gayatri is expressing her anger, advising me and saying that she has failed with a lot of effort.
I know some young people who have been running such campaigns.
The biggest problem is that we do not even know about such incidents in our surroundings but we also hesitate to talk openly about these things.
Whoever feels depressed does not speak to himself because he feels ashamed.
If they prefer to be alone without partnering with you, then do not let it happen.
This is the best way to do it.
It will be the third year.
Millions of people should celebrate mass yoga.
If you want to give some suggestions on the third International Day of Yoga then you must give me a mobile app and guide me.
Do not make any poetry or poetry about yoga so that people can understand it easily.
I want to tell the mothers and sisters one thing because today there has been a discussion on health and there has been a discussion on health.
A few days ago, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
The number of working women in our country is increasing day by day and participation is increasing.
But they also have some special responsibilities.
Earlier, maternity leave of 12 weeks was given to working women during pregnancy, which has now been increased to 26 weeks.
There are hardly two or three countries in the world that are ahead in this direction.
India has taken a very important decision for these sisters.
On the NarendraModi app, through Twitter, in the letter...
Be it fighting poverty or getting rid of disease, connecting with the world or spreading knowledge or information, technology or science has made a special place for itself.
It is also a matter of great happiness that this is the 38th successful mission of PSLV continuously.
This is an important achievement in the defence sector and you will be happy to know that only 4 or 5 countries in the world have this capability.
Two individuals have done a commendable job and they have developed a house that can save their homes in this hour of crisis.
In our country, there has been a lot of support in Lucky Grahak Yojana and Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana.
More than 4000 businessmen have received prizes worth Rs 50,000 each.
They understand it with great enthusiasm and are encouraging.
One of the young friends of Maharashtra, Pooja Nemde, a postgraduate student, is also talking about how Rupay card, e-allet are being used in their families and how they are enjoying it.
How important is the award of one lakh rupees for him, but he has now taken up this task as a mission and inspires others to do the same.
I urge the countrymen, especially the youth of the country, who have received awards under the Lucky Grahak Yojana, Digi-dhan Vyapar Yojana, to take the lead in this movement as ambassadors or ambassadors of the country.
In a way, you are messengers of purity.
This is not just the production of pulses but the biggest service to the poor of my country.
We know that when a citizen of our country does something good then the entire country feels a new energy and the confidence of the country increases.
We have welcomed the performance of the Divyangjans of our country in the Rio Olympics.
India lost Pakistan at the 20 World Cup Cricket Final held this month. India has been the second consecutive World Cup making and has brought glory to the country.
I once again congratulate all the players in the team.
The country is proud of this achievement of our Divyang friends.
I am extremely grateful for your partnership.
Therefore, today, as I am talking to you, my eyes are drawn towards two Mohans.
Today, as we talk of festivals, India is preparing for another big festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but in the whole world.
If we look at his entire life, we will see that in South Africa, he served the people of those communities that were affected by discrimination and at that time it was not an ordinary thing.
He served those farmers who were discriminated against in Champaran.
He taught the service not by language but by living his life.
I believe that there might be 130 crore ideas in the minds of 130 crore countrymen and there would be 130 crore programmes.
This is the Nand Lal Bose whose art and culture enhances the glory of our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
Once again, on the occasion of Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary, I wish every Indian a pledge.
We should do something for the country, for the society and for someone else.
This will be a good, true and honest work towards Bapu.
Son of Mother India, you must remember that for the last few years, we have been running the 'Swachhta Hi Seva' campaign across the country for nearly two weeks before the 2nd of October.
This time, on the 2nd of October, when we mark Bapu's 150th birth anniversary, we will not only dedicate to him an open defecation free India, but will lay the foundation of a new mass movement against plastic across the country.
Mudhai Pashankhheshu Ratnasanga Paradite.
This means water, food and electricity in the world are three gems.
But fools call the stone a gem.
The glory of food is immense in our culture.
Even we have converted the knowledge of food into science.
This is especially important for women and children because they are the foundation of our future in the society.
Through the Poshan Abhiyan, nutrition is being made a mass movement in a modern scientific way across the country.
People are fighting against malnutrition in a new and wonderful system.
One thing was brought to my notice.
This was a very good step that could have been taken in every region.
Friends, There are many small things through which our country can effectively fight against malnutrition.
Today, poor families and rich families are also affected due to lack of awareness.
The month of September will be celebrated as Poshan Abhiyan across the country.
There was a change in language and a small cordless instrument was put up in the ears of Bear Grylls.
After this programme, many people are getting to talk about Jim Corbett National Park.
You should also visit the places related to nature and wildlife.
I have already told you that you must visit North-East India once in your life.
On the 15th of August, from the Red Fort, I had requested you to visit at least 15 places in the next three years.
Last month, I had the opportunity to release the Tiger Estimation Report.
The number of tigers in India is now 2967.
But this is the New India where we have fulfilled the goal very soon.
When I was releasing the tiger related data, I was reminded of the Gir forest in Gujarat.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the lion's habitat in the Gir forest started getting accumulated.
But now we have to go beyond conservation and think about compassion.
We have to keep ourselves healthy and keep the country healthy.
I am aware that all these campaigns will also be launched on social media.
Come, let us move forward with a new zeal, new resolve and a new energy.
I look forward to your views and your views.
Let us all strive to build the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters and strive to fulfil Gandhijis dreams.
Let us move forward by turning our inner joy into a service.
Thank you very much. Namaskar.
When I announced this, many teachers, parents and students sent me a message, asked questions, suggested solutions, even if difficulties were to be resolved.
The strength of the society is felt during the festive season.
Sometimes it seems that we are not able to see the exam in the right perspective.
It seems as if this is a question of life and death.
The exams that you are going to pass are the exams that you have studied for the year.
This is not the test of your life.
You see his experience, his knowledge and his success.
Therefore, the burden of this number sometimes stops us from going right.
This is because there is a perception that if a student concentrates on sports, then his studies tend to lose his attention.
I dont know whether it will be right for everyone or not, but I have experienced that in such times, Deep Breathing is very beneficial.
No, take the body as much sleep as you need, so that your reading time is not wasted.
This will help in increasing the reading power.
Your concentration will increase.
You will feel fresh.
Your skills will grow at an all-round level.
When I hold election meetings, sometimes I feel tired.
A folk singer came to meet me.
Yes, young friends, you are preparing for the exam and I have kept you in mind.
Therefore, as much as I advise your parents not to be burdened, it also applies to me.
In order to cross the exam, a ceremony to be held.
After that the exam will never be over again.
Move forward with this mantra.
Mann Ki Baat offers me a great opportunity to connect with you.
My best wishes to you all.
It is said in the story that Jesus stood at a storehouse in a temple.
Today, the people of the country are going to get the benefit of two schemes as a gift on a big day.
In a way, two new schemes are going to be started.
There is an atmosphere of curiosity throughout the country, whether in villages or cities, whether it is educated or illiterate, how cash-free transactions can be made, how to buy without cash.
For this, the Government of India is going to start the promotion scheme for consumers and small businesses to create e-payment habits.
The scheme for promotion of customers is Lucky Grahak Yojana and Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana to encourage traders.
Every day, 15000 people will receive Rs.
These 30 crore people will soon be a part of this award scheme.
Cashless transactions have increased by 200 to 300 in the last few days.
Countries like India should be at the forefront in this field.
Our youth have made great strides in start-ups.
This digital environment is a golden opportunity.
Our youth should give importance to this sector with new ideas, new technologies and new systems, but we have to get involved in the campaign to free the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, every month, before Mann Ki Baat, I appeal to the people to share their suggestions and ideas.
When I saw these things, I can say this thing in a big way that I am dividing them in three parts.
This law will also work in the coming days.
Whatever we have to do for the benefit of the country and for the welfare of the people is our priority.
As per the Investment Report, India stands at third place in the prospective highest economy in 2016-18.
The presence of students in such a large number of board examinations indicates that our children in Jammu Kashmir are committed to scale new heights of development through education for the bright future.
While congratulating the students for their enthusiasm and zeal, I heartily congratulate their parents, their friends and friends, their teachers and the heads of all the villages.
My dear brothers and sisters, This time I would like to share with you the views of the people who have asked for Mann Ki Baat.
But when I see your support and see your cooperation, I am trying to mislead you.
They were familiar with their potential.
Today, once again they have accepted this challenge and I believe that the resolution of the 125 crore Indians, all the collective efforts of this country will give a new strength to this country.
But corruption is so widespread that some people still do not lose their bad habits.
Even now, some people feel that the money of this corruption, this black money, this unaccounted money, the money of this benami, some ways or the other will be found and brought back into the system.
They are looking for illegal means to save their wealth.
Sadly, they have chosen the path of using the poor in this also.
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, by depositing money in their accounts or by doing some work by them.
A strict law has been framed for Benami property and it will be difficult to comply with the provisions of the Benami Property Act.
The government does not want any trouble for the countrymen.
Praising the war against corruption and black money announced by Mr. Ashish from Madhya Pradesh for Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000, the Prime Minister said, "Agya Namaskar, my name can be blessed.
I am an ordinary citizen of the village of Tirali Tahsil in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
This is the strength of my country which includes the spirit of service, the spirit of sacrifice and truth.
During the elections, I used to talk about 'Cha' and it was spread all over the world.
People from many countries of the world had also learnt to utter a word of tea.
There was no festivals, no feasts or any other reason because of the closure of the note.
The pilgrims also accepted this honour.
Bharat Maru and Dakasa Paramarsa of Surat who have contributed to the fight against corruption and black money through their marriage, is an inspiration.
I would like to congratulate the newly married India and Dakasa for turning the occasion of marriage into a new occasion by converting it into a great Yajna.
But friends, you are my real soldier.
I am very well aware that all of you are active in this great work.
Once the people are taught the use of RuPay card then the poor people will bless you.
He taught this to the common man, that he would become free from all worries.
I believe that if all the youth of India get involved in this work then it will not take much time.
In a month, we will be able to stand in front of the world as a new modern India.
We have to take forward this fight to make the country free from corruption and black money.
The people who have seen it from afar will feel that the Indian way of life is an inseparable part of festivals and it is natural.
The light of Diwali, the shadow of darkness in the society, and the darkness of evil in the people, is the festival of lights of Diwali.
We all know one thing very well that wherever we go, visit the houses of the rich, visit the kitchens of the poorest of the poor, we get to see the cleanliness drive in every family on the occasion of Diwali.
I mean to say that Diwali is going to be an inspiration for the people of the world to move from darkness to light.
When we are celebrating Diwali, someone is standing in the desert, someone is protecting the industry of the Himalayas, someone is protecting the airport.
Apart from this, I would like to say that along with the army officers and the soldiers, his family and his wives also sacrificed a lot.
In a way, the entire army is getting very good messages and I want to give you a copy of that too.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the Army are present not only on the border but in every aspect of life.
It is the need of the hour to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the poor people of the country.
In the 21st century, there will be darkness in the village and now it will not be like this.
Sardar Saheb has given us an India and we all have the responsibility to make it the best India.
The core of unity is the strength of Best India.
Sardar Saheb was not only a person in the struggle but also a creative person.
On the occasion of Unity Day, October 31st, wherever we may be, we will remember and commit ourselves to the unity and integrity of Sardar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of light in this festival of Diwali.
My dear countrymen, once again, I will dedicate this Diwali to the jawans of the country.
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
A few days ago, we have lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri sector of Jammu Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
The citizens of Kashmir have understood the anti-national elements very well and they have gone out of the path of peace immediately after knowing the truth.
But Harshavardhan, I also say that the anger of the citizens of the country has a great value.
Very few people would be aware of the valour shown by the Divyangjan in the Parliament this time.
Not only this, I was also surprised to know that those with disabilities who were in fourth place in the race, and who did not receive any medal, took less time than those who won gold medals in the general category.
Congratulations to all those who have done this job, and best wishes to all those who have tried to do this.
I appeal to the people of the country that for the honour of mothers and sisters and for the health of small children, we should free the country from this problem.
Let us move ahead with our resolve.
They contributed to the construction of nearly 9,000 toilets with their hard work.

In 1928, in 1932, in 1936, he played a key role in bringing the gold medal for India in the Olympic Games.
We all know the name of cricket-loving bradman.
Reading the messages of the people became a source of inspiration for me.
One of the Shri Ajit Singh has written on the NarendraModiApp - Please tell me this time in Mann Ki Baat about the girl child's education and their participation in sports because they have made the country proud by winning medals at the Rio Olympics.
Thousands of people have expressed the same idea.
It should not be denied that we are not able to perform our expectations.
In some cases, the performance of our sportspersons did not reach the same level and only two medals were awarded in the medals tally.
But it is also true that despite not getting a medal, for the first time in many games, India's players have done a lot of good work.
This was the case with Sania Mirza and Rohan Bhupen attached to the tennis.
For example, there are many names like Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das, who have performed well.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
If we do that which we have done, we will be dismayed.
I have announced the formation of a committee.
Let them devote their lives to their disciples, to their students.
The contribution of teachers in the lives of all of us is always felt.
He always tried to live there as a teacher.
Not only this, he used to say: The best teacher is one whose inner student will never die.
You will have the same experience as I am.
Your teachers will bring about a change in the attitude of all the teachers who have told the world about the good things that have happened in your lives.
It is the responsibility of all of us to increase the pride of teachers in the society.
We all hope that the life of our country, of our society, of our families, of each and every person becomes uninterrupted.
We live in an independent India.
Therefore, let us move forward in the direction of Surajya by following the mantra of 'Swarajya Our Rights' at the Ganesh festival.
May Surajya be our priority.
Cant we propagate this message through the medium of public celebration
Why not use Ganesh idol made of village Pokhari instead
The sculptures in the plaster of Paris have adverse effects on the environment.
Many more have expressed this concern with him.
I also urge all of you - why not use the clay statues to illuminate our ancient traditions.
Destruction of Lord Ganesh.
Therefore, we should not create such Ganesh that will create trouble.
We always get to learn something or the other from saints, sages and great men.
I also congratulate all the friends of AIR who have contributed to the country's foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you gave me the responsibility of the Prime Minister, but I am a human being like you.
You can imagine that a common teacher, an elderly woman with pension, is donating 50 thousand rupees to liberate poor mothers from the smoke of stove and to provide gas connections, this is not a small thing.
It is not 50 thousand rupees but it is the spirit of the mother that grows and with the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters, the hope and strength of my country's future will grow.
Those people who try to create unrest in Kashmir by pushing these little children forward, they will have to be responsible for these innocent children at times.
My dear countrymen, the country is very large, full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society and as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to strengthen the issues of unity, to make the country more energetic and vibrant so that the country can brighten its future.
I believe in the power of 1.25 billion Indians.
Today, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago we used to think of drought, but today rain is also flourishing, and news of floods is also coming up.

Take special care of cleanliness, take extra precautions and be safe and pay special attention to the children.

I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims visit the Ambaji Temple in Bhadravan.
Those who know about the land of Rajasthan will be able to understand how big this work is.
This year, Gujarat has started a campaign to plant crores of saplings by taking the form of Van Mahotsav in the form of Van Mahotsav.
I cant mention all the states but they deserve to be congratulated.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa.
This was my first visit, that is, diplomacy in foreign travel, trade is discussed, security is discussed.
But what I want to say is that this time I got the opportunity to meet those great men who sacrificed their youth for equal opportunities.
But the Indians went to that place and were ready to sacrifice their lives for those who had visited them.
Let us take pride in these Indians who have made the essence of our life in South Africa alive.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to the artist Burma for conveying my message.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in independent India.

The letters that are being received for Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are being received are completely different from the government work.
People have asked for something, but there has not been a single such thing in the last five years that someone would ask for something for himself.
And, you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
Therefore, the entire country had dedicated an entire election not for its own benefit but for the protection of democracy.
It was due to their hard work that this time more votes were cast than the last time.
You will be surprised to know that the staff of the Election Commission had to travel two days to reach there.
India has the highest number of polling stations in the world.
The centre is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Although these stories are hundred years ago, but their relevance is still the same.
After reading these things, I had a different experience.
