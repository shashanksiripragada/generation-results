Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, today is the holy festival of Diwali.
Diwali greetings to all of you.
The shloka says - Light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which leads to the destruction of the opposite intellect and the vision of enlightenment.
What could be a better idea to remember this Divyangjan, if we spread light, spread positivity and pray for the destruction of the spirit of enmity.
Nowadays Deepavali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only does it involve the Indian community, but now the festivals of Diwali are celebrated with great fanfare by governments and citizens of many countries and their social organizations.
In a way, India will be built there.
Friends, Festival tourism also has its own attraction in the world.
There is a lot of potential in the festivals that our country is celebrating.
We should try to spread the festival of Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu and other states also including the people of other countries.
In our country, every state has its own festivals in every region and people of other countries have a lot of interest in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in increasing festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we had decided in Mann Ki Baat that this Diwali would do something different.
Let us all celebrate India's Nari Shakti and her achievements, that is, the Lakshmi of India.
And immediately after that, there was a lot of inspiring stories on social media.
Namo App will play Kodepaka in Warangal. My mother is my strength.
Since my father's death in 1970, my mother had taken the responsibility of our five daughters.
Today we are five brothers in good business.
My mother is my God.
For me it is everything and in true sense it is Lakshmi of India.
Ramesh ji, my greetings to your mother.
Deepika Swamy, who is active on Twitter, says, for her Major Khushboo Kanwar is Lakshmi of India, the daughter of a bus conductor.
For the sake of poetry, Lakshmi of India is her daughter.
He is proud that his daughter makes beautiful paintings.
He has secured a very good rank in the CLAT exam.
Megha Jain has also written that an elderly woman of 2 years has been feeding free water to the passengers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Megha Ji has been inspired by the humility and compassion of this Lakshmi of India.
So many stories have been shared by the people.
You must read, draw inspiration and share some inspiring stories from your surroundings too.
I respectfully salute all these Lakshmis of India.
It seems as if its foundation was laid in the 19th century.
How beautiful words, how good a feeling and how good a thought are in this poem in Kannada language.
Penninda permegonanu Himvatanu, Penninda perchidananda perchidananda Jankarayanu Jasavedanu orartha, Hemwant, i.e., on account of her daughter Parvati, Bhrigu Rishi attained fame on account of her daughter Lakshmi and King Janak because of her daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride and due to the greatness of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, 12th November 2019 is a day to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji across the globe.
Guru Nanak ji's influence is not only in India but in the entire world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters in some countries of the world are fully devoted to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I will never forget my visit to the Gurudwaras in Vancouver and Tehran.
There is a lot that I can tell you about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, but for that there are many links to Mann Ki Baat.
Shri Guru Nanak Devjis message reaches far and wide in the world.
He was one of the most travelled in his time.
He went to many places and wherever he went, he won everyone's hearts with his ease, humility and simplicity.
Taking the message of equality and harmony, he went north, south, east or west, in every direction and met saints and sages everywhere.
It is believed that Shankardev, the well-known saint of Assam, was also inspired by him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
There is a sacred place in Kashi, the Gurubagh Gurudwara.
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji lived there.
He also visited religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
In the south, Guru Nanak Devji traveled to Sri Lanka.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji himself resolved the problem of water scarcity there.
In Bidar, Guru Nanak Ji is a famous place which reminds us of Guru Nanak Devji.
During a depressed state, Guru Nanak Devji traveled north to Kashmir and adjoining areas.
This established a good relationship between the Sikhs and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji went to Tibet where the people considered him as Guru.
He is also revered in Uzbekistan where he had travelled.
He took a place in the hearts of lakhs of people who followed his teachings with full faith and are still doing it today.
A few days ago, Ambassadors from around 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar.
There he visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar, and all this happened on the occasion of Guru Nanak Devji's 550th Prakash Parv.
Later, several Ambassadors posted their pictures on social media and shared their good experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you all will remember the 31st of October.
This day marks the birth anniversary of the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who was a stalwart who unified India.
While Sardar Patel had the amazing ability to connect people together, on the other hand he used to reconcile himself with those who had ideological differences.
He was a man of detail in true sense.
At the same time, he was a master at organizational skills.
He was involved in planning and strategy.
Whenever we read about the work culture of Sardar Saheb, we get to know how important his work was.
Thousands of delegates from across the country were to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 1921.
Sardar Patel was responsible for the entire system of administration. He also used this opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city.
And ensured that no one faces a problem with water.
Not only this, he also took care that the goods or steps of any representative should not be stolen at the venue. And you will be surprised to know that Sardar Patel did the work in that regard.
He approached the farmers and urged them to make Khadi bags.
On the other hand, the sale of Khadi also increased significantly.
Our country will always remain grateful to Sardar Patel for his significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
Friends, We all know that Sardar Patel, as the first Home Minister of India, had done a great work and historic work of uniting the princely states.
There was also a specialty of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel whose eyes were on every aspect.
On one hand, his focus was on Hyderabad, Junagarh and other states.
On the other hand, his focus was on far flung Lakshadweep.
In fact, when we talk of Sardar Patel's efforts, his role in the integration of the country is also discussed.
Immediately after the partition of India in 1974, our neighbour's eyes were on Lakshadweep and it sent the ship with its flag.
As it was known to Sardar Patel, he immediately started his stern action without wasting any time without delay.
The tri-color was hoisted immediately after his command and demolished every corner of the neighborhood in Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the Mudaliar brothers to personally ensure that necessary assistance is provided for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today Lakshadweep is making an important contribution in India's progress.
It is also an attractive tourist destination.
I am hopeful that all of you will also be able to visit these beautiful islands and beaches.
My dear countrymen, on the day of October 31, 2018, the Statue of Unity, built in the memory of Sardar Saheb, was dedicated to the country and the world.
This is the highest statue in the world.
The US-based Statue of Liberty is twice as high.
The tallest statue in the world fills every Indian with pride.
The head of every Indian is raised with pride.
You will be happy to know that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists had come to visit the Statue of Unity.
This means that on an average, 8500 people have shown the magnificence of the Statue of Unity every day.
Friends, This Statue of Unity can be a subject of study for the tourism industry of the country and for all the states.
We all are witnesses to the fact that within a year, a place has developed as a world famous tourist destination.
People from across the country and abroad come there.
Transport, accommodation, guides, eco-friendly systems are being developed automatically.
A huge economy is developing and people are building facilities as per the needs of the tourists.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, What would be India that would not be proud of the fact that in the last few days, Time Magazine also gave Statue of Unity an important place to 100 prominent tourist places in the world.
I hope that all of you will take some time out of your valuable time to visit the Statue of Unity.
This is my request.
Friends, You are aware that every year since 2014, 31st October is celebrated as the National Unity Day.
This day gives us the message of protecting the unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost.
Run for Unity is also being organised on 31st October every year like this.
It will include people from all sections of the society, from all walks of life.
However, these days, there is a curiosity and a passion for Marathon.
Run for Unity is also a unique arrangement.
Running is beneficial for mind, mind and body.
Here, the spirit of Fit India is realized by running here.
At the same time, we also connect with the objective of 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'.
And so, not just the body, but the mind and the culture connect India to new heights for its unity.
And that is why you can connect wherever you live in, with your knowledge of the Run for Unity around you.
I hope that all of you will run on October 31st, for the unity of India and for your fitness.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country with the thread of unity.
This mantra of unity has been preserved in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level at every step.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and alert to strengthen the unity and mutual goodwill of the country.
If we look around us, we will find many such examples that have been continuously working to increase mutual goodwill.
But it often happens that their contribution to society disappears very soon from memory.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court had pronounced its verdict on Ram Janmbhumi.
Just remember the days when there was an atmosphere.
Some of the groups were playing games to take advantage of the situation themselves.
What kind of language was being spoken to produce heat in the atmosphere.
Attempts were also made to fill the tin sheds in different voices.
Attempts were made to reduce the frequency from the environment.
We should always remember that it gives us immense strength.
That day, that moment is a duty for all of us.
This is an example of how strong the voice of unity can give to the country.
Today, I also pay my tributes to them.
But it is also a pleasant and interesting experience.
I have heard those things, so I think I have heard them too.
Just imagine the world's highest battlefield with a temperature of 50-60 degree Celsius.
Oxygen is also known in the air.
In such a situation, it is no less than a feat to remain amidst such challenges.
In such a difficult situation, our brave soldiers take out the chest and protect the borders of the country, but they are also running clean Siachen campaigns.
On behalf of the people of India, I appreciate this wonderful commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold there that it is difficult to even rot.
In such a situation, segregation and management of waste is a very important task in itself.
We all know that Siachen is such a glacier that is the source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, Swachhata Abhiyan means ensuring clean water for the people living in low lying areas, using rivers like Nubra and Shiko as well.
My dear countrymen, festivals are a celebration of a new consciousness in the lives of all of us.
And especially in Deepavali, something or the other to buy something or the other from the market is being produced in the least quantity in every family.
I once said, let us try to buy only local products.
If something that we need is found in our village then there is no need to go to Taluka.
There is no need to go to the district if it is available in the block.
We will try to buy as many local items as we can.
The centenary of Gandhi Ji will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I urge our weaver brothers and sisters to buy something that is made by the hand of our Khadi workers.
This Diwali too must have bought a lot of money for you before Diwali.
But there will be a lot of people who might be wondering that after Diwali they would be able to get cheap as well.
So there will be a lot of people who will still be able to buy something.
With Diwali greetings, I urge you all to be vocal for your local, and buy local.
You see, how important we can play in realizing Mahatma Gandhi's dream.
I once again convey my best wishes to you on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
In Deepavali, we burst upon different kinds of cracks.
But sometimes there is a fire in the carelessness.
There is also an injury.
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great fervor.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
There is hardly any Indian who doesnt feel proud of our armed forces or our army personnel.
Every Indian, regardless of region, race, religion, creed or language, is eager to express their happiness and support for our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1.25 billion people of India celebrated the Parakram Parv.
We recall the surgical strike in 2016, when our soldiers gave a befitting reply to the perpetrators of proxy war on our nation under the guise of terrorism.
Our armed forces have organised exhibitions at different locations across the country so that more and more citizens, especially the youth of the country, can know what our strength is, how capable we are and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by putting their lives at risk.
A day like the Parakram Parv reminds the youth of the glorious heritage of our armed forces.
And it inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in an event in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of heroes. Now it is certain that our soldiers will give a befitting reply to all those who try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our nation.
We believe in peace and are committed to promoting it, but not at the cost of sovereignty of the nation.
India has always been committed to peace and committed to it.
In the 20th century, over a lakh of our soldiers made the supreme sacrifice for peace in the two world wars, when we had no relation with that war.
Our eyes were never on any other earth.
That was our commitment to peace.
A few days ago, on 23 September, on the occasion of the centenary of the Battle of Haifa in Israel, we remembered our brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad Jodhpur Lancers who had freed Haifa from the atrocities.
That too was a valour made by our soldiers in the direction of peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest contributors to the UN Peace Keeping Forces in the world.
For decades, our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
One of the most eagerly awaited parts of the parade, during the Republic Day celebrations is the Fly Past, in which our Air Force displays its strength along with the wonderful cars.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
With 6 pilots in 1932 and 1 Air Warriors moving ahead from a small beginning, our Air Force today is one of the bravest and most powerful Air Forces in the 21st century.
I heartily congratulate all the Air Warriors and their families who have served the nation.
In 1974, when an unprecedented attack was launched by Pakistan's attackers, it was the Air Force who ensured that Indian soldiers and equipment reached the battlefield in time.
In 1965, the Air Force also gave a befitting reply to the enemy.
Who doesnt know the war of independence of Bangladesh in 1971
The Air Force has also played a pivotal role in the 1997 war to liberate Kargil from encroachment.
The Air Force dusted them by carrying bombs on enemy posts in Tiger Hill overnight.
The nation is grateful to them for their commendable work in relief and rescue operations and in disaster management and air warriors.
Their morale is amazing to deal with natural disasters like storms, cyclones, floods and forest fires and to help the countrymen.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring gender equality and has opened the doors of each of its departments for the daughters of the country.
Now the Air Force is giving women the option of a Permanent Commission along with Short Service Commission which was announced by me from the Red Fort on 15 August this year.
India can proudly say that the strength of the Armed Forces in the Indian Army is not only the strength of the men but also the strength of the women.
Women are not only empowered but now they are also getting armed.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, our naval officer AbhilashTomy was struggling between life and death.
The whole country was worried about how to save Tommy.
You know that Abhilash Tomy is a very courageous officer.
He was the first Indian to travel the world by taking a small boat without any modern technology alone.
For the past 80 days, they were moving ahead at sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean, but caused a severe cyclonic storm to trouble them. But the brave warriors of India remained steadfast in the midst of the sea for many days.
I had met Tommy earlier too.
His courage, determination and the resolve to do something like this once again inspires the younger generation of the country.
I pray for the good health of AbhilashTomy. His courage, valour, determination and the power to win, will certainly inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, every child knows what is important for our nation on 2nd October.
October 2 this year has a special significance.
For two years from today, we are going to organize several events across the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Be it Martin Luther King Jr, or the great men like Nelson Mandela, everyone took strength from Gandhiji's ideas and fought a long battle to secure the rights and dignity of their people.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk to you about another important work of venerable Bapu, which more and more countrymen should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing a few ideas as a constructive program.
Later, in 1945, when the freedom struggle gained momentum, he prepared a revised copy of those ideas.
Pujya Bapu has put forth his ideas to the countrymen on a number of issues, such as farmers, villages, workers' rights, cleanliness and the spread of education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Pujya Bapu was a peoples collector.
Bapu's specialty was to connect with the people and to connect them with themselves.
Everyone has experienced this as the most unique feature of his personality.
He made everyone feel that this is the most important and most important thing for the country.
His biggest contribution in the freedom struggle was that he made it a mass movement.
At the call of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom struggle, people from all walks of life and from all walks of life dedicated themselves to the service of the society.
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra which is often referred to as Gandhiji's Talisman.
In this, Gandhiji had said - "I give you a janta, whenever you suspect that you will start appearing here, try this test, recall the face of the poorest and the weakest person that you have seen and ask your heart how useful the step you think is for the person
Will it benefit them
Will they be able to control their own lives and fate
That is, will it enable crores of people to get Swaraj, who were hungry and who were unhappy
Then you will see that your suspicion is correct and that is ending here.
My dear countrymen, one episode of Gandhiji is equally important today.
Today, the growing middle class of the country, its increasing economic power, increasing purchasing power can we remember revered Bapu for a moment if we want to buy something
Can we remember that friend of Pujya Bapu
What will be the luck that you will be able to buy directly or in a rigid manner
And if the poorest of the poor is benefitted then my happiness will be more than that.
Remembering Gandhiji, in the coming days, whenever we buy anything, whenever we celebrate Gandhi ji's 150th birth anniversary, we must think that every purchase of our country requires the welfare of some or the other country, and in that too, those who have shed their sweat, those who have given their money, those who have dedicated their talent, those should be benefitted from it.
This is Gandhi's birth, this is Gandhi's message. And I believe that your small step in the life of the poorest and the weakest person, can bring a very big result.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhi Ji had said that if you clean up, you will get freedom then perhaps he would not know how he would be - but that happened, India got independence.
Similarly, today we can feel that this small work of mine can play a big role in the economic progress of my country, in the economic empowerment of the poor, in the fight against poverty. And I believe that this is the true patriot of today's era.
For example, if you think of buying Khadi and handloom products on special occasions, it will help many weavers.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastri ji used to keep the old or torn clothes of Khadi as it is because someone's hard work is hidden in them.
He used to say that all these Khadi clothes are made with great hard work - one of them should come to work.
This spirit of attachment towards the country and love for the countrymen was inherent in the spirit of that great soul with small stature.
Two days later, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri Ji along with venerable Bapu.
As soon as the name of Shastriji comes, we, the people of India get a feeling of boundless faith.
His gentle personality always fills every Indian with pride.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji's specialty was that he was very humble from outside, but he was determined like a mountain from inside.
His mantra of 'Jai Jawan Jai Kisan' is the identity of this great personality.
It was his selfless penance towards the nation that during his brief tenure of one and a half years, he gave a mantra to the soldiers of the country and the farmers to take them to greater heights of success.
My dear countrymen, while remembering revered Bapu today, it is quite natural that we cannot live without talking about cleanliness.
A campaign called Swachhata Hi Sewa was launched on 15th September.
Crores of people joined this campaign and I have also got the opportunity to donate clean labour to the children of Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school whose foundation was laid by Baba Saheb himself.
People from all walks of life from across the country joined the Shramdaan on the 15th of this month.
Organizations also contributed to this event.
School students, college students, NCC, NSS, youth organizations, media groups, the corporate world, everyone contributed in a big way towards cleanliness.
I heartily congratulate all these cleanliness-loving countrymen for their efforts.
Come on, let's hear a phone call.
You have said a lot of things - cleanliness has its own importance in everyone's life and under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a toilet has been built in your house. And what can be a matter of greater happiness for all of us than what is being convenient for you now
And perhaps, the people associated with this movement might not have even imagined that you can not see it because of a sign language. But if there was no toilet then how difficult would you have to spend your life with it and after the construction of a toilet it became a great boon for you
Perhaps, if you had not made a call to connect with this aspect, perhaps this sensitivity would not have been reflected in the people associated with this movement for cleanliness.
I specially thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful story not only in the country but in the whole world about which everyone is talking about.
This time India is organizing the world's largest cleanliness conference in history.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (MGISC) is being attended by Sanitation Ministers from across the globe and experts from across the globe sharing their experiences and best practices related to sanitation.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (Mahatma Gandhi International Convention) will conclude on 2nd October, 2018 with the launch of Bapus 150th birth anniversary celebrations.
This is especially essential for the freedom, peace and justice of the oppressed, the exploited and the deprived section of the society.
Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar, several provisions have been made to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his own vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was constituted on 12th October 1993.
After a few days, NHRC will complete 25 years of its existence.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also worked to increase human dignity.
Our beloved leader, the former Prime Minister of our country, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had clearly stated that human rights are not a partial concept for us.
The motto of the Vedic Period has been inscribed in the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission.
NHRC has generated widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
In this journey of 25 years, it has created an atmosphere of hope and faith in the countrymen.
For a healthy society and for the best democratic values, I believe that this is a very promising event.
Today, in addition to the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been set up.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and practice - that is the basis for Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
My dear countrymen, be it the month of October, the birth anniversary of Jai Prakash Narayan, or the beginning of the centenary year of Rajmata Vijayraj Scindia ji, all these great men have been inspiring us, we bow down to him and on the occasion of Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary on 31st October, I will talk in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat. But today, on the occasion of Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary, on 31st October, I want to mention that for some years, Run for Unity is being organized in every small town of India, in every village.
This year too, we should strive to organize 'Run for Unity' in our villages, cities and towns.
Run for Unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb as he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I appeal to all of you that on October 31, through 'Run for Unity', we will strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society, every unit of the country in the thread of unity, and that will be a good tribute to them.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, today the entire country is celebrating the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
This festival has also been a great example of social harmony for centuries.
There are many such stories in the history of the country in which a Rakhi has linked two different states or people associated with religion with a thread of faith.
Just a few days later, Janmashtami is also celebrated.
The entire ambience is like that of elephants, horses, palanquins, Jai Kanya Lal ki, Govind Govind etc.
The natural joy of dancing in the color of Lord Krishna is somewhat different.
Heartiest greetings to all fellow citizens on Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami.
My heartiest greetings to all fellow citizens on the occasion of Sanskrit Week.
I am extremely grateful to daughter Chinmai who raised this issue.
Friends, Apart from Raksha Bandhan, Sanskrit day is also celebrated on the occasion of Shravani Poornima.
I congratulate all those who are engaged in protecting, nurturing and spreading this great heritage.
Every language has its own greatness.
India is proud of the fact that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world.
And we all Indians take pride in the fact that from the time of Vedic times to the present, Sanskrit language has also played a major role in the propagation of knowledge.
Sanskrit language and its literature have a repository of knowledge that connects all walks of life.
You all will be happy to know that the residents of Matur village of Sivamoga district of Karnataka state still use Sanskrit language for talks.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language that has the potential to produce eternal words.
It is possible to produce innumerable words through 2000 metal, 200 suffix, 22 prefix, and suffix.
And so, in any particular, a fine expression or subject can be expressed at all.
That is, if a guru imparts even a letter to his disciple, then there is no such thing in the whole world that the disciple can take the loan of his guru.
Let us celebrate the upcoming Teacher's Day with this spirit: Knowledge and Guru are invaluable, priceless, priceless.
I wish all the teachers of the country the very best on Teachers' Day.
At the same time, I thank you all for your dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, monsoon brings a new hope for our hardworking farmers.
Monsoon gives relief to the drying trees, shrubs and dry water bodies in the scorching heat.
But at times, it is also flooding with severe flooding and flooding.
There is a situation of nature that in some places it has rained more than in other places.
Recently, all of us have seen that there has been a tremendous impact on the lives of people in Kerala due to terrible floods.
Today, the entire country stands with Kerala in this difficult situation.
Our sympathies are with those families.
I am confident that with the courage and indomitable courage of the people of the state, Kerala will soon be restored.
But during disasters, we also see humanity.
Wherever there is a disaster, whether it is Kerala or in any other district of India, in order to make life normal again, from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, we are doing something at each and every place.
People from all age groups and all walks of life are making their contributions.
We all know that the Armed Forces personnel are drying up the rescue operations in Kerala.
He left no stone unturned to rescue the flood victims.
Be it the Air Force, Navy, Army, BSF, CISF, RAF, everyone has played a major role in the rescue and relief operations.
I would like to especially mention the hard work of the brave NDRF personnel.
The subject on which people from all over the country have written the most is the subject of our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonepat, Bhai Pravin from Kerala, Dr.
Swapan Banerjee, from Katihar, Bihar to Akhil Pandey, many others have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov urging me to speak on various aspects of Atal ji's life.
On the 16th of August, the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's demise and everyone was deeply saddened.
A nation leader who left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, for the last 10 years, he had gone a long way from active politics.
The kind of affection, faith and grief that Atal ji had for him all over the country reflects his great personality.
For the past several days, the best aspects of Atal ji have come to the fore.
India will always be indebted to Atal ji for the 1st Amendment Act, 2003.
This change brought about two major changes in the politics of India.
First, the size of the Cabinet in the State was restricted to 15 of the total number of Assembly seats.
Second, the limit under the Anti-Party Act was increased from one third to two thirds.
In addition, clear guidelines were also issued for disqualification of participants.
For many years, the political culture of forming big ministries in India had housed.These big cabinets were not meant for sharing work but for making politicians happy.
Atal ji changed this culture.
These steps have saved money and resources.
Along with this, efficiency also increased.
Atal ji was the visionary who changed the situation and implemented a healthy tradition in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of the budget from 5 pm to 11 am.
Thus, they brought our precious tricolor closer to the people.
I would certainly like to say that for a healthy democracy, for a better democracy, for a good tradition, continuous efforts to strengthen democracy and to carry forward the discussions with an open mind will also be a great tribute to Atal ji.
A few days ago, the Monsoon Session of Parliament concluded here.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and that of Rajya Sabha was 4.
And as a result, 21 bills were passed by the Lok Sabha and 14 bills were passed by the Rajya Sabha.
This monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and welfare of youth.
In this session, several important Bills benefiting the youth and the backward classes were passed.
You all know that there has been a demand for setting up of OBC Commission for decades like Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has fulfilled its resolve to set up an OBC Commission this time.
The session also witnessed the passing of the Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will protect the interest of SCs and STs in a better way.
At the same time, it will prevent the offenders from torturing the people of this class and instill confidence in the Dalit communities.
No member of society can tolerate any injustice against the country's Nari Shakti.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2019 to provide stringent punishment for those harassing or injuring or indulging in violence will be punishable with minimum 10 years.
Girls below the age of 12 years will be sentenced to death by the perpetrators.
A few days ago, you must have read in a newspaper that a court in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh had only completed the hearing in two months and sentenced two criminals of Kurm to death on one Saggar.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had sentenced the culprits to death for just five days.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts there have given similar speed.
This Act will play an effective role in preventing crimes against women and girls.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
This time in the monsoon session, everyone has shown an ideal together.
Today I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, the attention of crores of Indians is now being paid to the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Everybody wakes up in the morning and watches over newspapers, TV, news, social media and sees that an Indian player has won a medal, it is true.
The Asian Games are still going on.
I would like to congratulate all the players who have won medals for the country.
I also convey my best wishes to those players whose competitions are yet to take place.
India's players are doing excellent work especially in boxing and wrestling, but our players are also bringing medals in sports where we have not seen much earlier in the past as well as in sports like Wushu and Boating.
This is not just a medallion, but a proof of the courage and dreams of Indian sports and players.
The increasing number of our daughters who have won medals for the country is a very positive sign.
Similarly, our youngsters in the age group of 15-16 years are also among those who have won medals.
This is also a very good sign that most of the players who have won the medals are from small towns and villages and these players have achieved this through hard work.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all sports lovers and also pay my tributes to the legendary Hockey player Shri Dhyan Chand Ji.
I appeal to all the citizens of the country that they must certainly take care of sports and their fitness because a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
Only if India is healthy will the bright future of India be created.
Namaste Bhavana ji, I respect your feelings.
We all have seen houses and buildings being constructed with bricks and stones but can you imagine that about 1200 years ago a large mountain which was a complete rock was given the form of a magnificent large and magnificent temple, perhaps it was difficult to imagine but this was the case.
And that temple is the Kailashnath Temple in Ellora, Maharashtra If anyone tells you that a pillar with a length of more than 60 metres of granite has been built about a thousand years ago, and a rock with a weight of approximately 80 tonnes has been erected at its peak.
But the Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is a place where this incredible blend of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everybody is amazed to see the 11th century queen of Patan in Gujarat.
India has been a land engineering lab.
There were so many engineers in India who made the imagination imaginative and presented miraculous examples in the world of engineering.
In our legacy of great engineers, we also got such a gem whose work is still inspiring the people.
M.
He is revered in that part of the country, but the rest of the country remembers him with great respect and affection.
In his memory, 15th September is celebrated as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, the engineers of our country have made a mark for themselves all over the world.
When I talk of wonders in the world of engineering, I am reminded of one incident of the worst earthquake that had occurred in Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
So I got the opportunity to visit a village where I got the opportunity to meet a person above the age of 100 years.
They were joking about us by looking at me and saying, "Look, this is my house.
It is called Bhong in Kutch.
Then my house has seen 3-3 earthquakes.
But you will not get any harm at all.
This house was built by our ancestors according to the natural conditions here and the environment here.
And he was saying this thing with so much pride that even centuries ago, engineers of that period had created the situation according to the local conditions that kept the common man safe.
Now, as we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think of the future.
Workshops should be done at different places.
What new things have to be learnt in the changed era
Will you have to teach
Will we have to connect
What to teach students ?
How should zero waste become our priority ?
When we celebrate Engineers Day, we must think of a number of such things.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of festivals.
And the preparations for Diwali also start.
With this spirit, my best wishes to everyone.
Thank you, I'll meet you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
So, at some places people are still waiting for the rains.
India's diversity and diversity sometimes reflects the dislike of rain.
But what do we blame the rains
Man is the one who has chosen the path of conflict with nature and as a result, sometimes the nature touches us.
It normally takes a few hours to go to the cave and get out of it .
But on that day, there was something else left for the accident.
When he went for a good walk inside the cave then suddenly because of heavy rains , at the entrance of the cave water was collected .
Their exit route stopped.
Due to lack of roads, they were trapped inside the cave on a small rock.
And that too is not a day or two, for the entire 18 days.
On the one hand, they were facing a crisis.
On the other hand, humanity all over the world was united expressing the virtues of human beings saved by God.
People from all over the world pray for the safety of these children.
The sense of responsibility at every level was amazing.
Whether it is the government, the parents of these children, their family members, the media, the citizens of the country, everyone has shown a wonderful way of peace and patience.
Everyone was associated with their campaign by forming a team.
I believe that a disciplined behavior is like learning, understanding.
It is not that the parents are not sad, it is not that the mothers have not shed tears. But patience, restraint and peaceful conduct of the society are a matter of learning for all of us.
It shows that when humanity is a dream, wonderful things are created.
A few days ago, our country's favorite poet Neeraj ji separated from us.
We can give a lot of strength and inspiration to the Indians as well as to Neeraj ji.
Our School Board, while passing the exam, talked about the stress and anxiety of our students and now your message is for students like me.
Similarly, two months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth.
Because, this is the time when the college is very busy.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam are out of school and enrolled in college.
If you go to the exams in February and March, papers and answers, then in the months of April and May holidays, together with fun, the results are spent on deciding the way forward in life, choosing a career.
The attention of the students is limited to hostels.
The students come from the umbrella of their parents to the umbrella of the professors.
I am confident that my young friends will be very excited and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time we have to get out of the house, get out of the village, get out of a protective environment and become a partner.
For the first time, all such youths have to leave their homes and spend their lives in a new direction.
I will tell all of you to stay calm, believe in life and enjoy inner peace in life.
Learn something new, like new skills, learn new languages.
He has already successfully completed the MBBS examination of AIIMS Jodhpur.
His father nurtures waste to feed his family.
I congratulate him for his success.
There are many such students who come from poor families and despite adverse circumstances, they have done something with their hard work and hard work, which inspires us all.
Be it the prince of Delhi, whose father is a bus driver in DTC, or Abhay Gupta of Kolkata who studied on the pavement by sitting down on the street lights, Ahmedabad's daughter is African Sheikh, whose father runs an auto rickshaw.
The Divyang person from Gurgaon, Anushka Panda, is suffering from a hereditary disease called spine muscular atrophy.
All of them have achieved this success by breaking all barriers with their determination and their courage.
If we look around us, we will also get some such examples.
Any good event happening in any corner of the country inspires me.
And when I am telling you the story of this young man, I am reminded of the story of poet Neeraj ji and this is the purpose of life.
There was something like this, once I was interacting with two Indian youth in San Jose, USA, a technology hub.
I appealed to them to think about how they can use their talent for India and take time out to do something.
I called upon them to convert brain drain to brain gain.
Both IT professionals Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Bajpai took an innovative effort to address this challenge.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have teamed up with their professional skills and developed a smart village app.
This app is not only connecting the people of the village with the whole world, but now they can get information on their mobile phones.
The residents of village Taudhakpur in Rae Bareli, the Sarpanch of the village, the District Magistrate, the Taluka Development Officer, made the people aware about the use of the app.
It has now become easier to monitor the progress of the development work being done in the village, to record it through this app.
The app has phone directory of the village, news department, episode list, health centre and wellness centre.
The Grameen feature of the App, FACT rate among farmers, in a way works as a market for their produce.
If you look at this incident closely then one thing will be remembered that those people who had left India many years ago, those who had left India, those who knew the nuances of their villages, understood the challenges, and were associated with the feelings of the villages.
This is the reason why he probably could make the village what he wanted better and made it better.
The feeling of attachment to your village, your native place and doing something for the home, is naturally inherent in every Indian.
However, sometimes due to some distance from time to time, due to some circumstances, a thin dust accumulates on it, but if a small spark touches it, then the good thing emerges again.
Pandharpur is in itself a wonderful journey.
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, celebrated on the 23rd of July this year, is celebrated as the grand finale of the Pandharpur Vari.
Pandharpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra.
Just about 15-20 days before Ashadhi Ekadashi, pilgrims walk on foot to visit Pandharpur with palanquin.
Lakhs of workers are involved in this journey, which is called Vari.
Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram are great saints like Vitthal, Vitthal.
Pilgrimage is also known as Lord Vitthal which is also known as Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
There is immense devotion to people in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
Visiting Vithoba temple in Pandharpur and its glory, its beauty and spiritual bliss is a different experience.
I appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat that if they get an opportunity, they must experience Pandharpur Vari.
Unstinted saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram are still educating the untouchables in Maharashtra.
Providing strength to fight against superstitions.
Whether it is their load or not, we receive the message of goodwill, love and brotherhood from them.
It gives us the mantra to fight against superstition.
These were the people who stopped the society from time to time, showed tokens and arrows. They ensured that the old traditions of our society were eradicated from our society and that this India is a land of multi-faceted heritage.
We remember Tilak ji on his Jayanti on 23rd July and his Punya Tithi on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence.
He had the power and wisdom to show the foundations of British rulers.
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that they tried to impose sedition on him thrice in 20 years and this is no small thing.
Today, I want to place an interesting incident related to Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad before the countrymen.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, perhaps 100 years ago, more than 40,000 people welcomed him in Ahmedabad.
And during this visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with him.
And Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was so much influenced by Lokmanya Tilak and when Lokmanya Tilakji died on 1st August 1920, he decided that he would make a memorial for Tilak in Ahmedabad.
At the end, the statue was built and Sardar Saheb inaugurated it not by anybody but by Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February 1992.
And I am telling you about that period of the British.
Due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak, the tradition of public Ganesh Utsav started.
The Sarvajanik Ganesh Utsav became an effective medium to promote the spirit of traditionalism and joy, social awareness, collectiveness, people-to-people harmony and equality.
In such a scenario, there was a time when the country was united in its fight against the British by breaking the shackles of caste and creed.
Over a period of time, these events became popular.
This shows that what is the crucifix in our youth against the brave leaders of our ancient heritage and history.
Today, in many cities, it is possible that you will get to see a Ganesh Mandap in almost every street.
My dear countrymen, I had requested last time too and today as I am remembering Lokmanya Tilak, I would once again urge you to celebrate Ganesh Utsav with full vigour and celebrate it with full vigour.
And I will also say that on My Gov as well as on Narendra Modi App, things of eco-friendly Ganesh Utsav should be widely publicized.
I will convey your message to the people.
Lokmanya Tilak instilled confidence in the countrymen and he gave the slogan Swaraj is our birth right and we will take it forward.
He said that Swaraj is our birth right and we will fulfil it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and good results of development.
Those who sacrificed their lives so that the countrymen could breathe freely in the air of freedom.
Chandrashekhar Azad inspired many young people to save their lives for freedom and bravery.
Azad put his life at stake but he never bowed before foreign rule.
I am fortunate that I got the opportunity to go to Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I salute these two great sons of Mother India Lokmanya Tilakji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland, India's brave daughter and farmer daughter Hima Das made history by winning the Gold Medal.
In response to my letter, one more daughter of the country, 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat' has e-mailed me from Indonesia that she is currently preparing for Asian Games there.
You have brought glory to the country.
Ekta has won gold and bronze medals in the World Para Athletics Grand Pre-2018 in Tunisia.
His accomplishment is special because he has made his challenge a medium of work.
In 2003, due to the road accident, half of the body of daughter Ekta Bhyan has become useless, but this daughter has achieved this achievement by not losing courage and making herself strong.
Another Divyang, Yogesh athuniaji, has also set a world record by winning the Gold Medal in the Para Athletics Grand Pre-Discuss Throat (Curkfank) in Berlin and Sunder Singh Gurjar, along with him, has also won the Gold medal in the Bhalfenk.
My dear countrymen, many events and festivals of the month of August are full of celebrations, but due to monsoons, sometimes a disease enters the house.
I convey my best wishes for the good health of all of you, for the month of August, and for several festivals which have been going on for centuries.
Once again we will definitely get Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much.
A few days ago, a historic cricket match was held in Bengaluru.
You people have understood a lot that I am talking about the Test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistan's first international match and it is a matter of pride for India that this historic match from Afghanistan was with India.
Both the teams performed very well in this match and the other baller Rashid Khan of Afghanistan had performed very well in the IPL this year. And I remember that President of Afghanistan Mr. Ashraf Ghani had tagged me on Twitter and the people of Afghanistan are very proud of his hero Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our players to showcase their skills.
The best in Afghanistan is represented by Rashid.
It is the asset of the world of cricket and at the same time he wrote it in a funny manner or not let us give it to someone else.
This match will be a memorable match for all of us.
It is very natural to remember that this was the first match but I will remember that match for some special reason.
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world.
He did what a winning team could do while taking the trophy.
The team from Afghanistan, for the first time, played an international match while taking the trophy, invited the Afghanistan team and received photographs from both the teams.
We can experience the spirit of sportsmanship, the spirit of sportsmanship.
There is a very good way to unite the sports society and to discover the talent of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that in the same way we will play and blossom with each other, with full sportsman spirit.
My dear countrymen, on the 21st of June, there was a different perspective on the fourth Yoga Day.
The whole world looked together.
Be it the European Parliament in Brussels, the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Japanese Navy's warship, everywhere people were watching yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic event of Yoga was organized and I was told that women had performed many asanas.
The Indian and Chinese soldiers simultaneously practiced yoga on the high Burfilla peaks of Ladakh.
Yoga works to break all the boundaries.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries went beyond caste, religion, region, colour or gender to make this occasion a big festival.
If people from all over the world were so excited and participating in the Yoga Day programmes, why would it not be so encouraging in India
The country is proud when 1.25 billion people see that the security forces of our country have practiced Yoga at all three places in the Navy, the Army and the Air Force.
Some brave soldiers performed yoga at some places in Submarine, while some soldiers practiced yoga at the snowy mountains in Siachen.
Our air warriors, even in the midst of the sky, have energised everyone by performing Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet.
The sight was to see that he did yoga in air instead of sitting in a plane.
Yoga has been practiced everywhere - be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or playgrounds.
One of the scenes from Ahmedabad touched the heart.
Around 50 divyang brothers and sisters together performed Yoga at one place and set the world record.
I believe that today the work of Wellness, Revolution is being done by the Commission.
I hope that the movement of wellness through yoga will go a long way.
Most people will make it a part of their lives.
Many people have written to me on MyGov and Narendra Modi App that I will talk about Doctors Day on 1st July in Mann Ki Baat this time.
We remember the doctor in difficult times, but this is a day when the country celebrates the achievements of our doctors and expresses gratitude for their service and dedication towards society.
We are those people who worship mother in the form of God, believe in God as well because mother gives us life.
Mother gives birth to us and sometimes doctors give us birth again.
The role of a doctor is not limited to the treatment of diseases.
Today, doctors not only have medical expertise but they also have a great experience about the impact of general life style transactions on our health.
Indian doctors have made a mark for themselves all over the world with their talent and skills.
In the medical profession, along with Maharath, hardworking, our doctor is also known for resolving complex medical problems.
With the help of Mann Ki Baat, I extend my best wishes to all our doctor friends on the eve of Doctors Day on the 1st of July.
My dear countrymen, we are fortunate people who have been born in this land of India.
India has a rich history when there will not be a month or a day when there will not be any historical event.
Look, every place in India has its own heritage.
There are some saints associated with it, some great man, some famous person, everyone's own contribution, everyone's greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on the 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, you would be aware of Kabirwad of Gujarat.
When I was working there, I had organized a large national convention of the people associated with the tradition of Sant Kabir.
You know why Kabirdas Ji had come to Maghar
At that time there was a belief that the one who died in Maghar would not go to heaven.
On the contrary, the body that sacrifices in Kashi, goes to heaven.
Maghar was considered uncle, but Sant Kabirdas Ji did not believe in it.
He had to break the myths and superstitions of his time and that is why he went to Maghar and took the tomb.
Sant Kabirdas Ji emphasised on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his disciples and friends.
This was his ideal.
We see the same ideals in his creations and it is equally inspiring in today's era.
One of their friends is Kabir Soi Pir. However, if we do not know the sufferings of others, we do not know the sufferings of others, we do not know the sufferings of others.
Kabirdas Ji gave a special emphasis on social harmony.
He used to think a lot more than his time.
At a time when there was a time of conflict and turmoil in the world, he gave the message of peace and harmony and united the people of the country to end the divisions.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God.
Wherever he went, he took several initiatives for the welfare of the society.
The system of kitchens free of social discrimination where every caste, creed, religion or sect can come and eat and eat and Guru Nanak Devji had started this Langar system.
In 2019, the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated.
I want all of us to connect with it with enthusiasm and zeal.
I also urge you people that on the occasion of Guru Nanak Devji's 550th Prakash Parv, how can we celebrate it in the entire society and across the world, what new ideas are there, what new ideas are there, what new ideas are there, what new ideas are there, we should think about it, prepare it and make it an inspiration for all of us, with great pride.
India's struggle for independence is very long, very comprehensive, very hot and full of countless sacrifices.
There is a history associated with Punjab.
In 2019, the horrific events of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre are also ending 100 years that made humanity ashamed.
Who can forget the dark days of April 13, 1971 when bullets were fired on innocent, unarmed and innocent people, crossing all limits of cruelty that used to abuse the power.
Victory is always about peace and non-violence, between sacrifice and sacrifice.
Shri Raman Kumar from Rohini, Delhi has written on Narendra Modi Mobile App that Dr.
Syama Prasad Mookerjee on his birthday and he wants to attend the event.
Syama Prasad Mookerjee to India.
First of all, thank you very much.
It was a great pleasure to see your interest in the history of India.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with many fields, but the areas which were closest to him were education, administration and parliamentary affairs.
Very few people would know that Kolkata University was the youngest Vice Chancellor of the University.
On the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convention in Kolkata University in Bengali.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industry Minister of India and in a sense he had laid a strong foundation for industrial development, a strong base and a strong platform.
The first industrial policy of independent India in 1948 was a reflection of his ideas and vision.
Mukherjee's dream was that India should be self-reliant, skilled and prosperous in every sector.
He wanted India to develop big industries as well as focus on MSMEs, handloom, textiles and cottage industry.
All India Handicraft Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi Village Industries Board were set up between 1948 and 1950 to ensure better development of cottage and small industries.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had made a huge contribution.
He was very devoted to the development of West Bengal.
It is the result of his understanding, wisdom and activism that one part of Bengal can be saved and it is a part of India today.
Dr.
Remembering Shyama Prasad Mukherjees message of unity, be it in the spirit of harmony and brotherhood, be engaged in the progress of India.
My dear countrymen, in the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video conference.
We got the opportunity to learn from them directly about the changes that are taking place in the lives of people by moving ahead from the files.
People spoke of their resolve, their happiness and sorrow, and their achievements.
In remote villages, daughters are providing services ranging from pension to passport to the elderly in the village through Common Service Centres.
When a sister from Chhattisgarh is engaged in the business of making Sitaphal and making it an ice-cream.
Like the Anjani Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras as well as supplying cheaper medicines to the nearby villages.
There is no corner of the country where people dont have to tell about their success.
In such a situation, when a common man talks of new hope, new zeal and events happening in his life, then it is not the credit of the government.
Even a small girl from a remote village, becomes an inspiration for 1.25 billion countrymen.
For me, with the help of technology and through video bridge, one moment of spending time with the beneficiaries has been very pleasant and inspiring.
A new joy, a new enthusiasm, a new inspiration to give life to the poorest of the poor.
I am very grateful to the countrymen.
40-40,50-50 lakh people joined this video bridge program and you have given me new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you.
I always feel that if we look around us then something is better somewhere or the other.
There are good people.
We can also feel the fragrance of goodness.
In the past, one thing came to my mind and this is a unique combination.
On the one hand there are professionals and engineers while on the other hand there are farm workers and our farmer brothers and sisters associated with agriculture.
Now you would be wondering that these are two very different businesses - what is the relation of this
But it is such that the corporate professionals and IT engineers have come together in Bengaluru to build a simple prosperity trust that will double the income of the farmers.
He went out to connect with the farmers and make arrangements and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Today, they are not only producing vegetables but also marketing their vegetables through the trust to get good prices.
Farmers producing food grains are also associated with it.
On the one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing and on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure farmers participation in profits.
I am extremely grateful to these youngsters for their innovative experiment. And I am glad that these young people associated with the world of professionals, technologists, engineering, have come out of their boundaries to connect with the farmers, to connect with the villages and to connect with the fields.
Once again, I would like to congratulate the young generation of my country for their innovative experiments, I might have known something or the other, some people might have known something, some might not have known it, some might not have known it, but crores of people are continuously doing something good on my behalf.
GST will complete one year.
One Nation, One Tax, the dream of the people of the country, has now become a reality.
For one nation, one tax reform, if I want to give credit to the states, if I want to give maximum credit to them then I will give credit to the states.
GST is a very good example of Cooperative Federalism where all the states together have taken a decision in the country and then such a big tax reform has been implemented in the country.
So far 2 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can all be proud that the people of different political ideologies, people of different states sit and have different priority states, but all the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken with consensus.
Prior to GST, there were 1 different types of taxes in the country. But now only one tax has been imposed in the whole country.
GST is a victory of honesty and a festival of honesty.
Earlier, there used to be complaints of inspector raj in the case of tax.
With the introduction of GST, check posts have been shut down and movement of goods has been expedited, which is not only saving time but also benefitting from logistics.
GST will probably be the world's largest tax reform.
Such a big tax reform in India was successful because the people of the country adopted it and it was through public power that the success of GST was ensured.
It is generally believed that such a big reform, such a big country, it takes 5 to 5 years to complete the task of establishing such a large number of people. But the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the festival of honesty of the country, is the result of the participation of the people in the Jan Shakti.
This in itself is a great achievement for 1.25 billion Indians.
Once again, after completing Mann Ki Baat, I am waiting for the next episode of Mann Ki Baat to meet you and talk to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskar!
Through Mann Ki Baat, once again I have got the opportunity to be present before you.
You might remember very well that a team of six women commanders of the Navy had been on a sea trip for several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama, I would like to talk about it.
These six daughters of India, their team spent more than 45 days travelling all over the world on INSV Tarini, returned to India on 21 May and welcomed them warmly across the country.
He travelled across the oceans, and in many seas, and covered a distance of almost twenty two thousand nautical miles.
This was the first such event in the world.
Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet all these daughters and listen to their experiences.
If we look at the development journey of the human race, then it is the progress that has arisen out of the clutches of some adventure.
Recently, you must have seen that many new things have been noticed about those who are walking on the Mount Everest. For centuries, Everest has been defying human race and brave people have been accepting this challenge.
On 16th May 1999, a team of five tribal children from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra - Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Alay, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Kattode, Vikas Soyam - had scaled the highest peaks in the world.
I congratulate the people of Chandrapur school and my young friends from the bottom of my heart.
Recently, a 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to receive Everest from Nepal.
Many congratulations to Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Diya Everest became the first Indian father-son to join.
It is not that only the youth are engaged in Everest.
Sangeeta Bahal, aged 19, scaled Everest and Sangeeta Bahal aged more than 50.
There are some who have been riding on Everest who have shown that they have not only skills but are also sensitive.
For years, people have been engaged in Everest. There are many people who have successfully completed it.
I heartily congratulate all these brave hearts, especially the daughters and sisters.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, when I talked about Fit India two months ago, I had not thought that such a good response would be received.
A large number of people from all walks of life will come forward to support it.
When I talk about Fit India, I believe that the more we play, the more the country will play.
On social media, people are sharing videos of fitness challenges, tagging one another and challenging them.
Today everyone is joining this movement of Fit India.
Whether it is the people associated with films, the people associated with sports or the common man of the country, the soldiers, the school teachers, all around a single echo is heard - Yeah, Fit to India Fit.
It is a matter of great happiness for me that the captain of the Indian cricket team Virat Kohli has challenged me and I have accepted that challenge.
I believe that this is a very good thing and such a challenge will keep us fit and motivate others to stay fit.
Chhavi Yadav Ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that games that were once a part of the lives of every child, are becoming a part of the lives of every child.
These games were specially part of the summer vacation.
There are two types of games in traditional sports.
They are outside their homes as well.
The unity hidden behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games.
The same game is known by different names at different places.
I belong to Gujarat.
I know there is a game in Gujarat.
It is played with coats or tamarind seeds or dice and with square boards of 8778.
This game was played in almost every state.
We also played this game.
Who amongst us will be such that has not played moi dandiya in childhood
Moi Dandiya (Gilli Danda) is a game that runs from villages to cities.
It is known by different names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla.
In Odisha, it is called Gulibari. In Maharashtra, it is called Vitittalau.
Some games used to have their own season.
For example, there is a season to spit out kites.
When all the kites fly, when we play, we can express the unique qualities that we have in us.
You must have seen that many children are shy and shy, but there is a lot of turmoil in sports.
He expresses himself, the one who appears to be serious, the one who is hidden in him at the time of the game comes out.
Traditional sports are built in such a way that along with physical fitness, our rational thinking, concentration, alertness and energy also enhances.
From the children to the grandparents, when all the plays are played, then what is called the Pele and the Generation Gap disappears somewhere.
Many games also make us aware about society, environment etc.
Today, it is necessary that schools, streets, youth boards etc. come forward and promote these games.
Through crowd sourcing, we can create a huge collection of our traditional sports.
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of June, our country will officially host the World Environment Day celebrations.
This is an important achievement for India and a proof of Indias growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change.
The theme of this time is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I appeal to all of you that by understanding this theme and its importance, all of us should ensure that we do not use polythene, low grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on our forest life and on our health.
Go to the World Environment Day website Wed-India 2018 and there are many interesting suggestions. See, know, and try to place them in your daily lives.
When there is extreme heat, floods, rain does not take the name of the stoppage, unbearable cold then everyone becomes an expert and talks about global warming, climate change, but what can be done by talking about it
In the last few weeks, all of us have seen that dust storms in different parts of the country, heavy winds and rains have caused havoc.
There was also a loss of life and a shipment too.
All these things are basically the result of change in the climate landscape.
Our culture, our traditions have not taught us to fight against nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature and we have to stay connected with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had argued this thing in the wake of his lifetime.
When India played a leading role in the COP-21 and Paris Agreement, when we brought together the whole world through the International Solar Alliance, it was at the core of all these dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this Environment Day, let us think about whether we can do something to keep our planet clean and green
How can we move in this direction
Can we become innovative
The monsoon is about to arrive. We can aim at record plantation this time and not only planting trees but also maintaining them until they grow up.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
Now you remember, on 21st June, not only yourself, but the whole world remembers you on 21st June.
21st June is celebrated as International Day of Yoga all over the world and it has been accepted and people start preparing for it months back.
Nowadays it is being reported that strong preparations are being made to celebrate 21st June as International Yoga Day all over the world.
Yoga for unity and harmony is a message which the world has repeatedly felt in the last few years.
Yoga creates courage, which protects us like a decent father.
A sense of forgiveness arises as a mother for her child and mental peace becomes our permanent friend.
Bhartuhari has said that by doing regular yoga, the truth becomes our child, our sister, self-restraint, our brother, the earth becomes our bed and knowledge our hunger.
When all such qualities are associated with someone, then the yogi acquires the victory of all kinds of fear.
Once again, I appeal to the countrymen to take forward our legacy of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is the 29th of May, the death anniversary of India's first Chief Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Panditji.
The memory of this month is also associated with another thing. And this is Veer Savarkar.
This was the month of May 1985, when the people of India showed their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our jawans and farmers were committed to opposing the injustice that was being done to them.
Saddened by the fact that for a long time, we have kept the incidents of 1985 merely as rebellion or sepoys.
In fact, it was not only a matter of negligence but it was also an attempt to shock our self-respect.
It was Veer Savarkar who wrote fearlessly that whatever happened in 1985 was not a rebellion but the first war of independence.
The heroes of London's India House, including Savarkar, celebrated their 50th anniversary with great fanfare.
It is also a wonderful coincidence that in the same month when the first freedom struggle started, Veer Savarkar ji was born.
Savarkar jis personality was full of qualities.
He was a worshipper of both weapons and sciences.
In general, Veer Savarkar is known for his bravery and struggle against the British Raj. But apart from that, he was also a brilliant poet and social reformer, who always emphasized on goodwill and unity.
A wonderful description about Savarkar ji was made by our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
How precise the picture was made by Atal ji.
Savarkar led with both poetry and revolution.
Being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary.
Our daughters, who were once forced to seek shelter from garbage, are now stitching clothes to cover the penance of the poor after learning the sewing work.
I wish these daughters, full of hope and faith, the very best for their bright future.
He has shown that if you have the courage to do something and if you are determined to do it then success can be achieved even in the midst of all the difficulties.
And this is not just a matter of Sikar, you will see all these things in every corner of India.
If you look at the problems in your neighborhood, you will notice how people overcame the problems.
You must have experienced that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, and there are discussions with some people present there.
This discussion should be of politics, of society, of cricket, of sports and players, of the country and of the problems of the country such as this problem should be solved in the same way. But most of these things remain confined to the discussions only, but there are some people who move forward in the direction of bringing about changes with their work, their hard work and hard work.
Mr. D.
Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the past five decades.
Today you will be surprised to know that more than 70 children are filling the lamp of education in their lives.
He also opened a school named 'Asha Ashwasan' for the children living in slums where poor tea sellers spend 50 of their income.
It arranges for education, health and food for all the children coming to the school.
I'm D.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his hard work, his dedication and giving a new direction to the lives of the poor children.
They have removed the darkness of their lives.
Who does not know the Vedas, but has shown them alive.
Prakash Raoe.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for society and for the whole country.
You will also have a series of inspiring events around you.
There will be countless incidents.
Let us move forward with positivity.
In the month of June, there is so much heat that people wait for the rains and in hope the sky looks bright towards the clouds.
A few days from now, people will also wait for the moon.
Seeing the moon means being celebrated as Id.
The festival of Eid is a symbol of the beginning of a month's fast during Ramzan.
I am confident that all the people will celebrate Eid with full enthusiasm and on this occasion, especially the children will get a good Eid.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Recently, 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
Nineteen countries of the world including India participated.
When such a grand event and thousands of players from all over the world are participating in it, can you imagine the atmosphere
Enthusiasm, zeal, enthusiasm, hopes and aspirations, the resolve to do something - who can keep it apart when there is such an environment
Our players too performed very well in fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the countrymen and they won one medal after another.
India has shown record performance in the field of shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis or badminton.
26 gold, 20 silver and 20 bronze - India won almost 66 medals.
This success makes every Indian proud.
Winners of the medal are a matter of pride and happiness for the players.
It is a celebration of immense pride for the entire country and for all the countrymen.
Perhaps, to express this sentiment, I will have less words.
But what I heard from these players, I want to tell you.
This is the first time that there were so many things.
Do you know that all the best players from India have won this medal in the Commonwealth Games.
Manika Batra won the medals in all the events that she participated in.
She is the first Indian woman to win a gold medal in the Indian Civil Table Tennis event.
India is home to the highest number of medals in shooting.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only Indian Para Power-Lifter to win medals in Commonwealth Games.
This time the games were special because most of the medal winners were women athletes.
Be it squash, boxing, weightlifting or shooting, women players have done wonders.
In Badminton, two players of India, Saina Nehwal and P.K.
V.
It was in the midst of the Indus.
The athletes who participated in the games came from different parts of the country, from small towns and cities.
It is also the contribution of his friends who have kept their courage alive in every situation.
Along with those players, I congratulate all of them and my best wishes to them.
In Mann Ki Baat last month, I had called for a Fit India with our countrymen, especially our youth. And I have invited everyone to join Fit India and lead the Fit India movement.
A gentleman Shriman Shashikant Bhonsle has shared a photo of himself in the swimming pool and has written - My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written, "I feel happy and healthy with the morning walk.
And he goes on to say - For me - fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy.
There is no doubt that Happiness is the fitness itself.
Cinema artist Akshay Kumar has posted a video on Twitter.
Many other youth have also shared their experiences by joining the Fit India efforts.
I believe that this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us, for the whole country.
The Mahatma of International Day of Yoga on 21st June is now accepted by the whole world.
You too, must prepare from now on.
And you must have seen that an animated video on which I was told is now becoming very popular.
My young friends, you will now be in the worry of holidays after coming out of the circle of exams, exams and exams.
How to celebrate holidays, where to go
Paper-writing outside the walls of the walls provides an opportunity to experience life in a new way away from computers.
My young friends, today I urge you for a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, Sports, HRD, Drinking Water and Sanitation and the three Ministries of the Government of India have jointly launched the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
College students, students, youth from NCC, youth from NSS, youth from Nehru Yuva Kendras, who want to do something for the society, for the country and for the country, who want to learn something for the society, who want to associate themselves with the changes in the society, this is an opportunity for all of them to do something for the society with a positive energy. And this will also strengthen cleanliness. And when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, we will be satisfied to do something before that.
Each intern who successfully completes this internship will be given a certificate by the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Not only this, the internet will complete it very well, the UGC will also provide two credit points to them.
I once again invite the students, students and the youth to take advantage of this internship.
You can register for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship by visiting MyGov App.
I hope our youth will further carry forward this movement of cleanliness.
I also want to know about your efforts.
You must send your mahites, send stores, send photos, send videos.
Come, let us make this holiday a learning opportunity for a new experience.
I have seen that a few days ago, I was telling the stories of the youth of Delhi who were selflessly engaged in the education of poor children.
Starting with 15 children in slums near Gita Colony, Delhi, this campaign has connected 2000 children to 12 places in the capital today.
The youth and teachers associated with this mission are engaged in this massive effort to bring about a 2 hours free time out of their busy routine and social change.
Brothers and sisters, In the same way, some farmers of the mountainous regions of Uttarakhand have become an inspiration for the farmers of the country.
Their organized efforts not only changed the fortune of their own sector but also of their own sector.
Bageshwar in Uttarakhand mainly crops like Ragi, Rajgra, Maize or Jowar.
Due to being a hilly area, the farmers could not get the right price for their produce.
But the farmers of Kapkot Taluka instead of selling the crop directly to the market, instead of suffering it wrong, they adopted the path of value addition and adopted the path of value addition.
They started making biscuits from this farm produce and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative institute in Munnar village, and a factory to construct biscuits.
Given the courage of the farmers, the system has also linked it with the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being transported not only to about 50 Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district but to Almora and Kausani .
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institute has gone up from Rs 10 to Rs 15 lakh but at the same time, more than 700 families have been prevented from getting employment.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that in the future, the world will have to fight against water.
Everyone talks about it but is it our responsibility or not
Do we not think that water conservation should be a social responsibility ?
Our ancestors have shown this thing alive for centuries.
He gave priority to water Mahatmaya, one drop of water.
They have discovered such a new solution that how to save one drop of water .
Probably those among you who have got the opportunity to visit Tamil Nadu, there are some temples in Tamil Nadu where large inscriptions of irrigation system, water conservation system and drought management have been written in the temples.
Be it Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Puddukottai, you will get to see big inscriptions everywhere.
If you go to Rajasthan then you must visit Chand Baaw in Jodhpur .
It is one of India's largest and most beautiful habitats and one of the focus areas is the water shortage.
April, May, June and July are such times when there is an excellent opportunity to store rain water and if we prepare in advance then as much benefit is available to us.
MNREGA budget is also being used for water conservation.
In the last three years, everyone has made every effort in the direction of water conservation and water management.
About 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation and water management, apart from the MNREGA budget every year.
In 2017-18, I have spent 55 of the total expenditure of 64 thousand crore rupees i.e. about 35 thousand crore rupees on water conservation.
During the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefited through such water conservation and water management measures.
The MNREGA budget received by the Government of India for water conservation and water management has benefitted some people a lot.
In Kerala, thousands of MNREGA workers on that river revived the river after working hard for 70 days.
There are rivers Ganga and Yamuna full of water but there are also some areas in Uttar Pradesh, like the two small rivers named Sasur Khadi of Fatehpur district have dried up.
The district administration has taken up the work of conservation of soil and water in large numbers under MNREGA.
With the help of people of about 40-45 villages, this Sasur Khadi river restored the drought-hit river.
Be it animals, birds, farmers, agriculture or villages, this success is full of blessings.
I will say the same thing that once again April, May, June and July are before us, we should take any responsibility for water conservation, we should also make some schemes, we should also do something.
When Mann Ki Baat falls, I receive messages, papers and phones from all sides.
We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year, but many people do not know about the philosophy of living with the Nobel Prize winner Rabindra Nath Tagore with ease, beauty and insight.
Discuss this in the Mann Ki Baat programme so that people may know about it.
I thank Ayyan Ji for attracting the attention of all the friends of Mann Ki Baat towards this.
Gurudev Tagore was full of knowledge and wisdom, whose writings left an indelible mark on everyone.
Rabindranath was a talented personality, a multifaceted personality, but one of his teachers could experience it every moment.
He wrote in Gitanjali He, who has the knowledge he has the responsibility to import from the students.
I do not know the language of Bangladesh, but when I was young, I used to get up very early - the radio from childhood and eastern India starts soon.
I guess Rabindra Sangeet started at 5:30 in the morning and I got into a habit of singing Rabindra Sangeet at 5:30 in the morning.
I was habituated to listening to Rabindra Sangeet on radio when I got up early in the morning and when I got an opportunity to listen to these poems like Anandloke and Agure and Poreshmo, I got a sense of consciousness.
You must have been impressed by Rabindra Sangeet and his poems.
I respectfully offer tributes to Rabindranath Tagore.
The month of Ramzan is celebrated all over the world with great reverence and respect.
The social aspect of daily routine is that when a person is hungry he also feels hungry for others.
When he is thirsty he feels the thirst of others.
This is an occasion to remember the teachings and message of Pigmbar Mohammad Saheb.
It is our responsibility to follow the path of equality and brotherhood in his life.
Once a person asked Pygmbar Sahib, what is the best work in Islam
Pygmbar Saheb said - feeding a poor and needy and meeting with everyone in harmony, even if you know him or not.
Pygmbar Sahib believed in knowledge and compassion.
He was not proud of anything.
He used to say that it is only ego that defeats knowledge.
Pigamber Mohammad Saheb had said that if you have anything more than the requirement then give it to any needy person, so donation in Ramzan is also very important.
People donate in this holy month to those in need.
Pigamber Mohammad Sahib believes that a person is blessed with a pious soul, not with wealth and wealth.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showed the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, and guided millions around the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of the responsibility of all of us, the efforts to follow his path, the resolve to follow his path.
Lord Buddha is the source of inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
These are the human values that are needed most in today's world.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar used to stress that Lord Buddha has been a source of great inspiration in his social philosophy.
Baba Saheb strengthened the Dalits, oppressed, exploited and deprived sections of the society through the Constitution.
There cannot be a greater example of compassion.
This compassion for people is one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that Buddhist monks used to travel to different countries and were associated with them with the rich thoughts of Lord Buddha and they have been there all the time.
We have inherited the teachings of Lord Buddha across Asia.
This is the reason why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism in many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar and this is the reason why we are connecting important places of South-East Asia with special Buddhist destinations.
I am also happy that the Government of India has been partnering in the reconstruction of several Buddhist temples, including the centuries-old magnificent Ananda Temple in Myanmar.
Today, everywhere in the world, human suffering is visible, the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to remove hatred with compassion.
I convey my best wishes to everyone on the auspicious occasion of Buddha Purnima, who believes in the principles of compassion and believes in Lord Buddha spread across the world.
I seek blessings from Lord Buddha for the entire world, so that we can fulfill our responsibility of building a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of laughing Buddha, about which it is said that laughing Buddha brings good luck, but very few people know that smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event of India's defence history.
You must be wondering what is the connection between smiling Buddha and India's military power.
You might remember, 20 years ago on the evening of 11th May, 1898, the then Chief Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee addressing the nation and his words filled the whole country with pride, valour and happiness.
It was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 1989, a nuclear test was conducted at Pokhran, Rajasthan on the western side of India.
Indias testing has been successful and in a way India has demonstrated its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that that day is marked by the display of its military might in the history of India.
Lord Buddha has shown the world, inner strength, inner strength, is essential for peace.
Similarly, when you become strong as a nation, you can live peacefully with all.
The month of May 18th is not just important for the country that a nuclear test was conducted in this month, but the way it was done is important.
He showed the world that the land of India is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can scale new heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave the mantra - Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan.
We will also get a new joy and a new satisfaction to carry forward the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, when I meet again in Mann Ki Baat, I will talk more.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the holy festival of Ram Navami.
My best wishes to the people of the country on this auspicious occasion of Ram Navami.
We have seen the power of 'Ram' in the life of Pujya Bapu every moment in his life.
Recently, on the 26th of January, when all the dignitaries of ASEAN countries were present here, they brought cultural trips along with them. And it is a matter of great pride that most of these countries present Ramayana to us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are creating the same inspiration and influence not only in India but also in the entire world.
Once again, my best wishes to you all on the occasion of Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, like every other time, I have also received a large number of letters, emails, phone calls and comments from all of you.
I read what Komal Thakkar ji wrote about starting the online version of Sanskrit on MyGov.
It gives me great pleasure to see your love for Sanskrit along with being an IT professional.
I have asked the concerned departments to inform you about the efforts being made in this regard.
The audience of Mann Ki Baat who works in the context of Sanskrit will also be requested to consider what can be done in the context of the suggestion of Kamal ji.
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar ji, Village Barakar, District Nalanda, Bihar You read the comments written on NarendraModiApp.
The concern that you have expressed on the decreasing water level in the ground is certainly very important.
Shriman Sakal Shastriji, Karnataka.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animals in summers.
Sakhalji, I have conveyed your feelings to all the listeners.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha ji has said that I will talk about his health with the youth this time.
He feels that our youth are physically weak compared to Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time I should talk about health in detail - 'Fit India'.
And all of you can together launch the Fit India Movement with young people.
Recently, the French President had gone on a visit to Kashi. Mr. Prashant Kumar from Varanasi has written that all the scenes of this journey were touching and influencing the mind.
And he urged that all those pictures, all the videos should be published on social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had put these pictures on social media and Narendra Modi app on the same day.
Now you people like them and tweet, convey to your friends.
Angha, Jayesh and many children from Chennai sent to me by writing to me the ideas they had given in their heart about the gratuity cards that were given after the Exam Warriors book.
I want to tell all the children that your letters remove the tiredness of my day.
All these letters, all the phone calls, comments, I could read from them, all the things that I could hear, and many of those things that touched my heart, and even if I talked about them, perhaps I would have to go on saying something continuously for months.
This time most of the letters are from children who have written about the exam.
They have shared their plans about the holidays.
In summers, we have worried about the water for animals.
Farmers brothers and sisters have come to know about the Kisan Melas and the activities that are taking place throughout the country.
Several active citizens have suggested for water conservation.
During festivals, we talk about our festivals, our culture, our traditions.
That is, our thoughts also change with the seasons. And perhaps it is also true that our thoughts also change the weather of life of somebody.
And why not
In these words, in your experiences and in your examples, all the inspiration, all the energy, all the intimacy, are eager to do something for the country.
They have the power to change the weather of the entire country.
When I get to read in your letters that how Ahmad Ali, a rickshaw bearer of Karimganj in Assam, has built nine schools for the poor children due to his willpower, then this country's indomitable willpower.
In his mission, Saidul sold the houses and collected the money through donation.
Many of his travellers in the camp donated generously.
An engineer girl gave her first salary
In the same way, after 12 years of collecting money, the Bhagirathi tried to paint the same color and today due to his hard work, due to his same resolve, he is ready as a 30-bedded hospital with capacity of Puri village near Kolkata.
This is the strength of New India.
Today, the outlook of India has changed all over the world.
Today, there is a belief in the youth, women, the backward, the poor, the middle class and in every section of the country that yes
We can move forward, our country can move forward.
A positive atmosphere of self-confidence full of hopes and aspirations has been created.
This self-confidence, this positivity will fulfill our resolve of New India and will prove to be a dream.
My dear countrymen, in the coming few months, it is very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why there have been many letters related to agriculture.
This time, I also took a video of the discussion with the farmers on DD Kisan Channel, and I feel that every farmer should connect with DD Kisan Channel, and this experiment should be implemented in his field.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastriji, from Lohiyaji to Chaudhary Charan Singh ji and Chaudhary Devi Lalji, everyone considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and the common man's life.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastriji stressed on the need for plant, tree and plant protection and better agricultural infrastructure.
Ram Manohar Lohia on a big scale for better income for our farmers, better irrigation facilities and ensuring them all and enhancing food and milk production.
In his 1997 speech, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji stressed on the need for farmers to use new technology and innovate.
I had visited the Krishi Unnati Mela in Delhi recently.
My interaction with the farmer brothers and sisters and scientists there, learning about many experiences related to agriculture, knowing about the innovations related to agriculture, was a pleasant experience for me. But the thing that impressed me the most was the hard work of Meghalaya and the farmers there.
This state with low area has done a great job.
Our farmers in Meghalaya have a record production of over the last five years during 2015-16.
He has shown that when the goal is set, when the determination is strong and the resolve is in mind, it can be accomplished, it can be accomplished.
Today, the hard work of the farmers is getting technical support due to which the farmer is getting a lot of strength.
In the letters that I had received, I could see that many farmers had written about the spirit of support and they wanted me to talk about it in detail with them.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a major decision has been taken to provide fair price to the farmers.
It has been decided that MSP for the notified crops will be announced at least one and a half times of their cost.
Efforts are being made to connect the local mandis of the villages with the wholesale market and then with the global market.
22,000 rural haats in the country will be upgraded with necessary interface with APMC and e-NAM platform so that farmers do not have to go very far to sell their produce.
That is, in a way a direct link is being created with the fields.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.
How can the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our resolution. Besides, how can 1.25 billion Indians take a pledge and pay a great tribute to Gandhiji
How new activities can be respected for this
It is my request to all of you to share your thoughts with everyone through MyGov.
What is Gandhi 150
You may suggest to me what the slogan, the mantra or the phrase, is.
We all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and recall his inspiration and take our country to new heights.
Thank you. Thank you, you have rightly said and I believe that Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat are complementary to each other.
Today, the country has come out of a rigid approach in the field of health.
All the work related to health in the country was done by the Health Ministry only when all the departments and ministries, be it the Ministry of sanitation, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments are working together for a healthy India and the emphasis is on affordable health along with Preventive Health.
Preventive health care is the cheapest and the easiest thing.
And the more we create awareness about Preventive Health Care, the more it will benefit the family as well as the society.
There is a need for a healthy life - cleanliness.
As a result, sanitation coverage has doubled to almost 80 in the last 4 years.
Besides, work is being done at a comprehensive level in the direction of setting up of health wellness centres across the country.
It is the result of our commitment and commitment that today Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached every household.
More than 100 days have passed since the International Day of Yoga 21st June this year.
On the occasion of International Yoga Day, people from all over the country and the world participated with great enthusiasm.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do yoga on our own and motivate the entire family, friends and everyone for yoga from now on.
In new interesting ways, Yoga has to be popularized in children, in the youth, in the elderly, in all age groups, in men and women.
Although the TV and electronic media of the country has been doing various programs related to yoga during the year, but can we create awareness about yoga as a campaign from today till Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
Yes, I am a Yoga practitioner, but some people have made me a Yoga teacher through their creativity and have made me a 3D animated video of my yoga practice.
I will share those videos with you so that we can also practice asanas and Pranayama.
Efforts are also being made at an extensive level to ensure that healthcare is within the reach of the people and it is affordable and accessible to the common man.
The cost of heart stents have been reduced to 85 for heart patients.
The number of MBBS seats in 4 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being set up in different states to provide better treatment and health facilities to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened between every three districts.
We will all see collective efforts to get rid of B.B.
Years ago, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
For them, the industry was such an effective medium to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when the 'Make in India' campaign is going on successfully in the country, Dr.
The vision of Ambedkar, the dream of India as an industrial superpower, is an inspiration for us today.
Today, India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy and today the highest FDI inflows in the world are coming up in India.
The whole world is looking at India as a hub for investment, innovation and development.
Industry development in cities was the same idea that led to Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar believed in urbanization of India.
He did not want a person to live his life in poverty.
At the same time, he also believed that poverty cannot be eradicated by just dividing something into the poor.
Today, Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India initiatives are giving rise to our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
In the 1930s and 1940s, when only roads and railways were discussed in India, Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of the port and waterways.
This was stated by Dr.
Baba Saheb was the one who saw Jal Shakti as a nation power.
He stressed on the importance of water use for the development of the country, various river valley authorities, various water related commissions - all this was Babasaheb Ambedkar's vision.
Today historical efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New seaports are being built on different sea shores of India and the inland waterways are being strengthened in the old ports.
Most of the discussions in the 40s were related to the Second World War, the Cold War, and the Partition, during which Dr.
Ambedkar, in a way, laid the foundation for the spirit of Team India.
He spoke of the importance of a federal system, and stressed on the need to work together with the Centre and the States for the betterment of the country.
Today we have adopted the mantra of Cooperative Federalism, Co-operative Federalism and above all, Competitive Co-operative Federalism in every aspect of governance. And most importantly, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of people like me associated with the backward classes.
He has shown us that it is not necessary for a large or an rich family to be born, but even for those born in poor families of India, to dream, to fulfill that dream, and to achieve success.
Yes, it has also happened that many people paid tributes to Dr.
We tried to push them behind and made every effort to ensure that the sons of the poor and the backward families could not progress, could not achieve anything and could not achieve anything in their lives.
But the picture of New India is completely different.
An India that belongs to Ambedkar, the poor and the backward.
There will be separate programmes for rural development, poor welfare and social justice across India.
I appeal to all of you to actively participate in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, in the next few days, many festivals are about to come, Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi.
It is a day to remember the sacrifice and penance of Lord Mahavira on his Jayanti.
The philosophy of life of Lord Mahavira's messenger of non-violence will inspire all of us.
Greetings to all fellow citizens on Mahavir Jayanti.
While discussing Easter, one remembers the inspiring message of Lord Jesus Christ, who has sent a message of peace, harmony, justice, kindness and compassion to humanity.
When the festival of Baisakhi is celebrated in Punjab and West India in April, then on the same day the joy and joy of the Vaisakhi will prevail in Bihar on the same day at Judishital and Satuvai in Bihar and at Bihu in Assam.
All these festivals, in some form, are associated with our agricultural and food producers. Through these festivals, we thank nature for the priceless gifts that we receive in the form of produce.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat February 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar is the beginning of Mann Ki Baat today with a phone call.
Many of the questions related to science have been asked by my young friends to write something about it.
We have seen that the colour of the sea is blue, but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no colour of water.
Have we ever thought - whether it is a river or a sea , why does water become colorful
This question came to the mind of a young man in the decade of 1920.
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India.
The name of 'Raman' comes before us.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work on light scattering.
One of his discoveries is known as the Raman Effect.
We celebrate National Science Day on 28th February every year as it is said that on this day, light scattering events were discovered, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has produced many great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand, there has been a tradition of great mathematicians Bodhayana, Bhaskara, Brahmputra and Aryabhatta on the other, on the other, we are proud of Sushruta and Charak in the field of medicine.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose have brought glory to India.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose was also named after the famous Partial Boson.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend a programme in Mumbai - to inaugurate the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It was interesting to know about the miracles that are happening in the field of science.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor, the deprived or the needy.
At that event of Artificial Intelligence, I had urged the scientific community to help improve the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters how Artificial Intelligence can help them.
Can Artificial Intelligence help us make healthcare accessible and affordable to our people
A few days ago, along with the Prime Minister of Israel, I had the opportunity to visit Gujarat at the inauguration of the I-Create in Ahmedabad.
A young man there developed a digital instrument through which if a person can not speak, he will not only write through the instrument but he will also be able to communicate in the same way that a speaker can communicate.
I believe that we can use artificial intelligence in many ways.
Science and technology is precious and neutral.
It is not good or bad in terms of value.
Any machine will do what we want.
But, it depends on us what we want from the machine.
Humanity becomes important here.
Use of science for the welfare of human beings, experiment to scale higher heights of human life.
Thomas Alva Edison, who invented the light bulb, failed many times in his experiments.
Incidentally, today I am in the workplace of the Maharshi Aurobindo.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, and questioned their rule.
Similarly, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life.
Find answers and wait for mankind.
It is important to ask questions again and again to know the truth.
This is the true inspiration behind scientific research.
On National Science Day, I convey my best wishes to our scientists and all those associated with science.
May our youth be inspired to discover truth and knowledge, may they be inspired to serve society with the help of science. My best wishes are with you.
Friends, many times I get many messages about safety and disaster relief. People keep writing something or the other.
Shri Rabindra Singh from Pune has spoken on the subject of Occupational Safety in his comments on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He writes that safety standards on factories and construction sites are not good in our country.
On March 4, 2020, the Prime Minister will address the nation on the occasion of National Safety Day, in his Mann Ki Baat address, on the 4th of March, 2020, to raise awareness about the safety of people.
When we talk of public safety, then two things are very important - one protective and the other pre-emptive.
Safety is of two types - one that is required at an emergency, the safety of a person, the safety of a person, and the other that is required in his daily life, the safety in air is of two types.
If we are not aware of the safety of day-to-day lives and cannot achieve it, then it becomes difficult to cope up during disasters.
We all read the boards written on the path many times - Vigilance Hats - Incidents - Incidents - Incidents - Losses - Losses , Delights - Happiness - Let's not leave the world as soon as possible without security Do not take care of one's safety Do not waste anything, let's life be cheaper than that. These words never use in our life.
If we remain vigilant, follow the necessary rules, we will not only be able to save our lives, but also save the society from big accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that many suggestions related to safety are written at the work place but they are not visible anywhere while looking at it.
I urge the municipalities, municipalities, who have fire brigades, to visit different schools once in a week or once in a month to send their drills to the school children.
This will be of two benefits - fire brigade will also be in a habit of being alert and the new generation will also be educated about it and there will not be any expenditure on it - in a way it will become a sequence of education and I always insist on this thing.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is taking the lead in disaster management in the country.
Auda Mitra has also been launched for training volunteers in flood, cyclone prone districts.
Training and awareness have a very important role to play.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year due to heat wave.
Thereafter, NDMA conducted workshops on Prevention of Illicit Traffic and carried out a campaign to spread awareness among the people.
A good result was brought out by everyones participation.
In 2019, the number of deaths from Locust dropped dramatically to about 220.
This shows that if we give priority to security, then we can achieve security.
There are countless such people who work in the society, be it social organizations or be it conscious citizens, I would like to explain to all those who are engaged in relief and rescue work within minutes.
And the number of such innocent heroes is no less.
(BIMSTEC) - A Joint Disaster Management Exercise was also conducted in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal. This was the first and largest human experiment in itself.
We have to become a risk conscious society.
In our culture, we often talk about safety of values, safety of values, but we also have to understand the values of value of safety and security.
We have to make it a part of our lives.
It means, what was the system of information sharing
Because we are not aware of nature and therefore we listen to it after sitting in our ears or airplanes. But none of us feels that this instruction is for me.
This kind of experience is there in every field of our life.
We should not think that safety is for anyone else. If we all become aware of our safety, the sense of security of the society is also included in it.
The objective of the GobarDhan Yojana is to clean the villages and to generate wealth and energy by converting animal dung and solid waste into compost and bio-gas.
Some European countries and China, animal dung and other bio-degradable wastes are used for energy production but India is not using its full potential.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Gramin, we are now moving in this direction.
Drone dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste, etc., are all set to be used for biogas based energy generation.
Under the GobarDhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to look at dung and waste not only as waste but also as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas.
It will help in keeping the villages clean, improve animal health and increase productivity.
Biogas will increase self-reliance in energy for cooking and lighting.
This will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal herders.
New jobs will be available for waste collection, transportation, sale of biogas etc.
An online trading platform will also be created for the smooth flow of GobarDhan Yojana which will connect the farmers with buyers so that farmers can get fair price for their dung and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially our sisters living in rural India, to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating a Self Help Group and setting up cooperative societies.
I invite you to be a partner in this movement of clean energy and green jobs, take the initiative to convert waste into wealth in your village and to make dung-rich dung.
My dear countrymen, till date, we have been hearing about music festivals, food festivals, film festivals, some of which are of a kind or the other.
But a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh where the first garbage festival was organized in the state.
The objective behind this festival, organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation, was to create awareness about the cleanliness of the town and to create awareness about the various ways to make the citys waste creative and reuse the garbage.
The festival witnessed a wide range of activities, ranging from students to older people.
Different types of art works were made using garbage.
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of waste management.
On the theme of cleanliness, there was a music performance, an art work was created.
Inspired by Raipur, various types of garbage were also celebrated in other districts.
Each one of them made an initiative on behalf of their own and said innovative ideas about cleanliness, discussed and the poetry was read.
A festive atmosphere was created with regard to cleanliness.
The way school children participated in it with great enthusiasm was amazing.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Nagar Nigam, entire Chhattisgarh and its government and administration for the innovative way in which the importance of waste management and cleanliness was demonstrated in this festival.
Each year, the International Women's Day is celebrated on 8th March.
There are many programmes in the country and the world.
On this day, Nari Shakti Puraskars are conferred on women who have done exemplary work in various fields in the past.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life. It is the responsibility of all of us.
We are part of a tradition where men were identified by women, Yashodandan, Kaushalyanandan, Gandhariputra, these were the identities of a son.
Today, our Nari Shakti has instilled in us self-confidence and self-confidence, self-reliance and self-reliance.
They have not only taken forward themselves but have also taken the country and society forward and taken them to a new destination.
Last but not the least, our dream of a New India is that where women are empowered, empowered and have equal participation in the development of the country.
In the past, some great person had given me a very beautiful suggestion.
He suggested that on 8th March, several programmes are being organized to celebrate Women's Day.Can a programme be organized to honour mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in each and every village
And can we talk about a long life in that thing I felt very good, I was reaching out to you.
Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, about 15 lakh women - and this number is not small, 15 lakh women have organized a month's cleanliness drive.
Starting from 26th January 2018, under this campaign, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
Can you imagine how big this is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti is the strength of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which will effectively transform the cleanliness campaign and the culture of cleanliness in the common man.
Brothers and sisters, Just a couple of days ago, I was watching this thing in New Delhi that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta island after 70 years of independence.
You all know very well that Elephanta island is ten kilometres away from Mumbai in the sea.
I was surprised to know that despite being close to Mumbai and being such a big centre of tourism, electricity did not reach Elephanta for so many years after independence.
For 70 years, the darkness that engulfed the lives of the people of the three villages of Elephanta Island - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Satbandar - has disappeared and their lives have become illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that now the caves of Elephanta village and Elephanta will be illuminated through electricity.
This is not just electricity but a new beginning of development.
May the life of the countrymen be bright, may there be happiness in their lives What can be a moment of greater satisfaction and happiness
My dear brothers and sisters, Recently we celebrated the festival of Shivaratri.
Now the month of March is the month of March, when fields with harvested crops, golden shoots of wheat growing in the Ananda fort and the blossoming fragrance of mango seeds making their hearts blossomed, this is the specialty of this month.
But this month is also very dear to all of us for the festival of Holi.
On 2nd March the whole country will celebrate Holi with joy.
The more important the Holi colors, the more important the Halika Dahan is because this day is the day of destruction by burning the evils in the fire.
Holi is a good opportunity to forget all the joys and sorrows and to be a part of each other's happiness and happiness and love conveys the message of unity and brotherhood.
Best wishes and colorful greetings to all of you on the festival of Holi.
May this festival bring happiness and prosperity in the lives of our fellow citizens.
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the first episode of Mann Ki Baat in 2018. Two days ago, we celebrated the Republic Day with great enthusiasm and for the first time in history, Heads of 10 countries attended the function.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter on the Narendra Modi App and has urged me to touch upon the subjects written in his letter.
He has written that the imagination of people going to space on 1st February is about Chawla's death.
He left us in the Columbia space shuttle accident, but was an inspiration for millions of young people around the world.
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash Ji that he has started his long letter with the farewell of imagination.
It is sad for everyone that we lost the imagination at such a young age, but from his life he gave the message to the entire world, especially to the thousands of young women of India that there is no limit to female power.
If there is a desire, if there is a strong resolve, if there is an intense desire to do something then nothing is impossible.
It is a matter of great happiness that today women in India are moving fast in every field and increasing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the respect for women in our country, their place in society and their contribution has been inspiring the whole world.
There has been a long tradition of Indian diplomats.
Many great sages of India have contributed to the formation of the Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyee, there are many names.
Today we talk of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao but centuries ago in our scriptures, it has been said in Skandapuran: Dashaputra Samakanya, Dasaputran Pravardhan.
The more virtue the daughters will get, the more virtue the daughters will get.
This shows the importance of women in our society.
And only then, in our society, women have been given the status of 'Shakti'.
This woman power binds the entire country, the entire society, the family and the thread of unity.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given a lot of examples.
He wrote that it is an inspiration for our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to fly the fighter aircraft Sukhoi 30.
He also mentioned that Indian Navy women crew members are circumnavigating the globe on INSV Tarini, under the leadership of Dr.
Three brave women have become Bhava Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avni Chaturvedi fighter pilots and are undergoing training at Sukhoi-30.
Under the leadership of Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, All Women crew flew in the Air India Boeing jet from Delhi to San Francisco, USA and back to Delhi.
Recently, the Honble President took a new initiative.
The President visited a group of exceptional women who have done something for the first time in their respective fields.
These women achievers of the country, first female merchant vessel captain, first female train driver of passenger train, first female fire fighter, first female bus driver, first woman to reach Antarctica, first woman to reach Mount Everest, first woman to reach Mount Everest.
Our Nari Shakti has broken the glass ceiling and achieved remarkable achievements, setting a new benchmark.
He showed that a new path can be created by overcoming all odds and constraints on the strength of hard work, perseverance and determination.
A path that will inspire not only our contemporaries, but generations to come.
It will fill them with a new zeal and enthusiasm.
A book on Women Achiever, First Ladies has also been prepared so that the entire country can know about these women power, inspire them from their life and work.
It is also available as an e-book on the Narendra Modi website.
Today, the women power of the country has an important role to play in the positive transformation of the country and society.
Today, while talking about women empowerment, I want to mention about a railway station.
One railway station and women empowerment. You are thinking about the relationship between the two.
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India which is run by an all-women crew.
Be it the commercial department, railway police, ticket checker, announcer, point person, staff of more than 40 workers in all the departments are women.
This time, after watching the Republic Day Parade, many people wrote on Twitter and other social media that one of the highlights of the parade was the BSF biker contingent comprising women participants.
He was conducting courageous experiments and was astonishing guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today our Nari Shakti is taking the lead.
When it comes to tribal women, a definite picture comes up in everyone's mind that has a forest, a foot-step, and the load of wood is high on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women power has created a new picture in front of the country.
The Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is affected by Maoism, is an area of violence, violence, bomb, gun, pistol, Maoist have created an alarming situation.
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant in such hazardous areas by e-rickshaw.
Many women have joined it in a very short time.
And there are three benefits from it, while on the one hand self-employment has been empowering them, on the other hand, the picture of the area affected by Maoism is changing.
And along with all this, the work of protecting the environment is also being strengthened.
Continuous efforts have been made for centuries against social evils and evils at the individual and social level in our country.
A few days ago, Bihar made an interesting initiative.
Human chain, the world's longest human chain of more than 13,000 kilometers, was built to root out social evils in the state.
Through this campaign, people have been made aware of the evils of child labour and dowry system.
The entire state resolved to fight with evils like dowry and child marriage.
Children, the elderly, the youth, mothers and sisters, everyone had involved themselves in this battle.
The human chain, which started from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, is inextricably connected to the borders of the state.
It is necessary that our society is free from these evils, so that all the people of the society get the benefit of development in the true sense.
Let us all take a pledge to end such evils from the society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I admire the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration and all those involved in the human chain, who have taken such a special and comprehensive initiative in the direction of social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan from Mysore and Karnataka has written on MyGov that on the treatment of his father, the cost of medicines used to be Rs.6000 per month.
He was not aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Kendra earlier.
But now, when they came to know about Jan Aushadhi Kendras and received medicines from them, their expenditure on medicines has come down to 5.
He wished that I should talk about it in Mann Ki Baat so that it can reach out to the maximum number of people and they can take advantage of it.
For some time in the past, many people used to keep on writing about it.
I have also seen videos of many people on social media who have taken advantage of this scheme.
And when I get this kind of information, it gives me immense pleasure.
One is very satisfied.
And I also felt very happy that Shriman Darshan ji had thought that whatever he got was also received by others.
The objective of this scheme is to make healthcare affordable and promote ease of living.
Medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper by about 50 to 90 of the branded medicines available in the market.
This helps the common man, especially the senior citizens who take medicines on a daily basis, to a great extent.
Generic medicines sold are as per the prescribed standards for the World Health Organization.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
It not only makes medicines affordable but also creates new employment opportunities for the industrial entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at AMRUT stores of PM Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendras and hospitals.
The only objective behind all this is to make the poorest of the poor of the country quality and affordable healthcare accessible to them so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
The photo was such that my attention was drawn towards that photo.
It was a photo where a grandson was participating in the cleaning campaign of the River Clean Morna with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organized a cleanliness campaign to clean the Morna river under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The river Morna flows for the first twelve months but now it has become seasonal.
The other painful fact is that the river was completely filled with wild wounds and squirrels.
A lot of garbage was being put up on the river and its banks.
Action plan was prepared and under the first phase of Mission Clean Morna on 13th January, a day before Makar Sankranti, on 13th January 2018, the two sides of the river Mora were cleaned at fourteen locations in the area of four kilometers.
More than 6000 citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, college students, children, elders, mothers, sisters, everyone participated in this task of Mission Clean Morna.
On 20th January, 2018, this cleanliness drive was carried out in a similar manner and I was told that this campaign will run every Saturday morning till the river Morna is completely cleaned.
This shows that if a person decides to do something, nothing is impossible.
A big change can be brought about through the mass movement.
I thank the people of Akola, the district and the administration of the Municipal Corporation, every citizen engaged in this campaign of making this work a mass movement and this effort will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, these days, you must have heard a lot about the Padma Awards.
Newspapers also attract attention on this subject and on TV.
But if you look at it with ease, you will feel proud of the fact that great people are among us and naturally you will be proud of the fact that today the common man of our country is scaling new heights without any passion.
There has been a tradition of awarding Padma awards every year but in the last three years, its entire process has changed.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone.
Transparency has come in the entire process being online.
In a way, the selection process of these awards has been completely changed.
Now the identity of the person is not for the award, but the importance of his work is increasing.
You must have heard Shriman Arvind Gupta Ji, you will be happy to know that Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, dedicated his entire life in making children play games.
They are making more than four decades of waste to wealth so that children can be further educated about science.
They are trying to motivate the children to undergo scientific experiments by showing films made in 18 languages in 3000 schools across the country.
What a wonderful life, what a wonderful dedication
One such thing is that of Sitava Jyotirlinga of Karnataka.
They are not the same goddess of women empowerment.
In Belagavi for the past three decades, she has made a great contribution in transforming the lives of countless women.
At the age of seven, he had dedicated himself as a votary, but later he spent his entire life for the welfare of the devians.
Not only this, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard the name of Madhya Pradesh's Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family, a tribal family.
He did a simple job for life-saving, but he loved to make traditional tribal pictures.
Today, due to this same hobby, he is respected not only in India but in the whole world.
His paintings have been exhibited in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England, Italy etc.
The talent of Bhajju Shyamji, who brought India's name abroad, was recognized and he was honored with the Padma Shri.
You will be surprised to know about the tribal women of Kerala, Lakshmikutti.
Lakshmikutty is a teacher at Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in the tribal area amidst dense forests.
She has made 500 herbal medicines on her memory.
He has taken Maharath for making the medicine used after snake bite.
Lakshmi ji is continuously serving the society with her knowledge of herbal medicines.
He was honoured with the Padma Shri for his contribution to the society and recognition of the awardees.
Subhasini Mitra is a woman who sold utensils and vegetables in other houses to build a hospital.
When he was 23 years old, his husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired him to become a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being given free treatment in their hospitals built with hard work.
I am confident that there are many men and women in our country who neither know nor know anyone.
The Padma awards are a medium but I will also tell the countrymen that there are millions of people around us who are living in the society, who are dedicated to the society, who work for the society in a particular way, who work for the whole life and sometimes bring them among the society.
He does not work for dignity but his work inspires us.
Sometimes in schools and colleges, such people should be invited to listen to their experiences.
There should be some effort in the society as well, even beyond the award.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
This is the 9th of January when the revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
On that day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond between Indians in India and around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we organized a program to invite all MPs and Mayors of Indian origin living around the world.
You will be happy to know that in this program, from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and many other countries where our original Indian mayors were present, all those who were Indian Parliamentarians were present.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are not only serving those countries but also building strong relations with India.This time, the European Union, the European Union, sent me a calendar where they have very well demonstrated their contribution in various fields by the Indians living in different countries of Europe.
The people of our origin who live in different countries of Europe, who work in cyber security, who are dedicated to Ayurveda, who mesmerize the society with their music, some with their poems.
I would like to thank the European Union for its commendable work, for taking the people of Indian origin to the ECOGNISE and also for informing the people of the world through it.
30 January marks the death anniversary of Pujya Bapu, who has shown us a new path.
Even today, we see at every step how correct Bapu's words were.
If we resolve to follow the path of Bapu, what can be a greater tribute than what can be done
My dear countrymen, with 2018 greetings, I conclude my speech.
Mann Ki Baat in December 2017
This is the last episode of Mann Ki Baat this year, and let us also coincidence that this day is the last day of the year 2019.
We and you have shared a lot of things throughout the year.
Many of your letters, comments and ideas for Mann Ki Baat always bring a new energy for me.
The year will change after a few hours, but this sequence of our things will continue even further.
In the coming year, we will talk about new things, we will share new experiences.
My best wishes to you all for the year 2018.
Recently, on 25th December, the festival of bathing was celebrated all over the world with fanfare.
In India too, people celebrated this festival with great enthusiasm.
On this occasion of Christmas, we remember all the great teachings of Jesus Christ and the emphasis on Isha Christ was Seva Bhava.
My dear countrymen, this year was also the year of Guru Gobind Singh ji's 350th Prakash Parv.
Guru Gobind Singh ji's courage and sacrifice are a source of inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji gave a sermon on the great values and he lived his life on the basis of these values.
A guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, Guru Gobind Singh ji worked to inspire people in all these roles.
They fought against oppression and injustice.
People have been advised to break the shackles of caste and religion.
In these efforts, he also had to lose a lot of personal.
But he never gave place to the feeling of hatred.
In every moment of his life, the message of love, sacrifice and peace - was a personality full of many great qualities.
Come, let us take a pledge and seek inspiration from Guru Gobind Singh ji's great teachings and inspiring life and seek inspiration from it.
Those born in the year 2000 or later will become eligible voters with effect from January 1, 2018.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st century New India.
I congratulate these young people and urge everyone to register as your voters.
The whole of India is eager to welcome you as voters of the 21st century.
As voters of the 21st century, you too must have felt proud.
Your vote will become the basis of New India.
The power of vote is the greatest strength of a democracy.
Maternal is the most effective tool to bring a positive change in the lives of millions of people.
Thus, you too can become the architect of the 21st century India and it is being started from January 1.
And today in my Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk to our bright young people, who are full of energy and resolve for 18 to 25 years.
I believe that the skills and strengths of these energetic young people will help in realising our dream of a New India.
When we talk of a New India, a New India is free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
Be free from dirt and poverty.
'New India' - where there is equal opportunity for everyone, where everyone's hopes and aspirations are fulfilled.
A New India where peace, unity and harmony are our driving forces.
My 'New India Youth' should come forward and deliberate on how a New India would be formed.
They should also set a way for themselves to connect with those people who are associated with them and keep moving forward.
You should also move forward and the country should also move forward.
When I am talking to you today, I have come to know that can we organize a mock parliament in every district of India
Where these 18 to 25 year olds sit together and brainstorm on New India, find ways and prepare plans.
How can we accomplish our resolutions before 2022
How can we build an India that our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi made the freedom movement a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is to create a mass movement for a magnificent 21st century India.
How can a pledge be achieved
Today many new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth is coming forward and becoming successful.
I would like the New India Youth to know about all these opportunities in one place and a system should be created so that at the age of 18, they can easily get information about all these things in the world and they can also take the necessary benefits.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had talked about the importance of positivity.
I am reminded of one Sanskrit shloka - , .. It means, a person full of enthusiasm is very strong because there is nothing beyond enthusiasm.
Nothing is impossible for a positive and enthusiastic person.
People in English also say- "Pessimism leads to hunger, competition to power".
I had appealed to the countrymen in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, to share your positive moments of 2019 and to welcome 2018 in a positive environment.
I am very happy that a large number of people gave a very positive feedback on the social media platforms, MyGov and the Narendra Modi App, and shared their experiences.
Lakhs of tweets were posted on Positive India hashtag (), which reached out to more than 1.50 crore people.
In a way, the communication of positivity that took place in India spread all over the world.
The tweets and responses received were truly inspiring.
It was a pleasant experience.
Some countrymen have shared this years events that had a special impact on their minds and had a positive impact.
Some people also shared their personal achievements.
Sound by my name is Menu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket one, Face One, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wad.
I talk to the Bond.
Our insurance cover was reduced by one rupee per month.
This was done by my husband and he died in an accident.
We all know what happened at that time.
With this help of the government, we got a lot of benefit and I could get some seats.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
From our village, the National Highway has been passing through the village of Bhinar since 2019.
Due to this our roads have become much better and trade will also increase.
My name is Deepanshu Ahuja. I reside in the area Sadatganj, district Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bewani.
There was a water problem in our region and for the last 40 years we had to depend on the Army pipeline.
Now this pipeline has been constructed separately - independent.
So these are all big achievements in our year 2019.
There are many people who are doing such things at their own level that are making a positive difference in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India we are building together.
Come, let us enter the New Year with these little happiness, let us begin the New Year and take strong steps towards a Proactive India.
When we talk of positivity, I also feel like sharing one thing.
Recently, I came to know about the inspiring story of the administrative service to the state of Kashmir, the newspaper Anju Bashir Khan Khattar.
They have secured the first position in the Kashmir Administrative Service Examination after coming out of the clutches of terrorism and hatred.
You will be surprised to know that in the 1990s, the terrorists had burnt their ancestral home.
There was so much terrorism and violence that his family had to leave their ancestral land and leave it.
For a small child, there was enough violence all around him to create darkness and bitterness in his heart. But Anju did not allow it to happen.
He never gave up hope.
He chose a different path for himself - the path of public service.
He overcomes the odds and writes his own story of success.
Today, he has become an inspiration not only for Jammu Kashmir but for the youth of the whole country.
Anju has proved that no matter how bad the situation may be, the clouds of despair can also be scattered with positive actions.
Just last week, I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu Kashmir.
The enthusiasm, the dreams and the dreams that I was listening to him, they wanted to progress in the field of life.
I was inspired to spend all the time with those daughters. And this is the strength of the country, this is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a discussion on the famous religious places of the world, it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple in Kerala.
In this world famous temple, devotees come here in thousands of crores every year to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami.
How big a challenge is to maintain cleanliness at such a place where such a large number of devotees come
And especially those places that are situated between mountains and forests.
But the Sabarimala temple is an example of how this problem can be converted into a culture, how it can be solved to come out of the problem and how the power of public participation is so strong.
P.
A police officer named Vijayan initiated a program Punyaum Punkawanam and launched a voluntary campaign of awareness on cleanliness under the program.
And we made a tradition that the journey of those pilgrims who come here does not end until they do not perform any physical work in the cleanliness program.
In this campaign there is neither any big nor any small.
Every traveller as a part of Gods worship gives some time for cleanliness, works and works for removal of dirt.
Every morning, the scene of cleanliness here is very wonderful and all the pilgrims get involved.
No matter how big a person is, no matter how rich a person is, no matter how big a officer is, every person, like a common traveller, becomes a part of this 'Punyam Punkvam' program, he cleans it and moves forward.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
The cleanliness drive that was so much carried forward in Sabarimala and the virtues in it, pilgrimage to Sabrimala form part of every traveller's journey.
There, along with hard work, a tough resolution for cleanliness is also going on.
My dear countrymen, on the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu, on 2nd October 2014, all of us have resolved that the incomplete work of Pujya Bapu i.e.
Pujya Bapu kept struggling and kept trying for this work throughout his life.
And we all decided that on the occasion of Bapu's 150th birth anniversary, we should do something to give him an India of his dreams, a Swachh Bharat.
Efforts are being made at a massive level across the country towards cleanliness.
Changes are also being witnessed through greater public participation in rural as well as urban areas.
The Swachh Survekshan 2018, the worlds largest survey, will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March 2018 to assess the sanitation level achievements in urban areas.
This survey will be done in more than 4000 cities with a population of about 40 crore.
The facts that will be examined in this survey are Open Defecation Free (ODF) cities, waste collection, transport system for garbage collection, scientific processing of waste, efforts made for behavioural change, innovative efforts made for capacity building and cleanliness and peoples participation in this work.
During this survey, different teams will go and inspect the cities.
He will interact with the citizens and take feedback.
Use of Swachhata App and improvement of various types of service places will be analyzed.
It will also be seen whether such arrangements have been made by the cities so that the cleanliness of the city becomes the habit of the people and the city becomes a habit.
Cleanliness should not be done by the government alone.
It is also a great responsibility of every citizen and civil society.
And it is my appeal to every citizen to participate enthusiastically in the Swachhata Hi Seva movement that will take place in the coming days.
And your city should not be left behind and your every street corner should not be behind.
I am confident that the use of green and blue dustbins to extract dry and wet garbage from home will now have become your habit.
During the Swachhata Survey to be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018, in this health competition of cleanliness, you should not be lagging behind, it should become a matter of public discussion in every city.
And all of you must have a dream - our cities - our efforts, our progress - the progress of the country.
With this resolution, let us remember once again the venerable Bapu and take a pledge for a Swachh Bharat, let us pray for the fulfilment of this resolution.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that seem very small in appearance, but as a society, our identity is far-reaching.
Today, through this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one such thing with you.
One thing in our knowledge is that if a Muslim woman wants to go for Haj, she will not be able to go without Mehram or anymale guardian.
When I heard about it for the first time then I thought how it could happen.
Who would have made such rules
Why discrimination
And when I went into it, I was troubled - even after 70 years of independence, we were the people who applied such recognition.
For decades, injustice was being done to Muslim women but there was no debate on it.
Even in many Islamic countries, this rule is not there.
But Muslim women in India did not have this right.
And I am glad that our government has paid attention to it.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has also taken necessary steps and we have removed this restriction by eliminating this tradition from the last 70 years.
Today, Muslim women can go to Haj without Mehram and I am happy that this time around 1300 Muslim women have applied to perform Haj without Mehram and from different parts of the country - from Kerala to North - have expressed their desire to go for Haj.
I say it with full faith and my firm belief that India's development journey has progressed and will continue to progress on the strength of our female power.
We should constantly try to ensure that our women also get equal rights and equal opportunities for men so that they can move forward together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for us.
This time, there will be not one but ten chief guests on Republic Day.
This has never happened before in the history of India.
2019 has been special for both the countries of ASEAN and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years in 2019 and 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN in 2019.
It is a matter of pride for us Indians that on 26th January these great leaders of 10 countries of the world are present together.
Dear fellow citizens, In a way, our country is a country of festivals.
Probably there would be a day in which no festival is written.
We all have just celebrated Christmas and the New Year is about to come.
May the coming New Year bring happiness, happiness and prosperity to all of you.
All of us should move forward with new zeal, new enthusiasm, new zeal and new resolve.
The month of January is the time of sunrise and Makar Sankranti is celebrated in the same month.
Lohri is happy in Punjab and North India, while Khichdi and Tal-Sankra are waiting in UP-Bihar.
Sankranti Kaho in Rajasthan, Magh-bihu in Assam or Pongal in Tamil Nadu, all these festivals are special in themselves and they have their own importance.
Each of these festivals is celebrated from 13th to 17th January.
The names of all these festivals are different, but the essence of these is the same - connect with nature and agriculture.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on these festivals.
Once again my best wishes to you all on the New Year 2018.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
We will talk again in 2018.
Thank you.
The conversation was such that the younger brother talks to his elder sister.
Listen to how Lata Didi is eager, eager to know all the things related to the country even in this phase of age and the satisfaction of life is also in India's progress, changing India and touching new heights.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, salute.
Narendra Modi (narendramodi) January 1, 2020
Lata Didi: Salute.
I did the phone because this time on your birthday...
When will you go back?
Modi ji: I will return late in the night on the 28th and in the morning on the 29th, and then you would have been born.
Lata ji: There are many people in the old age, but it is a big thing to get the blessings of those who are big with their work.
Modi ji: Sister, you are very old in age and have grown up in work and whatever you have achieved is through meditation and penance.
Lata ji: Yes, I think that the blessings of my parents are there and the blessings of the listeners.
I am nothing.
Modi ji: Today is your salutation. This is a great education for all of our new generation.
It is a great inspiration for us that despite fulfilling all these things in your life, you have always given priority to the values of your parents and your humility.
Lateji: Yes.
Modi ji: And I am glad that when you say proudly that your mother was a Gujarati.
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you, give me something or the other.
I know that the image of India is changing due to your arrival. And I am very happy about that.
No, I don't want to give you a lot of trouble because I see you, I know how busy you are and how much work you have.
What is the need to think
When you came and touched the feet of your mother then I also sent someone and took blessings from her.
- Yeah.
Modi: My thoughts are with you, the Prime Minister said.
Modi ji: But the time was so busy that I could not come.
Modi ji: But I will come very soon.
It will be my good fortune.
Modi ji: Namaste Didi.
Late ji: Thank you very much.
Modi ji: Pranam ji.
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, the atmosphere of festivals will be filled with new zeal, enthusiasm and resolve once again.
This is the season of festivals.
For the next several weeks, festivals will be celebrated across the country.
The house will be filled with happiness.
Probably, this saying is not just a word, it is an order, a philosophy and an inspiration for all of us.
In some houses, when sweets are spoiled, in some houses, children shout for sweets.
This is the darkness on the bottom of the lamp.
The real joy of these festivals is the darkness, the darkness, the light that spreads.
Sharing happiness in both of us as well as in our nature, where there is lack of resources.
Think of giving one moment to another when there is a delivery of sweets, clothes and gifts to our homes.
At least, let us share the surplus produce of our households, which we do not take into account.
Start-ups of young friends from several NGOs are doing this kind of work in many cities.
They gather clothes, sweets, Bhoja, all from the homes of the people and find the needy and take them to their doorsteps.
Can we eradicate the darkness from the fire, with complete awareness and resolve, during this festive season
The smile on the face of many poor families will double your happiness on festivals and your face will shine on the other side.
Your lamp will be illuminated, your Diwali will be illuminated.
My dear brothers and sisters, Lakshmi ji comes home in the form of fortune and prosperity in Deepavali.
Traditionally, Lakshmi ji is welcome.
Can we organize these programs in our society, in villages, in cities and daughters
Can we hold public events?
There will be many daughters among us who will be bringing glory to the family, society and the country with their hard work and hard work.
Can we organize a function to honour India's Lakshmi on this Diwali
There will be many daughters and sisters around us who will be doing extraordinary work.
Some are engaged in spreading awareness about hygiene and health, some are working as a doctor, an engineer, and some are serving the society.
You must be making efforts to bring justice to anyone by becoming a lawyer.
Our society should recognize and respect such daughters and take pride in them.
His felicitations should be held all over the country.
The promotion of Lakshmi of India means paving the way for prosperity of the country and its people.
My dear countrymen, I had earlier said that one of the major advantages of Mann Ki Baat is that I got the opportunity to interact directly with many unknown people.
I am from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when the result of my examination came to me, some people asked me to read the book of Exam Warriors.
I have not read this book.
But after returning, I read this book and read it two-three times.
My experience in this regard has been very good.
I felt that if I had read this book before the exam, I would have benefitted a lot.
My young student friend, first of all, thank you for writing this letter.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors 2-3 times.
What you have said is that if I can spare time for the new version then definitely I will try to write something for parents and teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to share your experiences with me about the aspects related to the examination.
So I'll wait for your ideas.
I once again express my gratitude to our young friend from Arunachal, student Alina Tiang.
My dear countrymen, you are well aware of the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers and TV, and also talk about busyness.
But you know that I am an ordinary person like you.
And that is why the things that affect the common man in my life also affect my mind because I too have come amongst you.
Just a short while ago, he had come to the final of the 17th edition of the Grand Salem winner and tennis legend Raphael.
The audience warmly welcomed their views.
Even after losing on a difficult challenge, he gave a very lively testimony of the sportspersons without any hesitation.
On the other hand, the winner Nadal too appreciated Daniels for his game.
The morale of the winners in the same match and the humility of the winners were noteworthy.
If you have not heard the speech of Daniel Medvedev, then I will tell you all, especially the youth that you must watch this video of that.
The thinking of our ancestors is really commendable.
It is said in our scriptures - : That is, if a person's ability and humility were combined, then who could not win the heart
In fact, this young player has won the hearts of people from all over the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to say now is directly meant for your well-being.
Debate and discussion will continue, but if some things are stopped before it increases, it will be of great benefit.
It is very difficult to stop after the things that increase very much and spread very much.
But in the beginning if we become aware and stop it, a lot can be saved.
My heart says that with this spirit, I will definitely talk to my young friends today.
We all know that tobacco addiction is very harmful for health and its addiction also becomes very difficult.
The risk of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, blood pressure to those who smoke tobacco increases significantly.
This is what everyone says.
Tobacco use is caused by nicotine present in it.
Its consumption in young age also affects brain development.
But today I want to talk to you about a new topic.
You might be aware that recently e-cigarettes have been banned in India.
E-cigarettes are an electronic device different than the normal cigarettes.
The e-cigarette makes a chemical smoke by heating nicotine-containing fluids and uses nicotine.
We understand the threat of ordinary cigarettes very well, but there is a misconception about e-cigarettes.
There is a misconception that there is no threat to e-cigarettes.
Like the rest of the cigarettes, aromatic chemicles were used to prevent it from spreading.
We have seen around us that even if there is a father-in-law in the house, they stop smoking the rest of the house, they stop smoking and they want their children to not have the habit of smoking cigarettes and bidi.
They are trying to ensure that no member of the family smokes, does not smoke.
They know that smoking causes a lot of harm to the body.
The Pinaras are also aware and even the witnesses know.
But the case of e-cigarettes is quite different.
There is no such awareness about e-cigarettes.
They are also totally unaware of the dangers posed by it, and as a result, sometimes the e-cigarettes enter into an insolvent quietly and sometimes the children continue to show each other by doing a magic show at home.
See, I smoke out of my mouth, and see, I burn the lamp without fire, and see, I smoke out.
Once the teenagers and the youth of the house get stuck in their clutches, they gradually become addicted to intoxication, they become victims of intoxication.
In fact, many harmful chemicals are being used in e-cigarettes, which have a negative impact on health.
You know that when someone smokes around us then we feel the smell of that thing.
Even when there is a packet of cigarettes in his pocket, it is known by smell.
But this is not the case with e-cigarettes many teenagers and youth, knowingly or unknowingly, in the form of a fashion statement, with a lot of pride appearing in their books, in their offices, in their pockets, or in their pockets, often get caught and fall prey to it.
The young generation is the future of the country.
E-cigarettes are now being banned so that this new way of intoxication does not ruin our young country.
Do not waste the dreams of every family and the lives of the children will not be wasted.
Do not let this habit, this disease, be rooted in the society.
I urge you all to shun tobacco addiction and not to abuse on e-cigarettes.
Let us all build a healthy India.
There is a need to avoid all these things as well for Fit India.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a privilege for all of us that India has been the birthplace and work place of such extraordinary people who have dedicated their entire life not only for themselves but for the welfare of others.
This is our Mother India, our country is a multi-faceted nation.
Many human beings come out of this land.
India has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, the land of Karmabhoomi.
And these are the people who have dedicated themselves, not for themselves, but for others.
A similar personality is being honoured in Vatican City on 13th October.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that the Pope Francis will spawn Mariam Thresia on October 13.
Sister Mariam Thresia, who worked for the welfare of humanity in his 50-year-old small life, is an example for the whole world.
Sister Theresa completed her work with dedication and commitment.
Those who are carrying forward their vision and mission even today.
I once again pay homage to Sister Mariam Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride for not only India, but for the entire world today, as we celebrate Gandhi 150, as well as 130 crore Indians have pledged to free themselves of single use plastic.
In the direction of environmental protection, the way India has taken the lead in the whole world, the eyes of all the countries are on India today.
I am confident that all of you will be a part of the campaign to get rid of single-use plastic on October 2.
People are contributing in this movement in their own way.
But a unique campaign has been launched by a young man of our country.
When I came to know about his work, I talked to him on phone and tried to know about this new experiment.
It is possible that these things will also benefit other people of the country.
Mr. Ripudhan Belviji is doing a great job.
For the first time when I heard the word Ploging, it was new to me too.
Probably this word has been used in foreign countries in some measure.
But in India, Ripudhan Belviji has made it very popular.
I congratulate them and friends this time the Sports Ministry is also going to organize a Fit India Plogging Run on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu.
We have heard from Ripudhanji's experience about how to do this program and what happens in the program.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take one step in this direction, then India will move 130 crore steps towards becoming single use plastic.
Once again, thank you very much.
We want to move forward to convert our lives into national interest.
There is a desire to remember one thing as soon as possible.
However, I will do it in detail in the next Mann Ki Baat, but today I am saying this just a while ago so that you get an opportunity to prepare for it.
You remember that 31st October marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We have to run for the unity of the country on that day in lakhs of villages, children, elderly, everyone, schools, colleges, thousands of people.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on the 15th of August, I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort that by 2022, you would go up to 15 places in India.
If at least 15 places can be constructed then make a program of staying for a night or two nights.
You see, understand and experience India.
We have so many variations. And when the festival of Diwali falls, people definitely go and pray. Therefore, I once again urge you to visit any 15 such places in India.
And what is this improvement, what am I going to tell you
You will definitely be happy that today our rank is 34 and five years ago our rank was 65th and in a way we have hit a big jump.
If we make more efforts then by the 75 years of independence we will make our place in the top 10 places in the world in tourism.
Yes, you must also see that in the days of Diwali, there will not be any harm to anyone, anywhere due to cracks etc.
You must take all the precautions to be taken.
There should be happiness, joy and enthusiasm as well and our festivals also bring the aroma of togetherness and also bring out the culture of togetherness.
A collective life gives a new strength, a new strength and a new strength is the end of the festival.
Come, together, with a new dream, with a new resolve, let us celebrate festivals.
Once again many-many greetings.
Mann Ki Baat November 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Just a while ago, I got the opportunity to have an indirect interaction with the children of Karnataka.
The Times Group's Vijay Karnataka newspaper urged the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country by taking an initiative.
And then he published some of the selected letters.
I read those letters, and I felt very good.
These little children are also familiar with the problems of the country and the ongoing discussions in the country.
These children have written on many subjects. Kirti Hegde from North Kannada had given a clarion call for Digital India and Smart City schemes and said, We need to bring about a change in our education system. He also said that these days, children are not happy to study in the classroom.
And if we educate the children about nature then perhaps it will be useful for us in protecting the environment.
Reddy Nadaf has written from Laxmieshwar that he is the daughter of an army soldier.
He said that due to distance from school, I could not spend any time with my friends. He has suggested that there should be a school nearby.
This was a good experience for me as well.
My dear countrymen, today is 26th November.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
The same day in 1947, the Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
It is a day to remember those members of the Constituent Assembly.
He worked hard for nearly three years to frame the Constitution of India.
And whenever they read these discussions, we feel proud of the idea of a dedicated life for the nation.
Can you imagine how hard he had worked to create the Constitution of our country full of diversity
And that too at a time when the country was being freed from the shackles of slavery.
Keeping in view the Constitution, it is our duty to create a New India keeping in mind the ideals of the framers of the Constitution and the great men.
Our Constitution is very comprehensive.
Probably there is no such area of life that it has not touched.
Our Constitution is the identity of equality for all and its sensitivity towards all.
It protects the fundamental rights of every citizen, poor, dalit, backward or deprived, tribal or women.
And it protects their interests.
It is our duty to follow the Constitution in letter and spirit.
Be it a citizen or an administrator, we should move ahead with the spirit of the Constitution.
In this Constituent Assembly, seven separate Committees were constituted on important subjects.
One of the most important Committees was the draft committee and Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar. The draft committee was headed by Dr.
He was playing a very important role.
Today, the Constitution on which we feel proud of us has an indelible impression of Baba Saheb Ambedkar's leadership.
He ensured that the welfare of all sections of society was ensured.
On 6th December, on the occasion of his Mahaparinirvan Diwas, we pay tributes to him by remembering him as usual.
Baba Saheb's contribution in making the country prosperous and powerful is unforgettable.
The 15th December marks the death anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Sardar Patel, who became the Iron Man of the country from the Kisanputra, had done an extraordinary job of tying the country together.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
26-11 is our Constitution Day.But nine years ago, on 26-11, terrorists attacked Mumbai, how can the country forget it
This country will never forget their sacrifice.
Today, if terrorism is seen in every part of the world and in a way, it has become a very horrible form of the day-to-day events.
We in India have suffered a lot due to terrorism over the last 40 years.
But today, when terrorism is blowing through their own doors, every government of the world, the governments that believe in humanity, the governments that trust in democracy, sees terrorism as a big challenge.
Terrorism has challenged the humanity of the world.
Terrorism poses a challenge to humanity.
It is going to destroy the human powers.
And that is why not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world are working together to defeat terrorism.
Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi are the gems of this earth who gave the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and radicalization are the greatest motivators of our social tensions and are trying to isolate them.
And that is why it is the need of the hour to make the humanitarian forces more aware.
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of December, we will celebrate Navy Day - Navy Day.
Indian Navy protects and protects our coasts.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You all are aware that our civilization is on the banks of rivers.
Be it the Indus, the Ganga, the Yamuna or the Saraswati, our rivers and the seas are important for both economic and strategic purposes.
This is our gateway to the whole world.
This country, our land has an unbreakable bond with the oceans.
And when we look at the history, 800-90 years ago, during the period of the Chowdary, the Chaul Navy-Chaulanukad was considered to be one of the strongest naval forces.
In the expansion of the Chowdary, it was a major part of his Navy's efforts to make it an economic superpower of the time.
The expeditions of the Chaual Navy, the expeditions of the research have been found even today in a number of liberal Sangam literatures.
Very few people would be aware that most of the naval ships in the world were allowed on multimodal warships.
But women played a very important role in the Maulana Azad Education Foundation - 800-90 years ago and even women were involved in the battle.
The Chaual rulers had rich knowledge of ship-building and ship-building.
Then we talk of the Navy, who can forget the strength of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Navy.
The coastal area of Konkan, where the sea is very important, used to come inside the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj such as Sindhudurg, Murud Janjira, Swarnadurg etc. were either on the sea shore or were surrounded by sea.
The Maratha Navy carried the responsibility of protecting these forts.
Maratha Navy had a large fleet of ships and small boats.
His naval personnel were highly skilled in attacking and defending any enemy.
And when we talk about the Maratha Navy, it is possible that we do not remember the Kanoji Agra.
He took the Maratha Navy to new heights, and set up the Maratha Navy at many places.
After independence, our Indian Navy also showed its valour on various occasions.
Be it the liberation struggle of Goa or the India-Pakistan war of 1971, the Prime Minister said.
Even as the floods hit Sri Lanka in May-June this year, three ships of our Navy immediately reached there and helped its government and its people.
In September last year in Bangladesh, our naval ship INS Ghariyal carried humanitarian assistance in the context of Rohinga.
Last June, when the government of Papua New Guinea sent us a message of urgency and requested for the protection of the fishermen of their fishing boats, our Navy assisted us.
On the 21st of March, our naval ship INS Trikand had also embarked on a mission to evacuate a merchant vessel from the Western Gulf.
Be it delivery of health services to the Fijian islands or providing immediate relief to neighbouring countries, our Navy has always done a commendable job.
We Indians are always proud of our Defence Forces, be it the Army, the Navy or the Air Force, the courage, valour, bravery and sacrifice of our soldiers.
1.25 billion Indians can live the life of peace and security and that is why they sacrifice their lives for the country.
Every year, we celebrate the 7th December as the Armed Forces Flag Day.
It is a day to honour and honour the armed forces of the country.
I am happy that this time the Ministry of Defence has decided to run a campaign from 1st to 7th December, reaching out to the citizens of the country and making people aware about the Armed Forces.
All these little ones put the flag on the chest for the whole week.
A movement of respect for the army started in the country.
On this occasion, we can also distribute the flag of the Armed Forces.
You can post your experiences with the Armed Forces in the field of familiarisation with you in your surroundings with your brave steps and your photographs with the Army Armed Forces Flag Day.
In schools and colleges, you can get to know about the army by calling the army personnel.
It can be a good opportunity for our new generation to get information about the army.
This festival also provides an opportunity to raise funds for the welfare of all our armed forces.
The fund is being spent by the Sainik Welfare Board on the restoration of the families of the soldiers martyred in the war and the welfare of the injured soldiers.
On this occasion, let us also do something that enhances the morale of our armed forces.
Let us also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, 5th December is World Earth Day.
I also want to talk to our farmer brothers and sisters.
An important part of the Earth is soil.
Whatever we eat is attached to this soil.
In a way, the entire food chain is connected to the soil.
Even after thinking about it, if there was no land, if there were no plants, then what could have been possible for the entire human life
Long before our culture was concerned about this thing, and this is the reason why we have been making aware about the importance of our land for ages.
In our culture, on the one hand, there is a natural effort to remain connected to the fields, to the soil, to the devotion and reverence of the people, while on the other hand, scientific methods of nurturing this land have been a part of our lives.
Both these things have been important in the lives of the farmers of this country, in which the devotion to their land as well as the scientific preservation of the land.
I had heard about the farmers of Tohu village in Bhoranj taluka of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Earlier, the farmers used to use chemical fertilizers and fertilizers which adversely affected the health of their soil.
The yield went down and consequently the income went down and the productivity of the land was also gradually decreasing.
Some farmers of the village understood the seriousness of the situation and after that the farmers examined their soil from time to time and advised them to use as many fertilizers as they were asked to use fertilizers, fertilizers, micro-nutrients and organic fertilizers.
You will also be surprised to know about the results as to what was the result of the implementation of the guidelines given to the farmers by the soil health.
The production of wheat has increased three to four times in the Rabi 2016-17.
Our farmers across the country have created more than 10 crore soil health cards so that they can understand their soil better and also cultivate the same.
We worship mother earth but how much harm do we make her mother earth mother by chemical fertilizers like urea?
Every kind of scientific experiment has proved that giving more urea than required to the Mother Earth is a serious loss.
This is the need of the hour to re-engage the relationship of these mothers and sisters.
Can our farmers, our sons of soil make a pledge that by 2022, when we complete 75 years of our independence, the amount of urea they use today will be half the amount
What kind of changes start coming in the lives of farmers
We all are experiencing global warming and climate change.
There was a time when winter used to begin before Diwali.
Today, the cold is blowing at twelve o'clock in the morning, and the cold is rising gradually.
But as the cold begins, we all feel that it does not seem good to get out of the holiday.
But this example is inspiring for all of us as to how the people who are constantly awake in this season.
Tushar had done an inspiring job of spreading the message of cleanliness.
They show that there is no age of cleanliness or there is no limit.
Be it a small child or an elderly person, a woman or a man, cleanliness is essential for all.
And there is also a need to connect everyone for cleanliness.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have a solemn pledge.
In a moment, we learn something or the other.
Today they are doing good in every field.
Whether it is the field of sports, competition or social initiative, our Divyangs are not lagging behind.
You might remember that our divyang players won four medals in a beautiful exhibition at Rio Olympics and also became Champions at the Blind Tea Twenty Cricket World Cup.
There are many types of competitions being organized across the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Para Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country took part in it and showed their skills.
He also won the Gold Medal at the 70th National Para Swimming Competition.
He was selected by the Sports Authority of India for the 20-20 Para Olympics.
He is one of the 32 Para-Taranveers, who will be trained at the Centre for Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
I salute the spirit of Bhai Jiggar Thakur and convey my best wishes to him.
Today special attention is being given to the availability and opportunity for the Divyangjans.
It is our effort to empower every person of the country.
To build an inclusive society, we should move forward together and we should work together to ensure equity and inclusiveness.
I convey my warm greetings to all fellow citizens and I hope that this festival of Eid will inspire all of us to further peace and harmony in our society.
Forget about pain, and do not forget happiness.
I think we should propagate this point.
In our midst of the spread of the virus, an attempt has been made to repeat several interesting events of the past year.
Can you contribute in this ?
Can we share five positive experiences of our life this year ?
Remember such inspiring occasions.
If we remember the good things, the spirit of doing good will be awakened, the mood will be formed.
Good things give us the energy to do good.
And I will try to take the details of your positive India mission to the countrymen in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, next month, I will be amidst you for the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
We will get an opportunity to talk a lot.
October 2, 2017 on All India Radio
The festival Chhath, celebrated six days after Diwali, is one of the festivals celebrated with great fervor and loyalty in our country.
From food to clothing, traditional rules are followed in every aspect.
The unique festival of Chhath Puja is fully connected with nature and with nature.
The sun and water are central to the worship of Chhath, while the utensils made of bamboo and clay are an inseparable part of its worship process.
The prayer of the rising sun in this great festival of faith and the prayer of the setting sun is full of unique values.
This festival also celebrates the importance of cleanliness in our lives.
Cleaning of the entire house before Chhath, along with cleaning of the river, pond, Pokhar, the place of worship i.e.
It is also a festival of Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja, environment protection, disease prevention and discipline.
Generally, people consider it a inferiority complex to seek something, but in Chhath Puja, there has been a special tradition of eating Prasad after half the morning.
The belief behind this tradition of seeking Prasad also shows that it destroys the ego.
It is very natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat also gets appreciated and criticism happens.
But whenever I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I am convinced that Mann Ki Baat has tied up with a hundred percent unbreakable bond with the people of this country.
Take the example of Khadi and handloom.
On Gandhi Jayanti, I have always been advocating for handloom and Khadi. And what is the outcome
You must have been happy and satisfied to hear such a huge sale of Khadi and handloom in the same store.
The sale of Khadi gift coupons during Diwali has registered a growth of about 680.
The total sales of Khadi and handicrafts have registered a growth of about 90 this year compared to last year.
It shows that today, the youth, the elderly, the women, every age group, likes Khadi and handloom.
I can imagine how many weaver families, poor families and those working in the handloom sector would be benefitted from this.
Khadi has emerged as a powerful tool to empower the poorest of the poor by transforming the lives of the poorest of the poor.
It is playing a very big role for the rural people.
Shri Rajan Bhatt has written on Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about my Diwali experience with the security forces and he also wants to know how our security forces are celebrating Diwali.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwad has also written on the Narendra Modi app. Why can we arrange for the sweets of our houses to reach the security forces
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that the sweets of our houses should reach the soldiers of the country.
You all must have celebrated Diwali with great joy.
This time too, Diwali brought me a special experience.
I once again got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with our jawans of the security forces at the border.
This time it has been an unforgettable experience for me to celebrate Diwali with the security forces in the Gurej Sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I respect every soldier of our security forces, for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our security forces keep while fighting the difficult and difficult situations on the border.
Whenever we get the opportunity, whenever we get the opportunity, the experience of our soldiers should be understood and their pride should be heard.
Many of us may not be aware that our security forces are playing an important role in establishing peace not only on our borders but also across the world.
Being a UN peace ambassador, they are bringing the name of India to the world.
Recently, on October 24, the UN Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everyone remembers the UN's efforts to establish peace in the world and its positive role.
And we believe in VasudhaivaKutumbakam that is, the whole world is our family.
And because of this belief, India has been actively participating in UN's important initiatives since its inception.
You are aware that the proposal of the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter begins with the words WE THE PEOPLE.
India has always laid emphasis on gender equality and UN DECLARATION OF HMAN RIGHTS is its living standard.
The proposal that was made in its primary clause was 'All men are born free and equal' with the efforts of Indian representative Hansa Mehta and later 'All human beings are born free and fair'.
It seems to be a very small change, but it is reflected in a healthy thinking.
There will be many of you who are getting this information for the first time.
More than 18,000 Indian security forces have served in UN PEACEKEPING OPERATIONS.
Currently, nearly 7,000 Indian soldiers are associated with UNPEACEKEEPING INITIATIVES, which is the third highest in the world.
Till August 2019, Indian soldiers have served in about 50 OPERATIONS in the UN's 19th PEACEKEEEPING OPERATIONS across the globe.
The OPERATIONS operates in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan, and many other countries in the world.
In Congo and South Sudan, more than 20,000 patients have been treated and innumerable people have been rescued.
The security forces of India have not only protected the people of different countries but have also won their hearts by doing people friendly operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in peace-making.
Very few people would be aware of the fact that India was the first country to send a Family Police Unit to the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in Liberia.
And see, this step of India has become a source of inspiration for the world.
And then all the countries started sending their Women Police Units.
You will be proud to hear that India's role is not limited to Pacific operations, but India also works to train the Peace Keepers of almost 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peace protectors have spread the message of peace and harmony across the world.
Peacekeeping operations are not an easy task.
Our security forces have to work in difficult areas.
People have to stay in different places.
Different situations and different cultures have to be understood.
They have to adapt themselves to the local needs and environment.
He was the only UN Peace Keeper, a brave man who was honoured with the Param Vir Chakra.
Lt Gen Premchand ji is one of the Indian Peace Keepers who created a unique identity in Cyprus.
In 1998, at the age of 27, he was appointed as the Force Commander for Operation in Namibia and he served in order to ensure the country's independence.
General Thimaiyya, who has also been the Chief of the Indian Army, led the UN Peace Keeping Force in Cyprus and sacrificed everything for peace.
India, as a peace ambassador, has always been a message of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
We believe that all people live in peace, harmony and move forward in the direction of a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our holy land has been decorated with great men who have served humanity with selfless service.
Sisters and brothers, those whom we call Bhagini's statement were also extraordinary.
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Noble in Ireland, but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of the statement.
And the meaning of the statement is that it is fully dedicated.
Later, he proved himself as per his name.
Yesterday was the 150th anniversary of the Sister Statement.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his life for the welfare of the poor.
Sister Statement was deeply saddened by the atrocities committed in the British Raj.
The British not only made our country slaves, but they also tried to make us slaves mentally.
This work of instilling inferiority complex in us was going on continuously.
Bhagini Nivedita Ji re-emphasized the pride of Indian culture.
We worked to unite the people by awakening the national consciousness.
He went to different countries of the world and raised his voice against the evil propaganda about eternal religion and philosophy.
Eminent nationalist and Tamil poet Subramaniam Bharti is known for his revolutionary poetry Pudumai Penn, New Women and Women Empowerment.
It is said that its inspiration was the statement of Bhagini.
Bhagini Nivedita Ji also supported the great scientist Jagdishchandra Basu.
He helped in the publication and propagation of Basu's research through his writings and conferences.
It is India's own special beauty that spirituality and science in our culture are complementary to each other.
Bhagwani's statement and scientist Jagdishchandra Basu are a strong example of this.
In 1998, a horrific plague broke out in Kolkata, and hundreds of people died in awe.
Without worrying about their health, the work of cleaning the roads and the roads started.
She was a woman who could lead a comfortable life but was dedicated to the service of the poor.
Taking inspiration from his sacrifice, people waited with him for service.
He taught people the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
And it is written on his tomb: Here reposes Sister Nivedita who has given her all to India, who has offered her all to India.
Of course, he did the same.
Today, there can be no better tribute to this great personality than to see that every Indian should seek inspiration from his life and try to follow the path of service.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on Childrens Day, which is celebrated on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
Children are the most important heroes in building a New India-Nayak.
Your concern is true that earlier the diseases which used to occur at an advanced age and the last stage of life had started to appear in the children too.
Today we are very surprised when we hear that children are also suffering from diabetes.
Young people were fortunate to have had such diseases.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known as lifestyle disorder.
One of the major reasons for this kind of illness in young age is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and the change in our eating habits.
Society and family need to focus on this.
When they think about it, you will see that there is no need to do anything special.
It is only necessary to change the habit of doing small things in the right way and by doing them in the right way.
I would like the family members to make an effort to ensure that the children adopt the habit of going to the open grounds.
If possible, then the elders of our family will also play with these children in the open.
Instead of taking the kids to the lift, try to get them to the stairs.
After dinner, the entire family moved a little by keeping the children with them.
Yoga for Young India
Yoga will especially help our young friends to maintain a healthy lifestyle and avoid lifestyle disorders.
See, 30 minutes of yoga before going to school is very beneficial.
You can do Yoga at home and the specialty of Yoga is that it is easy, easy and accessible. And I can easily say that any aged person can do it.
Many studies and researches are underway to know how Yoga is effective in controlling diabetes.
It is being studied in AIIMS as well and the results that have come out so far are very encouraging.
We should not only treat Ayurveda and Yoga as a medium of healing and treatment, we should make it a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, in the field of sports, good news has come in the past few days.
Our players have brought laurels for the country in various sports.
In hockey, India has won the title of Asia Cup hockey.
Our players have done an excellent job and due to this India has become an Asia Cup champion after ten years.
Earlier, India had become the Asia Cup champion in 2003 and 2009.
My best wishes to the entire team and support staff on behalf of the people of the country.
After hockey, good news for India also came in badminton.
Badminton star Kidambi Shrikanth, who has excelled, has given every Indian a sense of pride to win the glory of Denmark Open.
This is his third Super Series Premier after Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
I congratulate our young friends for this achievement and for increasing the pride of India.
Friends, FIFA Under-17 World Cup was organized this month.
Teams from across the world came to India and everyone showed their best on the football field.
I also got the opportunity to go to a match.
There was a lot of enthusiasm among the players and spectators.
The whole world is watching you on such a big occasion of the World Cup.
Such a big match I was stunned to see the energy, enthusiasm and spirit of all the young players doing something.
The World Cup was successfully organized and all the teams performed their best.
India could not win the medals, but the young players of India won the hearts of all.
The whole world including India celebrated this festival of sports and this entire competition was interesting and entertaining for football lovers.
The future of football is very bright, the signals of it are visible.
I once again congratulate all the players, their colleagues and all the sports enthusiasts.
My dear countrymen, as many people as write to me about Swachh Bharat, I feel that if I think of doing justice with their feelings then I will have to organize Mann Ki Baat on daily basis and I will have to dedicate Mann Ki Baat on the subject of cleanliness.
Somewhere they are trying to seduce those attempts, while there are some instances of the collective efforts of the youth.
There is something about cleanliness, there is an innovation or there is a news of the changes that have taken place in the lives of an officer.
A few days ago, I have received a very detailed report on the transformation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
An entire team of NGOs named Ecological Protection Organization (ECSO) undertook a cleanliness drive for the Chandrapur Fort.
They sent me pictures of the forts before cleaning and after cleaning.
I was stunned to see the photographs and whoever would see these photos in his mind, would feel disappointed to see the dirt around him. Sometimes he would feel that the dream of cleanliness would be fulfilled. I would tell him that you can see the efforts of the youth of the Ecological Protection Organization, by their sweat and by their fervor, in the live pictures of his determination.
As soon as you see this, your disappointment will turn into confidence.
This great effort of cleanliness is a great example of beauty, collectivity and sustainability.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of all our countrymen to keep our historical heritage safe and clean.
I congratulate the Ecological Protection Organization and its entire team and the citizens of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of November, we will all celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
He spoke of the well-being of all humanity. He described all castes as one.
He emphasized the importance of women empowerment and women's dignity.
Guru Nanak Devji travelled 28,000 kilometers on foot, and during his journey, he conveyed the message of true humanity.
He interacted with the people, and showed them the path of truth, sacrifice and penance.
He gave a message of equality in society, and showed this message not only through words but also through deeds.
He ran an anchor, which gave rise to service among the people.
The acceptance of the anchor by sitting together awakened the feeling of unity and equality among the people.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji gave three messages of meaningful life - name of God, labour, work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Devji had set up the Gurbani in order to convey his message.
Next year 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
Let us try to follow his message and teachings.
My dear countrymen, two days later, on 31st October, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We all know that he had laid the foundation stone of a modern integrated India.
Today we can learn a lot from the extraordinary journey of this great son of Mother India.
On October 31, Mrs. Indira Gandhi left the world.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was that he not only gave a revolutionary thought but he was also expert in finding a practical solution to the complex problem of getting it done.
He was instrumental in realising the idea.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had agreed to tie India in a thread.
He ensured that the umbrella of 'One Nation, One Constitution' was brought to crores of Indians.
His decision-making ability enabled him to overcome all odds.
He had done a commendable job wherever there was a need for man-manage, where there was a need for burning fire.
He said that no distinction between caste and creed can stop us, all India's sons and daughters, all of us should love our country and make our mark on mutual love and goodwill.
This statement by Sardar Saheb is still relevant and relevant to our vision of a New India.
And this is the reason why his birth anniversary is celebrated as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas.
His contribution towards making the country a united nation is immense.
On the occasion of Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary, on October 31, the Run for Unity will be organized across the country, which will include children, youth, women, people of all age groups.
I appeal to all of you to participate in the Run for Unity celebrations of mutual goodwill.
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Diwali, with new resolutions, with new determination, you all have once again joined your daily lives.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat had ended with the help of All India Radio and today it is 36 Mo episode.
And when I tell you something in Mann Ki Baat, people from every corner of the country convey it to me. Perhaps I can say very few things to you but I get a lot of treasure.
Most of them inspire me.
Many are for reforms in the government.
Somewhere there is a personal complaint and sometimes attention is drawn to the collective problem.
And I take you half an hour in a month, but people talk about Mann Ki Baat for 30 days.
And as a result of this thing, it is natural that even the government has got a lot of sensitivity and a lot of strength in the far-flung society.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of the feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
And perhaps, in such a short span of time, I have got the opportunity to know the feelings of the common man of the country and I am very grateful to the countrymen for that.
And I believe that this discussion will also be useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future. It will have a new consciousness and a new energy.
Once I had said in Mann Ki Baat: We should worry about eating as much as we need and dont waste it.
But then I have seen that so many letters have come to me from every corner of the country. Many social organizations, many young people are already doing this work.
Many people who worked on the issue of how to utilise the food released in a bag, brought me a lot of satisfaction and happiness.
And after that I saw that many people came forward to do such a thing for cleanliness.
Once I saw the selfie with daughter of a Sarpanch of Haryana and talked to everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, a massive campaign Selfie with Daughter has been started not only in India but all over the world.
This is not just the issue of social media.
A new self-confidence is a matter of pride for every girl.
Every mother and father felt that I too should take selfie with my daughter.
Every daughter started to feel that I have some greatness, I have some significance.
Recently, I had a meeting with the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
When I told the people going on the tour that wherever you go, send a photo of that place on the Incredible India.
Millions of photographs from every corner of India, in a way, have become a great asset for the people working in the tourism sector.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have experienced how big a movement is being launched by a small incident.
Today I feel like saying all these things because when I was thinking that it has been three years, several incidents of the last three years have taken place in my mind.
The country is constantly moving in the right direction.
I have learnt and understood from my countrymen in the Mann Ki Baat programme of three years that every citizen of the country wants to do something for the welfare of others, for the good of the society and for the progress of the country.
This is a very big capital for any country and a great strength.
I salute the countrymen with my heart.
Whether it is a bed sheet, a towel or a curtain, the experience shows that the interest of Khadi has increased in the younger generation.
This has resulted in direct employment in the homes of the poor.
Discount is given in Khadi since 2nd October and a lot of relaxation is given.
I once again urge you to carry forward the campaign of Khadi.
Let us work with the spirit of buying Khadi and lighting lamps in the homes of the poor.
The poor of our country will get a strength from this work and we should do it.
And due to this increased interest towards Khadi, the enthusiasm of those working in the Khadi sector, the enthusiasm of the people associated with Khadi in the Government of India, has increased.
How to bring new technology, how to increase the manufacturing capacity, how to bring solar power
How can we revive the old heritage that were stuck for 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years
In Varanasi Sevapur, Uttar Pradesh, the Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri had been closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
A number of activities were added.
New employment opportunities have been created for many people.
Khadi and Village Industries in Pampore, Kashmir restarted its closed training centre and Kashmir has a lot to offer in this field.
Now with the resumption of this training centre, the new generation will get the opportunity to work in modern terms of construction, weaving, construction of new things. And I am glad that even the large corporate house has started offering the Khadi products in Diwali.
People have also started giving Khadi items as gifts to each other.
We all experience how things move forward in a natural manner.
My dear countrymen, last month in the episode of Mann Ki Baat, all of us had made a solemn pledge and had decided that we will celebrate 15 days of Gandhi Jayanti as a celebration of Swachhta across the country.
We will connect people with cleanliness.
Our Honble President started this work and the country was connected.
Be it the elderly, men, women, cities or villages, everyone has become a part of this cleanliness drive today.
And when I say Sankalp se Siddhi, we can see that how the Swachhata Abhiyan is moving towards a resolution.
Everyone accepts it, supports it, and contributes to someone else for its success.
This time we have seen one thing - there is one thing that we should clean somewhere and the other is that we should not litter with awareness but an ideological movement is also necessary if we have to make cleanliness a habit.
This time, several competitions were held with Swachhta Hi Sewa.
More than 2.5 crore children participated in the Essay Competition.
Thousands of children have made pictures.
As far as cleanliness is concerned, I never forget to thank the people of the media.
The electronic media of our country, the print media of our country can serve the country, we can see it in the Swachhata Hi Seva movement.
A few days ago, someone pointed out to me about the 18-year-old girl from Srinagar, Bill Dal.
And you will be happy to know that Srinagar Municipal Corporation has built its brand ambassador for cleanliness. And when it comes to Brand Ambassador then you would think that perhaps he would be a few artists, perhaps he would be a hero of the world and he would be a hero.
Bill Dar has himself been engaged in cleanliness for the last 5-6 years since the age of 12-13 years.
The biggest lake in Asia, which is near Srinagar, is cleaning it with plastic, polythene, liquid bottles and garbage.
They also earn a little from it.
Because his father died of cancer at a very young age, but he linked his life to livelihoods and cleanliness.
I would also like to congratulate the Srinagar Municipal Corporation for this initiative towards cleanliness and their thinking about the Ambassador as Srinagar is a tourist destination and every citizen of India feels like going to Srinagar and there cleanliness is so much strength to get there.
And I am glad that he not only built a brand ambassador but also handed over the car to the sanitation worker by the Corporation this time and he goes to other areas and educates people about cleanliness, motivates them and gets back till the results are produced.
Bill Dare is a young age, but a source of inspiration for everyone interested in cleanliness.
The month of October is the month of remembering many great men.
These great men gave us direction for the 20th and 21st centuries, led us, guided us and suffered a lot for the country.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, on October 11, we mark the birth anniversary of Jai Prakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh and on September 25, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.
This is also the year of Nanaji and Deendayal ji.
And what was the focal point of all these great men
One thing was common in his life and that was to live for the country, to do something for the country and not just preach, but to guide people through his life and conduct.
Gandhiji, Jai Prakash Ji and Deen Dayal Ji were all those great men who remained far away from the political arena but lived, struggled, worked and worked for the welfare of the people.
Nanaji Deshmukh left politics and joined the Gramodaya Movement and as we celebrate his Centenary year, it is very natural for him to respect his work.
When former President of India Shri Abdul Kalam used to talk to the youth, he always talked about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh.
He used to mention Nanajis works with great respect and he himself went to the village to see Nanajis work.
Remembering all these great men is not a blessing on them. We remember these great men because they keep getting the path ahead and continue to guide us.
In the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely mention SardarVallabhbhai Patel. But on 31st October, Run for Unity, Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat will be organised all over the country.
In every city of the country, there should be a large number of Run for Unity programmes and this season also is such that it gives us the joy of running and it is also necessary to get the strength of iron like Sardar Saheb.
And Sardar Saheb had united the country.
We should also move forward with the mantra of unity by running for unity.
We naturally say - Unity in Diversity is the specialty of India.
We are proud of diversity, but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I will repeatedly tell my countrymen in India and especially to my young generation that we are in an awakened situation.
To experience the diversity of India, to touch them and to feel their fragrance.
You see, these diversities of our country also work as a big school for the development of your personality.
It is a holiday, Diwali is a day. There is a habit of roaming around in our country, people go as tourists and it is very natural.
But sometimes there is a concern that we do not see our country, we do not know the diversity of the country, we do not understand the diversity of the country, but due to the impact of storm, we have started choosing to travel abroad only.
You go anywhere in the world, there is no restriction on me, but sometimes look at your homes.
The people of North India will not know what is in South India.
The people of western India dont know what is in eastern India
Our country is so diverse.
All these great men travelled widely in India.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to know and understand India.
We tried to make India live within ourselves.
Can we try to learn and understand the different states of our country, different societies, groups, their manners, their traditions, their dress, food habits and their beliefs as students
Value addition will take place in tourism only when we not only visit but also as a student.
I have my own experience that I would have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts of India.
There will be more than 450 districts where I would have got the opportunity to spend the night. And today when I am taking over this responsibility in India, I feel that this visit is very useful.
There is a lot of convenience in understanding things.
I also urge you to experience the storehouse of the immense power of our vast India, while speaking the mantra of Unity in Diversity.
This includes the dream of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat'.
How many varieties of food are there
Even if the whole life keeps eating a different meal daily, there will never be any recurrence of any food.
This is the strength of our tourism.
Inspire the diversity of the species.
With these experiences, your life will prosper.
Your thoughts will be wide-ranging.
And who can be a greater teacher than experience
Normally the period from October to March is mostly for tourism.
People travel.
I believe that if you go this time also then you will carry forward my campaign.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share your pictures.
You must send your photographs on Incredible India.
If you want to meet not only the buildings, but also the people there then send a photo of them.
Write not only about natural beauty but also about the life of that place.
Write good terms of your journey.
If possible, it should go to seven places.
Can you give me any information about this
You see, if all the people of one state talk about it, then I will tell the government to verify it and prepare a propaganda literature on the seven common things that have come about every state.
That is, in a way, it is my intention to encourage the tourist places with the views of the people.
The Government of India will work on it.
Come, join me.
You can also play an inspiring role in increasing the tourism of the country by using the time from October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch me too.
It stirs up my heart.
They leave a deep impression on me.
At the same time, I am also a person like you.
There is an incident of the past which may have been noticed by you people.We have seen a unique example of women power and patriotism.
We can imagine that at such a young age when a world has developed then what will be its mental state .
He worked hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to fulfill the dreams of his husband.
In the same way, Nitesh Dubey's husband, worked as a Naik in the army and died for the motherland.
His wife Nivedita too decided in her mind and joined the army.
It is natural for every countryman to respect our motherland, our bravehearts.
I congratulate these two sisters from the bottom of my heart.
He has created a new inspiration and a new spirit for the crores of people of the country.
Many congratulations to both these sisters.
My dear countrymen, amidst the festival of Navratri and Diwali, there is a great opportunity for the youth of our country.
The World Cup of FIFA under 19 is being held here.
I am confident that football will be spread all around.
The interest of every generation will increase in football.
No school or college field in India should be such that our youngsters are not exposed to sports.
Come, let us make sports a part of our lives, when the whole world is playing on the land of India.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
It is an occasion to worship Mother Durga.
The entire atmosphere is full of sacred fragrance.
All around there is a spiritual atmosphere, a festive atmosphere, an atmosphere of devotion and this festival is celebrated as a festival of Shakti Sadhana.
It is known as Sharadiya Navaratri.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to the countrymen and pray to Ma Shakti to let our country attain newer heights so that the hopes and aspirations of the common man of the country are fulfilled.
May the country be able to face every challenge.
And when India completes 75 years of its independence in 2022 then the effort to fulfil the dreams of those who fought for independence should be the resolve of 1.25 billion people, with tireless efforts and untiring efforts, we should come out with a five-year roadmap to realise this resolve. May Maa Shakti bless us.
Best wishes to all of you.
Celebrate festivities, enjoy with enthusiasm.
Man ki August 201
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals, on the other hand, when violence comes from any corner of the country, it is natural for the country to get worried.
This country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who gave full strength to the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors have accepted the values of public life, non-violence and respect for us.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: We have been listening to this thing since childhood.
I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort that violence will not be tolerated in the name of faith, be it communal or political ideology or be it faith in that person or be it faith in that tradition.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's constitution gives us every person a system of getting justice.
I want to assure my countrymen that no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one, no one will tolerate this.
Everyone will have to bow before the law, decide the responsibility of the law and punish the guilty.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversities, and these diversities are not limited to food, shelter and dress.
There is a diversity in every behavior of life.
Our festivals are also full of diversities, and thousands of years old our cultural heritage view cultural traditions, social traditions, and historical traditions. There will hardly be a day left in 365 days which is not associated with any festival.
Now you might have noticed that every festival of ours takes place according to the schedule of nature.
There is a direct link with nature.
Our Dhan festivals are directly linked to farmers and fishermen.
Today, when I talk of festivals, first of all, I would like to tell you the best of luck.
The festival of Samvatsari was celebrated in the Jain community yesterday.
The festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadrava in the Jain community.
The last day of the festival is Samvatsari.
This is indeed a wonderful tradition.
The festival of Samvatsari symbolizes forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
In a way, it is also known as the festival of forgiveness and this day is the tradition of calling each other a "Muchami Dukkadam".
In his play The Merchant of Venice, he writes: 'Mercy is two blades, that is blest with him that gives him the gifts and that Takes, that is, the one who forgives and forgives is blessed by God.
Bal Gangadhar Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and 125 years ago, before independence, he became a symbol of the freedom movement.
And since independence, he has become a symbol of social-education, social awakening.
Ganesh Chaturthi marks the 10th day of birth.
This Mahaparinirbhar is said to be a symbol of unity, equality and harmony.
Ganesh Chaturthi marks the birth of Lord Ganesh.
Onam is being celebrated in Kerala now.
One of the colourful festivals of India is Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural significance.
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
Apart from conveying the message of love and harmony in the society, this festival instills a new hope and a new faith in the minds of the people.
And now these festivals of ours are also becoming the reason for the attraction of tourism.
And I would like to tell the countrymen that just like Navratri festival in Gujarat or Durga festival in Bengal has become an attraction of tourism in a way.
Our other festivals also provide an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We should think about what we can do in this direction.
In the series of these festivals, a few days later, the festival of Id-ul-uha will be celebrated across the country.
Idul uha greetings to all fellow citizens.
Festivals are not only a symbol of faith and trust for us, but also of making festivals a symbol of cleanliness in the new India.
Festivals and sanitization are associated with family life.
The theme of the festival is Cleanliness.
This is not a new thing for us, but it is also necessary to be a social temperament.
The insistence on cleanliness publicly should not only be made at home but it should become an inseparable part of festivals like cleanliness in our villages, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of being modern are changing.
Recently, a new decision, a new parameter, how many cultures and how modern you are, how modern your thought process is and how modern it is being done to know all these things. And how aware you are about the environment.
If it is against it, it is considered a bad thing in the society today.
And today I can see the result of this thing that even during the Ganesh festival, an eco-friendly Ganpati, as if a large campaign has been started.
If you go to YouTube, you will find the children of every household making Ganesh ji, bringing the soil and making Ganesh ji.
Various experiments are being conducted in every family.
In a way, such a massive training of environment consciousness has been witnessed in the Ganesh Festival which has been rarely seen before.
A large number of media houses are also training people for Ganesh idols, are inspiring and guiding them.
And as I said, our country is full of millions and millions of bright minds.
And it feels very good when one finds out some new innovations.
Someone told me that there is a gentleman who is an engineer himself, he has collected the soil in a special way, and given the training of Ganesh Ji to make it a combination.
And if there is a Ganesh immersion in the water then he takes water in a bucket and keeps it in it so that it dissolves in the water immediately.
When the Swachhata Abhiyan was launched three years ago, on 2nd October it will complete three years.
And its positive results are visible.
Coverage of toilets has gone up from 3 to about 6.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves Open Defecation Free.
A few days ago there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but after the flood situation, when the water came down, the dirt was spread everywhere.
At the same time, activists of Jamiat-ulema-e-Hind at Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat cleaned 22 temples and 3 mosques affected by floods in a phased manner.
They sweated themselves and all came out.
The best example of unity for cleanliness was given by every worker of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind, an example that inspires everyone.
If the efforts made with dedication for cleanliness become our permanent habit then how far can our country reach
We should look for opportunities wherever we get the opportunity.
But let us all join together.
Work together on a holiday or Sunday.
Go to the nearby villages, go to the nearby villages, but do it as a movement.
A section has been created at the site where you can enter your name and the name of that family after the construction of a toilet, which has helped you.
My friends from social media can launch a constructive campaign and the work that has been discussed in the virtual world can be an inspiration to the world.
Swachh Sankalp se Swachh Siddhi Competition This campaign of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is a essay competition, a competition for short films and a painting competition is being organized.
You can write essays in different languages in these languages and there is no age limit, no age limit.
You can make a short film and make it from your mobile.
You can make a 2-3 minute film that inspires us for cleanliness.
It can be in any language, it can also be silent.
The awards will be given to those who will participate in this competition and the best of them will be three at the district level and three at the state level.
So I invite everyone to join this campaign of cleanliness in this form.
I once again want to say that this time, on 2nd October, Gandhi Jayanti, we should celebrate 2nd October as a Swachh Bharat. And since 15th September, cleanliness should reach every household.
You must take some steps for cleanliness.
Be a partner in your hard work.
See, how this 2 October will shine on Gandhi Jayanti.
You can imagine that after the 15 days of this cleanliness drive, after the same service and on 2nd October when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti, we will have a sacred joy inside us to pay homage to Pujya Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today, in particular, I would like to acknowledge your debt.
I want to express my gratitude to you from the bottom of my heart, that is, you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for such a long time, but I want to express my gratitude, accept my gratitude because lakhs of people from all corners of the country are connected with this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
The number of people who listen is in crores but lakhs of people sometimes write letters to me, sometimes send messages on the phone, which is a great treasure for me.
This has become a great opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I wait for your messages more than you wait to hear Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes some things become a part of our habit that we do not even think that we are wrong.
Prime Minister, I am saying a lot from Pune.
I want to tell you about one of my best wishes.
He always tried to help the people, but I got disturbed about one of their habits.
Once I had the mall to shop with him.
For a sari, she spent 2000 rupees comfortably and for 450 rupees for the pizza and for the auto rickshaw that took to the mall, it spent a long time with the rickshaw pullers for five rupees.
While returning, he bought vegetables on the way and again saved four to five rupees on every vegetable.
I felt so bad.
We pay huge bills without asking the big places once and we fight for a few rupees with our migrant brothers and sisters.
Don't you think that when we come to sell goods around our house, when we come to pick up some ferryman, whether it is small shopkeepers or vegetable sellers, or auto rickshaw drivers then whenever we come in contact with those living in service of others, we start feeling like these things: don't touch upon our homes, reduce it by two rupees, reduce it by five rupees.
And whenever we go to a large restaurant to have food, we do not even see what the bill has written and we immediately withdraw money.
Moreover, if you buy saris in the showroom, then they do not make any noise but we are not able to deal with any poor person without any discrimination.
We have never thought about what would happen to the poor
The question is not of Rs 2-5 but its very sad that you are poor and therefore doubt its honesty.
There is no difference in your life because of two-five rupees, but have you ever thought that this small habit of yours would have caused a deep shock to his mind?
Madam, I am grateful to you all for giving me a message by calling you heart touching.
I believe that even my countrymen, if they have a habit of behaving like this with the poor, they must leave it.
My dear young friends, The entire country celebrates 2nd August as National Sports Day.
This day marks the birth anniversary of the great hockey player, Major Dhyan Chand Ji.
His contribution to hockey is unparalleled.
I remember this because I want the new generation of our country to connect with sports.
Sports is a part of our lives.
If we are among the young countries of the world, then our youth should also be seen in the field of sports.
Sports - Physical fitness, mental alertness, personality enhancement, I understand what more needs it
In a way, sports is a huge herb of heart fairs.
The youth of our country should move forward in the field of sports and today in the computer era, I also want to warn that the playing field is more important than the play station.
On the computer , FIFA U-17 world show and play with football.
You will have to play cricket on computers but playing cricket under the sky is something special in the open field.
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out and they used to ask each other: When will you come back
Today, the situation is such that as soon as the children come home, they start watching cartoons in one corner or get stuck on a mobile game. And then the mother has to say - when will you go out
There was a time when mother used to tell the child when she would come and today the situation is that mother has to say - son, when will you go out
Friends, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has created a Sports Talent Search Portal to explore and refine sporting talent from where a child across the country, who has a talent in the field of sports, can upload his biodata or video on the portal.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to the selected new players.
Come, let us welcome our young guests coming from all over the world, to this festival of sports, to celebrate sports and to create an environment in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I want to share with my countrymen the events that have touched my heart last week.
I got the opportunity to meet some young daughters and some of them were born in the Himalayas.
The enthusiasm and courage of the six daughters of our country who have never been associated with the sea is an inspiration for all of us.
These six daughters will be able to cross the sea with a small boat INS Tarini.
The expedition titled Navika Sagar Parikrama, and will traverse a few months and months to India.
He will spend 40-40 days in water at one go and spend 30-30 days in water.
This is the first time in the world that our six daughters are going to be bravely amidst the waves of the sea.
Who will be an Indian who will not be proud of our daughters
I salute the spirit of these daughters and have asked them to share their experiences with the entire country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that everyone can read it because in a way this will be a story of adventure and I will be happy to share the stories of those daughters with you.
My best wishes to these daughters, many blessings.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we celebrate Teachers Day.
Former President of our country, Dr.
Radhakrishnan ji's birthday.
He was a President but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was devoted to education.
The great scientist Albert Einstein had said, "It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.
That is, spreading the joy of creativity and knowledge among our students is the most important quality of a teacher.
When we celebrate Teachers Day, can we all make a pledge
And when we talk of change in our country then the way we remember the mother in the family, the same way we remember the teacher in the society.
Teachers have a big role to play in transforming.
There have been sometimes incidents in the life of every teacher that their simple efforts would have been successful in bringing about a change in the life of a person.
If we make a collective effort then we will play a big role in the transformation of the nation.
Come, let's walk with this mantra of 'Teach to Transform'.
Namaste, Prime Minister, My name is Dr.
From Anania's life.
I reside in Mumbai city and work for India Research Centre at Howard University.
My dear countrymen, the 'Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana' Financial Inclusion has been a subject of discussion among the economic world scholars not only in India but all over the world.
The campaign was launched on 28th August, 2014 with a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, 28th August, 2020, it will mark three years of the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana.
30 crore new families have been linked to it and bank accounts have been opened.
This figure is more than that of many countries of the world.
Today, I am very satisfied that within three years, my poor brothers and sisters who have been sitting at the bottom of the pyramid in the society have become a part of the economic fundamentals of the country and their habits have changed, they have started moving in the bank, they have started saving money, they are feeling the security of the money.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the bank accounts of our poor.
In a way, this saving of the poor is their strength in the coming days.
And those whose accounts have been opened with the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana have also benefitted from insurance.
Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana, Pradhan MantriSurakshaBimaYojana, Rs.
In many families, due to the insurance of one rupee, when the poor got a crisis, the life of the family was over, in a few days it got Rs 2 lakh.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-up Yojana, Stand-up Yojana - be it Dalit, tribal, women, be it women, be it the youth who took up livelihood or be it the youth who wanted to do something on their own or be it the youth who got money without any guarantee from the banks.
Not only this, everyone has also made a successful effort to provide employment to the people of the state.
A few days ago, I had met the people of the bank. They surveyed and inspired the common man about the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana due to the Jan-Dhan Yojana and the RuPay card.
Today it is not that much time, but I will definitely tell the people of the bank that such cases are called MyGov.
They can also give new inspiration to the new generation by interviewing such people.
The changing weather cycles and changes in the environment are having a very negative impact.
In the last few days, some parts of India, especially Assam, Bihar, India, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Bengal have been affected by natural calamities due to floods.
The flood affected areas are being closely monitored.
Relief work is being done at a comprehensive level.
My colleagues in the Cabinet are also reaching Rubru where possible.
The State Governments are also making all efforts to help the flood victims in their own lives.
Social organizations, cultural organizations and civil servants are also making every effort to help the people in this situation.
From the Government of India to the Armed Forces, to the Air Force, to the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), to the paramilitary forces, all join in the service of the victims.
Due to floods, life gets disrupted.
NDRF teams were deployed on the ground.
The victims were made disaster friends and were trained on what to do and what not to do during the disaster.
Volunteers have been created, thus creating a mass organization and learning to work in difficult situations.
Slowly, we should also make it a habit to organize our activities according to the weather conditions so that we can save ourselves from the harms.
Whenever I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country prepare themselves more than me.
This time all the letters related to GST have been received and all the phone calls have been received.
And still, people are expressing happiness about GST and are expressing their curiosity towards GST.
And I would like to share a phone call with you too. Namaste Prime Minister, I am calling you Nitru Garg from Gurgaon.
I have heard your Chartered Accountants Day speech, and am very impressed.
Similarly, in our country, Goods and Services Tax-GST was introduced on this date last month.
Can you say that the results of the government's expectations are received after one month or not
I want to know your ideas about this. Thank you.
And when a poor person writes to me that because of GST, the prices of essential commodities have come down and things have become cheaper, I feel very satisfied and happy.
I was just seeing the impact of GST on the transport sector.
Now the income of trucks has increased.
It takes less time to distances.
Highways have been freed from traffic jams.
Prior to this, most of the resources in the transport and logistics sector were involved in maintaining paper work and had to build new godowns in every state.
But GST which I call Good and Simple Tax.
It has really made a very positive impact on our economy and has impacted our economy in the shortest possible time.
The speed with which the change has come about, the speed with which the changes have taken place, the new records have created a new faith in the whole country.
And sometimes economists, management experts, technologists, and the use of GST in India, as models, will present before the world.
This will be a case study for many universities of the world.
All decisions have been taken by the States and the Centre together with consensus.
And as a result, there has been only one priority for every government that there is no burden on the poor due to GST.
I heartily thank all the Ministries, all the departments, the employees of the Central and State Governments involved in this work.
GST is a shining example of Indias collective strength.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform but an economy that strengthens a new culture of honesty.
In a way, this is also a campaign for social reform.
I once again salute the crores of Indians for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
Naturally, since childhood, we have been hearing this thing, and this is the reason that the Non-Cooperation Movement started on 1st August, 1920.
The uit India Movement began in August 1942, which is known as the August Revolution.
And on 15th August, 14th August, the country became independent.
In a way, several incidents related to the Independence Day are associated with it in the month of August.
This year we are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But very few people know that the slogan of uit India was given by Dr. Yusuf Meherally.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 1, 1942.
The manner in which the countrymen fought, the way they fought, the way they fought, and the way they fought against you during the freedom struggle from 1985 to 1942 is our inspiration for building India.
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for Indias freedom movement.
This movement has resolved the entire country to get rid of the British Raj.
This was the time when in opposition to the British rule, the Indian people in every corner of the country, be it the village, the city, the educated, the untouchables, the poor, the rich and the rich, had together become a part of the uit India Movement.
The anger of the people was at its climax.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were fighting their lives with the mantra of Do or Die.
Millions of youth of the country had given up their education and had sacrificed their books.
The bugle of freedom came out.
Mahatma Gandhi had called for the uit India Movement on 7th August, but the British had put all the prominent leaders in jail.
And it was during that period that great souls like Dr. Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan played a leading role in the leadership of the second generation in the country.
In the Non-Cooperation Movement and the uit India Movement, two distinct forms of Mahatma Gandhi were found in 1920 and 1942.
The forms of the Non-Cooperation Movement were different and the situation of 42 was different. The intensity has increased so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi had given the mantra of Do or Die.
There was public support and peoples ability behind all this success.
It was a peoples resolve, a peoples struggle, and the entire country was fighting together.
Sometimes I think that if we look at it with a few pages of history, India's first freedom struggle was in 1985.
The freedom struggle started in 1985, till 1942, continued to run in every corner of the country.
This long period instilled a spirit of freedom in the hearts of our countrymen.
Everything was committed to doing something.
Generations changed, but there was no dearth of resolutions.
The people came, they went, they went, new people came, new people started joining, and the country was making every effort to overthrow the British rule.
This hard work, from 1985 to 1942, created a situation where it reached its peak in 1942 and the battle for uit India was blown up by the British in 1914.
From 1985 to 1942, five years to 1942, when it reached the people of that period of freedom, it became such a people, the five decisive years of Sankalp se Sidhi became the reason for the country's independence.
These five years were a decisive year.
Now I want to connect you with this figure.
We became independent in 1947 and today we are 2017.
It has been almost 70 years since the formation of the government, the system, the system, the development, the development, and everyone has made every effort in their own way to free the country from the problems.
For example, from 1942 to 1942, there was a decisive five years of Sankalp se Siddhi.
I can see that from 2019 to 2022, another five year period has come before us towards Sankalp se Sidhi.
On 15th August 2019, we will celebrate Sankalp Parva and by turning this pledge into accomplishment, when it will mark 75 years of Independence in 2022.
Efforts should be made to fulfil the crores and crores of resolutions.
As five years between 1942 and 1942 became decisive for the country's independence, these five years from 2019 to 2022 are also decisive and decisive for the future of India.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of our independence.
Come, let us run a grand campaign of 'Sankalp se Siddhi' from August this month.
Every Indian, social institutions, local bodies, schools, colleges, different organizations - take a pledge for every New India.
We will accomplish such a resolution in the next five years.
Today, I am particularly online because we may not be anywhere but we are definitely online.
I invite my young friends, especially the online world, to come forward and contribute innovatively in the making of a New India.
Using technology, bring video, post, blog, script, new ideas, all these things.
Let this campaign turn it into a mass movement.
The uit India uiz will also be launched on the Narendra Modi App for young friends.
This quiz is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to familiarize them with the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must disseminate it widely.
There is not a single person saying that the voice of 1.25 billion countrymen resonates from the Red Fort.
This time too, I invite you to send me your ideas on MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
I myself read it and try to express it in whatever time I have on 15th August.
The last three times I heard a complaint in my 15 August speech that my speech becomes a bit longer.
We see whether success is achieved or not.
My dear countrymen, I would like to say one more thing.
There is a social economy in India's economy.
And we should never underestimate this.
Our festivals, our festivals, are not just occasions of joy and happiness.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign of social reform.
But with this, every festival of ours has a direct connection to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
After a few days, Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, Ganesh Utsav, Fourth Chandra, Anant Chaudha, Durga Puja, Diwali - one after the other, and this is the right time for the poor to earn an economic livelihood.
As far as the economy is concerned, several months before the Raksha Bandhan, a Rakhi is made in hundreds of families in small domestic industries.
The people of Rakhi, those who sell Rakhi, those who sell sweets, the business of thousands of hundreds of people connect with a festival.
The families of our poor brothers and sisters run by them only.
We light the lamp in Diwali not only on the festival of lights but also on the festival of lights. It is not just a festival, it is a celebration of a house.
It is directly related to those poor families who make small earthen lamps.
But today, when I talk about the economy of the poor people associated with festivals, I would also like to talk about the environment.
And sometimes I think that the countrymen are more aware and active than I am.
For the last one month, citizens have constantly written to me about the environment.
He also urged people to share the message of eco-friendly Ganesh Chaturthi marks the birth of Lord Ganesh beforehand, so that people can make a plan of action on the selection of Lord Ganesha.
First of all, I am grateful to such conscious citizens.
He urged me to speak on this subject prematurely.
This time there is a special significance of the public Ganesh festival.
Lokmanya Tilak ji started this great tradition and this year marks the 125th anniversary of the public Ganesh festival.
Once again, on the occasion of Ganeshotsav, let us organize essay competitions, discussions and remember the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak.
And in the direction of Tilak ji's feelings, how we should take the public Ganeshotsav, how we should strengthen the spirit of that feeling and at the same time, Ganesh made from eco-friendly clay for protecting the environment.
And this time I have said very soon.
I am sure that all of you will join me and benefit from it will be that the poor, the poor, the artisan, the idols will get employment and the poor will get stomach full.
Let us connect our festivals with the poor, the economy of the poor, the joy of our festivals become an economic festival of the houses of the poor, it should be an effort of all of us.
I convey my best wishes to every countryman for the various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we see it continuously that our daughters are bringing glory to the nation, be it in the field of education, in the field of economy, in the field of social sector, in the field of sports and in the field of sports.
We are proud of our daughters.
Recently, our daughters performed brilliantly in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those daughters this week.
I was very happy to talk to him, but I was feeling that he could not win the World Cup.
There was pressure and tension on his face too.
We have seen many such games that if the players of India fails to do so, the country's anger breaks down on those players.
Some people say something after breaking the limits, write something that causes lot of pain.
But for the first time, when our daughters could not succeed in the World Cup, the 1.25 billion Indians took the defeat and did not let it fall on the daughters.
Not only this, these daughters sang and glorified what they did.
Indeed, the young generation of our country, especially our daughters, are really doing a lot to bring glory to the country.
Once again I convey my best wishes and best wishes to the young generation of the country, especially our daughters.
My dear countrymen, I once again remind you of the August Revolution, I once again remind you of August. On the 15th of August, I once again remind you of the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022.
Every countryman should make a resolution, every countryman should prepare a five-year roadmap to accomplish the resolution.
We all have to take this country to new heights and take it to new heights.
Let us walk hand in hand, let us do something.
Let us move forward with the belief that the future of the country will be better.
Many many-many greetings.
The weather is changing.
Rainfall in many parts of the country has made the weather pleasant.
After the rains, the cold winds are experiencing relief from the heat of the past.
And we have seen that there are many difficulties in life, however much stress, be it personal life, public life, or when the rains come, our mood changes.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath, is celebrated with great reverence and enthusiasm in many parts of the country.
Now, in some parts of the world, the festival of Jagannath Ji's Rath Yatra is celebrated.
And the poor of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath.
The people who made Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar. He must have seen that he praised Lord Jagannath ji for his temple and traditions, because it included social justice and social harmony.
Lord Jagannath ji is the god of the poor.
And very few people would know that there is a word in English, Jugernauth and it means such a grand chariot which no one can stop.
And in the Dikshanri meaning of this Jagran, it is also seen that this word has originated from the chariot of Jagannath.
And that is why we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath, I convey my best wishes to all the citizens and bow down to Lord Jagannath on the auspicious occasion of Jagannath.
India's diversity is also its speciality, India's diversity is also the strength of India.
The holy month of Ramzan was celebrated with great reverence by the people of India.
Now it is the festival of Eid.
On this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr, my best wishes to everyone.
The month of Ramadan is the month of Punya Tithi.
It is a month to share happiness and as much as we share happiness, happiness increases.
Let us together draw inspiration from these sacred festivals, share the treasure of happiness and take the country forward.
In this holy month of Ramzan, I came to know of a inspiring event of Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
About 3500 families of our Muslim brothers and sisters reside there in small villages. In a way, more families belong to our Muslim family.
In this Ramzan, the people of the village have decided to together build toilets.
And within this personal toilet, government assistance is also given to them and about 1 lakh rupees have been given to them.
You can spend 1 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate every village of Mubarakpur for turning this holy occasion of Ramzan into an opportunity for the welfare of society.
One of his things is also very inspiring.
And most importantly, he freed Mubarakpur of open defecation.
We know that in our country, three regions - Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala - have already been declared as Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF this week.
I express my special gratitude to the administration, administration and people of these five states for completing this task.
We know very well that if we want to do something good in the life of an individual and in the life of a society then we have to work very hard.
If our letter is bad, if we want to correct it then we have to strive for a long time with great awareness.
Then the habit of body and mind changes .
The issue of cleanliness is the same.
Such bad habits have become a part of our nature.
It has become a part of our habits.
We have to constantly try to get rid of it.
Everyone will have to attract attention.
We have to remember good motivational incidents.
And I am glad that today cleanliness is not just a government programme.
In the past, I have come to know of a very good event which I would like to say before you.
This incident is from Vijaynagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration there has taken up a major task with public participation.
A 100-hour non-stop campaign.
And what was the goal ?
To build 10,000 household toilets in 1 Gram Panchayats in an hour.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the people and the government have successfully completed the work of constructing 10 thousand toilets in 100 hours.
One village became ODF.
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijaynagaram district for setting a great example by coming to the culmination of your hard work.
These days, in Mann Ki Baat, I keep getting feedback from people continuously, on the Narendra Modi App, on mygov.
They keep coming in through letters and keep on coming on the AIR also.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has recalled the crisis that on 25th June he had presented as a period in the history of democracy.
This awareness of the democracy of Prakash Tripathi ji is commendable and democracy is not just a system, it is also a culture.
15th, 25th June was such a dark night which no democratic lover can forget.
No Indian can forget it.
In a way, the country was converted into a jail.
The voice of the opposition was suppressed.
Eminent leaders of the country including Jai Prakash Narayan were jailed.
Even the judicial system could not escape the shadow of that horrible form of crisis.
The newspapers were completely useless.
Today's journalistic students, people working in democracy, repeatedly remembering that period of time, constantly and continuously striving to increase awareness about democracy, should continue to do so.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
When the crisis was over for a year, Atal ji wrote a poem, describing the mood of that time in his poem.
We have to further strengthen this heritage.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is proud to be raised in the world today.
The entire world became Yoga Day on 21st June, 2019.
From water to mountains people welcomed the sun rays through yoga in the morning.
Almost all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
In China, people practiced yoga at The Great Wall of China, while in Peru, people performed yoga at a height of 2400 metres above sea level on World Heritage Site Machu Picchu.
People in France performed yoga at the Eiffel Tower.
More than 4000 people participated in mass yoga at Abu Dhabi in UAE.
In Afghanistan, India gave a new dimension to India's friendship by performing Yoga at Afghanistan Friendship Dam, Salma Dam in Hairat.
Programmes were held at 70 places in small places like Singapore and they have been running the campaign for weeks.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters were organized at UN Headquarters.
UN officials, including diplomats from around the world, were also present at the event.
This time again, Yoga has also worked in the world record.
In Gujarat, around 55,000 people in Ahmedabad have together made a new world record.
I also got the opportunity to attend the Yoga event in Lucknow.
But for the first time I got the opportunity to do Yoga in the rains.
Our soldiers also performed yoga in Siachen with a minimum temperature of 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Be it our Armed Forces, BSF, ITBP, CRPF or CISF, everyone has made Yoga a part of their duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations since it was the third International Yoga Day, I had said that share the photos of three generations of your family doing Yoga at one go.
Some TV channels have also taken this forward.
I received a number of photographs, some of which have been collected on the selected Narendra Modi App.
Honble Prime Minister, I am speaking from Dr. Anil Sonar, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
Sir, I have a question that we have recently heard in your speech in Kerala that instead of gifts and bouquets of flowers at different places, we should give a good reading book as mementos.
You have started this work even during your tenure in Gujarat. But, sir, we cant see this work in a few days.
So can we do this .
Reader-days and reading-months are being organized by Vikar Foundation to inculcate the habit of reading books among people, to make people aware about reading books.
That is why I got the opportunity to attend the inauguration.
And the handlooms of Khadi, which will also promote Khadi.
As long as I was in Gujarat, all of us had developed this habit, but after coming here I had lost that habit.
But when he went to Kerala, he was reminded once again.
And I have just started giving the following information to the government.
We too can gradually develop a habit.
And the age of flower bouquets is very low.
Once we put it in hand, then we put it in hand.
But if we book, then in a way it becomes a part of the house and becomes a part of the family.
If we welcome the handkerchief of Khadi, then how many poor people get help from it.
Costs are reduced as well and they are used in the true sense.
And when I am saying this thing then how historic these things are
Last year when I visited the UK, Rani Elizabeth of London invited me for dinner.
How many years have passed, yet Rani Elizabeth has preserved the towel that was given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I was watching it, he urged me to touch it.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I believe that habits do not change overnight. And when we talk like this then we also have to become victim of criticism.
However, there will be criticism but if we talk about it then gradually changes will come.
My dear countrymen, being a Prime Minister, there are many types of things.
I have to stay in files, but I have created a habit for me that I read some of the letters that come to me every day and this gives me an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different types of letters come, different types of people write letters.
These days I got the opportunity to read one such letter, I think you should definitely tell me about it.
In the far south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewife from Madurai, Arulmoji Sarwan, she sent me a letter.
In a tweet, he said, "I thought about economic activity in my family while paying attention to the education of children, so that the family could get financial assistance.
So, through the MUDRA Yojana, I took money from the bank and started working towards sending the goods from the market.
In such a scenario, I noticed that the Government of India has created a system called Sarvajanik e-Marketplace (GeM).
So I searched for information about what it was and asked the people about it.
Then I registered it myself.
I want to tell the countrymen that if you get the opportunity, then you too will be able to visit e-GeM on the internet.
Those who want to send some goods to the government, those who want to send small things, those who want to send electricity bulbs, those who want to send a dustbin, those who want to send a chair, those who want to send a table, those who want to sell them, those people who want to register their names on that site.
The people of the government departments must visit the site and see who provides cheap and cheap goods without compromising the quality of supply.
And then they have to be ordered.
So, every department of the government is watching the names of those who register themselves under e-GeM.
Due to lack of middlemen, the goods are cheap.
Now this Arulmoji Madam has registered all the things that he was able to supply on this government website.
And the interesting thing is that the letter he has written to me is very interesting.
He wrote that I got money from 'Mudra', my business started, I released all the information about what I could give in e-GeM and what I would have asked from the Prime Minister's Office, he wrote that he bought two thermos from me at the Prime Ministers Office.
And I got my bill of 1600 rupees.
This is empowerment.
This is the strength of the country.
It has transparency, it has empowerment as well as entrepreneurship.
This is the Government e-Marketplace (GeM).
I would certainly like to add more and more people who want to sell their goods to the government in this way.
I believe that this is a shining example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance. And what is its goal is minimum cost and maximum efficiency and transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga, and on the other hand we are proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that our steps are on the land of Yoga, so our dreams are for far-reaching consequences.
A few days ago, India has done a lot of hard work in sports and science.
Two days ago, ISRO launched 30 nanosatellites with Cartosat-2 Series satellites.
And besides India, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, almost 14 countries are included in this satellite.
And this Nano satellite campaign of India will help us in the field of agriculture and farmers during natural calamities.
A few days ago, we all might remember that ISRO successfully launched GSAT-1.
And it is the heaviest satellite launched by India so far.
And when the newspapers of our country compared the weight of its elephant then you can imagine how our scientists have done a great job in the field of space.
On 1st June, 1000 days of Mars mission has passed.
But I am glad that the efforts of our scientists have been successful in completing six months and now even after a thousand days our Mangalyaan mission is working.
Photographs are being sent, information is being given, synthetic data is being sent, it is working more than its age.
The completion of one thousand days is an important milestone in our scientific journey and our space journey.
Even in the field of sports, we are seeing an increasing interest among our youth.
Now it seems that along with studies, our youth is also seeing their future in sports. And due to their hard work and hard work, their achievements also bring glory to the country.
Recently, India has enhanced the pride of the country by making a medal tally in the Indonesia Open.
I heartily congratulate him and his coach for this achievement.
T.
Usha ji was also present at the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track for Usha School of Athletics.
Sports and personality also play a very important role in development.
The importance of sports in the entire personality development is immense.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If our family also has interest in sports, then they should be given an opportunity to play.
They should be picked up from the field, locked up in a room, compelled to read and write books, but if they have capability and interest in sports, then they should be encouraged and encouraged.
Everyone should dream for the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the atmosphere of rainy season and festivals, in a way, the experience of this period is unique.
We will never forget the heat of this year.
Rains are waiting for the alert.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has begun.
On the auspicious occasion of Ramadan, I convey my best wishes to the people of India and the entire world, especially the Muslim community.
Prayer, spirituality and charity in Ramzan are of utmost importance.
We Indians are very fortunate that our ancestors have created such a tradition that today India can take pride in this thing. We 1.25 billion Indians can take pride in the fact that all the sects of the world are present in India.
This is a country where people who believe in God also resides and those who deny God also resides. People who worship idols and those who oppose idol worship also resides.
Every kind of thought, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition, we have embraced the art of living together and at the same time, be it religion, sect, ideology, tradition, the same message conveys to us - peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan is going to help in furthering this path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again, my best wishes to everyone.
Last time when I was talking about Mann Ki Baat, I had used a word and especially asked the youth to do something new, come out of the comfort zone.
Take new experiences, and this is the age when life can be lived in such a way that it takes some risk and invites difficulties.
I am glad that many people have responded to me.
Personally, everyone showed me the courage to talk to me.
Some learn drama and some people have written that we are now beginning to write poems.
My reading habit was almost lost.
Therefore, I decided to read these holidays.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much struggle was required for Indias independence, how much sacrifices were required and how many freedom fighters had spent years in prisons.
I was inspired by Bhagat Singh who had done a lot of things at a very young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some messages to today's generation in this regard.
I am glad that the younger generation is taking interest in knowing about our history, about our freedom fighters and about those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
The countless great men who spent their youth in prisons, many young men in prisons laughed at them.
And that is why today we are breathing in a free India.
We must have seen that those great men who spent their time in the freedom movement had done a great job of writing, studying and doing a great job.
I visited Andaman Nicobar a few years ago.
He visited the Cellular Jail.
Today is Veer Savarkar's birth anniversary.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote the book 'Maji Janmthe' in jail.
He used to write poems, write on walls.
They were closed in small coats.
Think about the atrocities committed by the freedom fighters.
When I read Savarkar ji's book 'Maji Janmashtami', I got the inspiration to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a light and sound show that is very inspiring.
There was not a single state in India that would not have spoken in any language of India that would have deprived the people of Andaman and Nicobar Islands of Andaman and Nicobar for their freedom and for their youth in Cellular Jail.
The people of every language, every region, every generation of people had sacrificed their lives for the British.Today marks the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
I will definitely tell the youth of the country that what kind of atrocities were committed and how many hardships were being faced by the people for the freedom that we had got. If we go to Cellular Jail then we will find out.
Even if you get the opportunity, you must visit the pilgrimage centres of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, 5th June is the first Monday of the month.
Connecting with nature means nurturing a better planet.
And who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times - One must care about a world one will not see.
That is, it is our duty to take care of the world we do not want.
If you are tired and are tired, open the windows of the room, open the doors, breathe fresh air, then a new consciousness emerges.
When this body of five great souls comes in contact with those five great souls, then a new spirit emerges in our body a new energy.
We all have experienced this, but we do not notice it, we do not connect it in one thread or the other.
After this, you must see that when you are in touch with the natural state, a new consciousness will emerge in you. Therefore, on the 5th of June, the global campaign to connect with nature should also be our own campaign.
And we are getting some benefit from the things done by our ancestors to protect the environment.
If we protect, then our future generations will be benefitted.
In the Vedas, the Earth and the environment are considered to be the source of strength.
And Atharvaveda is, in a way, the greatest guiding light of the environment and has been written thousands of years ago.
It is said in our scriptures - : : : : : : : : : : : : : : That which is purity in us is due to our planet.
Earth is our mother and we are her sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, it is obvious that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the enlightenment of him, and his Mahaparinirvana, all the three trees were brought down.
But we need to connect it with modern techniques in modern terms.
These days I receive news from the states.
In almost every state, a massive campaign of tree plantation is going on as soon as the rains come.
Crores of trees are being planted.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has now become a known day for the world.
In the form of World Yoga Day, the whole world considers it.
In a very short span of time, the 21st of June has spread across every corner of the country.
On the one hand, when many forces of partition are showing their distorted appearance, yoga is the greatest gift of India to the world.
Through Yoga, we have connected the world with one thread.
Just as Yoga connects body, mind, intelligence and soul, today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, due to lifestyle, speed and increasing responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to lead a stress free life.
And it has come to the notice of the people at a young age as well.
In such a scenario, the role of Yoga in leading a stress-free life is very important.
Yoga is a guarantee for both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through yoga to experience the journey through body, mind, body, thought and practice.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world for Yoga Day.
Last year, I had announced several Yoga related competitions.
Slowly the work will move in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Day of Yoga, and I have been told that on this occasion, three generations of the same family will practice Yoga at one place.
Be it the grandparents, parents, sons or daughters, all three generations should do yoga together and upload pictures of it.
If there is such a wonderful coincidence yesterday, today and tomorrow, then Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that just like we had launched the Selfie with Doctor's campaign and had a very interesting experience.
The photographs of these three generations of Yoga will certainly inspire the country and the world.
I invite you all.
We still have around 3 weeks for the International Yoga Week.
Come to practice today itself.
From June 1, I will continue to post something or the other related to Yoga on Twitter every day and continue to post till June 21.
I'll share with you.
You too, for three weeks, should spread the theme of 'Yoga' and involve people.
In a way, this is a movement of Preventive Health Care.
I invite you all to join this movement.
Because I had a very interesting phone call and perhaps I did not even think about it like this.
But I am grateful to him for the way he had caught this thing.
You will also get to know about this phone call.
Namaste Modi ji, I am Naina from Mumbai.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission on your call.
The cleanliness drive that you had taken from the banks of Kashi has now taken the form of a movement with your inspiration.
It is true that wherever I go, the government machinery does the work of cleaning but during these days cleanliness is also celebrated in the society.
Five days before my visit, seven days ago, ten days ago, there are several programmes for cleanliness.
Media also gives a lot of priority to such programs.I had visited Kutch in Gujarat a few days ago.
You can imagine how happy I would be to know that the country is also taking care of these things.
During my visit, the subject of cleanliness is linked, what can be a matter of greater happiness for me
The other preparations that will be made to welcome the Prime Minister will be cleanliness.
It is equally heartening and inspiring for any cleanliness lover.
I convey my best wishes to all those who are helping in the cause of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
However, the suggestion is to spread some rumor.
I do not know whether I can do this or not.
Modi ji, before you meet, ask those who want to invite you, brother, if you want to tell me what will be the level of cleanliness
I liked the idea a lot, but I have to think about it.
However, it is true that the move should start as it would be better to offer other things as a gift to us that we should clean so many tonnes of garbage and give it in gifts.
How many can we prevent illness
How big the work of humanity will be
One thing I would like to say is that we should not consider the waste, it is a good thing, it is a source.
Do not just look at it as garbage.
The Government of India, with the help of the State Governments as well as with the peoples representatives from the cities, has decided to launch a major campaign of waste management.
On World Environment Day, on 5th June, resources will be available to collect solid waste and liquid waste in about 4000 cities of the country.
Two types of waste will be available, one green, the other blue.
There are two types of waste generated - one liquid waste and the other dry waste.
If we remain in the discipline, in the 4,000 cities where we have installed garbage, we will put dry garbage in blue dustbins and wet garbage in green garbage dumps like garbage dumplings, waste food, eggplants or tree leaves, all these are wet wastes and put them in green dustbins.
This whole process is such that it can work in the fields and the color of the fields is green, so you will remember what is to be laid in the green litter.
And the rest of the wastes like scrap paper, cardboard, iron, raw, cloth, plastic, polythene, broken boxes, rubber, metal etc. all these things are called dry wastes which are required to be recycled in a machine.
Just a few days ago, you must have heard a news report that the Versova beach in Mumbai, which was supposed to be dirty, is now a beautiful beach today.
The entire responsibility was entrusted to the VRV.
I congratulate Mr. Afroz Shah.
Best wishes to this movement.
And the way he connected the people of the entire region and transformed them into a mass movement is indeed an inspiring example.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, every year, be it print or TV or social media, the accounts of the present government are continuously going on for 3 years.
3 years ago you gave me the responsibility of the Prime Servant.
There have been a lot of surveys, a lot of openness, and I see every process as a very positive sign.
This 3 year term is calculated on each case.
It has been reviewed by people from all walks of life.
This is a great process in a democracy.
I clearly believe that the governments should be responsible in the democracy and the public should account for their work.
For an awakened nation, a vibrant nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I am an ordinary citizen just like you and as an ordinary citizen, all the good and bad things are affected by me too, just like in the minds of ordinary citizens.
Some people criticize it politically, but after such a long experience, I feel that when I started Mann Ki Baat, I did not even think that Mann Ki Baat would make me a member of every family in India.
It seems as if I talk about the house while sitting in the house in the middle of the family itself.
And there are hundreds of such families who have written these things to me.
And as I said, there is an impact in my mind as a common man.
Two days ago, in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Honble President, Honble Vice President, Honble Speaker Sir, everyone inaugurated the book Mann Ki Baat, an analytical book.As an individual, as an ordinary citizen, this event is very encouraging for me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, by the time we meet, there must have been rains in every corner of the country, the weather must have changed, the results of exams must have come, the beginning of new life will begin, and with the onset of rains, an innovative zeal and enthusiasm will spread in an atmosphere of happiness.
Let us all move forward in this environment in love with nature.
Best wishes to all of you on my behalf.
Most of the people who make suggestions or try to reach me are those who really do something in their lives.
He is striving hard to do something good according to his intellect, strength, capability and circumstances. And when it comes to this thing, I felt that these suggestions are not common but they come out of the clutches of that experience.
I had never thought that today the youth of our country has been doing this work for a long time.
Yes, we have been aware that some social institutions have been functioning for years but only after knowing that the youth of my country is engaged in it.
Many people have sent me a video.
There are several places where Roti Bank runs.
People deposit roti, vegetables on their behalf in this Roti Bank and those in need also get it from there.
Those who give it, those who take it, do not have to look down.
This is an example of what kind of work is being done with the cooperation of the society.
It is the last day of the month of April.
On the first day of May, we mark the foundation day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
On this occasion, my best wishes to the citizens of both the states.
Both the states have made continuous efforts to scale new heights of development and have contributed to the progress of the country.
My best wishes to these two states.
There was a time when climate change was known as the subject of education, the subject of dialogue, but today, in our everyday life, we experience it and are also surprised.
Nature has also changed the rules of sports.
When I was receiving suggestions from people about Mann Ki Baat, people gave me most suggestions on what should be done in this summer.
Although everything is prevalent, it is not new, but it is also very useful to remember it at that time.
Prashant Kumar Mishra and T.K.
S.
Many friends like Karthik have expressed concern over the birds.
These friends have said: In the balcony, water should be kept on the roof and I have seen that the small children of the family do this very good.
Once they understand why they should fill this water, then they visit 10 times a day, whether there is water in the pot or not, and whether the bird has come or not.
We feel that this game is going on but in reality this is an amazing experience of instilling emotions in the child's mind.
You too, sometimes see, a little similar feeling with animals and birds makes you feel a new joy.
Though we are colourful about our country's animal, animal, animal, nature, it is essential that these efforts be strengthened collectively.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the religious leader of the Dawoodi Bohra community, had completed 100 years.
I had the opportunity to launch this programme.
He distributed 52,000 pieces of gram flour to every corner of the world.
It was also included in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy that we dont have to send a print or a milkman or a vegetable or a postal worker but we forget that, earlier we used to ask him for some water.
Young friends, I want to do a few things with you as well.
Sometimes I am worried that our younger generation will have fun to spend their lives in Ease of Living.
Parents also raise their heads in a state of defence.
I am confident that some friends will definitely make efforts and will tell me the truth.
Would you use this time of vacation according to my suggestion I would like to make three suggestions, if we implement all three of them then it is a good thing but if we try to implement one of the three.
You will feel a new passion and a new feeling.
Try to learn new skills.
You may not have seen it, you may not have thought it, you may not know it but if you feel like going there then try to go there.
New places, new experiences, new skills.
There is a difference between the fact that sometimes looking at something on TV or reading about it in the book or listening to it from the acquaintances and experiencing the same thing on its own.
I urge you to try to know whatever your curiosity is in this vacation and do a new experiment.
If you are absolutely positive and are out of comfort then do it.
We belong to a middle class family and to a happy family.
I do not say that you do it again and again and feel it once again.
In the evening, you should reach the poorest of the poor with football or with volleyball or any other sports equipment.
You will be able to play with the poor children yourself. You will be able to enjoy the games that you have never met before.
And I am confident that once you go, you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many voluntary organizations work for the cause.
Find out if you are associated with Google Guru and join any such organization for 15 days or 20 days.
But at the same time, you sometimes feel like camping such a summer, learning a course of personality development, you should reach those people in the society who did not get the opportunity to participate in such camps and learn those people without taking money.
You can learn how development can be done.
Everyone has become busy with technology.
Community is also a tradition, collectiveness is a force to reckon with.
Today is the era of competition.
Sometimes we feel scared that our young generation machine is not becoming a human robot.
Try to spend time with oneself, away from technology.

In a way, it had become a symbol of VIP culture, but experience says that the red light used to look on the vehicle, it used to take a car, but it used to enter the mind and the VIP culture was home.
Just a while ago, no one can claim that the red light that has been installed in the brain has disappeared.
I received a very interesting phone call.
Although they have expressed doubts on the phone, but now this phone call suggests that the common man does not like these things.
It gives a feeling of being away from it.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I am calling from Shiva Choubey, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I want to say something about the government's red beacon light ban.
I read a line in the newspaper that wrote - "every Indian is a VIP on a road. I was very proud to hear that today my time is equally important.
I do not get stuck in traffic and I do not even have to stop for anyone.
So I would like to heartily thank you for this decision.
And in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, our country is not only cleaning the country, but also clearing the VIPs' claims on our roads. Thanks to the government's decision, turning the red light into a part of the system.
But we have to take it out of our minds through our efforts.
If we all make a conscious effort together, we will be able to come out.
New India is our concept that the importance of EPI in place of VIPs increases in the country.
And when I say EPI in place of VIP, my sense of duty is clear - Every person is important.
Everyone has importance, everyone has greatness.
If we accept the importance of 1.25 billion Indians, if we accept the greatness of 1.25 billion Indians, then how great a force will be formed to fulfil the great dreams.
We all have to do it together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that we keep remembering history, our culture and our traditions repeatedly.
We get energy and inspiration from them.
This year we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya the 125 crore countrymen.
For some reason we have become so small that we think for more than a century.
Centuries have a great importance for other countries of the world.
But India is such an ancient nation that we have got the opportunity to celebrate more than a thousand years old memories of its destiny.
What would have happened a thousand years ago
Very few people would be aware that Ramanujacharya had fought a great battle against the social evils of the society, high casteism, untouchability and casteism.
Through their conduct, society embraced those who believed to be impotent.
Thousands of years ago, he launched a movement to enter his temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are so fortunate that in every era a great human being is born out of our society to eradicate the evils of our society.
When we commemorate the 1000th birth anniversary of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya, we seek inspiration from him in order to awaken the spirit of social harmony and unity in our society.
The Government of India is also going to release a stamp in memory of Saint Shri Ramanujacharya on the 1st of May.
I respectfully bow down to Saint Shri Ramanujacharya and pay my respects to him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow 1st May also has a different significance.
It is also celebrated as Labour Day in many parts of the world.
Labor is being discussed, it is very natural for me to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar when it comes to Labor.
And very few people know that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the facilities and the respect that the workers receive today.
Babasaheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Baba Saheb and Saint Ramanujacharya, the great saint and social reformer of the 12th century Karnataka is also remembered by Guru Basaveshwara Ji.
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to attend a function.
It was also an occasion to dedicate a collection of his dead bodies to the nation.
In other words, Shram is Shiva.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is very natural to remember Dattopant Thengdi Ji.
My dear countrymen, a few days later, we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha all over the world consider it a festival.
The problems that the world is facing today - violence, war, destruction, weapons competition.
When we see this atmosphere then the ideas of Buddha appear to be very relevant.
And in India, Ashoka's life is a great symbol of Buddha's journey through war.
I am fortunate that this great festival of Buddha Purnima is celebrated through the United Nations on Vesak Day.
This year he is going to be in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will have an opportunity to pay tributes to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
We will get an opportunity to renew their memories.
My dear countrymen, in India, there has always been an attempt to move forward with the same mantra of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'.
And especially for our neighbouring countries.
This is a great example of our commitment towards South Asia.
Text of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 26th March 2019.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar. Most of the families in all parts of the country will be busy in the examinations of their children.
Those who have completed their exams will have a lighter environment and those families who will be in the exams will be worried a little bit now.
But at this time, I will only say that listen to what I have told the students in Mann Ki Baat last time.
Those interactions will definitely help you during the exam.
Today is 26th March.
26 March is Bangladeshs Independence Day.
A historic fight against injustice, an unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
On this important day, I convey my best wishes to the citizens of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day and wish that Bangladesh proceed, develop and assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development in this entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are our shared heritage.
The National Anthem of Bangladesh is also composed of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
It is interesting to note that Gurudev Tagore was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913 but also the British who conferred the Nighthood Award.
Three days ago, on the 23rd of March, the British had hanged Bhagat Singh and his colleague Sukhdev and Rajguru. And we all know the incident on the 23rd of March. It was satisfying to serve Mother Bharati on the face of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru. There was no fear of death.
All the dreams of life came true in the sacrifice of the freedom struggle of Mother India.
And these three heroes are still an inspiration for all of us.
We cannot ordinarily mention the saga of sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
And the entire British Sultanate was afraid of these three young men.
However, the British were worried about how to move ahead.
It was only then that we had to be hanged on the 24th of March but we were hanged on the 23rd of March.
Hanging was done with theft, which is not usually done.
And then he was taken to Punjab by the British to burn his body quietly.
A few years ago, when I got the opportunity to visit that place for the first time then I used to feel a kind of wave on that land.
And I will definitely tell the youth of the country that whenever they get the opportunity, whenever they go to Punjab, they must visit the memorial of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
This was the period when the scale and intensity of freedom were increasing.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired many youths for the armed revolution. Just a hundred years ago, on the 10th of April, on the 11th of April, Mahatma Gandhi had performed Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary year of the Champaran Satyagraha.
In the freedom movement of India, Gandhi's thoughts and Gandhi's style were reflected in Champaran for the first time.
This was a major turning point in the entire freedom movement.
Especially in terms of the method of struggle, in this period, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Satyagraha of Kheda, the struggle of the mill-workers in Ahmedabad, the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's thoughts and work culture was visible.
Gandhi returned from abroad in 1915, and in 1991 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cant evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image that Mahatma Gandhi had in our minds.
Imagine a man who came back to India in 1915, a period of just two years
Neither the country knew him nor he was impressed. It was just the beginning.
We can guess how hard they had to face at that time and how hard they had to work.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such a movement where Mahatma Gandhi's association skills, the ability to test Mahatma Gandhi's pulse of the Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi's actions against the British rule by organising, inspiring and bringing the poorest of the poor to the field for struggle, show this amazing spirit.
And that is why we feel the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi in this form.
But if we think about Gandhi 100 years ago, this Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study for any person who started his public life.
We can learn from how to start a public life, how to work hard and how Gandhi did it.
And it was this time when we hear the names of the great leaders of the country, when Gandhi had sent Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani ji and all those people to the villages.
By connecting with the people, the way people were working, they learnt to paint the work with the color of freedom.
And the British could not understand what the manner in which this Gandhi Ji was and the struggle continued and both of them continued together.
Gandhi knew that he had made a coin on two sides.
On one side of the coin conflict, on the other hand, Creator.
On the one hand, you have to fill the jails while on the other hand you have to devote yourself to constructive work.
There was a very wonderful balance in Gandhi's style of work.
What is the word Satyagraha, what can be the meaning of disagreement, what is non-violence against such a great Sultanate? Gandhi established a new concept not only with words but with a successful experiment.
The desire for this change, the effort for this change, of the 125 crore Indians, is the same which will lay the strong foundation for a New India.
New India is neither a government programme nor a political party electoral system nor a project.
This is the feeling that 1.25 billion Indians together want to build a grand India.
There is a hope, a hope, a resolve and a desire in the minds of 1.25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, if we try to find out what is happening in the society, in a sensitive and sensitive manner by going away from our lives, if we try to understand what is happening around us, then we will be surprised to know that lakhs of people, apart from their own duties, are doing something for the society, for the oppressed, the deprived, the poor and the distressed.
And he does penance like a penance servant, he does meditation.
Many people go to hospitals on a daily basis and help patients.
Many people who know that they run for blood donation immediately .
There are many people who worry about their food when they are hungry.
Our country is a multi-faceted country.
Public service is the same Lord service, this mantra is in our blood.
If we look at it as a collective, if we look at it as a collective, then we will find out what kind of great power this is.
When it comes to a New India, it is very natural to criticize, contemplate, and see it from a different perspective.
But it is true that if the 1.25 billion Indians take a pledge, decide the path to accomplish the resolution, and step by step then the dream of a New India - 1.25 billion Indians can be fulfilled in front of our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all things are done only through budget, government projects or government funds.
If every citizen resolves to follow the traffic rules and regulations, if every citizen resolves to fulfill his responsibilities with full sincerity and honesty then every citizen resolves that if I do not use petrol and diesel in my life for a day in a week then what a big change can happen.
What is to be said is that every citizen must follow his civic religion and perform his duties.
This can be a good beginning of a New India by itself.
My dear countrymen, today I also want to thank you.
In the last few days, an atmosphere has been created in our country, a large number of people have participated in the Digital Payments and Digi-dhan movement.
There has also been an increase in the number of transactions that can take place without cash.
Even the poorest of the poor is trying to learn and gradually people are moving towards doing business without cash.
Since demonetization, there has been a significant increase in the number of digital payments since demonetization.
It has been only 2-8 months since the launch of BHIM App but nearly 1.5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption. Can 1.25 billion citizens resolve to do 2.5 billion digital transactions in a year
We have announced in the budget.
For 1.25 billion countrymen, if they want to do this, they dont have to wait for one year, they can do it in six months.
If we want to pay the fee of Rs.2500 crores digital transactions then we will not fill the cash if we want to pay the fee of the school, we will digitally pay if we want to travel in the railways, if we want to travel in the airplane and if we buy medicines then we will make digital payments, if we run cheap ration shops then we will make digital arrangements.
We can do this in our daily lives.
You do not have a imagination, but you can serve the country with a great service and you can become a brave soldier in fighting black money and corruption.
A few days ago, a number of DigiDhan Melas have been organized for public education.
There is a resolution of 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have already been completed.
It also had a reward scheme.
About 12.5 lakh people have received this reward.
70,000 people have received the reward for their traders.
And everyone has pledged to take this work forward.
And the DigiDhan Mela is scheduled to end on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, as it was decided many times earlier.
After the completion of 100 days, the last major event is going to be held.
There is also a provision for big drones.
I believe that in whatever time we have saved Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary, we should propagate BHIM App.
We can contribute to how cash transactions take place, how to reduce transactions with notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time I seek suggestions from the people for Mann Ki Baat, suggestions from all sides come up.
But I have seen that there has always been an appeal to the people for cleanliness.
I want to talk to you about my mind.
I want to say that people will have to understand the importance of cleanliness.
I pass through a river every day, in which people throw a lot of waste and pollute the river.
That river reaches my house flowing from the ripps bridge.
It has taken off from the river and in many other areas and many people have talked about it but it has not benefited.
And the good thing is that the Gayatri is also expressing her anger, advising me and at the same time saying that she made many efforts but she failed.
This has led to awareness and swachhata movement.
Every human being has been positively involved in it.
It has also taken the form of a movement.
The hatred towards dirt is also increasing.
Be it awareness, active participation or movement, everyone has their own importance.
But they are associated with the habits associated with the cleanliness movement.
This movement is a movement to change the habits. This movement is a movement to create the habits of cleanliness.
This movement can be organized collectively.
It is difficult to do but it has to be done.
I believe that this sentiment has been awakened in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students and the youth and this itself is a sign of good results.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat programme, I will tell all those people who are listening to Gayatri, that this message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since the beginning, I have been receiving a lot of suggestions on one thing and most of the people have expressed concern about the wastage of food.
We know that we are eating more than required in the family and in the community kitchens.
Whatever we see, we take everything in the bag and we can't eat it.
We cant eat half of the plate that we fill in and walk with it only.
Have you ever thought about the damage that we give up on food
Have you ever thought that if we do not waste food, some can fill the stomach of the poor
Although some efforts are being made to someone, depression on this subject is a social evil.
It is injustice to the poor.
I am not urging much on this issue, but I want to increase awareness.
His life inspires us not to waste food.
The more we eat, the more we eat.
This is the kind of solution for the change.
And those who are aware of the health of the body always say - Keep some stomach empty, keep some plates empty.
We are also familiar with the word depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are suffering from mental depression.
The problem is that there are such people around us but we are unable to recognize them and perhaps we tend to hesitate to talk openly on this subject.
Those who are suffering from depression also do not speak because they themselves also feel ashamed about it.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not a disease that cannot get rid of it.
For this, there is a need to create a psychological environment and the first mantra to come out of it is that it needs a expression instead of a depression.
Talk openly with your friends, friends, parents, brothers and sisters, and teachers about what you are feeling.
Sometimes there is a feeling of loneliness and especially to the students living in hostels.
Families are big and we live together, so that there is no chance of depression.
However, I would like to tell my parents that sometimes you have seen that your father or daughter or any member of the family, who is sitting here with everyone, is eating and saying - 'I will not speak now, I will fall, I will not go to the table'.
You should understand that this is the first step towards depression.
If he does not like to live in a group and he lives in a single corner then he should always keep in mind that it should not happen.
This is the best solution.
And depression is the reason for mental and physical disorders .
Just as diabetes is the host of every disease, depression also eliminates our ability to survive, to fight, to venture and to decide.
Your friends, your family, your campus and your environment together can stop you from going into depression and if you have gone then you can come out of it very soon.
Help with your mind, share their happiness and sorrows. You will feel that your inner pain will end.
If you try to understand their pain and serve them with a sense of service, then a new self-confidence will develop within you.
Connecting with others, serving others and selflessly will lighten your minds.
Yoga is also a good way of keeping the mind healthy.
Yoga helps a lot to get rid of stress, to get rid of stress and to move towards a happy ending.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga and this is the third year of the same.
All of you make preparations and celebrate Yoga festival in lakhs of groups.
If you have any suggestion on 3rd International Day of Yoga then send me through mobile app.
Whatever song and poetry can be composed about yoga, it should be easily explained to the people.
But apart from work, women also have special responsibilities.
They also take care of family responsibilities and cooperate in family economic responsibilities, which sometimes causes injustice to their newborns.
The Government of India has taken a very important decision to increase the maternity leave to 26 weeks, from 12 weeks earlier.
There are only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this regard.
If this happens then these children will grow up and become the valuable reserves of the country.
It will also improve the health of mothers and will be an important decision for this.
This will benefit about 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
May the life of these great men continue to inspire us, and may we fulfil the resolution of a New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada is a festival of new year. Best wishes to all of you for this new year.
This is the best time to harvest crops after the spring season and the farmers will get the fruits of their hard work.
Nine years are celebrated in different parts of the country.
Mann Ki Baat (2nd digit)
Flowers blossom.
Not only the flowers, the fruits on the branches of the tree are visible shining in the sun.
The fruits of the summer season -LRB- mango -RRB- also appear in spring .
On the other hand, yellow flowers of mustard in the field give hope to the farmers.
The flower of banyan tree indicates the arrival of a holi .
Amir Khusro has beautifully described the moments of change in the weather.

The festivals of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivratri and Holi brighten the lives of people.
In an atmosphere of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are going to bid farewell to Phagan last month and are ready to welcome the new month of Chaitra.
It is a coincidence of the last two months of spring.
First of all, I thank millions and millions of citizens of the country for inviting suggestions for Mann Ki Baat.
Several people are not aware of the achievements of ISRO and therefore he said, I would like to share some information about 104 satellites and the Interceptor Missile.
Mr. Shavkat Mirziyoyev thanked you for the commendable work done by you people in this regard.
Whether it is to eradicate poverty, to prevent diseases, to connect with the world, to provide knowledge and wisdom, Technology Science has made its place everywhere.
15th February 2019 is a proud day in the life of India.
Our scientists have made India proud of the world.
And we all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions in the last few years.
Recently, after the success of the Mars mission on Mars, ISRO has created a world record in the field of space.
And it is also a matter of happiness that this is the 38th successful launch of PSLV.
It is a historic achievement not only for ISRO but also for the entire India.
This cost-effective space programme of ISRO has become a wonder for the whole world, and the world map has lauded the success of India's scientists.
Brothers and sisters, One of the 104 satellites is extremely important.
Cartosat-2D is India's satellite and it will help in mapping the trapped resources, infrastructure, development assessment and planning of Urban Development.
My farmer brothers and sisters in particular, the water resources in the country, how it can be used, how it should be taken care of, this new satellite will help a lot in this regard.
As soon as our satellites were launched, we also sent some photographs.
It has started its work.
It is also a matter of great happiness for us that this entire campaign has been led by our young scientists and our women scientists.
Such a strong partnership of youth and women is a proud moment for the success of ISRO.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the nation.
The less we congratulate these scientists and their entire team.
And that is India's security, India has achieved a great achievement in this regard.
This is not a big debate at this time, but the focus of Mr.
India has also successfully tested the ballistic interceptor missile in the field of defence.
The Interception Technology Missile successfully fired the enemy missile at a height of approximately 100 kilometers from the ground during its trial.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security.
And its specialty is that even if a missile hits India at a distance of 2000 kilometers, then this missile will destroy it in space itself.
We are delighted to see a new technology, a new scientific achievement.
And scientists have played a major role in the development journey of human life.
And a person with a unique intellect does not allow a curiosity to remain in the form of a curiosity. He also raises questions, finds new inquiries, creates new curiosity.
And this curiosity becomes the reason for new inventions.
He used to sit on his leg until he got the answer.
And if we observe the journey of development for thousands of years then we can say that this journey of development of human life will never end.
Full break is impossible.
The effort to know the universe, the laws of the universe, the minds of the human beings is continuously going on.
It generates new science and new technology.
And every technology, every new science has given rise to a new era.
My dear young friends, when we talk of the hard work of science and scientists, I have often said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should get attracted to science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
The scientists of today become the reason for a permanent change in the lives of generations to come.
Recently, NITI Aayog and Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a very unique kind of competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
An invitation was invited for societal innovation.
To identify, showcase, inform, and disseminate such research to the common man about how to do it and how to do it commercially. And I have seen how many important things have been done.
Many a times, the problem also reflects the importance of science for solving it.
When there was a rain in Mumbai in the year 2005, when it was rained, when there was flooding in the sea, there was a lot of trouble, there was a crisis, and when there was a natural crisis, the first crisis came to the poor.
The two brothers worked very diligently towards it, and they developed a house that protects the people from such a crisis, protects them from flooding and prevents water-borne diseases.
And our society also becomes technology-based.
Systems also become technology-based.
In a way, technology is becoming an inseparable part of our lives.
A few days ago, there was a lot of importance on DG-Dhan.
Slowly people are coming out of the check and moving towards the fuel currency.
In India too, digital transactions are growing at a rapid pace.
Especially, the younger generation has started having the habit of making digital payments through their mobile phones.
I consider it a greetings.
In our country, the Lucky Grahak Yojana Digidhan Vyapar Yojana has received huge support in the past few days.
It has been almost two months since 15 thousand people get a reward of Rs.1000 per day.
And through these two schemes, an initiative to make digital payments in India a mass movement has been welcomed across the country.
And it is a matter of happiness that till now 10 lakh people have been rewarded under the DigiDhan scheme, more than 50 thousand traders have been rewarded and more than 150 crore rupees have been given to those people who have taken forward this great campaign.
The highest number of consumers under this scheme are those who have received a reward of Rs 1 lakh.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received a reward of fifty thousand rupees.
Be it farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, housewives or students, everyone participate in this scheme with great enthusiasm.
Shri Santosh ji from Mysuru wrote on Narendra Modi App that he received a reward of Rs. 1,000 under the Lucky Grahak Yojana.
But I should tell you that he has written the most important thing.
He said, I received a reward of Rs. 1000 and at that time I came to know that a poor elderly woman had a fire at her house.
When the goods were burnt, I felt that the reward I received was probably due to the rights of this poor elderly mother, so I gave them thousands of rupees.
You have done a very inspiring job.
Every moment of our ups and downs keeps us aware of these digital things.
They keep speaking with such enthusiasm and also inspire others.
I would urge the countrymen, especially the youth of the country, to take advantage of this Lucky Grahak Yojana or the DigiDhan Vyapar Yojana, to become the ambassadors of the country.
You can take it forward and in a way it is a work that is against corruption.
In a way, you are a soldier of ethics.
You know that when hundred days of Lucky Grahak Yojana are over, on 14th April Dr.
It is a memorable day.
On 14th April, there will be multiple price drops of Rs.
It's about forty-five days left.
Can you do one thing by remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Recently, the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar was celebrated.
Recalling them, you must teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App.
Learn about how transactions take place, especially the small traders around you.
This time on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and the BHIM App, I would like to say this thing with special significance.
For the last two-three months, this movement has been successful in several townships, villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture is a major contributor to the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village gives strength to the economic speed of the country.
I want to tell you a lot of happiness today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have filled the stocks of food with hard work.
A record foodgrain production has been made this year due to the hard work of the farmers in our country.
Every sign is saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time, crops have been sown in the fields that every day it seemed that Pongal and Baisakhi are harvested today.
This year, more than 2700 lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country.
This is 8 more than the last record in the name of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I also want to thank the farmers because they should cultivate different pulses keeping in mind the traditional crops as well as the poor of the country because pulses also provide the highest protein to the poor.
I am glad that the farmers of my country heard the voice of the poor and planted pulses in about 2.25 lakh hectares of land.
This is not only the production of pulses but also the biggest service to the poor of my country, which has been done by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters of my country deserve special thanks for the manner in which the farmers of my country worked hard and made record by working hard.
My countrymen, this is something going on in the direction of cleanliness by the government, society, institutions, organizations, people in our country.
In a way, everyone has somehow been seen becoming aware of the awareness about cleanliness.
And in Warangal of Telangana state, there was not only a seminar in the closed rooms but also an experiment to know what the importance of cleanliness is.
Toilet Fight Importing Exercise was organized in Hyderabad from 1-18 February.
It was cleaned by evacuating toilet patterns of 6 houses and officials themselves have shown that twin pit toilet has not been used and can be used again.
He also showed how comfortable toilets with new technology are and there is no inconvenience in emptying the toilets. There is no hesitation in it, no hesitation in it. Those who are psychological barriers also do not fall prey to it.
And we can clean a toilet in the same way that we can clean it.
And as a result of this effort the media of the country has given a lot of importance to it and it is natural that when an IAS officer cleans the toilet then it is natural for the country to concentrate on it.
And from the toilet pit that is clean, which we consider as garbage, but if we look at it from the point of view of fertilizer, it is equivalent to a black gold.
We can see what is from waste to wealth.
And this has been accomplished.
For the family of six members, a standard twin pit toilet model is filled in about five years.
After this, the waste can be easily removed and reducted into another pit.
In six to twelve months, the waste deposited in the pit gets completely decompositioned.
These decomposed waste is very safe in handling and most importantly in terms of fertilizer usage is NPK.
Farmers are very well familiar with the NPK.
And now a special program is being organized in Doordarshan.
The more things will be highlighted in it, the more will it be beneficial.
Various departments of the government also consider Swachhta Pakhwada.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development along with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs - Tribal Affairs Ministry will take up this Swachhta Campaign.
And in the second fortnight of March, two more Ministries - Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation - will also carry forward the Swachhata Campaign in the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever a poor citizen of our country does something good, the whole country feels a new energy and self-confidence is high.
We all welcomed the exhibition put up by our divyang players at the Rio Olympics.
In this month of the Blind T-20 World Cup finals, India defeated Pakistan and became the world champion for the second time in a row.
The country is proud of the achievements of these divyang friends.
I have always believed that the Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, they are determined, they are brave, they are determined.
Every time we get to learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, the women of our country are not lagging behind.
They are moving ahead in a step by step and are bringing glory to the country through their achievements.
In the last few days, our women players won the Silver Medal in the Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy.
My best wishes to all those players.
8th March marks the World Women's Day.
In India too, girls should be given importance as well as increased awareness and sensitivity towards their family and society.
The 'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao' movement is progressing at a rapid pace.
Today, it has not only been a government programme, it has become a mission of social compassion and public education.
During the last two years, this program has connected common people.
This burning issue has forced people to think in every corner of the country and the old practices that have been going on for years have changed in the minds of people.
When we get the news that the festival was celebrated on the birth of a child, it gives us immense pleasure.
In a way, a positive attitude towards girls is becoming a cause of social acceptance.
I have heard that under a special campaign in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, child-birth has been banned.
More than 15 children have been prevented so far.
The district administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand girls under Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to the Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao scheme and besides organizing Gram Sabhas, the district administration is making every effort to ensure that the orphan girls get adopted, their education and education.
In Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being run for the education of children from every village, every home, under the Har Ghar Dacca program.
Rajasthan has launched its 'Apna BachaApnaVidyalaya' campaign to re-enter the drop-out female students from schools and motivate them to pursue studies.
I mean to say that this movement of 'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao' has taken many forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement.
New ideas are associated with it.
It has been moulded as per local needs.
I consider it a good sign.When we celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we have the same feeling.
Women are powerful, they are the women of India, they are not equal, they are equal officers. My dear countrymen, you get an opportunity to talk something at different times in Mann Ki Baat.
I get to know a lot from you.
What is happening on earth, what is happening in the minds of the villages and the poor, it reaches me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your contribution.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
In the past, we have celebrated many festivals.
Shri Krishna Janmotsava was celebrated in the entire India yesterday.
And everyone can find solutions to the present problems from Shri Krishna's life.
Sometimes we experience something new, that is, innovation in everything.
And that is why today when I am talking to you, my attention goes towards two Mohans.
Sudarshan Chakra bearing Mohan, thousands of years ago, had used his wisdom, his duty, his ability and his thinking to avoid war, to avoid war.
And Charkhadhari Mohan too chose such a path, to save the human values for freedom, and to give strength to the essence of personality, to the freedom struggle, and this was a turning point that the whole world was surprised, even today.
Whether it is the importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge, or the importance of laughing and making progress in life, all these things can be learnt from the message of Lord Krishna.
Today, while talking about festivals, India is preparing for another big festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but all over the world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Those who gave a new dimension to human history, set new records.
One thing has always been associated with Mahatma Gandhi, in a way it has become a part of his life.
Anyone was always present at the event, whenever and wherever required, to serve Mahatma Gandhi.
He not only emphasized the importance of service but also gave the same emphasis on the spirit associated with it.
We can understand this very well from Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, society, human beings and humanity were all about it.
Be it the Finix Farm in Africa, the Tolstoy Farm, the Sabarmati Ashram, or the Wardha Ashram, he emphasized on the unique social promotion, community mobility in all places.
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to bow down to several important places associated with the venerable Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi Ji also emphasized the concept of 'Sangh' with the spirit of service.
Social service and social welfare, community service and community mobility are the feelings that we can bring down in our daily routine.
In fact, this is a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, a true Karmali.
No countrymen.
And collectiveness has its own strength.
All these events of Gandhi 2019 should include mass participation and service.
Why don't we come out with the whole crowd
If we have a team of football players, I will not only play football but will also do a lot of service in accordance with the Gandhi ideals.
You can do a lot, share old books and spread knowledge to the poor.
And I believe that perhaps 130 crore Indians have 130 crore ideas and 130 crore ventures.
Be it the Sadbhavana, the Sadbhavana, the Sadbhavana, the Saubhagya and the whole of it is served with dedication and this too is done for the feeling of self- happiness, a unique pleasure.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I had visited Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha in the freedom struggle, Dandi is a very important turning point.
I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi of Dandi.
I urge you to visit one place or the other associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
It can be anywhere.
Whether it is Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Wardha Ashram or be it related to Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
At the same time, you should also write two or four speeches expressing your feelings.
Several events, competitions, exhibitions are also organized in the coming days.
But in this context, one thing is very interesting, which I would like to share with you.
Venice Byal is a well-known art program where artists from all over the world gather.
This time, a very interesting exhibition related to the memories of Gandhiji has been organized at the India Pavilion at Venice Biennial.
The pictures of Haripura were specially interesting in it.
You might remember that in Haripura, Gujarat, where Subhas Chandra Bose had been elected as the President, that event was also included in the history.
Gandhiji wanted them to showcase the lifestyle of the people of India through art and display their art work during the session.
This is the same Nandlal Bose whose artwork adorns our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
And his art equipment has made Nandlal Bose immortal along with the Constitution.
Nandalal Bose visited the villages near Haripura and then created some art works depicting the life of rural India.
There was a lot of discussion in Venice about priceless artefacts.
Once again, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I hope to make a pledge from all Indians.
For the country, for the society, something or the other should be done.
And this will be a good and sincere tribute to Bapu, the sons of Mother India, you might remember that in the last few years, we have been running the same Swachhta Hi Seva campaign across the country for nearly two weeks before October 2nd.
This time the campaign will start from 11th September.
During the campaign, we will come out of our homes and pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdaan.
We will run a massive campaign of cleanliness at all the public places, be it in the houses, in the streets, in the post offices, in the schools and in the colleges.
This time the emphasis is on plastic.
Similarly, we have to eliminate single-use plastic.
This time, on October 2nd, when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will not only dedicate to him an Open Defecation Free India, but will also lay the foundation for a new mass movement against plastic across the country.
I appeal to all sections of the society, to the people of every village, small towns and cities, to join hands and pray that this year we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti as a riddance from plastic.
Celebrate 2nd October as a special day.
Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti should be a special occasion of Shramdaan.
I appeal to all the municipalities, municipalities, district administration, gram panchayats, all the government-non-government systems, all the organizations, each and every citizen, to make adequate arrangements for collection and storage of plastic waste.
I also appeal to the corporate sector that when all these plastic wastes are collected, then they come forward for proper disposal, and arrangements are made for disposal.
It can be recycled.
This can fuel it.
In this way, we can also complete the task of safe disposal of plastic waste by this Diwali.
Just a pledge is required.
There is no need to look at this for inspiration.
What could be a greater inspiration than Gandhi
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit scriptures, in a way, are gems of knowledge.
We can find out what we need in life.
Recently, my contact with them has come down.
But earlier I had a lot of contact.
Today, I want to touch a very important point with a Sanskrit Subhashita.
And those are the things written centuries ago, but how important is it even today
There is a good definition and he has said: , , , : , : , : , : , , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , : , , : , : , , : , , : , , : , , : , : ) : , : , : , : , , : , : , : , : , : , : , , : , , : , ,
The imbecile stone is called Ratna.
In our culture, food is very important.
In fact, it has also transformed the knowledge of food into science.
A balanced and nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and new-borns, because they are the foundation of the future of our society.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once I was brought to my notice.
In Nasik, a mass movement has become a mass movement of rich rice.
The Anganwadi workers have been collecting foodgrains during the harvest days.
These grains are being used to prepare fresh food for children and women.
In a way, the donor becomes a conscious citizen, a social worker.
After that, he becomes a soldier of this movement and becomes a soldier of this movement.
All of us have heard about the food festival in every corner of India.
This is done when the child starts feeding solid food for the first time.
This is a very beautiful initiative that can be adopted anywhere.
In many states, people are running daily food camps.
If someone in the family has a birthday, a good day or a memory day, then the family members go to the Anganwadi by making nutritious food, delicious food, go to school and the family members themselves serve, feed, share their happiness, and increase happiness.
There is a wonderful union of service and joy.
Friends, There are many small things that can help our country to fight an effective battle against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, both the poor and the happy families are suffering from malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as POSHAN Abhiyaan across the country.
I had never imagined that I would be a place in the hearts of the youth of our country and the world in this manner.
I had never thought about the diversity that our country and the youth of the world pay attention to.
I had never thought that there would be a chance in my life to touch the young people around the world.
And it is possible that I had gone to Bhutan last week.
I have seen that whenever I got the opportunity to visit any place as the Prime Minister, the situation in this regard due to the International Yoga Day has become such that whoever meets me and sits in the world, someone asks me a question and answers about Yoga for five-seven minutes.
The Discovery Programme has planned to telecast the program in 165 countries in their language.
Today, when a global brainstorming session is going on about environment, global warming and climate change, I am confident that this episode of Discovery Channel will be of great help in familiarizing the world with the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity of nature in India's cultural journey.
And now people want to know about the steps taken in our country towards climate justice and clean environment.
But there is one more interesting thing that some people ask me with hesitation - Modi ji tell me that you used to speak Hindi and the Beer Greens did not know Hindi, so how did they communicate with you so quickly.
Or, after that, it has been edited.
They ask with a lot of questions.
Go, there is no secret in this.
Many people have this question in their minds so I can reveal this secret.
It's not a secret.
In fact, technology has been extensively used in interactions with Bear Grylls.
A small cordless device was installed in the ear of Bear Grylls and it was used in English.
However, I used to say that Hindi, but it used to be English, and because of this, communication became easier and this is the best of technology.
After this show, a large number of people have come to talk about the Jim Corbett National Park.
You too must visit places related to nature, wildlife and nature.
I have said this thing earlier as well and I would like to emphasize upon you that in your life, I must visit the Isan Bharat.
The world within you will expand.
From the Red Fort on 15th August, I had urged all of you to visit at least 15 places in India in the next 3 years.
That too, for the purpose of 100 per cent tourism, go to 15 such places, look, study, take the family, spend some time there, spend some time there.
A country full of diversity, these variations will also fill you with diversity as a teacher.
Your life will expand.
Your thinking will become widespread.
And trust me that there are such places within India from where you will come back with a new energy, new enthusiasm, new zeal and new inspiration.
Your family will also feel like this.
My dear countrymen, the care and concern of the environment in India is natural.
Last month, I had the privilege of declaring a tiger population in the country.
You know how many tigers are in India
A resolution expressing concern over the declining global tiger population was adopted in the world.
This resolution was to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a new India, that we achieve the goal as early as possible.
We doubled our tiger population in 2019.
Not only the tiger population in India, but also the number of protected areas and community reserves has increased.
When I was announcing the settlement, I was reminded of Girna Singh of Gujarat.
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister there, the habitat of lions in the Gir forest was shrinking.
Their numbers were decreasing.
We took one step after another in Gir.
In 2009, it was decided to abolish the Women Guards.
Structural reforms were undertaken to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk of nature and forest life, we talk of conservation only.
But now you have to move beyond conservation and think about compassion and competition.
We have received very good guidance in this regard in our scriptures.
My dear countrymen, who can forget this historic address of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1983
India's young sannyasins that shook the mankind across the world had left India's glorious identity in the world.
The way Swami Vivekananda ji saw India, the way Swami Vivekananda ji knew the strength of India, let us try to live it.
There is everything inside us, let us come out with self-confidence.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that 2nd August is celebrated as National Sports Day.
On this occasion, Fit India Movement - Fit India Movement will be launched across the country.
My dear countrymen, I will wait for you, on 2nd August, in Fit India, in the POSHAN Abhiyaan in September, and especially for the Swachhata Abhiyan from 11th September to 2nd October and for the complete dedication of plastic waste on 2nd October.
Let us come out with a new hope, a new resolution and a new strength.
My dear countrymen, today this is the same in Mann Ki Baat.
I'll meet you again.
I will wait for your words and your suggestions.
Come, let us all come together to realise the dream of our freedom fighters and the dream of Gandhi - 'Sanitary Happiness, Rejoice and Services'.
Namaskar .
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with great fervor and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
I hope that at every level, every time, the more important rights are given to the rights, the more important tasks should also be given.
It is only on the two sides of our rights and duties that the vehicle of Indias democracy can move at a fast pace.
Tomorrow is the 30th of January, the death anniversary of our revered Bapu.
On 30th January, all of us pay homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country by keeping a silent silence for 29 minutes at 11 o'clock.
As a society, as a country, on 30th January, 2020 at 11.25 pm, it should be a simple tribute.
Why not for 2 minutes but it should also express solidarity, determination and reverence for the martyrs.
There is a natural respect for the army and the security forces in our country.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families for the various gallantry awards.
The awards include various categories like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal etc.
I especially urge the youth that you are active in social media.
You can do one thing This time, the heroes who have received this honor, look for you on the net, write two good sentences related to it and spread it to your colleagues.
When we are aware of their courage, valour and bravery, we are amazed, proud and inspired.
On the one hand, we were all happy with the fervor and enthusiasm of 26 January. At that time, the soldiers of our army in Kashmir who were engaged in the service of the country were brave because of the avalanche.
I respectfully bow down to all those brave soldiers.
My young friends, you know very well that I am constantly conveying Mann Ki Baat.
Jan-February - March - April all these months are a testing month for every family.
At home there are exams for one or two children, but the entire family is under examination.
So I felt that this is the right time to talk to the students friends, talk to their parents and talk to their teachers because for many years wherever I went, the examination was a very big problem.
There is a strange psychological environment in every house where the family is troubled, the students are troubled, the teachers are troubled.
And I always feel that we should get out of this and that is why today I want to talk to the young friends in some detail.
When I announced this topic, many teachers, parents and students sent me a message, asked questions, asked questions, asked about difficulties and on seeing this I came to my mind and today I want to talk to you.
I received a telephone call from the Father of the Nation.
So I want to ask you so much that this atmosphere can not be happy
The nation has asked the question, but this question will be in your minds.
Exams should be an opportunity of happiness in themselves.
We have worked hard for the entire year and now the time has come to show that this should be a festival of hope and enthusiasm.
There are very few people for whom the exam is a pleasure, and for most people the exam is a pressure.
You have to decide whether you will consider it as a matter of happiness or pressure.
The one who believes in happiness will get it and the one who accepts pressure will get over it.
And that is why I am of the opinion that exams are a festival, exams are such that when there is a festival and festivals are celebrated then only those things that are the best in us come out.
The strength of the society is also felt on the occasion.
Generally, we feel how careless we are, but if we look at the arrangements for the 40-45-day Kumbh Mela, then it should be ensured that the people are not inconvenienced about the Make shift agreement and the discipline.
This is the strength of the festival.
Even during exams, a festive atmosphere should be created in the family, friends and neighborhoods.
You will see that this pressure will be converted into happiness.
The festive atmosphere will make us free from stress.
And I would like to urge my parents to prepare a festive atmosphere for the next three-four months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to convert these three-four months into festivals by understanding our traditions and the environment of our family.
And that is why I will tell you, 'Smile More, Secure More'.
You must have seen that when you are happy, you see yourself relaxed, and when you are relaxed, you would easily remember your years old traditions as well.
The entire scenario will be remembered for what the teacher had said in the classroom a year ago.
And you should be aware that the power to re-collate memory is the highest in the relaxation.
If you are in stress then every door gets shut, no one goes inside and does not come out.
The process of thinking stops, which becomes a burden on itself.
You might have noticed in the exam that you remember everything you remember the book, the subject comes to mind, the page reminds one, the page tells you on the top of the page that at the bottom the page also remembers the same.
Why did not I remember it, there was pressure.
But the person who was inside immediately came out and that is, you were released.
And that is why if there is any medicine to recall, then it is a relaxation.
And I say this on the basis of self-realization that if there is pressure, we forget our things and if there is a relaxation, we have never imagined before. And suddenly we remember those things which are of great use.
And it is not that you do not have the knowledge, you do not have the information, nor have you worked hard.
But when there is tension, your knowledge, your information gets suppressed and your tension dominates it.
And that is why it is necessary that A Happy Mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we are not able to see exams in the right perspective.
It seems as if he is a question of life and death.
The exams that you are going to pass are the exams that you have studied throughout the year.
This is not the test of your life.
It is not an exam for how you have lived your life, how you want to live your life.
You might have had the opportunity to pass through many tests in your life, in addition to the exams that were given in the classroom.
Therefore, with the success and failure of life, get rid of the burden of taking exams.
Our former President, Dr.
A.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a very inspiring example.
Some of you have sent a question to me: Today, the biggest challenge before education is that the education test has become centered on.
The quality has become all the more important.
This has not only increased the competition, but has also increased the stress in the students.
So I want to know your thoughts about this current direction of education and its future.
Although he himself has given the answer, but he wants me to put my point here.
Marks and marksheets are very limited.
There is no such thing in life.
How much knowledge you have gained, life runs on it.
Whether you have tried to live with what you know or not, life is on it.
The sense of mission that you have received, the sense of mission that is yours, whether there is any synergy between your mission and your mission or not, is life on them.
If you trust in such matters, the Marks standing tails will follow you, you will not need to run behind Marks.
In life, knowledge will come to you, skills will work, self-confidence will work, resolve will work.
You tell me that there will be a doctor from your family and every family member will go to a family doctor who is a family doctor.
No one of you might have asked his family doctor how many of them had passed.
Nobody has asked .
You just felt that as a doctor, you are getting the benefit and you start serving them.
To fight against any big case if you go to any lawyer then do you see that lawyer ' s mark sheet ?
You see its experience, its knowledge and its successful journey.
And that is why the stress on these qualities stops us from moving in the right direction.
But it does not mean that I just say that there is no learning.
It is necessary to use it for our testing.
It is necessary to know where I was yesterday and where I am today.
And if you look at your own life from close quarters then you will notice that if you look at the qualities of yourselves, you will find short-cuts, you will catch some select items and focus on them.
But if you focus on merit then gradually you shrink yourselves and you limit yourself to a certain area only to get the marks.
So, it can happen that despite being talented in the exams, sometimes fails in life.
Richa ji has also said this: Competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
In fact, competition does not come in the way of leading a life, competition comes in the way of life, and when I say competition then it means competing with myself.
How to be better tomorrow from tomorrow
A special feature of the lives of most of the successful players is that they compete.
Let us take the example of Shriman Sachin Tendulkar.
Friends in every field of life, when you are passing the exam, think that if you are able to study peacefully for two hours then you can read it for three hours.
Mr.
Sundarji has expressed his feelings about the role of parents.
He said that the role of the parents is very important in the examination.
He writes: My mother was not confused, yet she sat with me and called me an advocate of mathematics.
Because mothers are aware about the future of their children, they are active, they make things easier.
Once you learn to accept, most of the problems will end there.
Every parent will feel or feel that.
The problem is at the root of the problem as compared to parents and teachers.
It opens the way for solutions to problems that are acceptable.
Expectations make it difficult to wait.
Adopting the state provides an opportunity to open new avenues.
And that is why accept those things.
I was there at that time and I saw that he did not ask a question about his health by coming there.
He did not talk about the situation, the disease and the situation when he was sitting there.
In the first 2-4 minutes, the atmosphere was eased.
We often go to a sick person and scare him with the disease.
I will tell the parents that sometimes we do the same with the children.
Have you ever thought that during the exam you will give children the environment of laughter ?
You see, the weather will change.
I have received a phone call from a wonderful person.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I can't call my name because I had done something about it in my childhood.
And when I tried to pass by copying it then I was caught in it and because of me many friends around me were in trouble.
You must have often heard of it. Do not steal or steal.
I would like to tell you the same thing again.
Once there is a habit of stealing, there will never be a desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you reach ?
If you prepare for the exam then perhaps you will not need a copy.
My first question is whether we can reduce the stress during our examination and my second question is whether or not the examination looks like the burden is not light
If we want to develop all-round development then there is a life outside books as well and it is very big.
This is the time to learn and live.
Someone will say that I will pass all these exams first and then play.
So it is impossible.
So the rest of the body should also get physical activity .
Have you ever thought that when all this is in front, take two moments out and look towards the sky, look at the trees and plants, lighten your minds.
By doing so, you will come back to your room and your books with a freshness.
Whatever you are doing, keep it going for a while, stand up, go to the kitchen, look for the things you like and if you get the price of the biscuits then it will be better.
Why not just for five minutes, but take a little break.
There is no need to stay locked in a room for deep breathing.
Go under the open sky, go to the terrace, breathe in deeply for five minutes and then re-hear.
You will feel that the body will become absolutely light and the body will not only be lightened but will also lighten the mind.
Some people think that we will wake up till late in the night. We will read more and more.
Take as much sleep as is needed by the body .
The freshness will come.
Your efficiency will increase significantly.
When I hold meetings on the occasion of election, sometimes my voice sits down.
I came to meet a folk singer.
They asked me - how many hours do you sleep ?
He gave me a dose of medicine.
So, the more we understand the importance of these things, the more we benefit, the more you see.
But it does not even mean that one keeps lying down .
Without doing so, the people of your family will be disappointed with me.
And the day you come to your mark sheet, you will not see it, I will see it.
This is a very big medicine for keeping the mind, mind and body cautious.
But at the same time, I will also say that do not let the burden be made on what I have said.
I also feel that just as I advise your family and parents not to be over-burdened.
Remembering your resolve, put your trust in yourself and go for examination.
My best wishes are with you.
Make a test and a festival to overcome all odds.
Then there will never be a test.
Take this mantra forward.
Dear Countrymen, February 2019 marks the completion of forty years for the Indian Coast Guard.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has kept its place among the four largest Coast Guard in the world with all its 126 ships and 62 aircraft built in the country.
Last year, in addition to their responsibilities, the people of Coast Guard had undertaken a massive campaign to clean the seashore of our country and thousands of people had joined it.
And very few people know that in our country, not only men but women are also shouldering their responsibilities in a similar manner in the Coast Guard.
Coast Guard is not only the pilot and observer but also the horoscope.
Today, when maritime security is an important topic in the whole world, I congratulate the Indian Coast Guard on its 40th anniversary.
1st February is the festival of Basant Panchami.
spring has been recognized as the best season.
It is the queen of spring season .
The occasion is considered to be an opportunity to worship Vidya.
Not only this, it is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
My Rang De Basanti Chola - this is the inspiration.
My best wishes to the people of our country on the auspicious occasion of Basant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, the All India Radio also fills a new dimension with its imagination.
Since last month, she has started speaking Mann Ki Baat in regional languages immediately after the completion of my Mann Ki Baat.
This has received wide acceptance.
People are writing letters from far and wide.
I congratulate Akashwani for her self-centered work.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar. Best wishes to all of you on Christmas.
This day is an occasion to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Lord Issu said that the poor do not want to be of our benefit, they want to accept it. The Gospel of St. Luke says that Lord Jesus did not just serve the poor, but also preached the service done by the poor and that is the true (real, true) empowerment.
There is a story associated with it which is very popular.
In the conversation, it is said that Lord Jesus was standing near the treasury of a temple.
A lot of rich people came there and donated their blood.
After that a poor widow came and gave two copper coins in donation.
To see this, two copper coins are not called big donations.
It is very natural that there is a curiosity among the devotees present there.
Then Lord Jesus said, This woman has made the most donation because all others have contributed a lot but this woman has donated everything.
Today, 25th December marks the birth anniversary of His Majesty Madan Mohan Malaviya ji.
Malaviya ji, who has awakened the resolve and confidence of the people of India, has given a new direction to modern education.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to launch several development projects in Banaras under the penance of Malaviya ji.
At BHU in Varanasi, His Majesty the King has laid the foundation stone of Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre.
This cancer centre is going to be a boon not only for the people of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is also the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country can never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we honored the country by achieving success in the nuclear energy sector.
Be it a party leader or a Member of Parliament, a Minister or a Prime Minister, Atal ji established an ideal in every role.
On the birthday of Atal ji, I salute him and pray for his good health.
As a worker, I got the opportunity to work with Atal ji.
Many memories of his association are etched in his eyes.
Today, on Christmas Day, as a gift, the people of the country will get the benefits of two schemes.
Secondly, two new schemes are going to be launched for the countrymen.
All over the country, be it villages or cities, be it educated or uneducated, what is the cashless business, or how to buy without money - there is an atmosphere of curiosity everywhere.
Everyone wants to learn from each other.
In order to promote this, to make mobile banking stronger - to adopt the habit of e-payment, the Government of India is launching two new incentive schemes for customers and small traders from today.
One scheme for promotion of customers - Lucky Grahak Yojana and another scheme for promotion of traders - Digidhan Vyapar Yojana.
Today, on the 25th of December, as a gift from the Christmas, 15 thousand people will receive a reward of Rs 1,000 in the form of a reward of Rs 1,000 in the account of 15,000 people. This gift is not limited to just one day today.
Every day, 15 thousand people will receive a reward of Rs. 1,000 each.
In 100 days, lakhs of families will get a gift of crores of rupees, but this reward will only be given when you use mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI, USSD, on the basis of which drones will be made.
With this, there will be one day big draw for such customers in a week, with a reward of lakhs and three months later, on 14th April, Dr.
On Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary, there will be a bumper draw, with crores of rupees being rewarded.
Digidhan Vyapar Yojana is primarily for traders.
Traders themselves connect with the scheme and customers to make their businesses cashless.
Such traders will also be given a separate reward and this reward will be in thousands.
Traders will continue their business and reward them.
This scheme has been made keeping every section of the society, especially the common poor and the lower middle class at the center. Therefore, if someone purchases more than Rs.50 and purchases less than Rs.3000 then those people will get the benefit of this scheme.
Those who buy more than Rs.3000 will not get the benefit of this reward.
Even the poorest of the poor can buy goods from USSD as well as through normal phones and sell them and make payments of rupees, and everyone can become beneficiaries of this scheme.
Even in rural areas, people can buy and sell through AEPS and they can also win the reward.
These 30 crore people can soon become a part of this reward scheme.
I am confident that my countrymen will be interested in this system and the youngsters around you will definitely know about it. You can ask them, they will definitely explain it to you.
You will be able to learn it easily even if you have children in class 10-12 in your family.
This is very easy - the way you send the message of Whatsapp from mobile phones, this is just an easy task.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know that the awareness about how to use technology, how to make e-payments and how to make online payments is increasing rapidly in the country.
Cashless trade, cashless trade has increased by 200 to 300 in the last few days.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to promote this.
And how big this decision is, the traders can put it in a good way.
Traders who do digital transactions, develop online payment mode instead of cash in their businesses, have been allowed to do so.
Everyone has taken this campaign forward in their own way.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Chandrababu Naidu has appointed a committee to consider various projects in this regard.
But I have seen that many state governments have also started and implemented several such schemes in their own way.
Someone told me that the Assam government has decided to give 10 discount on the digital payment of property tax and trade license fee.
The Branches of the Rural Banks which conduct at least two digital transactions of 75 of their customers during the period January to March, will receive a reward of Rs. 50,000 from the Government.
As on 31st March 2019, a reward of Rs. 5 lakh has been announced by the Government for the villages having 100 digital transactions.
Under the Digital Agriculture Shiromani for farmers, the Assam Government has decided to give a reward of Rs. 5000 to 10 farmers, who will get a complete digital payment for the purchase of seeds and fertilizers.
I convey my best wishes to the Government of Assam and to all those who have started this good work.
Many organizations have also made several successful experiments to promote digital purchase among the poor farmers of the village.
I have come to know that GNFC- the Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited- a major fertilizer task, has set up 1,000 PoS machines where fertilizer is sold to farmers and 35,000 farmers have been digitally delivered 5,00,000 fertilizer bags to farmers. And the interesting thing is that in the last two weeks there has been an increase of 2 in the sale of GNFC fertilizer.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, in our system of living, the informal sector is a huge source of income. And most of the people are paid wages because of the hard work, money or wages of the workers.
Where they should get Rs 100, they get 80, they should get 80, they get 50 and they also get other facilities in the health sector like insurance.
But now cashless payment is being done.
The money is being deposited directly into the bank.
In a way, the informal sector has been changing in the formal sector, the exploitation has also stopped, and the payment has also been stopped and it has become possible for the workers, the artisans and the common man to get the compensation.
At the same time, they are also entitled to other benefits as well.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easily available to us.
Countries like India should be at the forefront in this field.
Our youth have made great strides in start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
Our youth should not only be able to strengthen this sector with new ideas, new technology and new methods, but should also be associated with the campaign to get rid of black money and corruption.
A large number of people have pointed out that such a good work, the work of the country's welfare, such a pious work, however, people have also mentioned how Gorakhand is being done, how new ways of finding solutions to the mistakes.
And the third stage is that people have not only supported what is happening, but the fight should move forward, corruption and black money should be destroyed, more stringent measures should be taken for that, there are people who are encouraging and writing.
I am grateful to the countrymen for writing and helping me with all these letters.
Shri Gurumani has written on MyGov: This step to curb black money is commendable.
We are being troubled by the citizens but we are all fighting against corruption and we are happy with the cooperation that we are giving in this fight.
We are fighting against corruption, black money etc. like the armed forces. The same spirit that Gurumani Kevalji wrote is reflected in every corner of the country.
We are all experiencing this.
But it is also true that when the public is suffering, and is suffering, then who is such a person who does not suffer from pain
The more pain you suffer, the more I suffer.
But for a better purpose, for a higher purpose, and for a better purpose, when the work is being done with a good intention, the people of the country stand shoulder to shoulder with those difficulties, with grief and pain.
In fact, these are the people who are the drivers of change.
I also thank people for one more reason for the fact that they have not only faced difficulties but have also given a sensational answer to some people who are trying to mislead the people.
Someone spreading rumours, spelling on the notes is wrong, someone has said that the price of salt has gone up, some have spread rumours, some have to cancel the notes of 2000, 500 and 100 are going to be cancelled again.
I salute this power of the people as well.
My dear countrymen, I can clearly feel that when 1.25 billion Indians are standing with you, nothing is impossible.
The blessings of the people become the blessings of God alone.
I thank and salute the people of the country for participating in this Mahayagya against corruption and black money with great enthusiasm.
There was extensive discussion in the Parliament on the issue of political parties as well as political parties.
Had the Parliament been running, there would have been a lot of discussion.
Those people who are spreading rumours that there is a complete breakdown of the political parties is wrong.
Those who are unable to support open corruption and black money, are always trying to find the government's errors.
This government is for the people.
The government is constantly trying to take feedback from the people.
On the other hand, on the very first day, I had said - "This fight is extraordinary.
What is the strength of those who have been engaged in the black money and corruption business for the past 70 years
Whenever I have decided to deal with such people, they are also adopting new techniques to defeat the government.
I would like to heartily congratulate all my fellow citizens.
How did this become possible .
Let me tell you the secret.
The secret is that I get all these information from the people.
The information that has been received from the government machinery has been manifold more than the citizens of Advaita. And most of us have been successful due to the awareness of the ordinary citizens.
Can a conscious citizen of my country imagine how dangerous he is taking to expose such elements
And most of the information that is being received is mostly successful.
I am confident that an email address given by the government for this purpose can also be sent to those whom you want to give this kind of advice.
You can also send it to MyGov.
There is also a third group of those who write letters, that too in large numbers.
They say: Modi ji will not get tired, will not stop, and take as many tough steps as possible. But once we have taken the path, we will have to reach Manjal.
I am especially grateful to all those who have written such letters because there is a kind of faith and blessings in their letters.
And there is no question of returning to the work with the blessings of 1.25 billion Indians.
We have taken it out and made a multi-pronged Benami Property Act.
The law will also do its work in the coming days.
Our priority is to do whatever is required for the welfare of the country and for the welfare of the people.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat last month too, I had said that despite these difficulties, our farmers have broken the record of last year in planting hard work.
This is a good sign in the field of agriculture.
Be it the labourers of this country, the farmers of this country, the youth of this country, the hard work of all of them is bringing a new color today.
In the past few days, on the economic platform of the world, India has carved out its name in many fields with great pride.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have improved by 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and have improved by 17 places in the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index 2016.
There are many reports in which it has been directed in this direction and India is moving forward at a fast pace.
The President, the Vice President also expressed his open regards.
But even in such circumstances, sometimes some good things happen and then mind gets a lot of satisfaction.
Such an excellent work has been done even in the Parliament, on which the attention of the country has not gone.
Brothers and sisters, Today I feel very proud and happy to share that a bill related to the campaign that was launched by my government regarding the disabled persons has passed in the Parliament.
I also express my gratitude to all the MPs of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for this.
I express my gratitude to crores of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is committed for the Divyangs.
I have also tried to make the campaign more vigilant about it in an individual manner.
I meant that the Divyangjans should get their rights and dignity, which they deserve.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have strengthened our efforts and faith when they have won four medals in the Olympics.
They have not only enhanced the pride of the nation but have also surprised people with their power.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters are also priceless, like every citizen of the country.
Today, I am happy that after the passage of this law in the interest of Divyangjans, there will be more employment opportunities for Divyangjans.
For them, reservation in government jobs has been increased to 4.
Special provisions have also been made for the education, facilities and grievance redressal of the Divyangjans.
You can guess how sensitive the government is for the disabled persons from the fact that in the last two years the central government has organized four thousand three hundred and fifty camps for the disabled persons and distributed aids to 5 lakh 80 thousand divyang brothers and sisters at a cost of Rs 352 crore.
The government has passed a new law in keeping with the spirit of the United Nations.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, there have been reports from the sports field that have made us all proud.
It is very natural for all of us to be proud of being an Indian.
The Indian Cricket Team has won just four in the series against England.
The work of some young players in this has been remarkable.
Virat Kohli of the Test Drought, along with good batting, also led a good leadership.
Off-Spirin R. from the Indian Cricket Team.
Ashwini Kumar Choubey was declared the best cricketer and best test cricketer for the year 2016.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
Even in the field of hockey, very good news came and gave a grand report after fifteen years.
Our junior hockey team won the World Cup.
After 15 years, this opportunity comes when the Junior Hockey team won the World Cup.
Many congratulations to the young players for this achievement.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of the Indian hockey team.
Last month, our women players too performed wonders.
Indias womens hockey team also won the Asian Champions Trophy and a few days ago, Indias womens hockey team won the Asia Cup.
I heartily congratulate all the players in the cricket and hockey team.
Last month, all of us were enjoying Diwali.
Like every year on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border of China to celebrate Diwali with my soldiers.
I have celebrated Diwali in the heights of the Himalayas with the soldiers and soldiers of ITBP.
He was full of emotions and not only this, the message of good wishes sent by the countrymen, it was a wonderful response to the country's security forces in their happiness.
And it is not just that people sent messages but they were connected with the mind.
Someone created a video i.e. almost every house became the outpost of the soldiers.
And whenever I used to see those letters, I was very surprised to know how many ideas are there, how many emotions are there. Mygov thought that some select items should be prepared to make a coffee table book.
Work is underway.
With your contributions, the feelings of the soldiers of the country and the feelings of all of you, your feelings towards the security forces of the country will be integrated into this book.
But the truth is, this time I did not feel like this.
This time it did not seem like that it is a festival and I am not at home.
It seemed as if we are celebrating Diwali with 1.25 billion Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases by 125 crores.
Some time ago, I had come to meet all the Sarpanchs of the villages in Jammu Kashmir.
And with so much love and affection these Sarpanchs of the villages spoke to me and everything touched my heart.
I requested him to go and focus his attention on the future of those children.
Today I am happy that all the Sarpanchs from the Kashmir valley have fulfilled their promise to me and have made everyone aware by going to the villages.
Just a few days ago, when the board was examined, about 95 per cent of the students and students of JK participated in the board examination.
The presence of such a large number of students in the board examinations indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through better future and education.
I would like to congratulate him for this enthusiasm but at the same time I extend my best wishes to his parents, his family members, his teachers and all the village sarpanchs.
Dear brothers and sisters, This time when I asked the people for suggestions on Mann Ki Baat, I can say that everyones suggestions came on one side.
Everyone used to say that we should talk at length about 500 and 1000 notes.
However, on the 8th of November at 8 o'clock in the night, I had discussed about launching a massive campaign to bring about improvement in the country while addressing the nation.
Even at the time when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision was not a general one but it was full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is, the more important it is.
And I had the impression that we would have to face many new challenges in our normal life.
And even then I had said that the decision is so big that it will take 50 days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards the normal situation.
The campaign to get rid of those diseases which we have been facing for seventy years cannot be easy.
I can understand your difficulties and mistakes very well.
But when I see your support, when I see your cooperation, there are many efforts going on to mislead you, even then the incidents that disturb your mind sometimes come out but you have well understood this path of truth and accepted this point of national interest by closing the notes of 500 and 1000 rupees.
And the whole world is watching this decision very closely. Every economist is doing a lot of analysis of this.
The whole world is watching whether India's 1.25 billion Indians will succeed in facing difficulties and challenges.
There may be questions in the minds of the world.
India has only faith in the 125 crore Indians and it is confident that the resolution of the 125 crore Indians will be fulfilled.
And like gold, our country will come out with all kinds of penance and penance and the reason for this is the citizens of this country.
The path to success has also been possible due to you.
Lakhs of bank employees, more than 1.5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank friends, are engaged in this work day and night in one lakh thirty thousand bank branches across the country.
In the midst of a lot of stress, all these people are very calm and working as a yajna for serving the nation.
When we start early in the morning, we do not even know when the night will be there, but everyone is doing it.
And that is why it is clear that India will succeed in this.
And I have seen that in spite of such difficulties, all the people of Bank and Post Offices are working.
And when it comes to the issue of humanity, it takes two steps ahead.
Someone told me that an old brother had an accident in Khandav.
I suddenly needed money.
The matter came to the notice of the local bank employees and I am very happy to know that they have made money to their home, to the elderly people so that they can help in the treatment.
Such a number of cases come out daily in TV, in media, in newspapers, in conversations.
I sincerely thank all the friends who have worked hard and made efforts in this Mahayagya.
It is only when you cross the test.
I clearly remember that the campaign of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was going on and the way the bank employees picked it up on their shoulders and the work that was not done in the last 7-7 years has been done by them.
Today, once again, he has taken up this challenge and I am confident that the resolution of 1.25 billion Indians, the collective strength of all will give a new strength to the nation.
They are looking for illegal ways to save their money.
The sad fact is that he has found a way out of it by using the poor.
Some people are trying to save money by misguiding the poor, by talking about greed and temptations, by putting money in their accounts or by doing some work with them.
I want to tell those people today - whether they want to improve or not your will, whether they follow the law or not, your choice will be to see the law or not.
But please don't let the poor go out of their lives.
Do not do anything so that the name of the poor falls on the record. And later when the check was done, my dear poor people would get into trouble because of your sins.
And there has been such a tough law of Benami property which is being implemented, it will bring a lot of trouble. And the government does not want the countrymen to face any problem.
My name is Ashish Parle.
I am an ordinary citizen of Tirali village, Tirali tehsil, Harda district, Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to give you many examples in Mann Ki Baat that despite suffering inconveniences people have welcomed this tough decision for the betterment of their nation which would increase the morale of the people and bring a cashless system to the fore.
I am very happy that you have stopped the notes of thousand and five hundred.
I speak Yelapappa Velankar from this village of Koppal district of Karnataka.
I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart because you had said good days would come. But no one thought that you would take such a big decision.
Seeing the notes of 500 and 1000 rupees, black money and corrupt people have been taught this lesson.
There will never be a better day for every citizen of India.
I would like to heartily thank you for this thing.
Some things are known through media, through people and through government sources, then the enthusiasm for working increases.
I feel so happy and so proud that what a wonderful capability the common man has in my country
If you go to the ground and get a chance to go through this road then you must pay the money.
And people go there, gather there, and after two-four days when they pass there, they pay the money.
This is the strength of my country which includes the spirit of service, the spirit of sacrifice and honesty.
I used to talk about 'Cha' in the elections and this has reached the global stage.
People from many countries of the world learnt the word CHAMPIONS.
But I did not know that marriage would also take place in the discussion on Chacha.
I came to know that on 17th November, a marriage took place in Surat with a discussion on Chacha.
In Surat, Gujarat, a daughter had given only tea to those who got married and did not spend any other money.
Bharat Maru and Daksha Paramarma of Surat who have contributed to this fight against corruption and black money through their marriage, have inspired them.
I had come late in the night and I used to watch TV, I saw in the news that there is a small village named Dhakia Julie in Assam.
There are tea plantation workers and they get money every week.
What did they do if they got a bond of Rs. 2000
Four women from the neighborhood got together and they bought it all around and paid a sum of Rs.2000, they didn't need a small note because all four of them bought it together and decided that when we meet next week, we will sit and take account.
People are looking for their ways.
And see the change too.
A message from the government has been sent to the people of the tea gardens of Assam saying that we have installed ATMs there.
See, how the lives of the villages are also being transformed.
Some people have immediately benefitted from this campaign.
The country will benefit in the coming days, but some people have benefitted immediately.
Each municipality receives fifty per cent tax on its own.
But this time, due to this decision of 8th, all the people were asked to submit their old notes.
Last year, in 47 urban units, there was a tax of about three and a half thousand crore rupees.
You will be surprised to know that in the same week, 13 thousand crore rupees have been deposited.
Now four times the money has been spent in that municipality, it is natural that there will be an arrangement for sewage treatment and anganwari in the poor population.
There are many such examples in which its direct benefit is also seen.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages and our farmers are a strong link in the economy of our country.
On the one hand, due to these new changes in the economy, every citizen is reforming itself amidst difficulties.
Despite difficulties, the farmers have found a way.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which priority has been given to the farmers and the villages, but there are still difficulties. But I am confident that the farmers who are in trouble, who are always firm in their resolve during natural calamities, will remain firm this time also.
Small traders of our country, who provide employment, also increase economic activity.
In the last budget, we had made an important decision that like big malls, the small shopkeepers in the villages will also be able to do their business round the clock and no law will stop them because I was of the opinion that if the big malls are available 24 hours then why should not the poor shopkeepers in the villages get the opportunity to sell their produce
A major initiative has been taken to provide loans through the Mudra scheme.
Lakhs of crores of rupees have been deposited into the bank accounts of such small people because a large number of people are engaged in small businesses and they are providing a boost to the trade of billions of rupees.
However, it is natural for them to face difficulties due to this decision.
You can also download the Bank App on mobile phones.
You too can install POS machines for credit cards. You also learn how to do business without notes.
Technical roads are safe and fast.
I would like you to help in making this campaign a success and not only do you lead the change but I am confident that you can lead the change.
I am confident that you can work on the basis of this technology in the business of the entire village.
I also want to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot.
There is a salary on paper and it is different when it comes in hand.
Sometimes a person who is standing outside has to pay some part of his salary and in the compulsion of his labour, this exploitation becomes a part of life.
With this new system, we want you to have a bank account, your salary is deposited in your bank, so that the minimum wages are complied with.
Nowadays your mobile phone also works as an e-packaged commodity - you can purchase from the small shops nearby by using the same mobile phone.
Therefore, I appeal to my worker brothers and sisters to be a part of this scheme because in the end, I have taken such a big decision for the poor, farmers, labourers, the deprived and the oppressed people of the country and they should get the benefit of this scheme.
Today I specially want to talk to the youth.
We say with pride in the world that India is a country with 65 of its population below the age of 35 years.
Young people of my country, I know that you must have liked my decision.
I also know that you support this decision.
I also know that you are making sufficient contribution to take this matter forward in a positive way.
But friends, you are my real soldier, you are my true friend.
We have had a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India and take the country to greater economic heights.
Can my youth help me
You will support me and that will not stop.
The experience that you have in today's world is not that much for the old generation.
Probably your parents, aunt and mother-in-law may not be aware of this thing.
You know what the app is, you know what online banking is, you know how to book online tickets.
For you, all these things are very common and you also use them. But the great work that the country wants today, our dream is 'Cashless Society'.
A hundred percent cashless society is not possible, but should India start a "less cash society".
Once we start the Less Cash Society today, the Cashless Society will not be far away and I will see your physical help, your time and your resolve.
And I believe that you should never disappoint me because all of us wanted to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know that for cashless society, there are many opportunities for digital banking or mobile banking today.
Each bank offers online facility.
E-Packet is a simple meaning of ballot.
Several types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards and RuPay cards that were being used after 8th of this month are very rarely.
The poor started using Ru-Pay cards and registered a growth of about 300.
As prepaid cards are available in mobile phones, prepaid cards are available in banks as well.
There is a good platform for doing business through the UPI that you can buy, send money and also get money. And this work is so easy that you can send it to the WhatsApp.
How to send a message on whatsapp today, who will be an illiterate person
Moreover, technology will become so easy that there is no need for a big smart phone for this purpose.
And now the cost of online surcharge has also been abolished. You must have noticed that in 2-4 days the expenditure on such cards has been abolished in the newspaper so that the movement of cashless society gets strengthened.
My young friends, despite all this, there is an entire generation that is untouched by this.
And all of you, as much as I know, are active in this great work.
The way creative message is sent to you on WhatsApp, I see slogan, poems, cases, cartoons, new imaginations all these things. And in the midst of so many difficulties, the power of the generation of our youth, it seems that this is the specialty of this land of India, as the Gita was born in the battlefield at some point of time.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work.
Yes, yes, I say again that I want your help and I am confident that millions of young people of my country will do this work.
Do one thing, from today itself resolve to become a part of the cashless society itself.
All the technologies that are available to spend online on your mobile phones are available.
Not only this, it takes at least half an hour, two hours to spend at least 10 families using this technology, how to use this technology, how to download the app and how to spend the money in your account How to provide it to the shopkeeper
How to teach shopkeepers and how to do business
You have to take the lead by voluntarily giving up this cashless society, a campaign to get out of the circle of this currency, a campaign to get the country out of the clutches of corruption, a campaign to get rid of black money, a campaign to get people out of the problems and problems.
Once the people of the country are taught how to use Ru-Pay cards, then the poor will be able to bless you.
If the common man is educated, he will probably get rid of all the worries. And if all the youth of India get involved in this work then I do not believe that it will take much time.
Within a month, we will be able to become a modern India in the world and you can do this through your mobile phones.
You can do it by visiting 10 houses per day and adding 10 houses per day.
I invite you, come, not just support, but we will become an army of change and bring about change.
We will carry forward this fight to make the country free from corruption and black money. And there are rich countries in the world where the youth of the country has changed the life of the nation. And this thing will be considered by the youth who bring about changes, they revolutionize the country.
Kenya, she picked up the bead, used the technology of a mobile system called M-PESA, and today almost all the trade in this region of Africa has come to Kenya.
This country has made a big revolution.
My young friends, I once again request you to carry forward this campaign.
I invite you from every school, college, university, NCC, NSS, as a community as well as individual as a community.
We will take this forward.
We have got an opportunity to serve the nation better, not to miss the opportunity.
Dear sisters and brothers, This day marks the birth anniversary of one of the great poets of our country, Shri Harivansh ji and today on the birth anniversary of Harivansh ji, Shriman Amitabh Bachchan ji has given a slogan for Swachhata Abhiyan.
You must have seen that the most popular artist of this century, Amitabh ji is pushing the campaign of cleanliness very well.
It seems that the subject of cleanliness has spread to his nervousness and at the same time he remembered the work of cleanliness on his father's birth anniversary.
HarivanshJi, he used to introduce himself through this medium.
So his son, Shriman Amitabh ji, who is running the mission of cleanliness in his mind, has written to me using the poetry of Harivanshji - 'Swachh Tan, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat', My identity.
I respectfully salute Harivansh ji.
I also thank Shri Amitabh ji for joining the Mann Ki Baat in such a way and for taking forward the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your feelings and your letters, on MyGov and on Narendra Modi App, I have always been associated with you.
Now Mann Ki Baat is about 11 o'clock, but soon after that we will start in regional languages too.
I am grateful to All India Radio for this new initiative that will provide an opportunity to my countrymen to be connected there, even where Hindi is not popular.
Thank you very much to everyone.
Those who have seen it from afar feel that it is the second name of the Indian life-long festival and it is also natural.
The festivals that have been in India since time immemorial have been the festivals which have been the festival of change in time to time.
We have seen the courage to end the tradition of festivals beyond time and the change in festivals, as demanded by the society, has been accepted with ease.
And they do it through this excitement.
All these things have been covered by our ancestors in a very scientific way.
Today the whole world talks about the environment and the issue of natural destruction has become a matter of concern.
The festival of India is about making the tradition as a bulwark of nature and enriching every human being from child to child.
Be it trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, festivals all these are the festivals that have a sense of responsibility towards everyone.
Nowadays we leave on Sundays, but the old generation, the labourers, the fishermen etc.
Therefore, the tradition of keeping the universe and science together was developed.
Today, as we celebrate Diwali, as I said, every festival of ours is an educationist.
One thing we all know very well, go to any corner of India, come to Amir's house, go to the hut of the poorest of the poor, on the occasion of Diwali, and every family gets a glimpse of the cleanliness drive.
Cleaning of every corner of the house.
But the need of the hour is not only to clean our homes, but also to clean the entire campus, to clean the entire area and to clean the entire village.
We have to expand this culture and tradition.
The festival of Diwali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
The festival of Deepavali is celebrated in some form or the other in all the countries of the world.
Several governments and the parliaments of the world have also started becoming part of the festival of Deepavali.
Whether it is in the East or in the West, whether it is a developed country or a developing country, whether it is Africa or Ireland, the festival of Diwali is clearly visible.
You all are aware that the US Postal Service has also issued a postal stamp this time.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared his photos lighting lamps on Twitter on the occasion of Diwali.
On the occasion of Diwali in London, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom hosted a banquet in his honour, which perhaps included the U.S.
And what is the picture ?
16 women MPs from Singapore, wearing Indian sari, stood outside Parliament and this photo has become viral.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
Today, the festival of Diwali is being celebrated in every street of Singapore.
The Prime Minister of Australia, while congratulating the Indian community on the occasion of Diwali, has called for engaging every community in festivals in different cities of Australia.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had recently visited India.
He told me that I have to return soon so that I have to attend the festival of Diwali there. I mean to say that Deepawali, the festival of lights, is an inspiration to take the world community from darkness to light.
On the festival of Deepavali, with the spread of good clothes, good cuisines, etc.
And the children and the youth enjoy a lot.
Sometimes it does not even notice what is happening around .
The news of the accident, the news of the fire and the news of the death of the deceased have caused great concern.
And there is also a problem that on the day of Diwali, doctors have also gone to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers.
In our country, the festival of Diwali is going on for a long time.
It is not just one day.
It includes Govardhan Puja Kaho, Bhaibij Kaho, Beneficiaries Kaho, and Kartik Poornima. In a way, it has been going on for a long time.
At the same time, we celebrate Diwali and also prepare for Chhath Puja.
Chhath Puja is a very big festival in the eastern part of India.
But its one specialty is that it conveys a very deep message to the society.
But there is a saying - brother, the people of the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath Puja is such a festival in which the sloping sun is worshipped .
There is a great social message in this festival.
I will talk about the festival of Deepavali or the festival of Chhath Puja. This is the time to convey my best wishes to you.
But at the same time, there is a special time for me.
I especially want to thank and express my gratitude to the countrymen.
In the last few months, the events that have taken shape, our army personnel are trying their best to ensure our wellbeing.
The sacrifices and penance of the soldiers of the armed forces continue to dominate the world in the near future.
And one of them had settled down in the mind to dedicate this Diwali to the security forces.
I have invited the countrymen for a campaign called 'To Solzers'.
But today, I want to say this thing by bowing my head and saying that there will not be any human being in India, in whose day there is immense love and pride for the soldiers of the country, the way it has been expressed, it will give strength to every countryman.
For the soldiers of the security forces, we cannot imagine that a message of your courage has been revealed in the form of a syntaxerx.
Be it the schools, colleges, students, villages, poor, businessmen, shopkeepers, politicians, sports persons or cine-people, there must have been hardly any survivors who did not light the lamp for the soldiers of the country, who did not send a message to the soldiers of the country, even through the medium of broadcasting, turned the lamp into an opportunity to express gratitude to the army and why not
Whether it is BSF, CRPF, Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rifles, Water Force, Army or Air Force, I cant mention the names of all of them, but what kind of difficulties do these countless people suffer
I can imagine how proud the soldiers of my country are
So many works have come on the message - to - Solzer ' s hashtag , what will you say in a symbolic manner ?
I want to read that Shriman Ashwini Kumar Chauhan sends a poem.
Such a sister-in-law has sent me a telephone message today as to what do we call a military family
Namaskar Prime Minister, I speak the Mohan of Shiva.
The 'To Solzers' campaign launched by this Diwali is encouraging our military brothers.
I belong to an army family.
My husband is also an army officer.
My father and mother-in-law have been officers of both the armed forces.
So, our entire family is full of young people.
I want to say that along with the army officers and soldiers, their families and their wives also make good sacrifices.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the Army are standing not only at the border but at every corner of their lives.
Be it a natural calamity or a crisis of law and order or be it mobilizing the enemy, or be it showing courage to return the youth from the wrong path, our soldiers continue to work with the inspiration of nationalism in every aspect of life.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh is Open Defecation Free.
Now Himachal has also been formed and the first nine-year-old Kerala is also going to be formed.
But how does this success be seen ?
Now our ITBP jawans have gone to their villages on leave from their duty.
The Gram Sabhas were supposed to meet at that time, they had reached the Gram Sabhas and there was a discussion on the construction of toilets.
It was found that some families were unable to build toilets due to lack of money.
We must forget this stigma and look at their patriotism. It did not serve the country only to give up the pills on the enemies.
He pulled out a thousand rupees from his checkbook and handed it over to the Sarpanch of the village and said that those 5 houses which did not have a toilet, give one thousand rupees to every family, and build 5 toilets and make all our villages open defecation free.
I really want to thank the youth.
I noticed that in the far-flung jungles of Kerala, there is no way out, it is difficult to reach the village by walking all day on foot.
It was difficult to reach the tribal panchayat Idmalakudi where it was difficult, therefore, it was noticed by the engineering students in the nearby urban areas that they had to build toilets in the village.
NCC cadets, NSS youth, engineering students and all of them together decided that we will build toilets.
The youth of the country had to carry the goods that were to be made for constructing toilets, bricks and cement, all these things had to be picked up by them and walked all day in Pela forest.
They built toilets in the village by their own efforts and this young man opened a small village in the remote forest to open Defecation Free.
This is the reason why Kerala is becoming ODF.
Gujarat has also declared more than 150 municipalities, municipalities, to be declared Open Defecation Free.
Ten districts have also been declared Open Defecation Free.
Haryana is also going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee on the first of its kind, and it has decided that within a few months, the entire state will be ODF.
So far, he has completed seven districts.
Work is going on in all the states.
I have mentioned some of them.
I heartily congratulate the citizens of all these states for joining this great task and for contributing in eradicating the dirtiness from the country.
My dear countrymen, there are many schemes in the government and if another good scheme is implemented in accordance with the first scheme then one has to quit the first scheme.
But generally, we do not pay any attention to these things.
The old scheme is also going on and new projects are going on and the wait for the future plans is also going on.
This is going on.
There is no need for kerosene to those houses where there is a gas stove in the house and electricity is available in the house.
The households that have gas connections, the households that have electricity connections, have Aadhaar numbers and I have heard that seven or eight districts have been declared Kerosene free today.
Just as they had taken up this task, I am confident that the entire state will soon become kerosene-free.
And the convenience of the people will also increase, yes, the problems will be faced by the middlemen and the dishonest.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guiding light for all of us.
Each and every point of theirs, whatever country should go, still sets the criteria for it.
Gandhiji used to say, When you make a plan, first of all remember the poor and the weak face and then decide that what you are going to do will benefit the poor or not who will be harmed or not
You should decide on this criteria.
The need of the hour is that we will have to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step after the other so that we can overcome the difficulties.
No matter how old our thinking is, society must be freed from the discrimination of sons and daughters.
Whether it is the 21st century or be it the darkness of the village, it cant run now.
And that is why the Maha Abhiyan of providing electricity to the villages and to free the villages from darkness is progressing successfully.
It is progressing in a time bound manner.
After so many years of independence, what will happen to the poor mother, who used to smoke 400 cigarettes a day by cooking on wooden stoves
Five crore such families are moving ahead successfully in giving a smoke-free life.This is a mission.
Small traders, small traders, vegetable sellers, milkmen, barbers etc., used to be trapped in the pursuit of money laundering.
My dear countrymen, on the 31st of October, this great man of this country, the unity of India, who made the mantra of his life, showed the way to life.
On the one hand is the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb and on the other hand is the greatest soul of the country's unity.
On the other hand, it is also the death anniversary of Smt. Gandhi.
We should not only remember the virtues of great men, we should also do it.
But I also touched upon the phone call of a gentleman from Punjab, and his pain, and the Prime Minister, Mr.
From Punjab, you know that the 31st of this month is the birthday of Sardar Patel.
Sardar Patel was such a person who spent his entire life in connecting the country and in this campaign, I feel that he was successful and brought everyone along.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of a single person.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, History is witness to the fact that Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had done the task of uniting the country after Chanakya.
The successful effort to bring an independent India under one flag and the great Bhagirathi task, which he gave, 100 salute to the Mahapurush.
But this is also a pain that Sardar Saheb was alive for unity, he was struggling for unity, he was also victim of many slogans because of his priority in unity, but never left the path of unity.
On the birth anniversary of that great man who had lived his life for unity and on the birthday of Sardar Saheb, we all feel pained by a corner of history.
But amidst these crises, we have to move forward with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of the country.
There are many languages, different dialects, many dresses, food-waters, but unity in diversity is the strength of India.
It is the essence of unity that lays the strong foundations of a better India.
The journey of Sardar Saheb started with a struggle for the farmers.
He was the son of a farmer.
Sometimes many of us hear Amul's name.
Today, people are familiar with every product of Amul within India and outside India.
But very few people would know that it was the divine vision of Sardar Saheb who envisioned the Cooperative Milk Producer Union.
And the Kheda district, which was then called the 'Kera' district, was strengthened by this idea in 1942.
As a result, today's 'Amul' is a living example of how Sardar Saheb had sanded out for the farmers.
I respectfully offer tributes to Sardar Saheb.
And wherever we may be on this day of unity on 31 October, remember Sardar Saheb and resolve for unity.
My dear countrymen, in this series of Diwali festivals, the festival of lights is also celebrated on Kartik Purnima.
Guru Nanak Dev Jis teachings are the guiding principles for entire humanity, not just for India but for the entire humanity.
It was Guru Nanak Devs message of service, truth and good for all.
This was the mantra of peace, unity and harmony.
When we were at the top of the evils of untouchability, caste system, high casteism and its perversion, Guru Nanak Dev had chosen Bhai Lalo as his partner.
Let us also follow the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' which has given us the light of the knowledge that Guru Nanak Devji has given us, the inspiration to leave discrimination, and who can be our guiding light if we want to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
I bow down to Guru Nanak Dev Ji when this Prakash Parv is being celebrated on his birthday.
My dear countrymen, once again, my best wishes to the soldiers of the country on this Diwali.
Thank you very much...
Text of PMs Mann Ki Baat address on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you. In the last few days, we have lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri region of Jammu Kashmir.
I salute all those brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
It was to make the entire nation self-reliant.
There is grief as well, anger is also there in the country. And it is not only for those families who have lost their sons, brothers and sisters, the entire country.
My dear countrymen, we trust our army.
We are proud of our army.
There are many opportunities for us, for our citizens and for our politicians, we speak as well.
But the army does not speak, the army does the valour.
Today I want to talk to the citizens of Kashmir as a disguise.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the anti-national elements very well.
And as they have started to understand the truth, they have been moving forward on the path of peace by dissolving such elements.
Every parent wants that school and college should work as soon as possible and the farmers feel that the crops, fruits, etc. that have been produced by them will reach the markets of India.
Economic activity is also going on well.
And in the last few days, the business has started to walk well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the only solutions to our problems, our path to progress and our development.
For our future generations, we have to scale new heights of development.
I am confident that we will find solutions to all the problems sitting together, find ways and at the same time will pave the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
Safety of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of governance.
The administration has to take several steps to maintain law and order.
And we will follow it completely.
Sometimes people who think that we think that we are the ones who think that we are the ones who give new ideas.
Now I get the opportunity to know a lot about social media.
Every corner of India provides an opportunity to know and understand the emotions of every kind of people and strengthen the power of democracy.
In the last few days, a young man named Harshavardhan gave me a different kind of idea.
He wrote, "I was very disturbed after the Uri terrorist attack.
But the way to do something, the way to do something, and what can a young student like me do
Of these, I had thought how I too should work for the welfare of the country.
And I resolved that I would study an additional 3 hours daily.
We will become a better citizen of the country.
Brothers and sisters, It is a matter of great happiness for me that in this atmosphere of anger, at such a young age, you can think healthyly.
But Harshavardhan, I will also say that the anger that has taken place in the minds of the citizens of the country has a great value.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
But you would be aware that when the war of 1965 took place, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was leading us and there was such a spirit in the whole country, there was anger and a spirit of patriotism.
Everyone wanted something or the other to do something.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried his best to touch this spirit of the country in a very good way.
And by giving the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, he inspired the people of the country to work for the country.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had shown that another way of expressing patriotism was for every citizen.
When Mahatma Gandhi was leading the freedom movement, when the movement was at its peak and there was a need for a stability in the movement, he used to make very successful experiments to turn that intensity of movement towards constructive work in the society.
If all of us, the army personnel, the administration officials perform their duties and if we make some constructive contribution in the spirit of this patriotism, then our country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr.
Karthik has written to me on the Narendra Modi App that the players who went to the Paralyspics have created history and their appearance is a victory of the human spirit.
Shri Varun Viswanath has also written on the Narendra Modi App that our players have done very well and you should mention this in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only these two, every person in the country has got an emotional connect with our players in the Olympics.
Probably moving ahead from sports, our attitude towards Para Olympics and our players, the attitude of humanity and our approach towards Divyangs has completely changed.
There is a lot of strength in this sentence.
This time, 17 players, including 3 women from our country, participated in the Olympics.
When Divyangjans play a big role in the field of sports as compared to other players then physical strength and skill in sports are even more important.
He won the Gold Medal at Bhai Devender Jhalafak for the second time and also won the Gold Medal after 12 years.
Age increases in 12 years and once you win the Gold Medal, the spirit also decreases slightly.
But Devendra ji had shown that the condition of the body, or the age of the body, could never weaken his resolve and after 12 years he took the second gold medal.
And they were not divyang by birth.
They had to lose one hand because of the electric current.
Just imagine, the person who won the first gold medal at the age of 23 and the second gold medal at the age of 35 years must have spent a lot of money in his life.
Mariappan Thangavela (High Jump) won the Gold Medal in the High Jump.
And Thangavelu lost his left leg only when he was 5 years old.
Poverty did not come at the cost of his involvement.
They are neither living in big cities nor coming from the middle class American family.
Despite being in a life full of difficulties at the age of 21 years, he gave the nation a medal with determination despite physical hardships.
With the name of Deepa Malik, a sportsman, she has added the pride of being a multi-faceted winner.
Varun C.
Bhati won the bronze medal in the highest order.
These medals are not only greatness but also a great contribution of our country, in our society and in our neighborhood. These medals have done a great job to look towards our Divyang brothers and sisters.
Our emotions have not only awakened, but our attitude towards this Divyangjan has also changed.
Very few people would be aware of the valour shown by these divyang people in this years Paralysis.
A few days ago, Olympics was held in the same place.
This time it has been made.
The 1500-meter run, in which Olympics's competition had created a record by those who won gold medals, was recorded by Abdeltif Baka, Algeria, who broke the 1500-meter competition for Divyangs from a short span of a decade and created a new record.
Moreover, I was surprised that the 4th rank among the Divyangjans was not given a medal as a runner but they also ran in less time than the one who won the gold medal in the ordinary runner-up.
I once again congratulate all these players. And in the coming days, India is moving forward in the direction of making a smooth plan for the Olympics and for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience at Navsari in Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
A Mega Camp of the Government of India for the Divyangjans was organized on the same day.
On that day, I also got the opportunity to release a book, which depicts the successful stories of some divyang people.
There were many inspiring incidents.
I consider it important to have a world record on the land of India and Navsari.
It successfully used six hundred hearing aids for hearing impaired hearing aids in the ears within eight hours.
It was ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for all of us, the people of the country, to create three World Records for the Divyangs in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on the second October, on the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission.
And on that day I had said that cleanliness should be our nature and it should be the duty of every citizen.
Now, on the second of October, when it is two years old, I can say with confidence that the awareness about cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 1.25 billion Indians.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness.Today, we can say that everyone has tried to move a step forward.
That is, the country has taken 1.25 billion steps forward towards cleanliness.
It has also been decided that the direction is right.
We have seen how good the results are and what is being done with some such efforts.
Be it the bus stations, railways, schools, colleges, religious places, hospitals, harkoi, children and the elderly, villages, poor, farmers, women, all are making some contribution towards cleanliness.
Friends from the media have also played a positive role.
However, we still have to go a long way.
For the sake of health, for the honour of the citizens, especially for the honour of the mothers and sisters, the tendency to defecate in the open should be stopped.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve complete success in the near future in the direction of getting rid of open defecation.
When I went to Gujarat recently, the officials told me that Porbandar, which is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will achieve the goal of ODF completely on this second October.
I would like to present a scheme for those young friends who are using technology at present.
Everyone has the right to know the situation of cleanliness in your city and that is why the Government of India has given a telephone number 16.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1986.
Calling on this number 16, you will not only be able to know the status of building toilets in your city but will also be able to apply for construction of toilets.
You must take advantage of it.
Not only this, a Swachhata App has been launched to know the status of complaints related to cleanliness and disposal of those complaints.
The Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Fellows.
This cleanliness campaign will not be limited to just values.
Cleanliness becomes a habit, it is not enough.
These wastes are being used for making compost, and for this it has been started from the government's policy intervention.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to procure the compost-centric fertilizer from the waste generated.
And this fertilizer can be made available to the farmers who want to go to their native places.
Those who want to improve the health of their soil, worry about the health of their soil, want to prevent the damage caused due to chemical fertilizers, the companies should give such fertilizer to those farmers who want to get such fertilizers in small quantities.
And Shriman Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing a lot in this work as a brand ambassador.
I invite the youth to start ups in the waste to wealth campaign, develop such tools, develop such technologies, and work on these products in a big way.
This year, from 25th September to 2nd October, a special event - 'Indonesia - India Sanitation Conference' is also being held.
The ministers, chief ministers, mayors, commissioners from across the country and all these things together are just about thinking and thinking about cleanliness.
What can happen in technology
What could be the economic structure ?
How can people participate ?
How to increase employment opportunities in this
All subjects have to be discussed.
And I can see that a lot of new ideas are coming about cleanliness.
One day I read in a newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University had started an awareness campaign to build toilets in 10 villages.
He himself worked hard and contributed to the construction of nearly 1000 toilets.
A few days ago you must have seen that under the leadership of Wing Commander Paramvir Singh, a group of people travelled 2800 kms from Devprayag in Ganga to Gangasagar and gave a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also made a one year calendar in their respective departments.
Each department will focus on 15 days especially on cleanliness.
The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, the Department of Panchayati Raj and the Department of Rural Development are all set to work together to enhance the sanitation coverage in their respective areas from 1st to 15th October, 2019.
During the last two weeks of October 16th to 31st October, 2020, 3 other departments namely, Department of Agriculture, Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing Industries and Department of Consumer Affairs, these three departments will conduct sanitization drives for 15 days in areas connected with them.
You must have seen that today all the campaigns of cleanliness are also going on.
First of all, a survey of 3 cities was presented to the people of the country about the status of cleanliness.
Now there are more than 500 cities of the country with a population of more than a lakh. And due to this there is a belief in every city that we have left behind, but we will do something better tomorrow.
An atmosphere of competition for cleanliness has been created.
I hope that all of us can contribute in this campaign as much as we can.
The next October marks the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is also being celebrated for two years.
I continue to urge you to buy something or the other from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This time also, I urge every family to have something to do with Khadi so that the lamp of Diwali can be lit in the homes of the poor.
On Sunday, the second day of October, as a citizen, how can we link ourselves to the work of cleanliness
Send the video if there is a video.
If our efforts throughout the country will give a new strength and a new momentum to this movement.
Remembering the virtues of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
And I have seen that in the past when I had asked people to quit gas subsidy and the response given by the people itself is a very inspiring event of India's national life.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out on the streets, and the families used to ask for donations from the old games that they used to give, and those who used to give the toys that are from poor areas they used to give.
What a wonderful pleasure to see those poor children watching the play games like Pela
The centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Ji, who gave a political philosophy, gave a unified human view to millions of workers like me, who were working on political thought, interpreting political thought, respect for Indian roots, and thinking about rewarding the cultural heritage of India, is beginning today.
The principle of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the welfare of the last man.
How can the fruits of development reach the poorest of the poor
He gave a complete economic agenda in every hand, every farm, and every farm, in two words.
Only then can we free the country from poverty if the country considers its centenary year as a year for the welfare of the poor, if the attention of the governments of the society is focussed on how the poor can benefit from development.
As a part of this, the Prime Minister's residence, and the road that was once known as the Race Course Road of the British, has been named as the Lok Kalyan Marg on the occasion of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's birth centenary.
This is an indicator of the poor welfare year of the same century.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Vijayadashami, two years ago, I had started Mann Ki Baat.
In this, I have been sincerely trying to ensure that the Mann Ki Baat programme does not become a programme for the government.
How does this country's faith inspire me
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
On the completion of two years of this week, I express my heartfelt gratitude to the entire audience for the way Mann Ki Baat has improved its appreciation and blessings.
I am also grateful to All India Radio for not only carrying out these messages but also making sincere efforts to carry them in all the languages.
I am also grateful to all those countrymen who wrote letters after Mann Ki Baat, gave a clarion call to the government, gave a clarion call and made suggestions to the government, highlighted the shortcomings of the government, and Akashwani provided a platform to the government and the representatives to resolve the problems.
Therefore, Mann Ki Baat is not just a conversation of 15-20 minutes but a new opportunity for social change.
For anyone the other reason is greater satisfaction than this .
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja next week, the festival of Vijayadashmi, in a way, is a different kind of atmosphere in the whole country.
It is a festival of venerated venerated veneration, a festival of unity of society is the unity of the country.
Whether it is Navratri or Durgapuja or the festival of worship of the sages or the unity of the society, then how should it be celebrated
How should be the festival that connects man to man ?
Only then can we celebrate the festival of victory by mixing it together.
Come, meditate on the sages, and walk with the mantra of unity.
Full text of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 28th August, 2016.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar. Tomorrow, 2nd August marks the birth anniversary of the magic of the hockey.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day all over the country.
I pay my tributes to Dhyan Chand Ji and on this occasion I also want to remind you of his contributions.
In 1928, in 1932, in the 1936 Olympics, he played an important role in making India a hockey player.
We all know the name of cricket-loving bradman.
He said He is a living example of Holistic Approach, Dhyan Chand Ji Sportsmen Spirit, and patriotism.
Once during the match in Kolkata, an opponent team played on Dhyan Chand ji's head.
There was only 10 minutes left to finish the match at that time.
And Dhyanchand ji had made three rounds in that ten minutes and said, I changed the injury.
But I have seen that this time, on a large scale, everyone urged me to do something about Rio Olympics.
I see that the common man has so much attachment to the Rio Olympics, so much awareness and pressure on the head of the country or to say something about it.
Apart from cricket, there is so much love for Indian citizens and sports as well, so much awareness and so much knowledge.
Reading this message for me also became a big inspiration in itself.
A Shriman Ajit Singh has written on Narendra Modi App, Please call upon the daughters in Mann Ki Baat to speak on their participation in education and sports as they have made the country proud by winning a medal in the Rio Olympics.
Someone Mr. Sachin writes, You must mention Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in Mann Ki Baat this time.
The medals we received were presented by these daughters.
Our daughters have once again proved that they do not get out of anybody.
One of these daughters is from North India, one from South India and one from East India.
So someone is from any other corner of India.
It seems as if the daughters of the whole of India have made the nation proud.
Summit Thakur on MyGov wrote that we could perform better in the Olympics.
He wrote - Respected Modi Sir, First of all, I congratulate you for winning the two medals in Rio, but I want to draw your attention to the fact that our performance was really good
And the answer is no.
We need to reduce the distance in sports.
Our parents continue to pay attention to studies even today.
Even today, sports is considered a disaster in the society.
We need to change this thinking.
Society needs inspiration.
Thus, thousands of people have expressed their feelings.
No one can deny that we are unable to perform our expectations.
It also happened that our sportspersons were performing in India, they were not able to reach there even in the sporting events.
And only two medals were won in the medal tally.
But it is also true that despite not getting a medal, if you look at it carefully, for the first time in many sports, India's players have shown great skill.
But why can we forget this one thing that it is the first Indian girl to qualify for the Olympics and the Olympics final
This is what happened in tennis with the pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bunpanna.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babu qualified for the Track Field Final.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, the women's hockey team reached the Olympics.
India's players, the times to come will definitely be good for us.
Many players, for instance, Aditya Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal and Atanu Das are many names.
But my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But if we continue to do the same, we will be disappointed.
I have announced a committee.
A work map of how we can do better.
Just imagine, the state should choose one or two games and plan how to do the best.
I also appeal to the sports associations and associations that they too should brainstorm in an unbiased manner.
And I request every citizen of India to send a suggestion on the Narendra Modi App that anyone interested in it.
Write to the government.
The Associations should discuss and submit their application to the Government.
State Governments will discuss and send their suggestions.
But I am confident that we will move forward with the resolution of 1.25 billion Indians, 65 per cent of them youth, and will get the best in the world of sports.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September is the Teacher's Day.
I have been spending a lot of time with the students on Teachers' Day for years.
But this time when I have to go for the G-20 Summit then I have come here to express my feelings in Mann Ki Baat today.
We have seen teachers as much as the mother has in her life and we have seen teachers who are more concerned about their students than themselves.
He dedicates his life for his students, for his students.
These days, after the Rio Olympics, everything is being discussed in the name of Pulela Gopichand.
He is a player but he has presented a fine example of what a good teacher is.
Today, I see Gopichand as an outstanding teacher besides being a player.
And on Teachers' Day, I salute Palla Gopichand ji for his penance, dedication to sports and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
Teachers' contribution in the lives of all of us is always noteworthy.
On 5th September, Dr.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan on his birthday and the country considers it a Teacher's Day.
He may have reached any place in his life but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only this, he always used to say - "Good teachers are those whose students never die."
Living as a teacher and keeping the inner student alive in relation to being a teacher, despite being a President, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji showed his life with such an amazing life.
I think that I remember a lot of things from my teachers because they were our heroes in our village.
But today I can say this thing with happiness that even though one of my teachers has become 70 years old, even today his letter comes to me every month.
Because of this, if I see any good letter from anyone then I feel a lot of respect.
It is the responsibility of all of us to raise the pride of our teachers in the society.
You must share your photos with your teachers on the Narendra Modi App, and whatever motivation you have with your teachers.
See, the contribution of a teacher in the country is also very valuable from the eyes of the students.
My dear countrymen, Ganeshotsav will take place in a few days.
Ganeshji is a widower and we all want that the life of our country, our society, our family, every person should be lifeless.
But when we talk of Ganesh Utsav, it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak.
The tradition of public Ganesh Utsav is a gift from Lokmanya Tilak.
Now Ganesh festivals are taking place not only in Maharashtra but in every corner of India.
Essay competitions and rangoli competitions.
His exhibitions also highlight the issues that touch the society in a very artistic manner.
This massive campaign of folk education is being run by the public Ganesh Utsav.
Surajya is our birthright, we should move towards Surajya, we should become our priority cant we convey this mantra to the public through the Ganesh Utsav.
Come, I invite you for this.
It is true that festivals are beneficial to the society.
This time too many people have written Ganeshotsava and Durga Puja to me.
Why not use the statue of Ganeshji made from the soil of the village pond ?
Statues made of POPs are not unique to the environment.
Protecting the environment, protecting our rivers and lakes, protecting the small creatures of this water from their pollution is also a service to God.
Ganeshji is a widower.
We should not create such a Ganesha ji that produces a law.
I do not know in what form you will take these things, but I do not just say this thing, many people say this thing and I have heard about many things - one statue is Shriman Abhijit Gondfal.
Ganesh Utsav, which is unique in nature, is also a service to the society.
Durga Puja is still the time.
Just now, let us decide that the old family that makes statues.
If we buy a statue from them then they will also get employment and if these statues are made from the pond or the soil of the river then they will be found again.
Greetings to all of you on Ganeshotsav.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be blessed with Saint Upadhyay on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had dedicated her entire life to the service of the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud when Mother Teresa, who had served the poor throughout her life, received the Saints title.
On the 4th of September, the Government of India will send an official delegation led by our foreign Prime Minister Sushma Swaraj on behalf of 1.25 billion Indians.
We get to learn something from saints, sages, great men every moment.
If we continue to do something, keep learning and do something good.
My dear countrymen, how big a change comes when development becomes a mass movement.
Janash Kitt is considered to be the form of God.
The Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments, has made a successful effort to involve people in the cleaning of Ganga and in the cleaning of Ganga.
On the 20th of this month, the Sarpanchs of villages along the banks of Ganga were invited in Allahabad.
The village should not let the river Ganga get dirty, some should come from Uttarakhand for this resolution.
Some people came from Uttar Pradesh, some from Bihar, some from Jharkhand and some from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India who have fulfilled this vision. I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the five states who have taken an important step in cleaning the Ganga by connecting the masses.
My dear countrymen, a few things touch me a lot sometimes and I also have a special respect for those people who are conceived of by him.
On July 15, more than 70 school children from Kabirdham district in Chhattisgarh have collectively written a letter to their parents.
This was done by children in the age group of seven to seventy years.
Congratulations to all those who have made this effort and also to those parents who have taken a decision to make their children's letter of seriously and toilet.
There are things that inspire us.
In Koppal district of Karnataka, a 16-year-old daughter, Mallamma, paid homage to her family.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
It has become the resolve of some Indians.
Some Indians have made it their goal.
But everyone is connected to it in some form or the other and everyone is making their own contribution.
There is daily news about how new efforts are being made.
One thought has come to the Government of India and has urged people to make a 2 minute, 3 minute film on cleanliness and send it to the Government of India.
You will find details on the website.
It will have a competition and the winner will be rewarded on October 2, the Gandhi Jayanti.
I would also like to tell the channels that you too have to compete for such films.
creativity - creativity can also give a boost to the Swachhata Abhiyan.
New ways will be found, new inspiration will be given and all this will be done by ordinary artists with public participation.
It is not necessary that there should be a big studio, good camera for making films.
A very important thing was done in the past.
Our Honble President Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated a new program in Kolkata - Akashwani Maitri Channel - Now some people will have to inaugurate a radio channel.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
On the other hand, they will share the contents of the Akashwani friendship and Bangladesh sitar on the other side and the Bangladeshi people on both sides will enjoy the AIR.
I also thank Bangladesh for joining us for this work.
I also congratulate all the friends of All India Radio for their contribution in foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, even though you have given me the task of becoming the Prime Minister, at the same time, I also look like you.
And sometimes the incidents of emotions touch me a lot.
Such incidents also give new energy, new inspiration and inspiration, which inspires the people of Baraat to do something.
Recently, I received a letter that touched my heart.
A 84 year old mother who is a retired teacher wrote this letter to me.
Had he not refused to disclose his name in this letter to me, today I would have spoken to him in his name.
In the letter, he wrote that when you appealed to release the gas subsidy, I gave up the subsidy and then I forgot.
My dear countrymen, you must be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those people who have given up their gas subsidy and some of my representatives will come forward and write to them.
It is my effort to write letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing a good job, the campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke of stove is excellent, I am a retired teacher.
The question is not only of Rs.50,000 but also of mother's feelings. And this is the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters, due to which the trust and strength are available for the future of my country.
I bow down to that mother and salute those crores of mothers of India who have always done something for themselves by working hard.
My dear countrymen, last year we were in trouble due to drought, but this month of August was constantly full of floods.
Some parts of the country have been completed.
The state governments could do whatever the central government, local bodies, social institutions, and citizens could do.
But in the midst of these flood news, there were some news that needed to be remembered more.
It will be remembered for the month of August this year for what kind of great results can be achieved if we walk together.
In August 2016, the anti-political parties, the parties which have not given up any opportunity against each other and almost 90 parties from all over the country and many parties in the Parliament together passed the GST bill.
Similarly, whatever happened in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country spoke in one voice regarding the situation in Kashmir.
If we have to say it in the least possible words, then I will say - 'unity and opinion' - these two things should be in the original mantra. And all of us are of the opinion 1.25 billion citizens of the country, from the Sarpanch of the village to the head principal, that any person who dies in Kashmir, whether he is a young man or a security worker, this loss is ours, it is our people, it is our country, it is the people who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by taking these children forward and sometimes they have to answer those innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is vast and diverse.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us as a government to keep a nation full of diversities alive. Only then will the country make its own bright future.
My 1.25 billion countrymen have faith in the virtues of their lives.
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of the text of PMs Mann ki Baat programme on All India Radio on 24.03.2017 My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
This morning, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the youth of Delhi. And I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports in the entire country will energise every young person.
We all know that in a few days, the world's largest sporting event is going to be organized.
The word Rio resonates repeatedly in our ears.
The whole world will be sports.
You will also keep a watch on the display of players from all over the world.
Our hopes and aspirations are huge but the enthusiasm of the players who have gone to play in Rio is huge.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organized a grand 'Run for Rio', 'Khelo Aur Jiao', 'Khelo Aur Khelo'.
All of us in the coming days, wherever we may be, who should be in charge of encouraging our players
No matter how much food there is, one has to leave everything.
Even if there is sweetness in the winter, one has to leave the bed and run to the field and not just the players, but their parents too.
The players are not made overnight.
I am also ready to do this work on behalf of you.
The country's chief postman is ready to deliver your message to these players.
Come, let us all be proud of each and every player and strengthen his efforts in the coming days.
And today when I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poem lover Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of Punjab Central University, has sent a poem.
There may be several other poets, poets, poets, poets, poets, poets, writers, poets, poets etc.
Technology changes every day, new forms take place every day, new effects are created and they keep changing.
You cannot capture technology.
If there is no research and innovation, then the way Bandi water spreads dirt, the technology also becomes a burden.
And if we live up to the expectation of old technology without research and innovation then we will be able to discover the world in the changing era and therefore we have to awaken the spirit of attraction towards science, research and innovation towards technology in the new generation.
The Atal Innovation Mission is being promoted by NITI Aayog.
One goal is to create an ecosystem across the country through the Atal Innovation Mission - Innovation Mission, Innovation, Expandment, Entrepreneurship, and Incubation.
Similarly, incubation centres have a direct connection with innovation.
And if I talk about Atal Incubation Centre then the government has given a huge amount of Rs.10 crores for that too.
Similarly, India is facing many problems.
We see problems in our daily lives.
Now we have to find solutions through technology.
And through the Atal Grand Challenge, the youth of the country have called upon the youth of the country to find solutions to the problems that you see with the help of technology, to research, to innovate and to find solutions.
The Government of India seeks to promote technology to solve our problems by awarding special awards.
And I am glad that when we mentioned the Tinkering Labs, about 13 thousand schools applied and when we talked about Incubation Centres, more than 4,000 educational and non-educational institutions came forward for Incubation Centres.
I am confident that the true tribute to Abdul Kalam ji - research and innovation will help our younger generation to find solutions to the problems of our daily lives.
My dear countrymen, some time ago we were concerned about the drought and today rain is also bringing happiness and flood news is also coming up.
The State Government and the Central Government together are making every effort to help the flood victims.
Despite the difficulties caused by the rains, everyone's mind, every human heart gets overwhelmed because the focus of our entire economic activity is on rain-fed agriculture.
Sometimes there is such a disease that keeps us astray for the entire life.
But if we remain vigilant, alert and try to avoid it then the way ahead is also very easy.
Long live Denguy.
Can be avoided by dengue.
Pay attention to hygiene, be careful and try to stay safe, pay special attention to the children and consider this disease in the poor population, but there is no case of dengue.
Dengue comes first in the happy and prosperous region and therefore we understand it.
You must have seen the newspapers on TV, but sometimes we are very sad about taking precautions while being aware of it.
The government, hospital or doctor will not only do our job but we will also not allow dengue to occur in our house, in our area and in our family and I will also be alert to avoid any water-borne disease.
On the other hand, my dear countrymen, I would like to draw your attention.
Life has become so busy, it has become so busy that we never have time to think.
When we fall sick, we feel that we are able to recover quickly and take any antibiotics for that.
But the bacteria that are known to be known to be infected by these medicines and then the drugs prove to be useless for these organisms and then it takes years to fight this battle, to make new medicines, to do scientific research, etc. and by then these diseases pose a new problem.
Bacteria that spread TB and malaria are making changes in themselves with a lot of fungus that medicines do not have any effect on them.
In medical terms, it is called antibiotic ray fungis and therefore, it is necessary to follow the rules of using antibiotics.
When it comes to health, I want to add one more thing.
Though the Maternal Mortality Rate has reduced in the last one decade, yet the lives of pregnant mothers cannot be saved in large numbers even today.
During pregnancy or after pregnancy, blood loss, delivery related infections, high BP, no one knows when its life will be wasted.
Keeping these things in mind, the Government of India has started a new campaign in the last few months.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, on 9th of every month, free screening of all pregnant women will be done at Government Health Centres.
Can my doctor, brother and sister not provide this work for the poor for 12 days in a year
A few days ago, I have written a lot of letters.
Thousands of doctors have upheld my speech.
But India is such a big country that lakhs of doctors should join this campaign.
I believe that you will definitely join.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is concerned about climate change, global warming and the environment.
There is a collective concern in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
Lord Shri Krishna speaks of the tree during the Kurukshetra war.
In the Gita, Lord Shri Krishna says- , That is, I drink in all the trees.
There is no plant which has no medicinal properties. It is said in the Nashti Mulan Anoushdha (Nash) Policy.
Mahabharat's festival is celebrated in many detail and it is said that the trees that plant the tree are very rich.
There is no doubt about it.
The tree that donates it also makes it like a tree in the world.
A few days ago, I came to know of a girl from Pune, Sonal. She touched my heart.
In the festival of Mahabharat, it is said that trees also fulfill the responsibilities of a child in the world. Sonal did not just fulfil the wishes of his parents but also in the society.
The daughter-in-law of Narayanapur village in Pune's Junnar taluka, Maharashtra, Maruti Mahatre married her grandson Sonal in a very inspiring manner.
And when I saw his picture on social media, I was surprised that even the plants that were not visible in the wedding were visible all around.
The view of the photo was very touching.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became the immortal tale of Nature's love.I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Shri Mahatreji for this new endeavour.
And many people use it.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims visit the Ambaji temple in the month of Bhadravan.
And I will tell them, see, this is the mother's prasada, if you worry about going to your village and making it big, then mother will continue to bless you.
And lakhs of pilgrims used to come here and lakhs of trees were distributed in that year.
Temples can also start the tradition of planting in this rainy season instead of Prasad.
There can be a mass movement - of tree plantation.
I have repeatedly told the farmer brothers that we are destroying our soil by making fences at the edges of our fields so why should not we cultivate timber in such a place
If we plant trees along the banks of our fields and if we cultivate, then we can also sell and sell trees after fifteen-twenty years with the permission of the government.
And you can also become a new source of income and India can also be saved from importing timber.
The government created a mass movement.
Rajasthan - Desert - This is such a big festival and we have resolved to plant 50 lakh saplings.
Twenty-five lakh plants in Rajasthan are not a small thing.
Those people who know the land of Rajasthan know what a big step has been taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also pledged to increase its green cover to fifty percent.
Under the Green India Mission run by the Central Government, the work has been expedited by the Railways.
In Gujarat too, there is a very bright tradition of Van Mahotsav.
This year in Gujarat, the forests of Amravan, Ekta Van and Shaheed Van have been brought up as Van Mahotsavs and thousands of trees have been planted.
I cant mention all the states, but they too deserve to be congratulated.
But for me, the visit to South Africa was in a way a pilgrimage.
When we remember South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When there are words of non-violence, love and forgiveness in the world, then Gandhiji and Mandela are born.
During my visit to South Africa, I visited the Phoenix Cemetery, known as the abode of Mahatma Gandhi.
I was fortunate to have the opportunity of the train journey of Mahatma Gandhi to Peter Meritzburg Station- the train that Mahatma Gandhi had planted on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary.
But this time I got the opportunity to meet those great personalities who spent their lives for equality and equal opportunity in the fight against Nelson Mandela.
Nelson Mandela lived in jail for twenty-two and twenty years.
In a way, he sacrificed a lot of youth and I got the opportunity to visit the great personalities like Shri Ahmad Kathada, Shri Lalu Chiba, Shri George Bijori and Roni Kaisers, who are the close friends of Nation Mandla.
The sense of duty enshrined in the Gita is evident from the fact that the Gita has always had a sense of duty.
I will always remember that visit.
There can be no greater mantra of equality and equal opportunity for any society and government.
Priority will be different but the path is the same and the path is development, equality, opportunity, equality and embodied spirit.
Let us take pride in our Indians who have lived upto the basic mantra of our life in South Africa as well.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to Shilpi Verma.
Those who gave me the message are very natural.
Being a woman, I am sad about her family.
And some people get deceived and caught in the trap of money.
A new method of robbing is spreading across the world through this technology.
And that too on an SMS.
In a short while, they came to know that everything was robbed.
But recently I had a pleasant experience.
Some students from Aligarh also came to me.
Artistic paintings have been done at the station.
If you ever go to Aligarh then definitely visit the station .
Today, I am getting news from several railway stations of India that the local people are identifying their areas on the railway-station walls with their art.
We are experiencing an innovation.
This is an example of how public participation can bring about a change.
Congratulations to all those who have worked like this in the country and my friends from Aligarh.
And you too will be celebrating festivals at home and outside.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is of special significance to us.
As in the previous year, on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, can't you give the mothers and sisters of your country the gift of Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana
Just imagine, give your sisters such gifts that will really protect them in life.
And today social security is there.
This is the true meaning of Raksha Bandhan.
My dear countrymen, there are many of us who have been born since independence.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in an independent India.
The entire country should be painted in the colors of our freedom fighters, the fragrance of independence should be felt all around us, the atmosphere should be created and the Independence Day should not be a government event but a programme of the countrymen.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope you too will do something related to the inspiration of patriotism.
Whatever you want, you should keep your point on the Red Fort at such a great height.
And nowadays the technology platform is so easy that you can send the things comfortably to me.
Text of PMs Mann Ki Baat address on All India Radio
In holidays, every citizen makes several programs.
And as there is a rainy season during the holidays, I also feel like enjoying Kerry.
And sometimes I feel like if we get a chance to sleep in the afternoon then it will be better.
But this time the terrible heat has ruined everything .
But I have seen that the citizens too are making great efforts.
In many villages, there is awareness and the value of water is known only to those who are suffering from water problems.
And that is why there is also a sensitivity with regard to water and there is an activity of doing something.
A few days ago, someone told me that Hiware Bajar Gram Panchayat of Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra and the villagers there have solved the problem by taking water as a very sensitive question in the village.
We have decided to give up the cultivation of those crops which used to use maximum water, whether it is sugarcane or sugarcane.
It looks very easy to hear, but it's not that easy.
And all of them went to the fields of gardens and vegetables where there was least requirement of water.
He has taken several initiatives such as fountains, drip irrigation, rain water harvesting and water harvesting. Today, the village is on its own strength to deal with the water crisis.
Well, I would like to talk about a small village, Hiwar, Bajar but there will be several such villages.
I also thank all such villagers for their excellent work.
I was told that there is a Gorawa Gram Panchayat in Dewas district in Madhya Pradesh.
The Panchayat has undertaken a campaign to make farm ponds.
However, water has not only been saved but when the water level is up then there is a huge improvement in the quality of water as well.
Sometimes it seems that when the Government of India provided water to Latur by train then it became a news for the world.
It is true that the speed with which the railway has done this work is commendable, but the people of Pela village also deserve to be congratulated.
I will say that more congratulations to the Railways than the Railways.
However, several such schemes which are run by the citizens are never compared to them.
It is the nature of a human being that we may be passing through a lot of difficulties but when some good news comes then he feels that the entire crisis has come to an end.
This year, rainfall is expected to increase from 106 to 110, as the message of a great peace seems to have arrived.
It is time for rain to come, but news of good rainfall has also brought a new consciousness.
The more you enjoy the news on good rainfall, the more you give an opportunity to all of us, the more it also poses a challenge.
Can we run a campaign to save water from the village
Farmers need soil, that crop is being grown in the fields.
This time why should not we take out the soil from the ponds in the villages and take them to the fields ?
It will also improve the soil condition of the fields and increase the water storage capacity of the ponds.
Sometimes the water can be stopped in the cement bags, in the empty bags of fertilizer and from where the roads are to be filled with soil
If the water is stopped for five days, if the water is stopped for seven days, then the water will sink into the ground and the ground level will rise.
Water will come to our wells.
Water should be stopped as much as possible.
So whether it is a water crisis or a drought situation, we have time for one and a half months to come.
And I am always saying that whenever we visit the birthplace of the Porbandar Mahatma Gandhi, there is a place in the different places where we have seen that in order to save the rain water, we have constructed 20-20 years old solder under the house and how clean the water is.
This work has been going on for almost 30 years.
Several governments, several schemes and expenditures have been incurred so that this question arises in the minds of crores of people of the country like Bhai Kumar Krishna.
For those who have religious faith, the Ganges is a moksha.
I will not only accept this Mahatma, but I feel that Ganga is life-saving.
We get livelihood from the Ganga and we get a new strength to live from the Ganga.
The way Ganga flows, it also gives a new impetus to the economic activities of the country.
We brought the Ganges into one Bhagirathi, but there is a need for crores of devotees to save them.
This will not succeed without peoples participation.
And that is why all of us have to become representatives of change for cleanliness, for cleanliness and for cleanliness.
Several efforts are being made by the government.
Efforts are being made to fully cooperate with the states which are situated on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are also being made to connect social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have also been taken to curb industrial pollution and the supply of Patna.
Every day, large quantities of sewage and solid waste are discharged into the Ganges.
To clean such waste, trash skimmers floating in water at places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc.
These machines have been supplied to all the local swaraj institutions and they have been requested to run them continuously and clean the garbage from there.
And in the last few days, I have been told that there is a lot of effort in that direction, while there are 3 to 11 tonnes of garbage daily.
The discharge of garbage or black liquor from the pulp and paper industry is almost completely closed.
All this indicates that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that if one finds a person not only on the banks of Ganga but also on the far-flung southern part of the country then he certainly says: Sir, will the Ganga be cleaned
So this is the belief of the common man that it will certainly help in cleaning the Ganga.
People are also donating Ganga for cleanliness.
We are running this system in a very good manner.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
It is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
On this day, the Panchayati Raj system in our country started.
And today the Panchayati Raj system across the country is successfully working as an important unit of our democratic polity.
Therefore, with the cooperation of the State Governments, the Government of India launched the Bharat Abhiyan from 14th April to 24th April, 10 days.
And today, on the 24th of this month, I will go to Jharkhand, where our most tribal brothers and sisters live, to celebrate Panchayati Raj Day.
And once again at 3 in the afternoon, on Panchayati Raj Day, I will talk to all the Panchayats of the country.
This campaign has done a great job of awareness.
How can democratic institutions be strengthened in every corner of India at the village level
How should the villages become self-reliant
How should the villages prepare their own plans for development ?
The daughter's birthday should be the festival of the village.
There are many such schemes.
In some villages, food donation programs have been organized.
Probably there are very few occasions in all such villages of India that such programs have been organized for 10 days at the same time.
I congratulate all the state governments and the Sarpanchs of the villages for this thing.
In a very fundamental way, through innovation, this flood has been converted into an opportunity for the welfare of the village, for the development of the village, for the strengthening of the democracy.
The awareness that has been created in the villages is the guarantee of UDAY.
Prime Minister Namaskar
I am speaking from Mumbai at Sharmila Gharpur.
I have a question about education in school colleges.
There has been a need to reform the education sector over the years.
For example, not having enough schools or colleges or not having quality education.
Today, if there is any first dream of parents in every family, then it is a good education for the children.
The idea of home, vehicle and everything comes after everyone.
And for a country like India, this feeling of public mind is a great strength.
There should be greater concern and greater awareness about good education for children.
And the children also become aware that I go to school for this purpose.
And so, first of all, I would urge all the parents that they should talk to the child in detail about the activities happening in the school.
And if something is noticed, go to school and talk to teachers.
This sense of responsibility can also reduce many evils of our education system.
So in a way, the effort to spread education all around was a priority.
And it was also necessary.
But now the more important the spread is to improve our education system.
We have done a great job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
With the literacy campaign, now better education has to be our priority.
Admission, admission, admission and the formula continue to resonate, but now the children who have reached school, we have to focus on good education, right education.
You must have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to emphasize on good education.
But it is true that there is a need to bring about reforms in the system.
This time in the budget, you must have seen that the work has been done with chilos.
In the Budget, 10 Government Universities and 10 Private Universities have been asked to get rid of Government dams and come up on a challenging path. Come, tell us what you want to become the top university.
This scheme has been formulated with the intention of giving full freedom to them.
Indian universities can also become global competitive universities.
At the same time, skill is as important as education.
Similarly, technology will also play a big role in education.
Distance learning and technology will also make our education easy.
And I am confident that the results will be visible in the near future.
People have been asking me about something for a long time.
Some people write on the web portal MyGov.
Some people write to me on the Narendra Modi app, and most of these youngsters write to me.
In today's era, sports plays an important role in addition to teaching for the youth.
So one day I had also visited you and I would like to talk to all of you.
As a result, I have just called a meeting in which the head of the NCC, the head of the NSS, the head of the Scouts Guides, the head of the Red Cross and Nehru was from the youth center.
And when I asked them when they had met earlier, they said- "Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-da.
I have benefitted only in my childhood and I also believe that these organizations should give a new life and a new strength should be irrigated.
This time I have placed a few topics in front of them.
I have asked them: brother, why should our youth and all the organizations not do a great job of water conservation in this season
What programs can we set up to connect the country
What could be the common youth song of all our organizations
What new things can be added to their work culture and program
If you write to my Narendra Modi App, I will send it to the right place.
Such a situation will certainly emerge.
My dear countrymen, today, let me tell you that we are compelled to think.
I also see it as a disturbing thing to people.
You must have seen that the political situation in our country is such that in the last several elections, it used to be discussed as to which party would give gas cylinders.
And every political party felt that if it was to reach the middle class in terms of elections, then the issue of gas cylinders was a big issue.
On the other hand, economists used to insist on reducing subsidies.
And because of this, several committees used to sit and suggestions were made to reduce the subsidy on gas.
These committees used to cost crores of rupees.
But the matter used to remain there.
This experience belongs to everyone.
But there was never a thought outside it.
My dear countrymen, today, I am happy to inform you all that I have adopted the third path.
One crore families voluntarily gave up their gas subsidy.
But after counting, it was found that there were more than 80 per cent of these families who had given the distributors themselves in the country, who were in the queue and were able to get their subsidies through the writers.
This one incident has forced the economists of the country to think in a new way.
And if this happens to the world's economies, then the results will be there.
For them too, this is an event outside the confines of their ideas, who will have to think about it.
I would like to especially urge the entire political class to do something that gives us the confidence of the people everywhere.
You have never thought that we will get such results.
And we should go in this direction.
Trust those who are sending the marks by giving their exams.
Sometimes I feel that we should announce that today there will be no ticket checker on the route of the railway track.
Each newspaper and news channel carries news of breaking news.
Is there nothing better with us in a country of 1.25 billion people
Please change this situation.
Abdul Kalam used to always say that only positive news was printed on the first page of the newspaper.
He used to keep saying this thing continuously.
A few days ago, a newspaper had also written to me, "We have decided that on Monday we will not give any negative news.
Good news becomes the biggest reason for good news.
However, it is true that the more we strengthen the goodness, the less space will be for our evils.
If I light a lamp, then darkness shall be removed, and it shall come to pass.
You can also contribute in it.
Ravi ji has given a good suggestion but please do not get angry with me.
Let us all try to make a positive difference and try to make a positive difference.
The specialty of our country is the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Congregation can also become a point of attraction.
Very few people around the world would know that crores of people would come to the bank of river for such a long time.
For the last two days, I have been seeing that many people are uploading the pictures of Simhastha Kumbha.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India, the tourism department of the state government to compete with it.
Photo contests, and tell people to upload beautiful photos in a beautiful way.
How the atmosphere will be created and people will also come to know about the diversity of the Kumbh Mela.
So this can definitely be done.
Friends, it is true that the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh met me and he used to say that we have laid special emphasis on cleanliness.
And cleanliness will not be there only.
People from there also carry the message of cleanliness.
I believe that this Kumbh may be a religious-religious, spiritual fair but we can also make it a social opportunity.
We should also do this thing that how the love for water should increase, how the faith towards water should increase, how we can use this Kumbh to send a message of water conservation.
My dear countrymen, on this important day of Panchayati Raj, I am going to meet you once again in the evening.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
You might remember that last time I had discussed about a book on the stories of Premchand ji and we had decided that whatever book you read will be shared with everyone through the Narendra Modi App.
I have seen that a large number of people have shared a lot of information about several types of books.
I am happy that people are discussing and writing on several subjects like science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade, lifestyle etc.
Right, I will definitely talk to you about some other books.
But I have to accept one thing that now I am unable to give a lot of time to read books.
But one advantage is that I need to know about the many books that you write and write.
But with the experience of last month, I feel that we have to take it forward.
Why should we create a permanent book corner on the Narendra Modi App and whenever we read new books, write about it and discuss it
And you can also suggest a good name for this book corner.
I want these books to become an active platform for corner readers and writers.
You keep reading and writing and sharing it with all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
A number of effective efforts are underway for water conservation across the country.
People have shared traditional practices and solutions.
The media has also respected several innovative campaigns on water conservation.
Be it the government, NGOs, all are doing something on the battlefield.
Seeing the power of collectiveness, the mind is feeling very satisfied and satisfied.
For example, the enthusiasm shown by the villagers of Aara Keram village of Oralazi block, far from Ranchi in Jharkhand, has become an example for everyone.
You all will be happy to know that the beautiful state of India, Meghalaya has become the first state in the country to formulate its water policy-water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, the cultivation of those crops which require less water is also not harmful to the farmers.
I would especially like to congratulate the Haryana Government for communicating with the farmers and inspiring them to practice traditional farming and to cultivate low-water crops.
Now the time for festivals has come.
Many fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals.
Why not use this fair for water conservation
Friends, Some of the things in life enthused us and especially the achievements of the children, their valour, give us new energy. And that is why today I feel like talking about some children and these children are - Nidhi Bipottu, Monish Joshi, Devshi Rawat, Dhanush Jain, Harsha Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Arunesh Ganguly and Hritik Ala-Manda.
Whatever I will say about them will fill you with pride and enthusiasm.
We all know that cancer is a word that scares the whole world.
It seems that death stands on the threshold of death, but all these ten children have not only defeated deadly diseases like cancer, but their bravery has also brought the name of India to the world.
In fact, the World Children's Women's Games were held in Moscow this month.
It is a unique sports competition where people take part in the Young Cancer Service or those who have come out of the fight against cancer.
The competition saw competitions such as shooting, chess, swimming, running, football and table tennis.
All ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament.
Some of them won medals in more than one sport.
My dear countrymen, I firmly believe that you must have been proud of the achievements of India, across the skies, in space.
Sanjiv Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.K. from Telangana.
Arvindrao, many from different parts of the country have written to me on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and have urged to discuss Chandrayaan-2 in the Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, from the point of view of space, 2019 has been very good for India.
In March, our scientists launched the A-SAT and then Chandrayaan-2.
In the run-up to the elections, there was no further discussion of big and important news such as A-SAT.
In just three minutes from the A-SAT missile, we have the capability to break the satellite three hundred kilometers away.
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve this feat and now on 22nd July, the whole country proudly saw that Chandrayaan-2 took a lead from Sriharikota to space.
But if you ask me what two big lessons I received from Chandrayaan 2, I will say it is the two lessons Faith Fearlessness.
We should have faith in our talent and capacity. We should have faith in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is fully Indian in colour.
It is an Indian in the spirit and purpose.
It is entirely an indigenous mission.
The way our scientists have launched Chandrayaan-2 in a record time, working day and night to fix all technical problems is unprecedented.
The whole world saw this great penance of scientists.
We also have to face temporary setbacks in our lives. But always remember that we have the strength to overcome them.
I am confident that Chandrayaan-2 will inspire the youth of the country for science and innovation.
At the end, science is the path to development.
Now we are eagerly awaiting the month of September, when Lander Vikram and Rover Pragyan will land on the surface of the Moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share a very interesting competition with the students and young friends of the country and invite the youth of the country for a quiz competition.
Space inquiries, India's Space Mission, Science and Technology will be the key themes of this quiz competition, such as what needs to be done to quit the rocket.
How the satellite is installed in orbit and what information do we get from the satellite, what is the A-SAT and many things are there in it.
I urge my young friends, students, to participate in this quiz competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with your participation.
I especially urge schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work harder to ensure victory for their schools.
Encourage all students to join it and the most exciting thing is that the Government of India will take the students who have the highest marks in each state to Sriharikota at their own expense and in September they will get an opportunity to witness the moment when Chandrayaan would be landing on the surface of the moon.
This will be a historic event for the winning students of their lives.
But for that, you will have to participate in the quiz competition, the highest number of points and you will have to win.
Friends, You must have heard this suggestion from me - this is a joyous occasion.
My dear countrymen, you must have noticed one thing.
Our Mann Ki Baat has given momentum to the Swachhata Abhiyan from time to time and similarly the efforts made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that began five years ago today, with the participation of the people, is setting new benchmarks for cleanliness.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal condition in cleanliness. But the way the Swachhata Campaign has been successful in public places, it is the strength of the resolve of 130 crore Indians, but we will not stop it at all.
This movement is now moving from cleanliness to beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching the story of Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has left his job in the United States and returned to serve Mother India.
He has taken upon himself the task of not only making Delhi clean but also making it beautiful some time ago.
He along with his team started with the dustbin of Lodhi Garden.
Through the medium of street art, he has done the work of decorating many areas of Delhi with beautiful paintings.
From the over bridges and school walls to the hutments, when he started digging the town, he got the support of the people and the sequence started.
You might remember how Prayagraj was also decorated with street paintings during Kumbh.
I came to know that Bhai Yogesh Saini and his team played a big role in this.
There may not be any sound in the colours and the lines, but the message of the rainbow that emanates from the images shows us more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this in the beauty of the Swachhata Abhiyan.
It is very important for us that the culture of making waste to wealth develops in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of turning waste into wealth.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very interesting comment on MyGov.
This comment came from a brother Mohammed Aslam who lives in the shops in Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote - I like to listen to Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am happy to share that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobilization Programme - Back to Village in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was held in the month of June.
I feel that such programs should be organized every three months.
At the same time, there should be an online monitoring system for the program.
In my view, this was the first such programme in which the public interacted directly with the government.
After reading the message sent by Bhai Mohammed Aslam ji and after reading it, my eagerness to know about the Back to Village programme increased. And when I came to know about it in detail, I felt that the entire country should also know about it.
This programme shows how eager, enthusiastic are the people of Kashmir joining the mainstream of development.
The event lasted for the week and was briefed in detail by the government officials in all the 4,500 panchayats of the state.
How can Panchayats be strengthened
How can their income be increased
What can be the impact of their services in the lives of the common man The villagers also showed their problems without any hesitation.
Friends, In this program, there was not a mere saying that the officers would return to the villages throughout the day. However, this time the officers spent two days and one night in the panchayat, they got the opportunity to spend their time in the village.
Several other things have also been added to make the program interesting.
Under Khelo India, sports for children was organized.
Further, Sports kits, Job Cards of MNREGA and SC-ST certificates were also distributed.
The people of Kashmir became an opportunity partner in this festival of development.
It is heartening to note that the Back to Village programme was also organized in remote villages where the government officials had to travel one day or one and a half days on foot to reach out to the hill through difficult terrains.
The officers also reached out to the border panchayats, which are often located across the border and are located in far-flung areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts without any fear.
Some officers were so overwhelmed by their welcome that they had been staying in the village for more than two days.
Such programs and peoples participation in it shows that our brothers and sisters in Kashmir want good governance, it also proves that the power of development always depends on the power of the bomb blast.
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred and create obstacles in the path of development will never succeed in their nefarious designs.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya, the recipient of the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented the month of Shravan in one of his poems.
In this poem, he has said: It means, the flow of rain and water is unique, and the earth is enchanted by its beauty.
Throughout India, people of different cultures and languages celebrate Shravan month as their own.
Whenever we look around us in this season, it seems as if the earth has covered the greenery.
Meanwhile, the festival of Raksha Bandhan is also a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
When it comes to the month of Shravan, you will be happy to know that in the last four years, the highest number of devotees have participated in the Amarnath Yatra.
Since 1st July, more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
In 2015, more than the number of pilgrims who had participated in this journey of 60 days, this time it has been in just 28 days.
I would like to especially praise the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return from the journey, they appreciate the warmth and intimacy of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I was told that in Uttarakhand too, since the start of the Chardham Yatra this year, more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within a month and a half.
After the severe disaster in 2013, for the first time such a record number of pilgrims reached there.
I appeal to all of you to visit those parts of the country whose beauty blossoms immensely during the monsoon.
There cannot be a greater teacher than tourism and travel to see this beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and vibrant month of Shravan brings new energy, new hope and new hope to all of you.
Similarly, the month of August reminds us of uit India.
However, when we watch TV, we can see only one aspect of rainfall - floods, flooding, traffic jams on TV.
Thanks a lot to all of you.
I also want to join you in this journey.
The more you worry about your children's exams, the more worry I am.
But if we change the way we look at the exam then perhaps we will be free from worry.
In my last Mann Ki Baat, I had said that I am happy to share your experience and suggestions on the Narendra Modi App.
Teachers, whose career has been very successful, have written to me several relevant topics on their parents and society.
What I have heard, what I have read, what I have told me, I will also talk about it.
How many of those things I feel will be remembered
I want to tell you the message that Bharat Ratna Shriman Sachin Tendulkar has given to the youth of India is proud of.
You must work hard but you must set a real goal for yourself and try to achieve that goal.
When I was in cricket, I had a lot of expectations from me.
So it was very important for me to find a solution.
So I thought that I will keep expecting from others and will accomplish my goal.
But it fulfills my own goal and is fulfilling it. So, I am definitely doing something good for the country.
And I always tried to achieve that goal.
My focus was on speaking and the goal was gradually achieved.
I will tell you that it is very important for you, your thoughts to be positive.
Why is the competition
Why not contest
Why should we waste our time in competing with others
Why dont we compete with ourselves
Why dont we decide to break all our old records
You go, no one can stop you from moving forward.
And when you break your old records then you will find that you do not have any expectation of happiness, of satisfaction, of a lot of satisfaction.
Friends do not consider the exam to be a game of statistics.
Do not get stuck in the accounts of those who have reached.
Life should be connected with a great purpose.
We should work with dreams, we should make a pledge.
Whether these examinations are going to be right or not, their calculations are on whether our speed is right or not.
And so if the dream is huge and grand, then the test will become a celebration of its happiness.
Each exam will be a step towards fulfilling this great purpose.
Every success will be the key to achieving that great goal.
And therefore, what will happen this year, do not limit yourself to what will happen in such exams.
Take a very big purpose and if there is nothing less than expected then there will be no disappointment.
And there will be courage to make efforts with greater strength.
Thousands of people have written to me smaller things than the mobile phone on my app.
Shreya Gupta emphasized that a healthy mind is there in a healthy body.
Along with your studies, the students should also take care of your health so that you can write in a healthy way in the exam.
Now, on the last day, I would not like to say that you should start a debate and go for a run of three kilometers, five kilometers.
But one thing is true, especially in the days of examinations, how you spend your days.
Our routine 365 days should be unique to our dreams and resolutions.
I agree with Shri Prabhakar Reddy, who has urged him to sleep on time and to revive the whale in the morning.
Enrolment into the Examination Venue and other items should be kept in mind.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said, I may not dare to say this because I am a bit sad about sleeping.
And many of my friends complain to me that you sleep very little.
And this is possible.
I am not talking about being asleep.
If there is a slight problem in our body as well as in the part of our body then you must have seen that the whole body does not experience ease.
Not only this, our daily routine also gets disrupted.
And that is why do not consider any thing as small.
You will not be caught in the habit of getting an agreement with the Jews, which is certain.
Please decide, do it.
Friends, Sometimes I have seen that the students who go for examination have two types of students.
You must have seen these two types of students.
If someone can do this thing better than me, then it is the master to check and check the big players of the world who have checked out.
Champion Viswanathan Anand will be his experience.
Come, learn from them how to check in this examination.
Hello, I would like to begin by conveying my best wishes to Viswanathan Anand, first of all.
I will talk a little about my examinations and their experiences.
Problems arising in life after examinations are similar.
When you play, you do not know what is going to be done now. As you do not know in class, what is the question of examination.
If you are calm, healthy, and have taken enough sleep, then the right answer will be the moment that will give you the mind.
So stay calm.
Do not put too much pressure on yourself, do not keep too much expectations. This is very important.
Look at this as a challenge - I remember what I was taught during the year, I could solve the problems.
In the last few minutes, the topics that you don't remember very well, pass through those important topics.
You may recall some of the details with your teachers or students, which will help you in writing in the exam.
If you repeat difficult questions, they will be fresh in your mind, and you will be able to write better about them in the examination.
Therefore, be calm, take a very deep sleep, do not rinse in superstitions, and do not lethargic. There is a fear in the beginning, but I have been able to successfully complete these examinations.
Therefore, you must have complete faith in the system.
Viswanathan Anand has indeed done a very important thing.
Sometimes we used to hear about the events of Arjun's life - how did he look at the eyes of the bird
If you are passing through sad sadness, if you are spending the last moments in books, then you will not be able to feel calm.
Let us laugh, let us laugh, let us laugh, let us laugh, let us laugh, let us laugh, let us together create an atmosphere of peace.
Just imagine, you stand at a pond, and beautiful things are seen in the pond.
But if suddenly a stone is thrown into some water and water starts flowing, then what can be seen in the beautiful things seen in the pond
If the water is calm, things may not be so deep.
But if the water is disturbed then nothing can be seen below.
Then I feel, no, I'll be fine if it's a bit light.
So I have developed my own technology.
It is possible that this is my experience, which will also help you.
Rajat Agarwal, has said a good thing.
He writes on my app- We should feel light with friends and family for at least half an hour everyday. He has said this very important thing because often we see that when we come to the exam, we sit to count how wrong it is.
We get trapped in that.
Friends, don't do this.
Spend half an hour coming out of this.
Rajat ji's point is really something to understand.
While explaining this in the present context, Ramcharitmanas tried to convey this message to the country and the world.
Such a revered muraribapu has also sent a very important drop to the students.
And he is not only a teacher but also a thinker. And that is why there is a combination of his words.
I have experienced that we can be happy and happy with the acceptance of the situation.
If you go ahead with a stress-free and happy mind in your exams, you will surely succeed. And even if you do not succeed, there will not be a loss of glans and there will also be pride in being successful.
I am also grateful to the venerable Shri Muraribabu that he has given us a very good message.
Friends, Today I want to tell you one more thing.
I have been seeing that this time the people who have told me about their experiences have definitely discussed Yoga.
Well friends, let me make it clear today that if I start practicing Yoga tomorrow morning, it will be unfair to you.
But it is true that Yoga is the key to the journey of development of a mind-set, be it in the life of a student or in the life of an individual.
Simple key.
Look, if you can do it.
I have a lot of faith in it.
It's not like that.
But if we read the instructions then perhaps we will co-operate with us, yes, yes, yes, let us go the same way.
And I would like to urge you that if you go to this facility for five minutes then you must read the information.
When I read it for the first time, I felt that I do not know it again, but when I read the same thing again then I noticed that no question is asked in another way. But this is the same thing that I am not able to understand the questions.
Rao, he emphasized on patience.
In very few words, a very good message has been given to all the students.
Come, listen to the message of Rao Saheb.
From Bangalore to C.
N.
R.
Come on, let me tell you.
I believe that it is natural to get worried due to the examination.
And this is the competitive exam.
Do not worry, do a good job.
I say the same to my young friends.
Always remember that there are many opportunities in this country.
Like mountains and trees, you also have the right to be here.
You should have conviction, loyalty and penance.
With this quality, you will succeed in every exam and other effort.
How is it a way of talking about a scientist
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
What he has said about dedication, penance and determination is the same thing.
If you are in trouble, you will also be afraid.
And a golden future is waiting for you to do good work.
Now my interest on the app has given a message about the experience of the Right Exam.
He said that his family is constantly trying to create a positive environment at the time of examination.
It is true that Sachin ji also spoke of a positive approach, a positive frame of mind.
We are studying in our course on Themas Elevation, a discovery of an electric bulb.
But friends, how many years have they taken to do this thing How many times have they failed, how much time has passed, how much money has gone, how disappointed have they been due to failure
But today that electricity, that bulb also illuminates our lives.
This is what we say: failure has the potential to succeed.
Who doesnt know Shrinivas Ramanujacharya, one of the modern mathematicians - Indian mathematicians, you must be aware.
His formal education did not include any special training on mathematics.
But he made immense contributions in various fields like Mathematical Analysis, Number Three etc.
K.
Rolling is a great example that success can be achieved anywhere.
Harry Potter series is popular all over the world today, but it was not the case at the beginning.
They had to bear a lot of difficulties.
Rolling said that he used to put in full energy in the difficulties which was really important for him.
Nowadays the examination is being conducted not only for the students but also for the entire school and the teacher.
But without the support of parents and teachers, the situation is not good.
Whether it is teachers, parents or senior students, all of them together form a team and move forward in a planned manner with the same idea, the examination becomes easy.
Shri Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the app - he has complained that parents should never pressurize them to bring more marks on their children.
They should be encouraged only for preparation.
If the child is talking to his friend, do not stop it.
Create a light-hearted environment, create a positive environment, be it your father or daughter, see how much Confidence comes.
You will also be able to see that conference.
Friends, One thing is certain, especially I want to tell my young friends that the life of our people has changed a lot over the generations to come.
Every moment, new inventions, new technology, and science seem to have a colourful look.
And we are not just overwhelmed.
We also like to join it. We want to move beyond science.
I am doing this because today is National Science Day.
The countrys Science Festival is celebrated on 28th February as the National Science Day.
28 February, 128 Sir C.
Raman for his discovery of the Raman Effect.
He received the Nobel Prize for this research.
Therefore, the country celebrates 28th February as National Day.
Science belongs to the people of science.
And new inventions are not possible without science and technology.
On this National Science Day, the country emphasized on new inventions.
Knowledge and technology should become an integral part of our developmental journey.
And this time the theme of National Science Day is Make in India Science and Technology Driven Innovations.
Friends, Sometimes the successes achieved and the vision of the world can change when they succeed.
If you are very busy in the exam, you might be wondering that many news stories have not been mentioned in your mind.
But I also want to tell the countrymen this thing again.
You must have heard of a few days ago that science has become a very big and important discovery in the world.
The world's scientists worked hard, the generations to come, did something and after about a hundred years, a success was achieved.
The discovery of the Gravitational Waves was revealed to the men of our scientists.
This research is a far-reaching success of science.
This discovery does not only prove to be the theory of Einstein's great scientist of the last century, but is considered to be a great Discovery of Physics.
This entire humanity will work for the whole world.
But as an Indian, we are happy that the sons of our country were involved in the entire process of invention.
Our scientists will strive to advance research in the future too.
India will also be a part of global efforts.
And my countrymen, in the last few days, an important decision has been taken.
In order to achieve more success in this research, the government has decided to open the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory section in India.
Connecting India will give a new strength and a new momentum to this process.
India will certainly be an active participant in this highly scientific research process of human welfare in the midst of limited resources.
Once again, I salute all the scientists and wish them the very best.
From tomorrow you can listen to my Mann Ki Baat by tweeting on that number.
You will also be able to hear it in your mother tongue.
There are 8108 - 8108 again, I say this again.
81908 - 81908 documents are under examination.
You know, brother, tomorrow is a budget.
Day after tomorrow we all celebrated Christmas and now the preparations are going on for the New Year's reception.
India is full of diversity.
In a way, every festival takes place while waiting for the second festival.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country with a festival economy.
This becomes the reason for economic activities of the poor sections of the society.
On my behalf, my best wishes to all the countrymen on Christmas (Natal) and also on the New Year of 2016.
May the year 2016 bring great happiness to all of you.
New hopes, new zeal and new resolutions take you to a new height.
Ganesh V from Pune.
Sawleshwarakar has written to me that this is the weather of tourists.
A large number of tourists from India and abroad come here.
People also go out to celebrate the holidays of Christmas.
The cleaner our tourist places, the better the image of India will be in the world.
I welcome Ganeshji's ideas and convey Ganeshji's message to the countrymen.
Anyway, we say "Guest God Bhava" when a guest is about to arrive here.
Also, in our tourist places, in the destinations of tourists, in our places of pilgrimage, it is indeed a matter of great importance.
As such, they are ordinary artisans and craftsmen and workers.
He has done a unique job that the newspaper has published his story.
And when that thing came to my mind, I also felt that this thing should reach you.
In Bhojpura, he built 100 toilets so far, considering that this work is sacred without his hard work and hard work.
I heartily thank Dilip Singh Malaviya for this.
Sometimes we hear about pessimism about the country.
And this is the thing that takes the country forward and it seems very natural for him to be proud of Dilip Singh in Mann Ki Baat.
This is the result of the tireless efforts of many people that the country is progressing rapidly.
With a step in step, 1.25 billion Indians are moving ahead with a step forward and are also pushing the country forward.
New opportunities for better education, better skills and employment.
It is a great task for the common man to provide easy loans under the MUDRA Yojana to those who could never access the bank's doors.
Who can forget the occasion of Yashoda Mata and Krishna when Balkrishna opened his mouth and showed the entire universe to Mother Yashoda.
This event has made India a place of pride in Yoga.
In a way, cleanliness is happening at home.
Citizens participation is also increasing.
The extent to which the village will have electricity after so many years of independence, the extent to which the villages will be electrified, the enthusiasm and the zeal with which the villages will be electrified, the people living in the cities will never be able to access electricity.
I am confident that the media will reach out to such villages and therefore the biggest benefit will be that the employees of the government will be so satisfied and will be so happy that they have done something that is going to bring about a change in the life of a village.
Whether the farmer, the poor, the youth, the women, should all these services be accessible or not
Therefore, it should not be reached that no government has worked and no government has worked.
But it should be reached so that if they are entitled to this, then do not let them go.
They should also get information so that they can get their rights
We should all try to ensure that the right thing, the good thing, the work of the honest man should reach as many people as possible.
This is also a service.
I have made a small effort to do this thing in my own way.
I can't do anything alone.
But should I do something out of what I am doing, right?
A common citizen can also join me by downloading the Narendra Modi app on his mobile phone.
And I keep sharing these small things with them.
And it is a matter of great happiness for me that people also tell me a lot of things.
How will I reach without your help ?
Come, let us together convey our best wishes to the common man, convey our best wishes to the common man and motivate them for their hard work.
This was followed by a discussion in all departments of the Government.
My young friends, on the 16th of January, the Government of India is going to launch a comprehensive action plan for Start-up India and Stand-Up India.
And in this program, IIT, IIM, Central Universities, NITs, wherever the youth are from across the country, they will be linked to this program through live connectivity.
For example, be it a digital world or an IT business, these start-ups are for them.
No, we have to change it according to the requirements of India.
I'll get the market.
Similarly is the intellectual property of our youth limited to some cities ?
This thinking is wrong.
Young people in every corner of India have talent, they should get a chance to chimney.
Start-up India and Stand-Up India should not be limited to just a few cities.
And I also urge the state governments to take it forward.
On 16th January, I will definitely be present before you and will discuss this in detail and your suggestions will always be welcome.
Dear young friends, On the 12th of January, we mark the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
Those who are getting inspiration from Swami Vivekanand Ji.
15th to 12th January is celebrated as Swami Vivekananda Jayanti (National Youth Festival) National Youth Festival.
This year it will be held from 12th January to 16th January in Rampur, Chhattisgarh.
And I have come to know that this is his theme because this theme is based on theme. It is very good. I have been told that more than 10,000 youth from all the states, from every corner of India are going to gather here.
The youth of India is about to create a panorama.
In a way, dreams have to be fulfilled.
The resolve is to be realized.
Can you suggest me about this Youth Festival ?
I would especially urge my young friends that the Narendra Modi App is there.
So I will wait for you friends to know your thoughts about the youth festival on the Narendra Modi App.
Dilip Chauhan of Ahmedabad Gujarat, a visual challenging teacher, celebrated the Accessible India Day in his school.
He has phoned me and expressed his feelings, Sir, and in my school he has celebrated the Accessible India Campaign.
We had enjoyed the school and had inspired and encouraged the children to help the differently abled in the society.
I think this was the first time that you had done it.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
And you are working in this field yourself.
You understand these things very well and you will be facing a lot of difficulties.
There are times when there is an opportunity to meet such a person in the society, we have a lot of ideas.
We also express our vision of going to them according to our thinking.
For such people, many words have been used in the world, but there has always been a reflection on the words.
Every time people feel that the word does not appear to be good, it does not seem honorable for them.
When Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan was launched by the Government of India this year, I was about to attend it.
But I had planned to visit some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially those districts where I could not attend the launch event that day.
But he wanted to attend the event and kept thinking in my mind.
At that time I had thought in my mind that God, who has caused some loss in the body, has caused some damage, some that works properly, even the organs are called handicapped and we know the form of a handicapped person.
But if we come to know about him then we can see his shortcomings in his eyes, but God has given him some special ability.
After that I thought that through eyes we feel that they are disabled, but they feel that they have some extra power.
And after that when I came to my mind why should I not use the word Divyang in our country instead of handicappedness ?
These are the people who have a part that is more than one organ, which has a divinity, a divine stream that is not present in us, not with the normal body.
I like this word very well.
Can we, my countrymen, make use of the word 'Divyang' instead of 'Divyang'
I hope that you will take this matter forward.
We have launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
Under this, both physical as well as indirect, will improve the inter-disciplinary approach and make it accessible to the Divyangjan.
Be it the schools, bus stations, railway stations, ramps, easy parking, accessible lift, braille script, all these things are incomparable.
In order to make their availability easier, they need innovation, technology, system and sensitivity.
We have taken up this task.
People's participation is also being received.
They should not die in the files.
Recently, the Government of India has made an effort to ensure that the beneficiaries of the schemes get easy access to the schemes.
Subsidy is provided in gas cylinders in our country.
The government has made some changes in this.
Be it Jan Dhan account or Aadhaar card, the world's largest, Largest Direct Benefit Transfer scheme, the scheme will directly transfer the subsidy to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
The scheme is known as PAHAL and the experiment has been very successful.
By the end of 9th November, nearly 15 crore cooking gas consumers have become beneficiaries of PAHAL scheme.
The government money has been directly transferred into the bank accounts of 14 crore people.
No middlemen, no recommendations, no scope for corruption.
On one hand, the campaign of Aadhaar card, opening of Jan Dhan accounts on the other, and on the other hand, the state government and the Government of India together will prepare a list of the beneficiaries.
So far, about 40 thousand crore rupees have been directly transferred to the beneficiary's account through various schemes.
I am aware that about 35 to 40 projects are being directly linked to Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, on the 26th of January, a golden moment of the Republic Day, it is also a happy coincidence that this time marks the 125th birth anniversary of the founding father of our Constitution, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
There was a special discussion on the Constitution in the Parliament for two days and it was a very good experience.
All the parties, all the MPs spoke at length about the sanctity of the Constitution, the importance of the constitution, and understanding the constitution in true terms.
We should take this matter forward.
Can the Republic Day truly connect the people with the system
Our Constitution gives us a lot of rights and it should be done in a natural manner.
But the Constitution lays emphasis on duty and duty too.
But it has been seen that the discussion of duty is very limited.
Very often, when there are elections, all around there are publicity, all around the walls are written, hoardings are put in place that it is our sacred duty to cast votes.
There is a lot of duty during the time of voting, but why should not there be a talk of duty in the natural life also ?
As we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 26th January this year, can we organize essay competitions, poetry competitions, lectures etc. in schools, colleges, villages, different societies, organizations etc
If 1.25 billion Indians step by step then how big a history can be created.
Can you send it to me
I want to know your ideas.
Send it to me on my portal MyGov.
I would certainly like to know what the younger generation of my country thinks about the duty
I feel like making a small suggestion.
As we celebrate Republic Day on the 26th of January, we have images of great men in our cities, whether by citizens, by school-college students.
And I am not saying this for the government.
Can we make it our natural habit as a society and as a country
On 26th January, all of us together try to honour the statues of such great souls, to clean the premises and to clean up the premises with ease by the citizens.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2016.
Who would have got the opportunity to visit
And with the new zeal and enthusiasm, business will also start.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas will also begin.
Festivals have their own importance in social life.
Each and every corner of the world is constantly receiving news of natural disasters and reports of natural disasters that have never been heard or contemplated.
People are also experiencing how rapidly the impact of climate change is increasing.
Many have died.
I convey my condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
The State Governments are fully engaged in relief operations.
The central government is also always working hand in hand.
Now a team from the Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But when we look at the crisis around, we need to bring about a lot of change in it.
15 years ago, Natural disasters were part of Agriculture Department as more and more natural disasters were limited to drought.
Today, its form has changed.
At every level, it has become imperative to work on our capacity building.
Governments, civil society, citizens, every small and big institution must work in a very scientific manner to build capacity.
I spoke to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif, after the Nepal earthquake.
And I had suggested to them that we should jointly organize a joint exercise on disaster preparedness by the SAARC countries.
I am happy that a table-top exercise and the workshop for Best Practices in SAARC countries concluded in Delhi.
A good start.
Today I got the phone call from Jalandhar, Punjab.
(I speak from the district Jalandhar in Punjab.
We do organic farming here and guide many people.
I was very happy to hear your message, Lakhwinder Singh ji.
Not only this, you know the problem of farmers.
And your concern is true but this does not happen only in Punjab Haryana.
This is our custom in the whole of India and we have traditionally followed the path of burning the residue of our crops.
But the pain that you have expressed is true.
First of all, we have to train our farmer brothers and sisters.
But this is not the truth.
Crop residues are also very valuable.
It itself is a biological fertilizer.
We dedicate that to the nation.
Moreover, if a small piece of it is planted, then it becomes a dry fruit for the animals.
Secondly, the upper layer of the land gets burnt due to burning.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Just imagine that our bones are strong, our heart is strong, our kidneys are good and everything is fine, but what will happen if the skin on the body burns
We cant survive even if our hearts are on the Move.
The upper layer of our soil is burnt, which leads to the destruction of our fertile land.
And that is why we should make positive efforts.
Even if these shits are coated once again on the ground, it becomes fertilizer.
Or if some water is poured in a pit and mixed with molasses then it becomes a good type of bio-fertilization.
Moreover, if the fertilizer made on the ground is made in it, it will be of double benefit.
I once had the opportunity to interact with the farmers who had been engaged in banana cultivation.
And he told me a good experience.
Earlier, when he used to cultivate bananas and when the banana crop was finished, he had to spend five thousand, ten thousand and fifteen thousand rupees per hectare.
And as long as the people carrying it did not come with the tractor-butter, they used to remain the same.
But some farmers have proved that they have broken 6-6, 8-8 inches into the ground.
The water that is in that pit, keeps the crop alive.
Dear Countrymen, The International Day of Persons with Disabilities will be remembered by the whole world on the 3rd December.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had a discussion on organ donation.
I also discussed the issue of the NATO helpline for organ donation.
29th November is considered as the Indian Organization Day of Donation.
Film actor Ravina Tandon and many others joined.
Body donation can save precious lives.
When a part of the body goes from one body to the other, that part gets a new lease of life but that part gets a new lease of life.
I am confident that there will be greater awareness in this field as well and help the needy in the truest sense because no one can donate it anywhere else.
I have said earlier that 3rd December is celebrated as Disabled Day.
He is also a physically and mentally challenged person and has an exceptional courage and capability.
Sometimes there is pain when they have fun.
Sometimes the feeling of compassion and kindness are expressed.
But if we change our outlook and look at them, then these people can inspire us to live.
Inspire to do something.
We cry even if we face a small problem.
Then I remember how my problem is very small, how does it work
And so these are all sources of inspiration for us.
Their way of struggling with the life of those who could not make their resolve, and the crisis, is also commendable.
Javed Ahmad, I want to talk to him today.
40-42 years of age.
In 1976, the terrorists shot Javed Ahmad in Kashmir.
The ability to stand on his feet went on for a while but Javed Ahmad did not accept defeat.
The scourge of terrorism cannot be defeated.
The body does not support them, but for 20 years they have immersed themselves in the study of children.
How can there be improvement in infrastructure for physically handicapped people ?
How to develop facilities for handicappedness in government offices at public places ?
They are working on it.
They also turned their studies in that direction.
He earned his Master's Degree in Social Work and became the messenger of the differently-abled as a social worker and is leading a silent revolution today.
Shouldn't we be able to inspire Javed's life in every corner of India
I specially remember the life and penance of Javed Ahmed Ji on 3rd December.
In the absence of time, even though I talk of Javed, the lamp of such inspiration has been illuminated in every corner of India.
They are spreading new light of living and showing the way.
3rd December is an opportunity to draw inspiration from all of them by remembering them.
Be it the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the dalits, the exploited, the deprived sections of the society, they have to constantly work with the government and the government.
And as a citizen sometimes someone gets a bad experience from a government servant.
And that very bad experience changes our attitude towards the government system throughout life.
Many times we do not even know because it is so easy. We do not know that any government system, any government servant is doing this thing.
In our country, ASHA workers who are network all over the country.
You must have never heard of the discussion on ASHA workers among the people of India.
But when I became the world's renowned family entrepreneur of the Bill Gates Foundation, his success has become an example in the world.
Both Bill Gates and Milinda Gates were given the Padma Vibhushan jointly by us.
They do a lot of social work in India.
Whatever they earn through their lifetime, they are using it for the work of the poor.
In the past, the Government of Odisha honoured one ASHA worker on Independence Day.
Get involved in the treatment on the basis of the primary arrangements that they have been taught.
Emphasis should be on the use of insecticides in every house.
For example, ASHA worker Jamun Mani Singh has been working with dedication to save the entire village from mosquitoes, as the child sleeps well and needs care.
And they have fought against malaria and prepared the entire village to fight it.
There will be so many awards like this.
Millions of people will be around us.
We will look at them with some respect.
Such people become so big in our country.
How big a companion is he in the happiness of the society
I take pride in all such ASHA workers through Jamunmani.
An e-book referring to the inspiring events of Swachh Bharat, ideal of Parliamentarians in terms of village context and health, health etc.
I urge you to look at it.
See, not only show others, but also show them.
Read it and maybe you will feel like adding something like that.
So you must be mygov.
Send it to in.
Such things do not come to our attention very soon but it is right for the society.
Positive and positive energy is the biggest source of energy.
You too, tell the good events - share them.
So you can truly become a social teacher.
The temperature of the Earth should no longer be increased.
It is also the responsibility and concern of everyone.
And this is the first way to save the temperature.
Energy Conservation The 14th December is the National Energy Conservation Day.
Several schemes are being run by the government.
The bulbs are under implementation.
I once said, "On full moon night, one should switch off the street lights and light a full hour in the moonlight."
He should experience the moonlight.
When I got the opportunity to see a link sent by a friend, I understood what I was saying to you.
In Kanpur, a woman named Noorjahan does not seem to have had the privilege of reading more on TV.
But he is doing one such thing which probably no one would have thought about.
They are working to provide light to the poor by using solar energy.
He has set up a committee of women and set up a solar-powered fan plant.
And they pay the rent of 100 rupees a month.
People go to Phans in the evening and come back in the morning for charging again.
And I have heard that people from 500 homes come here in large numbers.
Now see what the biggest people of the world would do for climate change, but a soldier is doing this kind of work to inspire everyone.
And even so, the meaning of Noorjahan is to publish the world.
They are spreading light through this work.
I congratulate Noorjahan and TV too, because he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur to the country and the world.
Congratulations.
I have received a phone call from Shri Abhishek Kumar Pandey from Uttar Pradesh.
We want to know from the Prime Minister how the Mudra Bank that runs on its banks is helping such brave-hearts like us.
Mudra promotes business ventures.
MUDRA creates earning opportunities.
And Mudra is truly empowering.
The Mudra Yojana is being run to help the small entrepreneurs.
However, the speed at which I want to go is still going to come.
But the beginning has been good.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crores under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am glad that out of these 66 lakh women, about 24 lakh are women.
And most of those who have received this help are SC, ST, OBC, and they themselves have worked hard to ensure that they run their families with dignity.
Abhishek himself speaks of his enthusiasm.
Many news stories keep coming to me.
Someone told me that someone in Mumbai is Shailesh Bhonsle.
Under the Mudra scheme, he received a loan of Rs. 8.5 lakh from the bank.
And they started doing business in sweez-dress cleaning.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that the Swachhta Abhiyan is such that new courage will be developed.
And Shailesh Bhonsle did it.
They have brought a tanker, they are working and I am told that in such a short span of time they have paid two lakh rupees to the bank.
Probably this is the purpose under our Mudra Yojana.
But earlier they used to earn more money than interest.
Earlier, due to higher interest and other reasons, the expenditure that was incurred on account of other reasons has now been reduced to about one thousand rupees per month due to the same money being deposited in their hands.
And a good business of his family started growing gradually.
But I want the scheme to be more popular.
Let all our banks be more sensitive and help the smallest of the people.
In fact, these people run the economy of the country.
Only the small workers are the economic potential of the country.
We also want to emphasize upon it.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Sardar Patel Jayanti on 31st October, I talked about Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
These are things that need to be constantly awakened in the social life.
What should be the structure of the program ?
What is clove .
How does public participation increase ?
I had asked for all these suggestions.
I was told that there are many suggestions.
But I look forward to more suggestions.
I expect a lot of concrete projects.
And I have been told that the participants will get the certificates.
It has been announced on a large scale insurance scheme.
You too, run a creative mind.
How can we make this mantra of unity - Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat - the mantra of connecting one Indian
Be it a living person or a grand person or a life or be it an easy one to connect everyone, what should the government do
What should the society do ?
What should civil society do ?
There can be many things.
I am confident that your suggestions will definitely help us.
My dear brothers and sisters, The winter has come.
I urge you to use this good season for a while to keep the body healthy.
And it is necessary to create an environment in the family itself, be it a family festival or an hour-long celebration.
You see, how the spirit comes and how much the body supports the entire day.
If there is good weather then good habits will also fall.
My dear countrymen, once again, greetings to you.
Jai Hind...
My dear countrymen, I salute you all.
Once again I am fortunate to connect with you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Today, India and South Africa are going to host the 5th one-day match in Mumbai.
This category has been named as Gandhi-Mandela series.
And so the importance of the last match has increased a lot.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I want to congratulate the friends of the Kannur Center of All India Radio.
I would like to see such AIR stations across the country turning their attention to such awareness and active people in their area, and our objective of running the country with public participation will get a new strength.
And that is why I heartily congratulate all the friends of Kannur Akashwani Kendra.
In Kerala, students from St. Mary Upper Primary School of Chittoor have written a letter to me.
The letter is special in many ways.
At first, these girls have created a picture of Mother India with their thumb impressions.
The map of India has sent me.
At first, I was very surprised to know why he made the map of India with his thumb impression.
But when I read his letter, I understood how well he gave a symbolic message.
These are the girls who have just tried to make the Prime Minister aware.
They are running mass awareness campaigns for organ donation.
He has also staged plays at many places to understand the difference between the people.
Body donation should be a tendency and activity .
These girls have written to me in the letter that you should appeal to people about the donation in your Mann Ki Baat.
They say organ donation should be made a festival.
Recently, I received a lot of messages on phone call.
Delhi's Devesh ji has also given me a similar message.
The ambitious target of one million organ donation per million population is a very fruitful step taken by the government.
I think this is very important.
The country needs more than 2.5 lakh kidneys, heart and liver donation every year.
But in a country of 1.25 billion people, only 5,000 transfers can be successful.
One lakh eyes need light every year.
And we can reach Keval for 25 thousand years only.
We can give only one before the need for four eyes.
Efforts have also been made to guide the States in this direction.
Some states have made a great effort to reduce the script and speed it up.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is at the forefront in the field of organ donation.
Many social institutions and several voluntary organizations are doing a great job in this direction.
The National Organization for Tissue Transplant Organization-Note has been established to promote organ donation.
A 24x7 helpline 1800 11 40 service is also available.
And it has been said in our country that Teykaten Bhanjitha.
There is a very good description of the joy of sacrificing your life in the mantra of 'Tyukten Bhanjitha'.
A few days ago, we all watched it on TV, Delhi ji.
And that operation was successful.
One life is saved.
Let us realize the true spirit of organ donation and let us speed it up.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Recently, we celebrated Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days I will also celebrate Diwali.
Id is also celebrated and Ganesh Chaturthi is also celebrated.
India-Africa Forum Summit is being organized between 26th and 2nd October in New Delhi, the capital of India.
This is the first time that such a massive event is being organized on the soil of India.
The leaders of the 44 African countries and the Union have been invited.
The Summit is one of the largest gatherings of African countries outside Africa.
The relations between India and Africa are strong.
The more the population of India, the more the population of African countries.
And if we take both of them together then we are the third largest population of the world.
And they say that lakhs of years ago this was the same land.
Later, two volumes of the Indian Ocean were divided.
We have such a good natural resource.
And nearly 2 lakh people of India have been living in this country for a long time.
India has economic relations with African countries, cultural and political relations.
But India plays a very important role in training the youth of most African countries.
Human Resource Development, Capacity Building, More than 25,000 African students are studying in India.
And today there are leaders from many African countries who have studied in India.
So how intense are our relationships
And in that sense, this Summit is very important.
Normally, when the Summit is held, the Heads of States from different countries meet.
Similarly, the Heads of Mission are also scheduled to meet at the Summit.
But we are trying to ensure that the masses are kept in touch with it.
Around 160 schools participated in the event.
It also had schools in India and outside India.
And thousands of school children have written things that will give impetus to India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, an exhibition titled Memoirs of Mahatma Gandhi from Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, is coming from Porbandar to Delhi on the 29th of October, 2018.
Millions of school children witnessed the exhibition.
The people of the village saw how Mahatma Gandhi played a great role in Africa and India's relations. What was the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality on both these lands
How bright the children from schools in our small places are, how comprehensive their vision is, how deeply they think.
As such, this summit is of India-Africa, but we can clearly see the opportunity to connect with the people.
I congratulate dignity, all the children participating in the competition, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
Last time on 15th August, I had made a proposal about the MP Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Later, many MPs fulfilled this task.
Staying in a lot of mind.
A workshop was held in Bhopal last month.
The Sarpanchs of the villages, the Collectors of the villages, several MPs from there, Government of India, State Governments, all discussed in depth the topic of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Many innovative things were noticed and very encouraging things were discovered.
I would like to draw your attention to some of these things.
Jharkhand, in a way, is a very large area, a tribal area.
He selected the Parsi Gram Panchayat in Kunti district of Jharkhand, to be the model village.
It was difficult for the government employees to go there as well.
I congratulate Hon'ble MP, Mr. Karia Munda ji.
In a way, it teaches children how to become teachers in the morning and in the evening.
And they taught and studied about 550 illiterate children.
It is true that there is no budgetary system in the society, no circulars, no special arrangements, but what a big change can be brought about through the village panchayat.
This village is well known for sugarcane production and for Kurtiya jaggery in the state.
Smt. Ruwala ji started the Kurtay jaggery sugarcane festival in this village on 11th March.
People from old public life also came here.
An exhibition was also organized to increase the sale of sugarcane products by the government officials who had worked there.
How to make the village a centre of economic activity, how to sell the village produce, how to sell sand.
Shriman Ruwala ji really deserves to be congratulated for his efforts in making an ideal village as well as a self-reliant village.
My dear brothers and sisters, How can we not talk about cleanliness and cleanliness
Savita Rai of Mumbai has sent a message to me through telephone: "For the preparation of Diwali, we clean our homes every year.
This Diwali is an occasion to keep our house clean as well as the environment outside and also to keep it clean even after Diwali.
He has drawn attention to the truth.
I want to remind you my dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali last year, our country, especially the media, had launched a big campaign and wherever there was a crack in the mud after Diwali, it was not right.
All the media persons carried out a campaign of awareness.
And as a result of that a cleanliness drive was started immediately after Diwali.
So, Savita ji is right that we should do the same after the festival as we worry about before the festival.
It should be done in every public programme.
And today I would especially like to congratulate the entire media world of India.
On 2nd October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, I had the privilege of participating in the cleanliness conference organized by India to Day Group.
He gave the Clean India Awards and I also saw how many activities are going on.
What kind of people are working for this mission themselves
What are the places in our country that have been kept so clean
All these things came to light and at that time I had sincerely thanked the commendable work of the India to Day Group.
Through e-TV, they have been continuously encouraging the work of cleanliness over the last one year.
He has connected more than 51 lakh children of about 55-56 thousand schools in Andhra-Telangana.
Be it public places, stations, religious places, hospitals or parks, a massive campaign has been started for cleanliness in many places.
Now these news stories themselves reflect the power of fulfilling the dream of a Swachh Bharat.
Mission Clean India is the hundreds of channels of our country, there are thousands of newspapers, I cant take the name of everyone due to lack of time, but everyone has run this campaign.
And so, as per the suggestion given by Savita Raiji, today the whole country considers this work as her own and is taking it forward.
The Governor of Meghalaya has written to me a letter to His Excellency Shanmuganath, Governor of Meghalaya.
And through that letter, I mentioned the Mavalyanong village of Meghalaya.
He wrote that over the last few years, this village has taken up the challenge of cleanliness and almost every generation is devoted to it.
And it is said that a few years ago, he received the award for the cleanest village in Asia.
I am glad to hear that there is a village in Meghalaya in the far-flung North-East of our country, which has been engaged in the field of sanitation for years.
This has become the habit of the citizens there and it has become the culture of the village.
This is what instills confidence in all of us that our country will definitely become clean.
And when we commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we take off our chest and proudly say 1.25 billion Indians will be able to say that we have freed our mother India from dirt. My dear countrymen, on 15th August, I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort that there are a few things where corruption has taken place.
When a poor person goes for a small job, he doesnt know about the recommendation of a person, he has to bear the brunt of the middlemen.
I have never heard of a psychologist in the world who fully recognizes a person in a 2 minute interview.
And after that, I had announced that why should not we abolish the system of interviews for job seekers.
My dear young friends, Today, I proudly say that the government has completed all the processes and recruitments to the Non-Gazetted posts of Group D Group C and Group B will no longer be taken.
The Rules will come into force from 1st January, 2016.
We will not obstruct the ongoing process, but will come into force from January 1, 2016.
So, my best wishes to your young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget, we announced an important scheme.
In a way, gold has become a part of social life in our country.
Gold is considered as a medium of economic security.
The key to crisis is considered to be gold.
This tradition has been going on for centuries in social life.
Under this, you can deposit your money in a gold bank, and the bank will interest you on it, as you deposit the money and get the interest.
Earlier we used to keep the money in the gold lockers and we had to pay the fare of the lockers.
Now we will put the gold in the bank and the bank will give you money in the form of interest.
Can't gold be turned into wealth now
Can we change the gold from the dead money into a living force or not
We have to do the same thing, you have to support me.
Now do not keep gold at home.
Its security and its interest are two benefits.
Take specific advantage.
There is another scheme - the Sovereign Gold Bond will not be in your hands with gold, but a paper will come out.
But the price of this paper is equal to one gold coin, and on the day you return the paper the price of the gold will be equal to the price, the same money will be paid back.
So we are launching these schemes.
This will not require us to buy gold.
So, I will present this security guaranteed scheme in front of my countrymen in the next week.
I am happy to share that we are also bringing gold coins with Ashoka Chakra.
It has been almost 70 years since our independence, but till now we have used only foreign gold coins or gold coins.
Why should not our country ' s national mark be ?
Therefore, in the next week and before dhantares, and dhantares will be available to the common man, Indian gold coins of 5 grams and Ashok Chakra of 10 grams are being launched.
Also, 20 gram of gold will be made available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring a new paradigm in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, 31st October marks the birth anniversary of the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Keeping in mind the Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the map of United India comes out.
This Mahapurush has made a great contribution to the unity of India.
He has demonstrated his strength as a Iron Man.
We will not only pay our homage to Sardar Saheb but his dream of uniting India, which he had shown in a geographical way, but this mantra of unity should constantly become a medium of thought, practice and expression.
India is a country full of diversity.
India is a country full of diversity of sects, sects, many dialects, many castes, clothing and so on. It is our diversity that is our splendor.
Had it not been for this diversity, perhaps we would have been proud of the grace that we would not have been able to bring.
And so, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the key to development.
Over the last few years, on the 31st of October, Run for Unity is being organised all over the country.
I have heard that this time too it is being organized all around.
People are enthusiastically preparing for the Run for Unity.
Run for Unity is really the race for development.
In other words, the guarantee of the race for development is also the race for unity.
Come, pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Proceed the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Diwali, I will be visiting Britain.
I am very excited about my visit to the UK this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also provide scholarship to such sections of the society, be it Dalits, Adivasis or backwards, their bright children who go abroad.
I believe that this place of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage centre for those children of India when they study in Britain.
And so I am saying that I am very excited about my visit to the UK.
And now that building is being built with the wealth of 1.25 billion Indians, with the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar, you can guess how much happiness people like me will enjoy.
In London, I will also get another opportunity to unveil the statue of Lord Basaveshwara.
The work that Lord Basaveshwara had done for democracy and women empowerment several years ago is actually a study of the world.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Basaveshwara to the nation on the daughter-in-law of London is a shining example of how the great men of India had thought about it centuries ago.
You know that when such incidents have taken place then all of us, the minds of the countrymen are thrilled.
My dear countrymen, you are connected with Mann Ki Baat.
Later, the AIR of your letters will also be discussed.
Discussions are held with government officials.
Some people write their problems and try to solve the problems as well.
We should learn many languages in a country like India.
Thus, a good relationship has been tied up with us.
The last time I was completing one year.
Today we are entering a new year.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind
Prime Minister's Office English rendering of PM's Mann Ki Baat address on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
There has been a fundamental thought in my life and because of that I have a great faith in the power of the people. But through what Mann Ki Baat taught me, explained, realized and realized, I can say that the power of the people is greater than what we think.
Our ancestors used to say that peoples participation is a part of God.
I can say with my experiences of Mann Ki Baat that there is a great strength in the thinking of our ancestors, it is a very big fact, because I have experienced that I used to seek suggestions for Mann Ki Baat and I was able to speak only on two or four suggestions every time but lakhs of people used to be active, suggesting that this is a great power.
Yes, these lakhs of letters have given me a big lesson.
Different departments of the government analyzed the letters of the people and what are the policies, what is the personal question, what is not even in the government's mind?
Who could have thought that the source of these information would be Mann Ki Baat
One day I had said the same thing: Selfie with Doctor and the whole world was in awe.
Perhaps, in all the countries of the world, one or the other has achieved the dignity of selfie with the doctor and daughter.
And when he used to do 'Selfie with Doctor', he used to increase the enthusiasm of his daughter but also instills a commitment within himself.
Even when people were watching, it seemed that the neglect of daughters would have to be over.
There was a silent revolution.
Keeping in view the tourism potential of India, I had asked such citizens to visit Incredible India.
But what a big change has been brought about by such people from every corner of India. Probably the tourism department of the Government of India, the tourism department of the state government had never thought that we have such a beautiful heritage.
There was a time when Khadi for Nation.
Is it not the need of the hour or is it Khadi for Fashion
Today, I am very satisfied that the sale of Khadi has almost doubled in the last one year. Now, this work has not been done due to the official announcements.
On a TV channel, I had seen a retired teacher standing on a widow's line, leaving the subsidy.
The common man, the middle class and the lower middle class of the society, for whom it is difficult to quit subsidies, but such people have left it.
Is this not a silent revolution
Is it not a view of this manpower ?
Governments should also learn that the work that is being done in our government offices is a powerful, energetic and determined society of a very large population.
We tried to make every small thing our own and to associate ourselves with the welfare of the country.
What could be the greater satisfaction than this ?
This time in Mann Ki Baat, I thought of doing a new experiment.
I pray to the citizens of the country that they send your questions and suggestions through telephone.
I will pay attention to it in Mann Ki Baat.
This is a very pleasant experience.
People from all age groups have conveyed the message.
I liked to hear some messages myself.
My team is working on the rest.
You might have taken one minute or two minutes but your phone call for me, your message is very important.
The entire government will definitely work on your suggestions.
But one thing was surprising and enjoyable for me.
However, it seems as if there is negativeness on all four sides.
But my experience has been different.
These 55000 people had to say this thing in their own way.
I was able to say anything but I am surprised that all these things were in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat.
Totally positive, suggestive, creative.
The people have said that more than 90 per cent of the people have filled their hearts with energy and joy.
They must have heard of radio.
I noticed how important the radio would be for the visually impaired.
I see a new dimension and say so good things that it is enough to make people and the government too sensitive.
I have received a message from Pawan Acharya from Alwar Rajasthan.
Listen to what they want to say. Definitely listen - Maru is a Pawan Acharya and I am from Alwar, Rajasthan.
I believe that like the wind, your feelings will definitely reach every corner of India.
He has given a good suggestion that the soil should not be rooted and that is why the earthen lamps are also precious.
My dear countrymen, on Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army.
Be it our Navy, the Army, the Air Force, the Air Force, the Navy, the Air Force, the Navy, the Air Force, the Navy, the Air Force, the Air Force, the Air Force, the Air Force, the Air Force, the Air Force, the Air Force and the Air Force.
It completed 50 years with Pakistan in the 1965 war.
On this occasion, a valorous exhibition has been set up by India Gate in Delhi.
If you look at it from the point of view of history then you can learn a lot and if you look at it for inspiration in life then perhaps there can be no greater inspiration than it to serve the motherland.
Whether it is the battle of Hajipur, whether it is in North or Chaminda, and if we look at the winning scenes of Hajipur then it is thrilling and proud of our soldiers.
I also met the families of those brave-hearts. And those who took part in the war are now in the northern era of life.
If you want to make history then it is necessary to understand history in depth.
I returned in two and a half hours but you will need three to four hours.
Look at the strength of the democracy, a small child has ordered the Prime Minister, but he has forgotten to mention his name in a hurry.
We should also inculcate the habit of cleanliness and create a system for cleanliness.
I was very satisfied with the message of this child.
I too have to listen.
The good thing I see is that the Parliament of the country is also discussing about India's cleanliness.
And look at the other hand, on the one hand, the Parliament on the other and on the other hand the child of this country talks about cleanliness - what can be the good fortune of a big country
The movement that is going on, the thinking that the atmosphere of hatred towards filth is becoming aware of cleanliness - it will make the governments work, it will make them work and it will do it.
We have to move forward even if there are shortcomings and in 2019, when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we should work towards fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi, and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say.
Once he had said - If I want to choose one of the two freedoms and cleanliness, I will first choose cleanliness. After independence, Gandhi had more importance than independence.
Gulshan Arora ji has sent a message to MyGov from Delhi.
He wrote that he wants to know about Deendayal Jis birth centenary.
My dear countrymen, the life of great men is always an inspiration for us.
And it is not our job to evaluate the thinking of the great man.
Take any date, some of you will get the name of a great man from the windows of history.
In the coming days, let us remember all these great men, let us carry the message of their life to every house and let us also try to learn something from them.
I would like to especially urge you once again on October 2.
2nd October marks the birth anniversary of Bapu, Mahatma Gandhi.
I had said last year too that you would have every kind of fashion fabric, every kind of fabric, but it should have a place for Khadi.
I once again say that Khadi is allowed to go on for a month from 2nd October.
We should take advantage of it.
And handlooms should be given equal importance along with Khadi.
And that is why in this Diwali we must place Khadi at our home and place it on our body.
And see, last time sales were almost double.
How many poor people have benefitted
You people have done the work that the government cant do with the help of billions of rupees.
This is the power of the people and therefore I once again urge you to do this thing.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted to have one thing in my heart.
I feel like you should also have some taste for this joy.
I visited Kolkata in May and met the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose.
His nephew Chandra Bose did everything.
I had the opportunity to spend a long time with the family members of Subhas Babu to spend the evening with joy.
Can you imagine how happy it will be for me
Perhaps for the first time in his life, Netaji's family would have come together to attend the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.
But more importantly, I am glad that I have never had the opportunity of receiving such hospitality in the Prime Minister's residence, which I will meet in October.
More than 50 people of Subhas Babu and the entire family live in different countries and everyone is specially coming.
On hearing this, I felt that he himself seemed to be a leader and perhaps he would become a leader.
My name is Bhargavi.
I would like to make a statement to the Prime Minister that you should awaken the younger generation about the water registration so that the participation of the younger generation can be increased in the coming days and the important cooperation of the youth in the future is selected and run by the government.
In a democracy, every voter has the destiny of the country and this awareness is gradually increasing.
A few years ago, we saw that our Election Commission was working as a sole regulator, but there has been a major change in the last few years.
Today, our Election Commission has become a facilitator and not just a regulator, but a voter friendly and voter-centric in all its schemes and ideas.
The electoral rolls should be upgraded and we should remain vigilant.
During the elections, I am saying that first after the elections, water was poured.
How sacred is the work, everyone should do it.
On the last day I came after visiting Kashi .
One, I got the 7th standard student named Kshitij Pandey.
It is the seventh in the Kendriya Vidyalaya in Banaras Hindu University.
However, it is of very sharp intelligence.
But I saw his interest in physics at such a young age.
How the emotions come in robots, what things they were saying, how they were saying, it was a very strange brother.
There should be continuous questions in the mind of the child .
How to do ?
When .
You should ask this child to mind .
In the same way, I met Sonam Patel, a very small child.
He is nine years old.
This daughter of a resident of Sunderpur, Varanasi, is a daughter of a very poor family and I was surprised that the entire Gita is in her heart.
But most importantly, when I asked him, he used to say shloka, he used to interpret it in English, he used to interpret it in Hindi.
Do you only read Gita or do you have any other feeling ?
If you take a history then in the evening everything faces it.
We all are surprised that how they are so talented in the entire family
I was really impressed.
Sometimes some children are fond of celebrity, but Sonam has no such thing.
Whatever you watch on TV, you read in the newspapers, we do many things besides, and sometimes we enjoy such things.
Similarly, my interaction with these two children was memorable for me.
I have seen that in Mann Ki Baat, some people bring me a lot of work.
Sandeep ji, what will you do to me
I have to make such arrangements once in a month, so much time and so much time has to be studied.
Sometimes my friends from All India Radio have to wait for half an hour.
But I respect your feelings.
I am grateful to you for your information.
Today it is okay for just one month .
One year has passed since Mann Ki Baat.
Do you know how much Subhas Babu used to use radio
He started his own radio from Germany and used to inform the citizens of India about the freedom movement through radio.
Azad Hind Radio was launched by him from a weekly news bulletin.
He ran these radios in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushkar and Urdu in all languages.
It has been one year since I too spoke about the Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio.
I tell you that I too am talking to you and this is my satisfaction.
I will meet again for Mann Ki Baat next month.
You keep sending suggestions.
The government will also benefit from your suggestions.
Reforms begin.
Your contribution is very valuable to me.
Once again, my best wishes to you all.
In his Mann Ki Baat address the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has said, My thoughts are with all sections of the society.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to you all
Once again I got the opportunity to be with you for Mann Ki Baat.
People in far-flung areas are celebrating Onam and yesterday the entire country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
In the context of social security, the Government of India has implemented many new schemes for the common man.
I am glad that in a very short span of time, everyone has adopted these schemes in a big way.
I had made a small request that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, we should give this security scheme to our sisters.
The primary information that I have received is that eleven crore families have joined this scheme since the beginning of this scheme.
I have also been told that almost half of the benefits have been given to mothers and sisters.
I believe this is a good sign.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, a year ago, Jan Dhan Yojana was launched on a massive scale.
Why the work that has not been done for so many years, will be done in such a short span of time
I also saw the mirage of the poor
We had to open accounts with zero balance.
But the poor saved money and deposited Rs.22,000 crores.
Young people have been employed.
You will be happy to know that in the last one year 1 lakh 23 thousand Financial Literacy Camps have been organized to involve the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
Not just stopping the opening of accounts.
And now thousands of people have also become the recipients of overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana.
And the confidence that the poor can get money from the banks has also arisen.
I have brought it to you and it is your job to maintain it.
All of us should have active accounts.
I am sure that you will do this.
The events of the past few days have made the whole country restless, frustrated with violence and violence.
But in a very short time, all my enlightened citizens of Gujarat have taken care of the situation.
The situation had played an active role before the disruption and once again Gujarat was on the path of peace.
Peace, unity and brotherhood - this is the right path.
And we have to walk hand in hand with the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
Recently, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of Sufi tradition.
I got the opportunity to listen to him.
And in a way, I got the opportunity to listen to the kind of stories that I experienced, that in a way, some music was playing.
I felt very nice.
Probably reaching the truest form of Islam in the world has become the most important thing.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition which is associated with love and generosity will take this message far and wide, which will benefit the human race.
And I would like to tell others that even though we believe in any sect, we must understand the Sufi traditions.
In the coming days, I will have another opportunity and I consider this invitation as my good fortune.
In India, scholars of the Buddhist tradition from many countries of the world are going to be aware.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodh Gaya.
I will get the opportunity to work with these scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to tell you a special episode of Mann Ki Baat today.
Even earlier in Mann Ki Baat, I have mentioned this subject.
You must have heard me in the Parliament, you must have heard me in public meetings, you must have heard me in Mann Ki Baat.
I have been saying this thing every time that the government's mind is open on the issue of 'Land Acquisition Act' which is being debated.
I am ready to accept any suggestion for the welfare of the farmers and I have come to say this again and again.
But today my farmer brothers and sisters have been saying this thing through the states that if the issue of amendment in the Land Acquisition Act has been brought about through the states then it has been urged that if the villages, poor farmers have to make arrangements for providing water to the fields, if there is a provision for providing electricity to the villages, if there is a need to build a house for the poor of the villages, if there is a need to make arrangements for employment to the poor youth of the villages, then we will have to leave the ears of the bureaucracy.
And then there was a proposal for reform.
But I saw that the fear was spread so much that the farmer was so scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, My farmer should neither be confused nor scared.
And I do not want to give any opportunity to anyone who fears the farmers and misleads the farmers.
We introduced an ordinance.
Tomorrow, August 2019 marks the completion of the Ordinance.
And I have decided to let it go.
This means that the situation that was there before the formation of my government has now been restored.
But one work was incomplete in that.
And that is why we brought them to the ordinance, but due to these disputes, those issues were also complicated.
And my farmer brothers and sisters, I assure you that Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is not just a slogan.
Welfare of villages, poor farmers.
And so on 15th August, I had said that not only the Department of Agriculture, but also the Department of Farmers Welfare will be formed.
And when it comes to the war of 1965, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
It is also natural to remember the mantra of 'Jai Jawan Jai Kisan'.
And it is very natural to remember all the martyrs who have kept the flag of India's tricolor alive.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 1965 war.
I am glad that India is doing a great job in many directions in the field of science.
Our scientists are really doing a great job.
Now we have the opportunity to take these innovations to the common man.
How to convert principles into devices ?
How to connect the lab with the land ?
We have to take it forward as an opportunity.
I also got some new information.
I can say that for me it was also an extremely inspiring one.
And last time in Mann Ki Baat, I had said that our students should move towards science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are many opportunities and many possibilities.
I receive a lot of letters from the citizens.
It has written about skill development.
Shri Prakash Tripathi from Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu stressed on the need for good teachers for primary education.
There is emphasis on reforms in the education sector.
I have to say one thing to my young friends.
I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 15th of August - why is it an interview for a lower level job
And when there is an interview then where will every poor family, widow, mothers and sisters get a job
The poor will not have to run for emotions.
Exploitation will not happen, taxation will not happen.
These days guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
Twenty-four countries of the world, together with India, deliberated on the ground for health-care, especially the Maternal Mortality Ratio and Infant Mortality Rate.
This is the first time that this event has happened in some other country outside the United States.
However, there is a lot of improvement.
India's appreciation at the global stage has started showing, however, these figures are not small
Just as we got rid of Polio, we also got rid of Tetanus in the deaths of those mothers and children.
The world has accepted this.
Brothers and sisters, Today news of dengue continues.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but its protection is very easy.
And the Swachh Bharat that I am talking about is directly related to it.
We see advances on TV.
There is a lot of public education in this regard, but our attention is not there.
I urge you all to say that we should not make death so cheap.
Life is very valuable.
Becoming depressed about water, depression about cleanliness, or becoming a cause of death is not correct.
There are free testing facilities for dengue at around 514 centers across the country.
And cleanliness should be given a lot of importance.
In a way, festivals are celebrated in our country from Raksha Bandhan to Deepavali.
Why not associate our every festival with cleanliness now ?
You see, culture will become a habit
Hitendra Mahajan, Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan Ji is also passionate about serving the tribals of India.
These two brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
This year, the two brothers won the race.
India's respect has increased.
I convey my best wishes to these two brothers.
But I am most glad that they have been doing their entire campaign 'Team India - Vision for Tribal' with the intention to do something for the tribal people.
See, how every person is making efforts to take the country forward in his own way
And yes, when you hear such incidents, your chest swells up.
Sometimes we commit great injustice to our youth because of our passion.
My experience is different about the youth.
Sometimes we talk to the youth and we learn a lot.
I have met many such youths who say- "Brother, I have prayed in life for a sandy on bicycle".
Some people say that I have kept a cycle-day daily.
Today, I would especially like to congratulate the Government of Maharashtra.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now there will be a grand, divine and inspiring memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
When Indians traveling around the world go to London then the memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, which is now being built by the Maharashtra government, will be an inspiration for us.
I salute the government of Maharashtra for both these efforts to honour Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
My dear countrymen, namaskar.
Once again after a long gap, we are starting the episode of Mann Ki Baat, talk of the people and talk of public opinion among you.
Several things used to be heard and repeated in a short span of time as a part of the family of 130 crore Indians. Sometimes our similar things used to become an inspiration for us.
You can imagine how this period of time has passed.
Probably this was not a lifeless event.
I was doing a mission every moment and when I am talking about Mann Ki Baat, I may say words, words are mine, voices are mine, but the story is yours, your meanings are yours, your valour is yours.
I used to use my words and words only because of that I was missing out on this programme.
I felt an empty stomach.
But it's too late this Sunday.
Well, the opportunity has finally been reached.
In a family environment, Mann Ki Baat, small, medium, society, becomes the reason for change in life.
In a way, this sequence of events, giving rise to a new spirit, and in a way supporting the realization of a New India, should go ahead.
I feel kinship.
Sometimes I feel that this is a journey of my self-esteem.
This is my journey from Ahim to Vaya.
For me, this silent conversation with you was, in a way, a part of the experience of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions about why I was going to Kedarnath in the run-up to the elections.
Most people have derived political meaning from it.
For me, it was an opportunity to meet you.
The rest is your curiosity. I think we will discuss it too.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, in the same way, your effort to strengthen a positive thing, I continuously feel in your words.
The letters that are received for Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are received are completely different from the regular official work.
Sometimes, some of your words work to advance my thinking process.
If someone writes for cleanliness then they are not only showing their salutation towards cleanliness but they also explain the efforts of cleanliness.
If someone talks about the environment then he feels the pain, but at the same time he tells the experiments he has conducted - the experiment he has seen and the imagination that he has in his mind is also portrayed.
That is, in a way, I can feel a glimpse of how to solve problems in a society at large.
Mann Ki Baat is like a blessing for the country and society.
They show us that there is no dearth of inner strength, strength and talent among the countrymen.
The need is to incorporate this strength and talent, provide opportunities, and execute it.
Mann Ki Baat also tells us that all 130 crore Indians want to be strong and active participants in the development of the country. And I will definitely say this thing that in Mann Ki Baat there are so many letters, so many telephone calls and so many messages are received.
When I analyze such things, you can imagine how much happiness my heart would have enjoyed, how much energy I would have got.
Actually, I have not come here. You have brought me here, you have laid me down and you have given me the opportunity to speak once again.
With this spirit, let us move forward with the mantra of 'Mann ki Baat'.
When there was a crisis in the country, its opposition was not confined to the political arena it was not confined to the politicians, the movement was not confined to the prisons.
There was an outrage in the heart of the people.
There was a thirst for lost democracy.
Similarly, in normal life, the joy of democratic rights is known only when one snatches away democratic rights.
In the crisis, every citizen of the country started feeling that something has been taken away from it.
Probably in some country of the world, every citizen of that country has voted not just for a democracy but also for a democracy, rather than for the rest of their rights and needs.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, the massive election campaign has been completed in our country.From Amir to the poor, everyone was eager to celebrate this festival with happiness, and to decide the future of our country.
When something is very close to us, we underestimate its importance, and its ill effects are also ignored.
This number may seem very common to us but if I say this thing from the perspective of the world, if I leave China, then more and more people from any country of the world voted in India.
The number of voters who voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than double the total population of the United States.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of the whole of Europe.
This speaks for the vastness and pervasiveness of our democracy.
In the history of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it was the world's largest democratic election.
You can imagine how much resources and manpower will be required to complete such an election.
Lakhs of teachers, officers and staff worked day and night to make the election possible.
While nearly 3 lakh security personnel of paramilitary forces performed their responsibilities to successfully accomplish this great feat of democracy, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also worked hard.
As a result of the hard work of these people, this time more than the last time, votes were cast.
About 10 lakh polling stations across the country, more than 40 lakh EVM machines and more than 1 lakh VVPAT machines can be imagined.
All this has been done so as to ensure that no voter is deprived of his electoral right.
Polling station was set up for one female voter in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the officials of the Election Commission had to travel there for two to two days - this is the true honour of democracy.
The highest level of polling station in the world is also in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
There is also a more glorious fact in this election.
Probably for the first time in history, women cast their votes with the same enthusiasm as men.
The percentage of voting for women and men was almost equal in this election.
One more encouraging fact related to this is that today there is a record 8 women MPs in the Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and everyone involved in the electoral process and salute the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have often heard from my mouth that Book No Book was my request whether we can give books instead of flowers in welcome or in hospitality.
Since then, people have started giving books at many places.
I am glad that just a few days ago, someone gave me a book called Premchand Ki Lok many popular stories.
Although I could not get a lot of time, but during the journey, I got the opportunity to read some of his stories again.
His stories, which express human emotions in a simple, easy language, touched my heart.
His stories convey the spirit of the whole of India.
When I was reading the story of intoxication written by him, my heart went on to the economic inequalities prevalent in the society.
I was reminded of the days of my youth days as to how this topic was discussed overnight.
The story of the son of a landlord, Ishwar and the poor family, tells us that if you do not have the courage, then you do not know when the impact of the bad world falls.
The second story that touched my heart was Idgah.
A child's sensitivity, a pure love for his grandmother, is so mature at such a young age.
When a 4-5-year-old Hamid arrives at his grandmother with a chipio from the fair, he truly attains the pinnacle of human compassion.
The interaction touched upon the pain of the lives of poor farmers.
Despite the loss of their crops, the small farmers are happy that they will not have to sleep in the fields in extreme winters.
Although this conversation is about a century ago, but its popularity is equally visible today.
After reading it, I had a different kind of feeling.
When it comes to reading, I used to read about Kerala's alphabetical library in any media.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village in the middle of the dense forests of Idukki.
The teacher of the primary school here, P.K.
Chinnath Pimi, both of them have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by tying bandages on their backs.
Today this library, along with tribal children, is showing a new path to everyone.
Gujarat's Wancho - Gujarat campaign has been a successful experiment.
Millions of people from all age groups participated in this campaign of reading books.
In today's digital world, during the time of Google Guru, I will also urge you to take some time out and place books in your daily routine.
You will really do a lot of fun and write about whatever books you read on Narendra Modi App so that every listeners of Mann Ki Baat also get to know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking on issues which are a big challenge not only for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on the Narendra Modi App and Mygov. And I have seen that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Pawan Gauri of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Farid of Bhubaneswar, besides Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf have also written about the challenges related to water.
Water has a lot of importance in our culture.
The Rigveda says about water, , , , , , , , , , that is, water is the power to give life, the source of energy.
May you bless us like a mother and may you continue to shower your blessings on us
Lack of water affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 per cent of the water received through the rains is being saved in our country.
Only 8 percent.
Now the time has come to solve this problem.
I believe that just like many other problems, we will be able to address this crisis with public participation, with the strength, cooperation and resolve of 130 crore Indians.
Keeping in mind the importance of water, a new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created in the country.
It will take decisions on every subject related to water at a fast pace.
A few days ago, I tried to do something different.
I have written letters to the Sarpanchs across the country.
I have written to the Gram Pradhan that he should sit and discuss with the villagers, to save water, to collect water, to save rain and water.
I am happy that they have shown full enthusiasm in this work and on the 22nd of this month, crores of people in thousands of panchayats have donated their labour sweat.
In villages, people resolved to collect every drop of water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I want to tell you about one Sarpanch.
The people there are ready to play their active role in water conservation once again.
Many-many greetings to the Prime Minister, every Sarpanch for his activism on my behalf.
There are many such Sarpanchs across the country who have taken up the task of water conservation.
In a way, this opportunity has become an opportunity for the entire village.
It seems that the people of the village are now engaged in the competition to build a water temple in their village.
As I said, collective efforts can produce many positive results.
There can be no single formula for overcoming the water crisis across the country.
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country for this.
But everyones goal is one and that is to save water and water.
Rainage lines are being restored in Punjab.
With this effort, we are getting rid of the problem of water logging.
The lives of the people of the village are being changed due to the construction of a tank in the Thimpu district of Telangana.
A major change has been brought about in the small ponds built in the fields at Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20,000 women came together to revive the river.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who have been working very well on the Rainwater Harvesting.
I believe that many such efforts are being made and when we work together and strongly, then we can make the impossible possible.
When people join, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I appeal to the people of the country three times.
My first appeal is that just as the countrymen turned cleanliness into a mass movement, let us also launch a mass movement for water conservation.
Let us all resolve to save every drop of water together. And I believe that water is the Prasad of God, the form of a parasol.
Earlier it was said that with the touch of Paras, iron becomes gold.
I say that water is parasol and the parasol produces a new life by touching water.
To save every drop of water, launch an awareness campaign.
Discuss water-related issues in this section as well as ways to save water.
I especially urge the personalities from different fields to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Be it the film fraternity, sports persons, media persons, social organizations, people associated with cultural organizations, story-tellers, everyone should lead this movement in their own way.
To awaken the society, to connect the society and to connect the society.
You see, we can see changes in front of your eyes.
This is my second appeal to the countrymen, many traditional methods of conserving water in our country have been used for centuries.
I urge you all to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had the opportunity to visit the birthplace of Porbandar and Pujya Bapu, then there would be another house behind the house of Pujya Bapu, there are 200 years old water tanks and today there is water and arrangements for stopping rain water, then I always used to say that whatever temple of Kirti must visit that place should definitely look at this water tank.
There will be many such experiments in every place.
Come, let us make a list of best practices related to water conservation and motivate people to save water.
All of you can share your content using the Janshakti4 Jalshaktihita tag.
My dear countrymen, I also express my gratitude to you for one thing and also thank the people of the world.
On the 21st of June, once again on the occasion of Yoga Day, three-three generations of each family, four-four generations have come together to celebrate Yoga Day.
The awareness about Holistic Health Care is also increasing the importance of Yoga Day.
In every corner of the world, if a Yoga lover welcomes it as soon as the sun sets, then this is the entire journey till the sun sets.
There is hardly any place where human beings are not connected with yoga, Yoga has taken the form of such a big one.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from the Siachen to the Submarine, from the Air Force to the aircraft carriers, from AC gyms to the penses, from villages to cities, Yoga was not only practiced everywhere, but it was also organized collectively.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities and ordinary citizens from many countries of the world have shown me on Twitter how they have celebrated Yoga in their respective countries.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that building a healthy society requires healthy and sensitive individuals and ensuring Yoga.
Therefore, promoting Yoga is a great work of social service.
The announcement of Prime Ministers Awards for outstanding contribution for the promotion and development of Yoga in 2017 was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
This award has been conferred on those organizations across the world and you must not have imagined that they have made an important contribution in the promotion of Yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many Institutes and Training Courses or has many such M.S.
Antonietta Rozzi, who started the Sarva Yoga International and propagated yoga across Europe.
This is an inspiring example in itself.
If this is a matter related to yoga then can Indians be lagging behind in it
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger was also honored. For the past several decades, it has been dedicated to Yoga.
Similarly, Swami Rajrishi Muni was honored and he established the Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
The widespread celebration of Yoga and respect for those who make the message of Yoga at home, have made this Yoga Day special.
It is a very big journey for me to connect with your ideas and Mann Ki Baat.
Let us meet, let us talk.
Keep listening to your feelings and keep following them.
Sometimes, I keep trying to live those feelings.
Keep getting your blessings.
You are my inspiration and you are my energy.
Let us together enjoy Mann Ki Baat and also fulfill the responsibilities of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Ten days ago, Mother India had lost her brave sons.
These brave-hearts sacrificed their lives to protect the 1.25 billion Indians.
Our brave sons made one day and night so that they could sleep peacefully.
After the martyrdom of the brave-hearts in the Pulwama terror attack, there is anguish and anger in the minds of people and people across the country.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families all around.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives while protecting Mother India.
We all have to deal with the challenges faced by the country by forgetting casteism, communalism, nepotism and all other differences so that our steps against terrorism are strengthened more than ever before.
Our armed forces have always displayed unparalleled courage and valour.
They have shown exceptional courage to maintain peace.
On the other hand, the attackers also responded in their language.
You must have seen what steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack.
The Army has resolved to eliminate the terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspiring stories of their family members through the medium of broadcast have given courage and strength to the entire country.
The courage shown by Ramananji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, in this hour of grief also inspires us all.
He has said that he will send his second daughter to fight the enemy and will fight if necessary.
The entire country salutes the indomitable courage of his wife Meenaji, the martyr of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
He has also pledged to recruit one of his sons from the CRPF.
When Shaheed Vijay Soren's body reached Gumla in Jharkhand wrapped in a tri-color, his son-in-law said, "I too will join the army."
The spirit of the Masum reflects the spirit of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
Similar sentiments are being seen in the homes of our brave martyrs.
I appeal to the younger generation that they should try to know and understand the spirit and emotions shown by these families.
Knowing what sacrifice and penance are we need not go back to the ancient event of history.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Omkar Shetty, Karnataka, has expressed her happiness at the launch of the National War Memorial.
I was also surprised and pained that there was no National War Memorial in India.
It is a memorable place where the saga of valour of our brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the protection of the nation can be kept alive.
I decided that there should be a monument in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been built in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow i.e. on 25 February, we will dedicate this National Soldiers Memorial to our Army, the crores of Indians.
The country will make a small effort to repay the loan.
A new memorial has been built just near the heart of Delhi i.e. the place where India Gate and Amar JawanJyoti are located.
I am confident that for the countrymen, we will be able to visit this National Soldiers Memorial to a place of pilgrimage.
This National Soldiers Memorial symbolizes the gratitude of the Nation towards the highest sacrifices made by our soldiers since independence.
The design of the memorial showcases the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The martyrs of the Amar Chakra symbolize the immortality of the soldier.
The second circle is the Chakra of valour and bravery of the soldiers.
After that, sacrifice is a chakra.
This circle represents the sacrifices of the soldiers.
It contains the names of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the country in golden letters.
Thereafter, the Rakshak Circle reflects the safety.
The circle is compact with dense trees.
Looking at the volume, the National Soldiers Memorial will be identified as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country and study them to express their gratitude.
Those who have laid down their lives for the country, so that we can live, so that the country can be safe and developed.
It is not possible to express in words the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces to the development of the country.
In the month of October last year, I had the privilege of dedicating the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our thinking under which we believe that the country should be grateful to the men and women police personnel who are constantly engaged in our security.
I hope you will go to the National Soldiers Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, I get to read thousands of letters and comments from you through different means.
This time when I was reading your comments, a very interesting comment from Ashish Mukhopadhay ji came to me.
He wrote that when the British arrested Birsa Munda on March 3rd, 1900, he was only 25 years old.
Yoga on 3rd March is also the birth anniversary of Jamsetji Tata.
He further writes that both these personalities have come from a completely different family background and enriched the history and heritage of Jharkhand.
In Mann Ki Baat, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamsetji Tata is in a way similar to paying homage to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have not only brought glory to Jharkhand but also to the entire country.
The entire nation is grateful to him for his contribution.
Today, if our youth need an inspiring personality to guide them, then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
When he was asleep, the British hid him and caught him with a lot of hide and seek.
Do you know why the British took shelter of such cowardly acts ?
The British too were afraid of them, because they had such a great empire.
Lord Birsa Munda had just removed the British rule equipped with guns and guns from his traditional tricolor.
In fact, when people get an inspiring leadership, the collective will power of the armed forces is immense.
BhagwanBirsaMunda did not struggle for political independence only against the British.
But they also fought for the social and economic rights of the tribals.
They have done all this in their short life.
In the dark life of the underprivileged and the exploited, he lit up as the sun.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at a young age of 25 years.
Mother Indias sons like Birsa Munda have been born in all parts of the country.
There should not be any corner of India where no one has contributed to this freedom struggle that lasted for centuries.
But unfortunately, his words of sacrifice, valour and sacrifice have not reached the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda actually showed us his identity, then a great leader like Jamsetji Tata gave the country great institutions.
Jamsetji Tata was truly visionary, who not only saw the future of India but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He knew very well that it was his vision to make India a centre of science technology and industry for the future.
This has resulted in the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, now known as the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).
Not only this, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister, Morarjibhai Desai, was born on the 29th of February.
You all know that this day comes once in four years.
Morarji Desai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
The record of presenting the highest budget in the Parliament in independent India is in the name of Morarjibhai Desai.
Morarji Desai took the leadership of India in such a difficult time when the democratic tension of the country was in danger.
Morarji Desai flung himself in the movement against Emergency to protect the democracy.
For this, he had to pay a heavy price even in his old age.
The government of that time arrested him and imprisoned him.
But in 1997, when the Janata Party won the elections, it became the Prime Minister of the country.
The amendment also provides that the fundamental rights conferred under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be violated during the time of crisis.
For the first time, it was arranged that after the written recommendation of the Cabinet, the President would declare the Emergency.It was also decided that the period of the crisis will not be extended beyond six months at a time.
Similarly, Morarjibhai ensured that the way democracy was assassinated in the year 1957, cannot be repeated in the future.
The future generations will always remember his invaluable contribution in maintaining the glory of Indian democracy.
Once again, my tributes to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, this year too, there was a lot of curiosity about the Padma awards.
Today, we want to honor those people who are doing their work at the grassroots level by moving ahead on the path of a New India.
Due to their hard work, those who are making positive changes in the lives of others in different ways.
In fact, they are true Karmyogis who are selflessly engaged in public service, social service and service to the nation.
I want to tell you about some such people.
Talking about Abdul Ghaffar Khatri of Gujarat, he did a wonderful job of reviving the traditional Rogan theatre of Kutch.
He is doing a great job of bringing this rare painting to the new generation.
The Tree of Life (Life) artwork made by Abdul Gafoor was gifted to former US President Barack Obama.
In the Padma awards, Shabbeid Sayyid of Marathwada is known as a servant of mother Ganga.
The way he has devoted his entire life to the service of mother cow is a unique thing in itself.
You will be surprised to know about America's Tao Porchon-Lynch.Link has become a living organization of yoga today.
Even at the age of 100, he has been training people for Yoga and has made 1500 yoga teachers till date.
Famous by the name Lady Turjan in Jharkhand, JamunaDudu bravely fought against the mafia and naxalites in Timber and not only saved 50 hectares of forest but also mobilized 10,000 women and motivated them to protect the trees and wildlife.
It is difficult to give an example of the work done by them for the upliftment of Divyang women even when they are Divyang, they are working to make the visually impaired children self-reliant by setting up an institute named Pragyachhu Mahila Sevakkunj.
He has set an example in women empowerment and making agriculture profitable.
Kisan Chachi has linked 300 women of his area to the Self Help Groups and encouraged them to be financially dependent.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk about the experiences that touch the heart of those who have been experiencing this thing for the last few days.
Nowadays whenever I go to the country, I have been trying to ensure that some beneficiaries of 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana' will get the benefits of 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana'.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme.
I have seen how big a change is being brought about in the lives of the poor.
If all of you know that such a poor person is unable to get treatment due to lack of money then definitely tell him about this scheme.
This scheme is for every such poor person.
My dear countrymen, examinations are about to begin in schools.
Different Boards across the country will initiate the process for examination of the 10th and 12th Boards in the next few weeks.
My best wishes to all the students of the examination, their parents and all the teachers.
A few days ago, a major event of the Pariksha Pe Charcha 2020 was organized in Delhi as a Town Hall.
The unique feature of the Pariksha Pe Charcha 2020 programme is that there has been an open discussion on a wide range of subjects related to examinations.
There were certain aspects that could definitely be beneficial for the students.
All the students, their parents and teachers can watch this entire event on YouTube, and I congratulate all the winners of the exam for the upcoming exams.
My dear countrymen, be it the talk of India or of festivals.
There will not be any day in our country that does not have any significance, nor will it have any festivals.
Because, we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture.
A few days later, the festival of Mahashivaratri will take place and this time the festival of Shivaratri will take place on Monday.
My best wishes to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Shivaratri.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, when I visited Kashi, I got the opportunity to spend time with my divyang brothers and sisters.
So he said, I am the Prime Minister.
I was really impressed by the strength of that Divyang youth.
My dear countrymen, it has been a unique experience for me to connect with you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Through the medium of radio, I meet millions of families in a way every month.
Many times while talking to all of you, reading your letters or listening to the idea sent on phone, it seems to me that you have accepted me as a part of your family.
It is a very pleasant experience for me.
Friends, Elections are a great celebration of democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy with all the elections.
And I will keep on talking to you for years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar. On the 21st of this month, the country received a very sad news.
Sivakumar Swamiji devoted his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveshwara has taught us - , That is, fulfilling our duties with hard work is equal to the abode of Lord Shiva in Kailasham Dham.
His fame was as one of the greatest scholars in English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He spent his entire life seeking food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
The welfare of the farmers in every way was the priority of Swami ji's life.
Siddhaganga Mutt regularly organizes animal and agricultural fairs.
I have had the privilege of receiving the blessings of the venerable Swamiji several times.
Kalamsahbe narrated a poem for Pujya Swamiji on this occasion.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb beautifully presents the life and mission of Shri Shivkumar Swamiji and Siddhaganga Mutt.
Once again, I salute such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country which is not only an integral part of our democracy but is also older than our Republic - I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
No stone is left unturned in ensuring that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, gets an opportunity to cast his vote.
When we hear that polling stations are set up in Himachal Pradesh at a height of 15,000 feet above sea level then in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, polling stations are set up in remote islands.
For just one voter
When we hear these things then it is natural for the Election Commission to feel proud.
In view of this, the entire team of Election Commission employees goes to the remote area and arranges for the voting and this is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for its consistent efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also congratulate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other staff who take part in the electoral process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year, the Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country. This will be the first time that the youth born in the 21st century will use their votes in the Lok Sabha elections.
It is an opportunity for them to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now they are going to be a part of the decision making process in the country.
It is time to connect your dreams with the dreams of the country.
I appeal to the young generation that if they are eligible to vote, they must register themselves as voters.
Each of us must realize that becoming a voter, securing the right to vote, is one of the important milestones of our lives.
At the same time, it is my duty to cast votes - let this spirit remain within us.
There should be a lot of pain in life because of any reason, if not able to vote.
If you ever see something wrong happening anywhere in the country then you should feel sad.
I appeal to the well-known personalities of the country to create awareness among the people by campaigning for voter registration or voting day.
I hope that a large number of youth will be registered as voters and with their participation, our democracy will be strengthened.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done something wonderful for humanity.
On 23rd January, the entire country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different manner.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I had the privilege of inaugurating a museum dedicated to the heroes of India's freedom struggle.
You know that many rooms and buildings were closed since independence in the Red Fort.
The cells of the Red Fort have been converted into beautiful museums, dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army Yaad-e-Jallian, and the museum dedicated to the First War of Independence of 1985- India and dedicated to the nation as Kranti Mandir.
Every brick of these museums has the aroma of our glorious history.
The stories of our freedom fighters from all corners of the museum inspire us to go into history.
Bharat Mata ki Veer sons Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shah Nawaz Khan were put on trial by the British authorities.
When I was visiting the memory of Netaji at the Kranti Mandir of the Red Fort, I had given a very special gift to me by the members of Netaji's family.
Netaji used to wear this cap.
I opened the hat in the museum itself, so that the people visiting there also looked at the hat and inspired the patriotism.
In fact, the valour and patriotism of our heroes need to be kept separate from each other to the new generation.
Just a month ago, on 30th December, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
At one event, the tricolour was hoisted at the same venue where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had unfurled the tricolour 5 years ago.
Similarly, in October 2018, when the tricolour was hoisted at the Red Fort, everyone was surprised as there was a tradition on August 15.
This occasion was to mark the completion of 75 years of the formation of Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and skilled organizer.
A brave soldier who played a pivotal role in the freedom struggle.
With brilliant threads like 'Delhi Chalo', 'You-Muje Khoon Do, Me-You-You-Azaadi Dunga', Netaji made a place in the hearts of every Indian.
There was a demand for several years that files related to Netaji should be made public and I am glad that we have been able to do that.
I remember that day when Netaji's entire family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together we talked about Netaji, and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26 Alipur Road related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir.
If you go to Delhi then you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today as we talk about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and in that episode of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you something related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered radio as an important medium to connect with the people, as Netaji also had a close connection with the radio, and he also chose radio to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhas Babu started Azad Hind Radio and through radio he interacted with soldiers of Azad Hind Fauj and the people of the country.
I am told that it also broadcasts radio stations, weekly news bulletins in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangladesh, Marathi, Punjabi, Posts and Urdu languages.
The Radio Station is being operated by resident of Gujarat M.K.
Vyas ji played an important role.
The programs being telecast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes helped the warriors of our freedom struggle a lot.
A visual museum has also been built in this Kranti Mandir.
This effort is to showcase Indian art and culture in a very interesting manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and more than 450 paintings and art works of 3 centuries old.
The Museum showcases some of the finest works of great artists like Amrita Sher-Gil, Raja Ravi Varma, AvindraNath Tagore, Gaganendra Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Rai, Sailoz Mukherjee among others.
And I will specially request you all to visit and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you are thinking of art and I am talking to you about Gurudev Tagore's outstanding work.
You must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician till now.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made pictures on many subjects.
He has also made pictures of animals. He has also made pictures of many beautiful landscapes and has still worked to bring the human characters to canvas through art.
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not name most of his work.
He said that the person who sees the pictures himself, understands the pictures, sees the messages he has given in the pictures with his own eyes.
His paintings have been depicted in European countries, Russia and the United States.
I hope you will go and see his paintings in the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have spread the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
There was such a saint - Sant Ravidas ji.
Ravidas Jayanti is on 1st February.
Sant Ravidas ji's thread is very famous.
Saint Ravidas ji had given a big message through a few lines.
He used to say that if God is in every human being, it is not right to divide them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas Ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Saint Ravidas ji, through his message, tried to explain the importance of labour and labour in his entire life.
He said that it would not be wrong to say that he has explained the real meaning of the dignity of labour to the world.
He used to say: , , , That is, if your heart and mind are sacred, then the witness God resides in your heart.
Sant Ravidas ji's messages have inspired people from all walks of life - the Maharaja of Chittor, the Queen of Chittor or Mirabai - all his followers.
Once again I salute Sant Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sider has written on MyGov that I will highlight the aspects related to Indias space programme and its future.
He also wanted me to urge the students to take interest in the space programme and to think ahead of the sky with some different attitudes. Kiran ji, I appreciate your idea and especially the message that has been given to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad where I had the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
In our space programme, innumerable young scientists of the country have contributed.
We take pride in the fact that today the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students are reaching space.
The Kalam Set was launched by our students on January 24th.
Sounding rockets produced by university students in Odisha have also made many records.
Since independence, the space missions that were launched till the year 2014, almost the same number of special missions have been started in the last four years.
We have also built a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously with one launch vehicle.
We will soon be launching the Chandrayaan-2 mission on the moon.
Our country is using space technology in a beautiful way to protect lives.
Whether it is cyclone or rail and road safety, space technology has helped a lot in this.
Navigation services have been shared between our fishermen brothers and sisters, which are helpful in their security as well as in economic progress.
We are using space technology to improve the delivery and accountability of government services.
About 40 lakh houses from 23 states have been taken up under this scheme.
Along with this, nearly 3.5 crore assets have also been tagged under MNREGA.
Our satellites today are a symbol of the country's growing capability.
It has a great contribution in our good relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellite has been a unique initiative, which has also given a gift of development to our neighboring countries.
Today, India is launching satellites not only from developing countries but also from developed countries through our comprehensive launch services.
The sky and the stars are always attractive for the children.
Our space programme offers children the opportunity to think big and move beyond those boundaries that have been considered impossible so far.
It is the vision of our children to watch the stars, and to inspire them to discover new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that whatever sports will be played, this time many young players and young players have played in Khelo India.
In the month of January, about 6,000 players took part in 18 games in Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
Only when the players at the local level perform better will they perform better at the global level.
This time in 'Khelo India', players from every state have done well at their own level.
The life of many players who have won medals is a tremendous inspiration.
Akash Gorkha who won a silver medal in boxing I was reading that Akash's father Ramesh ji was working as a watchman in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
Maharashtras Under-21 female kabaddi team is housed in Sonali Halvi Satara.
She lost her father at a very young age and her brother and her mother encouraged Sonali's Hunar.
It is often seen that girls do not get such a boost in sports like kabaddi.
However, Sonali chose Kabaddi and excelled in this regard.
A 10 year old Abhinav Shaw from Asansol is the youngest gold medal winner in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Akshay Baswani, a farmer's daughter in Karnataka won the Gold Medal in weightlifting.
When we talk of building an India, it is the resolve of the youth power that is New India.
The stories of Khelo India show that people from big cities are not only contributing to the creation of a New India, but also contribute to the development of a New India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard of a lot of prestigious beauty competitions.
But have you heard of the competition to shine the toilet
He said more than 50 lakh toilets have also taken part in a unique competition, which has been going on for the past one month.
The name of this unique competition is - a clean beautiful toilet.
As people keep their toilets clean, they are also making some pictures of it by coloring it and making it beautiful.You will also get to see pictures of clean toilets on social media from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup.
I call upon all the Sarpanchs and the Gram Pradhans to lead this campaign in their Panchayat.
You must share the picture of your clean beautiful toilet with MyIzzatGhar on social media.
Friends, On 2nd October 2014, we had started a memorable journey together to make our country clean and open defecation free.
Today, with the cooperation of the people of India, India is moving towards becoming Open Defecation Free much before the 29th of October 2019, to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
The listeners of Mann Ki Baat have also contributed a lot in this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat. And therefore, it is heartening to note that more than 5 lakh fifty thousand villages and 600 districts have declared themselves Open Defecation Free and the sanitation coverage in rural India has crossed 8 and nearly 9 crore households have been provided with toilets.
My little colleagues, the days of examinations will come.
Anshul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about exams and exams.
Mr. Anshul, thank you for raising these issues.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is exam time.
From students to their parents and teachers, many people are busy in the examinations.
I wish all the students, their parents and teachers the very best.
I would like to discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat today, but you will be happy to know that two days later, on 29th January at 11 am, I will interact with students from all over the country at Pariksha Pe Charcha.This time, along with students, parents and teachers, will also be part of this program.
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in this program.
In this Pariksha Pe Charcha, I will talk to my young friends on all aspects related to examinations, especially those related to the stress-free exam.
I had urged people to send inputs and ideas for this and I am very happy that a large number of people are conveying their ideas on MyGov.
I will certainly put some ideas and suggestions in front of you during the town hall programme.
You must be a part of this programme.
You will also be able to see its live telecast through social media and Namo App.
My dear countrymen, 30 January marks the death anniversary of venerable Bapu.
The entire country pays homage to the martyrs at 11 o'clock.
Wherever we are, pay homage to the martyrs for two minutes.
Remembering Pujya Bapu, and fulfilling the dreams of Pujya Bapu, building a New India, and fulfilling our duties as citizens, let us move forward with this resolution.
May this visit of 2019 be carried forward successfully.
My best wishes to you all. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
What should we do so that we can bring about a change in our lives and contribute to the development of the country and the society at large
My best wishes to you all for the year 2019.
You all must have thought about how to remember the year 2019.
It is also important to remember how India will remember the year 2019 as a country and the strength of its 130 crore people.
It makes us all proud.
In 2018, Ayushman Bharat, the world's largest health insurance scheme, was launched.
Electricity reached every village of the country.
Eminent institutions of the world have believed that India is liberating the country from poverty at a record pace.
With the determination of the countrymen, the sanitation coverage has increased to 75 percent.
For the first time since independence, tricolour was hoisted at the Red Fort on the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government.
The Statue of Unity, the tallest statue in the world, was conferred with the honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who gave the country the slogan of unity.
The name of the country has been raised in the world.
The country was awarded the United Nations' highest environmental award, the Champions of the Earth Award.
Indias efforts in the field of solar energy and welfare have been recognized globally.
The security of the country has got a new strength.
This year, our country has successfully completed the Nuclear Triad. So, now we are getting nuclear power in water, in place and in the river.
The daughters of the country have made the country proud by visiting the entire world through the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
The first waterway of India started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the waterway sector.
The country's longest rail-road bridge, the Bogibeel Bridge was dedicated to the nation.The first airport in Sikkim and the first airport in the country is Pakyong.
India won the Under-1 Cricket World Cup and the Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India won a large number of medals in the Asian Games.
India has done well in Para Asian Games too.
Thus, if I talk about the male and female of every Indian and our collective efforts, then our Mann Ki Baat will continue to be so long, perhaps in 2019.
All this has been possible due to the untiring efforts of 130 crore Indians.
I hope that this journey of development and progress of India will continue even in 2019, and our country will continue to scale new heights with more strength.
My dear countrymen, in December this year, we have lost some extraordinary countrymen.
Dr. Jayachandran was known for his affordable treatment to the poor.
People say that they were always ready to treat a patient.
After coming to the hospital for treatment, he also paid rent to the elderly patients.
I'm Thebeterindia.
I have read about many of his works that have inspired the society on the common website.
Similarly, on 25th December, the demise of SulagittiNarsamma of Karnataka was revealed.
SulagittiNarsamma was an aid to pregnant mothers and sisters in delivery.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the remotest parts of the country.
Earlier this year, he was honoured with the Padma Shri.
There are many inspiring personalities like Dr. Jayachandran and SulagittiNarsamma who dedicated their lives for the benefit of all in the society.
When we talk of healthcare, I would like to discuss about the social efforts of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors in the city are treating the poor free of cost by setting up camps.
Today hundreds of poor patients are getting benefitted from this camp.
The zeal of these doctors engaged in selfless service is truly commendable.
Today, I am very proud to say that due to collective efforts, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign.
I was told that a few days ago, more than three lakh people joined the cleanliness drive at Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
I got to read about Jayachandrayan and we got a better opportunity to talk to Thebeterindia.
I have been trying to know these inspiring things by going to com.
I am glad that these days there are many such websites which are conveying to us many stories that are inspiring us from the lives of such people.
Like Thepositivindia.
Com is working to spread positivity and to make society more sensitive.
I am confident that more and more people will be able to know about our heroes who are transforming the society.
It is easy to spread negativity, but much good work is being done in the society around us and it is being done by the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports plays an important role in every society.
When games are played, the viewers' mind is filled with energy.
We experience a lot of things- name, identity and respect for the players.
But sometimes there are many things behind it that go beyond sports, which go beyond sports, which is even bigger than sports.
I would like to talk about a girl from Kashmir, Hanaya Visra, who won a gold medal at the Karate Championship in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and resides in Anantnagar of Kashmir.
He studied Karate with hard work and perseverance and took a careful look at it and proved it to himself.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I wish you the very best for a bright future.
Many good wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, a 16-year-old daughter was also discussed in the media.
You must have read it too.
Rajni has won the Gold Medal in the Junior Womens Boxing Championships.
Rajni ji went to a milk stall winning the medal and drank a glass of milk.
After that, Rajni wrapped the medal in a cloth and put it in a bag.
You must be wondering that why should a glass of milk be drunk
He did this in honor of his father Jasmer Singh ji, who sells lassi at a stall in Panipat.
Rajni said that her father had sacrificed a lot and suffered a lot in taking her to this place.
Jasmer Singh left in the morning and his brothers and sisters had already gone to work.
When Rajni expressed her desire to learn boxing before her father, she encouraged her father to get all possible help.
Rajni ji had to start with the old practice as her family's financial condition was not good at that time.
Despite all these conflicts, they did not lose courage and continued to learn boxing.
She also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to His Majesty.
And I also congratulate his parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani ji for supporting Rajni and for boosting its spirit.
This month, a 20-year-old girl from Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni, became the fastest Asian to travel the world through a cycle.
She used to cycle about 300 kilometers daily for 15 days.
Shouldn't we be inspired to know about such accomplishments
Especially my young friends, when we hear about such incidents, we seek inspiration to say something in the midst of difficulties.
If there is strength and enthusiasm in the pledge, then the difficulties are solved on their own.
Difficulties can never be a hindrance.
If we listen to many such examples, then we too get a new inspiration in our lives.
My dear countrymen, there are many festivals full of excitement and enthusiasm in January - such as Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi.
Meanwhile, Sun descends and enters the Capricorn constellation.
After this day, the day begins to gradually grow and the winter crop starts to grow.
My best wishes to our Annadata - Kisan brothers and sisters.
Unity in Diversity The spirit of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is inherent in our festivals.
We can see how closely our festivals are associated with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not considered different, there is only one person and community here.
A good example of our close relationship with nature is the calendar based on festivals.
Along with festivals, there is also a list of planets and constellations.
This traditional calendar shows how old our relationship with natural and astronomical events is.
According to the moon and sun calendars based on the speed of the moon and the sun, the date of festivals and festivals is determined.
It depends on who believes in the calendar.
Festivals are also celebrated in many areas as per the position of planetary constellations.
Gudi Padava, Chettichand, Ugadi are all celebrated according to the lunar calendar, while Tamil Puthandu, Vishu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh, Bihu are all celebrated on the basis of sun calendar.
In many of our festivals, the spirit of saving rivers and water is inherent.
Chhath Parva- Rivers, Lakes are connected with the worship of the Sun.
Even on Makar Sankranti, lakhs of people take dip in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals also remind us of social values.
On the one hand, it has a mythological significance on the other, on the other, every festival teaches a lesson of life - the inspiration to live with each other through brotherhood.
I wish you all the very best in 2019 and wish you all the very best for the upcoming festivals.
Share the photographs taken on these festivals with everyone so that everyone can see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, our culture is full of things on which we can take pride and pride in the whole world. And one of them is Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh.
Even in films, you must have seen and seen a lot about its magnificence and magnificence, and it will be true that the Kumbh is as grand as it is.
People from all over the country and the world come and join the Kumbh.
In the Kumbh Mela, there is a crowd of faith and faith.
Millions and millions of people from all over the country come together at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh is flourishing and flourishing from our great cultural heritage.
This time, on the 15th of January, the world famous Kumbha festival going to be held in Prayagraj, which perhaps you all are waiting eagerly for it.
For the Kumbh Mela, the seals have also begun to reach the saints and sages.
Its global importance can also be gauged from the fact that last year UNESCO has marked the Kumbh Mela in the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list.
A few days ago, Ambassadors of many countries witnessed the preparations for Kumbh, where national flags were hoisted at the same place.
People from more than 150 countries are expected to visit the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj.
The divinity of the Kumbh will illuminate India's magnificence all over the world.
This can be a very big learning experience especially for the youth.
I myself had visited Prayagraj a few days ago, and I saw that the preparations for the Kumbh were going on at a grand scale.
The people of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic about the Kumbh.
I have dedicated the Integrated Command Control Centre there, and will provide a lot of assistance to the devotees.
This time a lot of emphasis is being laid on cleanliness in the Kumbh.
If there is a spirit of reverence in the organization, it will spread its message far and wide.
This time every devotee will be able to perform Akshayvat after having a holy bath in the Sangam.
This symbol of the faith of the people, this Akshayvat was locked in a fort for hundreds of years, and devotees could not even visit it.
Now the doors of Akshayvat have been opened for everyone.
I appeal to all of you that when you come to Kumbh, you must keep pictures and aspects of Kumbh on social media so that more and more people get inspired to go to Kumbh.
May the Kumbh of spirituality be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh also be the Kumbh of Nationality.
May this Kumbh of the devotees also become the Mahakumbh of national unity, the Mahakumbh of global tourists as well.
May this Kumbh of Art also be a Mahakumbh of creative powers.
Pujya Bapu and South Africa have an unbreakable relationship.
It was South Africa from where Mohan became Mahatma.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa and stood firmly against apartheid.
He also set up Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms, which resonated globally for peace and justice.
2018 is also celebrated as the birth centenary year of Nelson Mandela, also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mandela was an example of conflict against colors all over the world and who was the inspiration for Mandela
He had the courage and inspiration to spend such years in prisons from venerable Bapu.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only inspirations for the whole world, but their ideals also inspire us to create a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a DGP conference was held in Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat, where the world's highest statue is the Statue of Unity, where there was a meaningful discussion with the police personnel of the country.
What steps should be taken to further strengthen the security of the country and its people was discussed in detail.
At that time, I also announced the launch of Sardar Patel Award for National Unity, which will be conferred on those who have contributed to national unity in any form.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He always strived to keep India's integrity intact.
Sardar Saheb believed that India's strength lies in its diversity.
We pay tribute to Sardar Patel through this award of unity while respecting that spirit.
My dear countrymen, on the 13th of January, we mark the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna.
For most of his life, he lived in North India and sacrificed his life in Nanded, Maharashtra.
Janmashtami is a day to commit ourselves to the life and teachings of Shree Ram.
In a way, the entire India received his blessings.
If we look at his life, it gives a glimpse of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji attained the position of Guru in a short span of nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had the courage to fight the battle of justice in Varanasi from the Sikh Gurus.
He was a calm and simple personality, but when an attempt was made to suppress the voice of the poor and the weak, and injustice was done to them, Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice firmly for the poor and the weak and therefore it is said - 1.25 lakh rupees for one fight, 1.25 lakh rupees for one fight, 1.25 lakh rupees for one fight, and 1.25 lakh rupees for the other.
He used to say that power cannot be demonstrated by fighting the weaker sections.
Shri Govind Singh ji knew that the biggest service is to alleviate human suffering.
He was a divine man full of bravery, valor, sacrifice and righteousness who had an supernatural knowledge, both weapons and science.
He was not only a legend, but also a scholar of many languages including Gurumukhi, Brijbhasa, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
I once again salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
That is, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India is taking place.
Several events are being organized across the country to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
F. in this series
Under the Eat Right India movement, healthy India visits are taking place across the country.
This campaign will continue till 29th January.
When India is clean and healthy, India will prosper.
Nutritious food is most important for good health.
You too should participate in it, and especially I urge you to show these things to the children.
Important education of food is important since childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the last event of 2018.
In 2019, we will meet again, talk about our minds, the life of the person, the life of the nation, the life of the society and the inspiration is the basis of progress.
Come, new inspiration, new zeal, new resolve, new accomplishments, new heights - let's move forward and change the country too. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On October 3, 2014, the pious festival of Vijayadashami, through Mann Ki Baat, we all started a journey together.
Today 50 episodes of Mann Ki Baat has been completed.
Similarly, today is the Golden Jubilee Edition - the Golden Jubilee Edition.
The letters and phones you have received this time are mostly in the context of this 50th episode.
On MyGov, Delhis Antakkumar, Amar Kumar and Vikas Yadav from Patna, Similarly, on Narendra Modi App, Monika Jain of Delhi, Bardwan, President Government of West Bengal and Sangeeta Shastri of Nagpur have asked a similar question.
He says that many times people connect you with latest technology, social media and mobile app, but why did you choose a radio show to connect with people?
Your curiosity is very natural why did Modi come with radio when he had forgotten radios in today's era
I was a month and I was going to some other place in the evening.
When the mountains of Himachal get cold in the evening then stop for tea on a dhaba on the road and before that when I ordered the tea, it was a very small dhaba, the same person used to make tea and sell it himself.
There was no cloth on the top.
The same was standing on the edge of the road with a small saliva.
He said, "No, you don't know, it's a matter of great happiness.
I didn't understand, he said, "Listen to Babasaheb Radio, the same thing is being discussed on Radio.
Probably no one can match the reach and depth of communication.
This thing has come to my mind since that time and I had realized its strength only then.
So when I became the Prime Minister, it was very natural that I should pay attention to the most powerful medium.
And when I took over as a Prime Servant in May 2014, I wanted the unity of the country, its glorious history, its valour, the diversity of India, the essence of our society, the blessings of the people, the pride, sacrifice and penance of all these things to the people of India.
From remote villages of the country to metropolitan cities, from farmers to young professionals.
Recently, Akashwani also conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I saw some of the feedback that was very interesting.
Of the people surveyed, on an average, 90 per cent are people who listen to Mann Ki Baat on a regular basis.
Most people feel that the biggest contribution of Mann Ki Baat is to increase the positivity in society.
Through Mann Ki Baat, the mass movement has gained momentum.
There has also been a lot of discussion about India-positiveness.
It also reflects the spirit of positivity and positivity in the minds of our countrymen.
People have also shared their experiences that through Mann Ki Baat, the spirit of volunteerism has increased.
Radio, Mobile, Internet, Facebook Live and Pariscopies are also being connected to Mann Ki Baat through the Narendra Modi App.
I sincerely thank all the members of the Mann Ki Baat family for their trust and being a part of it.
Your apprehensions are true.
If you really want a leader to get a mic, and if you want to hear lakhs and crores of rupees, then what should you do
Some young friends studied on all the subjects related to Mann Ki Baat. They analyzed the words of all the episodes, but they studied which word was spoken many times.
What words were spoken again and again
One of his examples is that this programme has been non-political.
When Mann Ki Baat had started, I had decided that neither politics nor governments should be lauded for this thing nor any Modi is there in it. And the greatest strength and inspiration to fulfil this resolution was from among you.
Modi will come and go, but this country will remain steadfast, our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
This will take the country to new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
When will the strength of any government be so strong that the campaign of self-reliant India will start from a small village in Haryana and spread not only in the whole country but also abroad
Let every section of the society, celebrities, be connected, and a new, modern language of thinking in the society, which is understood by today's generation.
Sometimes we also enjoy Mann Ki Baat, but in my mind, 130 crore countrymen always reside.
His heart is my heart.
Mann Ki Baat is not a matter of government, it is a matter of society.
Mann Ki Baat is about an aspirational India, an aspirational India.
India's life is not politics, India's soul is not power.
The essence of India's life is social policy and social power.
There are thousands of aspects of social life and one of them is politics as well.
If politics happens, it is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes the events and politics of politics get so overwhelmed that other talent and resources of the society get overwhelmed.
It is the collective responsibility of all of us to ensure that the talents of the common man get the due place for a bright future like India. And Mann Ki Baat is a humble and small effort in this direction.
Your question is in a way a matter of intimacy.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat is that you are asking questions not to the Prime Minister but to your close friend.
If I reply directly to the question raised by you people then I will say - There is nothing.
Indeed, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple task for me.
Every time people receive letters before Mann Ki Baat.
People share their views on MyGov and Narendra Modi Mobile App. There is also a toll-free number 1800 11 800.
People record their messages in their own voice by calling there.
As the episode of Mann Ki Baat approaches, I read very closely the ideas and information sent by you during the journey.
And so, when I read the letter, I can easily connect that place and context with myself.
Then, I would like to mention some facts like the name of the village, the name of the person, etc.
In fact, the voice in Mann Ki Baat is mine, but the examples, feelings and emotions belong to my countrymen.
There are millions of people whose names I have not yet been able to name in Mann Ki Baat, but they keep sending letters and comments without getting disappointed. Your thoughts, your feelings have a lot of importance in my life.
I am confident that your discussions will be multiple times more relevant than ever before and will make Mann Ki Baat more interesting, more effective and useful.
Efforts are also made to focus on the letters and suggestions that have not been included in the Mann Ki Baat.
With their hard work, Mann Ki Baat reaches more and more people.
The All India Radio team prepares every episode for broadcast in many languages.
Some people very efficiently recite Mann Ki Baat in regional languages through Mann Ki Baat.
In this way, they become Narendra Modi for just 30 minutes.
I also congratulate those people for their talent and skills.
I urge you all to listen to this program in your local languages as well.
I would also like to heartily congratulate those friends in the media who have regularly broadcast Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
No politician is ever happy with the media, he feels that he gets very little coverage or the coverage he gets is negative, but the media has made several issues raised in Mann Ki Baat.
There are many issues like cleanliness, road safety, drugs free India, selfie with the doctor who have been promoted by the media as a campaign in an innovative manner.
Without your cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat will remain incomplete.
In fact, I have no secret to myself.
Whatever I am doing, it will also happen to all the families.
In a simple language, I try to adapt myself and the youth into that situation and try to create a balance with their thoughts and to match the value.
This is the old baggage of our lives. When they do not come in the middle, it becomes easy for anyone to understand.
The youth of today is very much concerned about not doing anything on which they have no faith in themselves and when they believe in something, they leave everything behind for it.
Many a times, people talk about communication gap between aged people and young people in families.
In fact, the trend of interacting with young people in most families is limited.
In most cases, be it the teaching or the lifestyle-related issues or be it the prevention of tax evasion or be it the words of an open mind or be it the saying of a family gradually becomes a matter of concern.
Instead of interfering in an expert's debate, the dialogue will become effective.
I have been constantly trying to interact with the youth through various programmes or social media.
I always try to learn what they are doing or what they are thinking.
They always have a repository of ideas.
They are highly energetic, full of innovation and focused.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I try to share the efforts and stories of the youth as much as possible.
Many times there is a complaint that the youth asks a lot of questions.
I say that it is good that the youngsters question.
This is good because it means they want to examine everything from the root.
Some people say that there is no patience in the youth, but I believe that there is no time for the youth to get hurt, this is the thing that helps the youth to become more innovative today because they want to do things faster.
We think that today's youth is very ambitious and thinks of a lot of big things.
It is good, dream big and achieve great success.
After all, this is New India.
Some people say that the younger generation wants to do many things at the same time.
I say, what is wrong in that
They are proficient in multiplexing, so they do.
If we look around, be it social entrepreneurship or start-ups, sports or other areas, it is the youth who bring about a big change in the society.
The youth showed the courage to ask questions and see big dreams.
If we bring down the thinking of the youth and give them an open environment to express them, they can bring about a positive change in the country.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram, Vinitaji has written on MyGov that I should talk about Constitution Day tomorrow i.e.
He says that this is a special day as we enter the 70th year of our adoption of the Constitution.
Vinitaji, thank you very much for your suggestion.
Tomorrow is Constitution Day.
A day to remember those great men who created our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November 1947.
It took 2 years, 11 months and 19 days for the Constituent Assembly to complete this historic task.
Just imagine within three years these great personalities have given us such a comprehensive and comprehensive constitution.
The extraordinary pace with which he drafted the Constitution is an example of time management and productivity even today.
It also motivates us to fulfill our responsibilities in a record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a confluence of the great talents of the country, each one of them was committed to provide a Constitution to empower the people of India, to enable the poorest of the poor.
The special feature of our Constitution is that rights and duties, i.e. rights and duties, are explained in detail.
The synergy between the two will take the country forward in the lives of the citizens.
If we respect the rights of others, then our rights will be protected automatically. Similarly, if we follow our duties given in the Constitution, our rights will be protected automatically.
I still remember that in 2010, when India's Republic was 60 years old, in Gujarat, we took the shape of the Constitution by placing it on an elephant.
It was a memorable occasion for the youth to raise awareness about the Constitution and to connect them with the aspects of the Constitution.
We will complete 70 years as a Republic in 2020 and 75 years of our Independence in 2022.
Let us carry forward the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, talking about the Constituent Assembly, one cannot forget the contribution of a great man who had been at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
6th December is the day of his Mahaparinirvana.
I salute Baba Saheb on behalf of all the countrymen who gave the right to live with dignity to crores of Indians.
The democracy was in the nature of Baba Saheb and he used to say - Indias democratic values did not come from outside.
What is a democracy and what is a parliamentary system - there has never been a new thing for India.
At the Constituent Assembly, he had made a very emotional appeal that we will have to protect the independence obtained after such a struggle till the last drop of our blood.
He also used to say that we Indians may be from different backgrounds, but we have to keep national interest in everything.
My dear countrymen, two days ago on 23rd November, we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji and in the year 2019, we are going to celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji always thought for the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the path to truth, karma, seva, compassion and harmony to society.
Similarly, a train will also run on the pious places associated with Guru Nanak Devji.
Recently, when I was holding a meeting related to it, I remembered the writing of Sahib Gurudwara at that time.
The Gurudwara suffered a lot during the 2001 earthquake of Gujarat, but the way the local people worked together to revive it is still an example today.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to construct the Kartarpur corridor so that the pilgrims of our country can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak Devji in Pakistan and Kartarpur.
My dear countrymen, we will meet once again after the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat, in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, and I am confident that today, for the first time, the feelings behind this programme of Mann Ki Baat have given me an opportunity to talk to you because you have asked such questions, but our journey will continue.
The more you join, the more our journey will become stronger and the more satisfying it will be.
Sometimes a question arises in the minds of people as to what I got from Mann Ki Baat.
Today I would like to say that one thing that touches my heart in the reactions of Mann Ki Baat. Most of the people said that when we listen to Mann Ki Baat sitting with all the families, it seems that the elders of our family are sitting amidst us and sharing their ideas with us.
When I heard this in detail, I was very satisfied that I am with you, I am with you and in a way I will also be visiting you through Mann Ki Baat as a member of your family.
Your ambition, my ambition.
Let us take this journey forward.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
About six and a half months before independence, on the 29th of January, 1947, the world's renowned international magazine Time Magazine brought out a portrait of Sardar Patel.
In his leading story, he had printed a map of India and today we do not have the map that we see.
It was the map of India divided into many parts.
Time Magazine wrote that India was facing challenges such as partition, violence, food crisis, inflation and power politics.
Time Magazine writes that amidst all these, the country has the ability to put the country in the thread of unity and to put the danger in place, that is Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
He gave direction to the Bardoli Satyagraha.
His sincerity and commitment to the country was such that farmers, labourers and industrialists all trusted him.
Be it Junagadh, Hyderabad, Travancore, or the Rajvada of Rajasthan, or Sardar Patel, we can see an India today with great vigour and strategic prowess.
We naturally remember Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel on seeing this nation and our Mother India tied in the bond of unity.
On this 31st October, we will be celebrating the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, paying a befitting tribute to Sardar Patel and dedicating the Statue of Unity to the nation.
Located on the banks of the Narmada River in Gujarat, the height of this statue is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty of America.
It is the world's highest skyscraper statue.
Every Indian can now take pride in the fact that the highest statue in the world is on the soil of India.
The same Sardar Patel who was associated with the land will now enhance the glory of the sky.
I also salute the families of our soldiers for their bravery. But do you know why we all the citizens of India celebrate Infantry Day
This is the day when the Indian Army troops landed on the land of Kashmir and protected the valley from the intruders.
This historic event is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview from Sam Manekshaw, a great military officer of India.
She was recalling the time when she was Colonel Fild Marshal Manekshaw at the interview.
Meanwhile, in October 1947, the military campaign started in Kashmir.
Field Marshal Manekshaw has said how during a meeting Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was condemned for the delay in sending the army to Kashmir. During the meeting, Sardar Patel looked at him in his special style and said that there should not be any delay in the military campaign in Kashmir and the solution should be resolved as soon as possible.
After that, the army personnel took a flight at Kashmir Bhini Airport and we saw how the army succeeded.
Indira Gandhi, our former Prime Minister, is also on her death anniversary on October 31.
I respectfully paid homage to Indiraji.
My dear countrymen, who doesnt like sports
I have just had two memorable visits.
Earlier, we had the opportunity to meet our Para athletes in the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
In this game, India made a new record by winning a total of 2 medals and increased the pride of India.
I had the privilege of meeting all these para athletes personally and I congratulated them.
Similarly, the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina got the opportunity to meet.
You will be happy to know that our youth performed the best ever in Youth Olympics 2018.
Apart from 13 medals, we also won 3 other medals in the Olympics.
You might remember that this time India's performance in the Asian Games has been outstanding.
See, in the last few minutes, I have used many such words, the best ever, and the most glorious ever.
This is the story of Indian sports that touches new heights every day.
India is setting new benchmarks not only in sports but also in those areas which were never thought of.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur who won Gold in Athletics for the country at the 2018 Asian Para Games.
She is divyang by birth.
When he was eight years old, he lost his father.
He spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he cleaned the buses of DTC to run a vehicle of life and worked as a waiter at Dhaba on the roadside in Delhi.
Today, he has been winning gold for India at the same Narayan International events.
Not only this, look at the rising sons of excellence in Indias sports, India has never won any medal at the Senior Level or Junior Level in Judo.
But Tababi Devi made a history of winning the Silver medal in the Youth Olympics.
Tababi Devi, a 16-year-old young player, resides in a village in Manipur.
His father is a laborer while mother works to sell fish.
There were times when there was no money for food in front of his family.
Even in such circumstances, the courage of Tababi Devi is not a threat.
And he made a history of winning medals for the country.
There are countless stories to come.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young player and his passion is the identity of a New India.
My dear countrymen, all of you might remember that in 2019, we had successfully organized the FIFA U-17 World Cup.
The whole world appreciated it as a very successful tournament.
A new record was also created about the number of viewers in the FIFA U-17 World Cup.
More than 12 lakh people took the pleasure of football matches in different stadiums of the country and the courage of the young players increased.
This year, India has had the privilege of hosting the Men's Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will commence from 28 November to 16 December.
Every Indian, be it sports or sports, has interest in sports, he must have a passion for hockey.
India has a golden history in hockey.
In the past, India has won gold medals in many tournaments and has been the World Cup winner once.
India has also given hockey many great players.
Whenever there is talk of hockey in the world, the hockey story will remain incomplete without these great players.
The whole world is familiar with hockey magician Major Dhyanchand.
After that, hockey has done a great job from Balvinder Singh Senior, Lesley Colodias, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh and Dhanraj Pillai.
Even today, Team India players are inspiring the new generation of hockey through the success of their hard work and hard work.
Sports is a good opportunity for lovers to watch exciting matches.
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only increase the enthusiasm of the Indian team but also motivate all the teams.
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Mens Hockey Team for this competition and assure them that 1.25 billion Indians are standing with them and with them and I also convey my best wishes to all the teams of the world to come to India.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward for social work, they are becoming volunteers, it is an inspiration and an inspiration for all the countrymen.
But in the new era, in new ways, a new generation is coming forward to do this work with a new zeal and enthusiasm.
Every Indian will be proud to see his zeal and dedication towards this task.
It is a fragrance of the journey from IT to Society, Main Nahin Hum, Aham Nahin Vayam to Sastry.
Some are going to teach children some are going to teach old people.
Some are engaged in cleanliness, some are helping the farmers and there is no desire to do all this, but there is a selfless spirit of dedication and resolve in this regard.
A young man learnt Wheelchair Basketball to help the Wheelchair Basket Team of Divyangjan.
This is the passion, this is the dedication with which this mission is going on.
Will no Indian be proud of this thing
This spirit of 'not me' will inspire all of us.
My dear countrymen, this time when I was watching your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I had a very interesting experience from Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on MyGov. Please speak in Mann Ki Baat about how the customs and traditions of the tribes of India are best examples of co-existence with nature.
We need to learn from their traditions and practices in our lives for sustainable development.
Manish ji, I would like to praise you for placing this subject among the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is a subject that inspires us to look towards our glorious past and culture.Today, the whole world, especially the West, is discussing the issue of environmental conservation and is exploring new ways for a sustainable lifestyle - balanced life.
As such, even our year is not free from this problem, but to solve it, we just have to hide within us, to see our rich history and traditions, and especially to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
Living in harmony with nature has been part of our tribal culture.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
In the Bhil tribe of Central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, people worship the trees like Pipalo and Arjun.
In the deserts like Rajasthan, Bishnoi society has shown us the path of environmental protection.
In particular, it is acceptable to them to sacrifice their lives for the protection of trees but not a single tree.
Mishmi of Arunachal claims to have a relationship with tigers.
They consider them as their brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland too, tigers are seen as protectors of forests.
In Maharashtra, the people of the Varali community consider the tiger as a guest and the presence of the tiger for them is a source of prosperity.
There is a belief in the Kol community in central India that their destiny is linked with the tiger.If the tigers do not get food, then the village will also have to be hungry.
Gond tribe in central India stops catching fish in some parts of Kathan river in the winter season.
They consider these areas as a refuge place for fish, which provides them healthy and abundant fishes.
The tribal community makes their homes natural, strong and eco-friendly.
Among the isolated regions of the Nilgiri Plateau of South India, a small community, traditional settlements are made up of locally available items.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is true that the tribal community believes in staying peaceful and harmoniously in harmony with each other. But, when someone is harming their natural resources, they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that the tribal community was among our first freedom fighters.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who struggled hard against the British rule to protect his forest land.
There are many examples of tribal communities who teach us how to live in harmony with nature. And today the country is indebted to our tribals for the forest wealth that we have got.
Let us pay our respects to them.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about individuals and institutions who are doing something extraordinary for the society.
Such works, which seem normal at first glance, have a profound effect on changing our mindset and the direction of society.
A few days ago, I was reading about Punjab's farmer brother Gurbachan Singh ji.
A common and hardworking farmer was married to Gurubachan Singh ji's son.
Before this marriage, Gurubachan ji had said that we will get married in a simple manner.
There is no need to spend any amount of money, be it life or other things.
You will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurbachan Singh was a direct farmer and what he said by using them, that condition is the right strength of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji asked him to give me a pledge that now you will not burn the harvest.
You can imagine the kind of social power it has.
It seems like Gurubachan Singh ji is very valuable but he tells us how large his personality is and we have seen that there are many families in our society who convert personal events into social harmony.
The family of Shri Gurbachan Singh has set an example in front of us.
I have read about Kallar Mazra, another village in Punjab, which is near Nabha.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurbachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to Kallar Mazara and the people of all those places who have done their best to keep the environment clean.
All of you are carrying forward the Indian legacy of healthy lifestyle as a true heir.
Just as the lake is built, small awareness and activation play a crucial role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it is said in our scriptures: , , , , , : That is, may the three worlds be in the abode of peace everywhere, in water, in the earth, in the sky, in the sky, in the fire, in the wind, in the wind, in the vegetation, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the entire universe.
May there be peace in the soul, in the heart, in me, in the stars, in every corner of the world.
This year, 11th November is a special significance for India as the end of the First World War 100 years ago on 11th November is also completing 100 years i.e.
World War I was an important event for India.
In true sense, we did not have any direct reference to that war.
Yet, our soldiers fought valiantly and played a very big role and made supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when it comes to war, it is not behind anyone.
Our soldiers have shown their valour in difficult terrains and adverse situations.
There was only one purpose behind them - the restoration of peace.
In the World War I, the world saw the scourge of destruction.
According to estimates, nearly 1 crore soldiers and almost the same number of civilians lost their lives.
They understood the importance of peace all over the world.
The definition of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Today, peace and harmony does not mean just a war.
From terrorism to change the environment, from economic development to social justice, all need to work with global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is the true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, the point of our conscious India is something else.
The natural beauty of the Northeast is incomparable and the people there are very talented.
Our Ishaan India is now well known for its best practices.
Ishan India is such a sector which has made great progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award 2018 to promote sustainable food systems.
You will be happy to know that this award is a recognition of the best policy makers in this field.
Moreover, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for having won the award by leaving behind 51 nominated policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October ends.
Best wishes to all the countrymen on all these festivals.
I urge you to take care of yourself in these festivals, take care of your own health and also take care of the interests of the society.
This festival becomes an opportunity in your life to move forward as a mission and to take a firm resolve.
Your progress is a major part of the country's progress.
The country will progress as much as you progress.
My best wishes to you all.
