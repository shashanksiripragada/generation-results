My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Happy Diwali to all of you
It is said here - Shubham Karoti Kalyana Aarogya Dhan Sampadam
In this verse it is said that light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which destroys the opposite intellect and shows goodwill.
I bow down to such a divine light
What better idea could be to remember this Diwali than to expand the light, spread positivity and pray to destroy the spirit of enmity.
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world .
The special thing is that it not only includes the Indian community, but now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organizations of that country celebrate Diwali with full joy.
In a way, India stands there
Friends, Festival tourism has its own attraction in the world.
The country of festivals that we have, in India, has immense potential for festival tourism.
We should try to spread festivals like Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and also involve people from other states and other countries in the happiness of the festivals.
In our country there are so many festivals of every state and every region of ours that the people of other countries have a lot of interest in them .
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in increasing the cultural tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, we had decided that we would do something different on this Diwali.
I had said - let us celebrate the women power of India and their achievements on this Diwali, that is, the honor of Lakshmi of India.
And soon after that, a series of incredible stories were put on the social media.
Kodipaka Ramesh of Warangal wrote on NamoApp that my mother is my power
My mother is God for me!
It ' s everything for me and it ' s the Lakshmi of India .
Ramesh ji, my salute to your mother
Geetika Swamy, who is active on Twitter, says that for her Major Khushboo Kanwar is Lakshmi of India who is the daughter of a bus conductor and led the All - Women contingent of Assam Rifles.
For poetry Tiwari, India's Lakshmi is her daughter, who is also her strength
They're proud that their daughter does the best painting.
He has also achieved a very good rank in the ATC exam
Megha Jain has written that a 92 year old woman from Ninety Two Year provides free water to the passengers at Gwalior railway station for years.
Megha Ji has been inspired by the humility and compassion of Lakshmi of this India
Many such stories have been shared by people
You must read, take inspiration and share something similar with yourselves and I bow down to all these Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the famous 17th century poetess Sanchi Honamma, who wrote a poem in Kannada language in the 17th century, had written that expression, that word, every Lakshmi of India, this is what we are talking about.
It seems as if its foundation was built in the 17th century.
How excellent words, how good emotions and how good ideas are in this poem of Kannada language
Penninda Parmeganu Himavantanu, Paniida Bhrigu Parchidanu Pennida Jankaraayanu Jasuvaldanu (Peninda permegondanu himavanantanu.Peninda broohu perchidananu janakarayanaanu jusuvalendanu) That is, due to her daughter Parvati, Rishi Bhrigu, due to her daughter Lakshmi and King Janak got fame due to her daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride and with the glory of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, November 12, 2019 is the day on which the 550th Prakash Utsav of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated worldwide.
The influence of Guru Nanak Dev is not only in India but in the whole world .
In many countries of the world our Sikh brothers and sisters are settled which are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji .
I can never forget my travels to the gurdwaras in Vancouver and Tehran.
There is so much about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji that I can share with you, but for this there will be many episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
He always kept service paramount
Guru Nanak Devji believed that the work done selflessly could not cost any money
They stood firmly against social evils like untouchability
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji has delivered his message to the world from far and wide.
He was one of the greatest travellers in his time .
He went to many places and wherever he went, his simplicity, humility, simplicity, he won everyone's heart.
Guru Nanak Dev ji did many important religious trips, which are called sadness
Taking a message of goodwill and equality, he travelled in every direction, be it north or south, east or west, and met people, saints and sages everywhere.
It is believed that the famous saint of Assam , Shankardev , was also inspired by him .
He traveled to the holy land of Haridwar

He also went to religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism .
Journey to Gurunanak Dev ji, Sri Lanka in the south
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water there.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bidar that reminds us of Guru Nanak Dev Ji and it is dedicated to him.
During a depression, Guru Nanak ji traveled north, Kashmir and its surroundings too.
It established a strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir .
Guru Nanak Dev Ji also went to Tibet, where people, considered him as a guru
They are also revered in Uzbekistan, where, they traveled,
During one of his sadness, he had also traveled extensively to Islamic countries, in which, Saudi Arabia, I
Just a few days ago, Ambassador of High five counties from around 85 countries, from Delhi to Amritsar
There he visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and all this happened on the occasion of 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji .
Not only did all these ambassadors visit the Golden Temple but they also got an opportunity to know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
After this, many Ambassadors shared photos on social media with great pride and good experiences.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you all will remember the 31st of October.
Sardar Patel used to look at the finer things in a very deep sense.
In fact, they were Man of Detel.
At the same time he was also expert in organization skills
He had mastered planning and strategy .
When we read about Sardar Saheb's style of working, when we hear it, we get to know how tremendous his planning was.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country were going to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 1921 at Nineteen Towny One .
Sardar Patel was responsible for the entire system of the session .
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city
He approached the farmers and urged them to make khadi bags
Farmers made bags and sold to representatives
Put the shoes in these bags, keeping them with you, the tension of stealing shoes ended in Delegates' mind.
Khadi , on the other hand , also grew significantly .
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
He did important work to ensure fundamental rights, so that there is no scope for any discrimination based on caste and sect.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did a great work of uniting and uniting the princely states.
Indeed, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role is discussed in certain provinces in the integration of the country.
He also played an important role in small space like Lakshadweep .
Soon after the partition of India in 1947 , our neighbour had a glance at Lakshadweep and sent a ship with its flag .
As soon as Sardar Patel got the information, he lost no time, without delay, immediately started the harsh action.
Soon after their command , the tricolor was hoisted there , and after seeing every conspiracy of the neighbor to take possession of the Lakshadweep , they demolished it .
After this incident Sardar Patel asked the Mudaliar Brothers to personally ensure that Lakshadweep gets every necessary help for development .
Today, Lakshadweep is making an important contribution in India's progress.
It is also an attractive tourist destination
I hope all of you will also travel to its beautiful islands and beaches
My dear countrymen, on the 31st of October, 2018, the day the Statue of Unity, built in memory of Sardar Saheb, was dedicated to the country and the world.
This is the highest statue of the world .
is double the height of the Statue of Liberty located in the US
The world ' s highest statue fills every Indian with pride .
Every Indian ' s head rises up with pride .
You would be happy to know that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists visit the Statue of Unity.
This means that on an average 8 , 000 people per day saw the grandeur of the Statue of Unity
We have shown the faith and reverence towards Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. Now the centres of attraction are constantly evolving and it is also boosting the local economy and people are also getting new employment opportunities.
Keeping in mind the convenience of the tourists, many villages are providing home stay facilities in their homes.
Professional training is also being given to those who provide home stay facilities.
The people there have also started cultivating ragone ruit and I am sure that soon it will become a major source of livelihood for the people there .
Friends, For the country, for all the states and for the tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a subject of study.
We all are witnesses to the fact that within a year, a place that develops as a world famous tourist destination.
There people come from abroad
Many facilities of transport, accommodation, guides and eco-friendly arrangements are being developed one after the other.
a huge economy is developing and people are creating facilities there as per the requirement of passengers
The government is also playing its role
Friends, As you know, every year since 2014, the National Unity Day is celebrated on 31st October.
This day, gives us the message of protecting the unity, integrity and security of our country at all costs.
On October 31, every time Run for Unity is also being organized
It will include people from every section of the society, people from every section
Run for Unity is a symbol of this, this country is one, running in one direction and wants to achieve a goal
One goal - One India, Best India I
The last five years have been observed - not only in Delhi but in hundreds of cities of India, union territories, state capitals, district centres, even in small tier-2 and tier-3 cities, there are men, women, city people, village people, children, youth, elderly people, divyangs all are joining in large numbers.
Anyway, nowadays, look, people are getting a passion and passion for Marathon.
Run for Unity is also a unique proposition
Running is beneficial for the mind-brain and body of everyone
It ' s also running around here .
We fulfil the spirit of India as well as connect with the purposia of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
And that is why not just the body but the mind and the sacrament to take India to new heights for its unity.
And so whatever city you live in, there, you can find out about Run for Unity around you.
This portal provides information about the places across the country where Run for Unity is to be organized
I hope you all will run on the 31st of October - for the unity of India and for the fitness of yourself.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel integrated the country into a single thread.
This mantra of unity is like a sacrament in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should keep strengthening this mantra of unity at every level, at every step, at every step and at every step.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and alert to strengthen the unity and mutual goodwill of the country.
If we look around us, we will find many examples that have been continuously working to increase mutual harmony, but sometimes it happens that the efforts of the society, its contribution and the memory of the society disappears very soon.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi
The Interest Groups were playing games to take advantage of that situation in their own way.
To create warmth in the environment, what kind of language was spoken
But all these things went on for five days, seven days, ten days, but as soon as the decision came, the country felt a pleasant, surprising change.
On one hand, for two weeks everything was done for warmth, but when the verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi came, the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all sects, saints and saints gave very balanced and moderate statements.
Whenever I remember that day , the mind is happy .
Respected the dignity of the judiciary very proudly and did not allow any warmth, atmosphere of tension to be created anywhere
These things should always be remembered . It gives us a lot of strength .
That day, that moment, it's a duty to all of us.
This is an example of how strong the voice of unity gives to the country.
I pay tribute to them today.
My dear countrymen, today, if a story from house to house is heard far and wide, if a story from every village, from north to south, from east to west, from every corner of India, then it is about cleanliness.
But there ' s a pleasant experience and interesting experience
I hear, I think, I'll tell you, too.
Imagine, the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature drops to minus 50-60 degrees
Coygen in the air is just a name .
In such adverse circumstances, living in the midst of so many challenges is no less than a mighty, no less.
In such a difficult situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country by pressing the chest, but also running clean Siachen campaigns there.
On behalf of the people of India , I commend the Indian Army for this wonderful commitment .
I express my gratitude
There ' s so cold that it ' s difficult to decompose anything
In such a situation, segregation and management of waste is a very important task in itself.
In such a scenario, to remove 130 tons and more of garbage from the glacier and its surroundings and that too is a great service between the rail eco-system here.
We all know that Siachen is such a glacier which is a source of rivers and clean water , therefore running a cleanliness campaign here means ensuring clean water for those people who live in low lying areas .
as well as using rivers like Nubra and Shyok
My dear countrymen, festivals are a festival that awakens a new consciousness in our lives.
And especially in Diwali, it is possible to buy something or the other, to bring something from the market in every family.
I once said we try - buy local things
If we need something from our village then there is no need to go to the tehsil
If you meet in Tehsil then there is no need to go to the district
The more we try to buy our local things, Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I have always been urging that we must buy something or the other made from the hand of our weavers, from the hand of our Khadi artisans.
Even in this Diwali, you might have bought a lot before Diwali but there are many people who think that if they go after Diwali then perhaps they will get a little cheaper.
So there will be a lot of people who still have to buy
With the best wishes of Deepawali, I would urge you to come and buy local products.
See, how important we can play in fulfilling Mahatma Gandhi's dream
Once again, I convey my best wishes to you on the auspicious occasion of Deepawali.
We use a variety of crackers in Diwali
But, sometimes there is a fire in carelessness
It's gonna get hurt somewhere.
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm .
My best wishes
Thank you very much
Talk of mind, September 2018
Will he be able to control his own life and fortune ?
Remember that Jantar Mantar of Pujya Bapu
Can we think at the time of shopping that which citizen of my country will benefit from what I ' m buying ?
Today the whole country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan
Best wishes to all the countrymen for this holy festival
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is considered a symbol of the mutual love and faith of sister and brother .
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries .
There are many such stories in the history of the country, in which a defense formula linked people belonging to two different states or religions to the door of faith.
Just a few days later the festival of Janmashtami is also going to come .
The whole atmosphere is going to echo the joy of elephants, horses, palanquins, Jai Kanhaiyalal, Govinda-Govinda
The joy of jumping in the color of Lord Krishna is different .
Apart from Raksha Bandhan Sanskrit day is also celebrated on the day of Shravan Purnima .
I congratulate all those who are engaged in the preservation of this great heritage, carrying it to the masses.
Every language has its own importance India takes pride in the fact that Tamil is the oldest language in the world and we all Indians take pride in the fact that from Vedic times to the present, Sanskrit language has also played a major role in the spread of knowledge.
Knowledge related to every field of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature .
Whether it is science or technology, agriculture or health, economy or architecture, mathematics or management, economics or environment, the mantra to deal with the challenges of global warming is described in detail in our Vedas.
You all will be happy to know that the residents of Muttur village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka state still use Sanskrit language for talks.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which the creation of infinite words is possible.
Sometimes lions use shayari but those who are familiar with Sanskrit auspicious people know that in very few words, such an accurate statement is made from Sanskrit auspicious people and secondly, it is very easy to understand because of being connected to our earth, our tradition.
As has been asked to explain the importance of the guru in life - Ekami Aksharmastu, Guru: disciples Prabodhayat
Let us all celebrate the coming Teacher's Day with this spirit
The entire country celebrates his birth anniversary as Teachers Day .
I wish all the teachers of the country the very best on Teachers Day and also congratulate you for your dedication to science, education and students.
Trees scorched with heavy heat provide relief to dry reservoirs, but sometimes it also brings excessive rainfall and devastating floods.
There is a situation of nature that in some places there was more rains than other places .
Heavy floods in Kerala have badly affected people's lives
Today, in these difficult circumstances, the whole country stands with Kerala
Our condolences to the families who have lost their loved ones and cant compensate for the loss of lives but I want to assure the bereaved families that 1.25 billion Indians are standing shoulder to shoulder with you in this hour of grief.
My prayers are with those who have been injured in this natural calamity, who go healthy as soon as possible
I am confident that with the courage and indomitable courage of the people of the state Kerala will soon rise again .
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everyone is doing something or the other at their own level so that wherever there is an objection, wherever there is an objection, whether it is Kerala or India, and the area, the life of the people can be normal again.
All age groups and people in every field are contributing
Everyone has been trying to ensure that the problems of the people of Kerala can be minimized, we share their sadness.
We all know that the Armed Forces personnel are the heroes of the ongoing rescue work in Kerala.
They left no stone unturned to save the people trapped in the flood
I also want to mention the hard work of the NDRF jawans .
He has done a great job in this hour of crisis .
The capacity of the NCR has become a new center of faith for every Indian by their commitment and quick decision making efforts to tackle the situation.
Yesterday was the festival of Onam, we will pray that the festival of Onam will give strength to the country, especially Kerala, so that they can recover as soon as possible from this disaster and give a boost to the development journey of Kerala.
Once again, on behalf of all the countrymen, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and other parts of the country that the whole country is with them in this hour of crisis.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at the suggestions that came to my mind .
Then the subject on which people from all over the country wrote the most is the subject of our beloved Shriman Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar, Bihar, many countless people have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and on Mygov, I have urged to talk about various aspects of Atal ji's life.
On August 16, as soon as the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's demise, everyone was immersed in grief.
A nation leader who left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago
In a way , for the last 10 years , he had gone a long way from active politics .
They were not seen anywhere in the news, they were not seen publicly.
For the past few days, the best aspects of Atal ji have come to the fore in the country .
People have remembered him as the best MP, sensitive writer, best speaker, popular Prime Minister and do
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act to Two Thoughts Three
This change made two important changes in India ' s politics
First , the size of the cabinet in the states was limited to 15 of the total assembly seats .
Secondly, the limit fixed under the anti-defection law was increased from one-third to two-thirds.
Along with this, clear guidelines were also set for disqualification of defection people.
For many years, the political culture of forming a huge cabinet in India was made not only for the distribution of large - scale cabinet work but for the happiness of the politicians .
Atal ji changed it
His move saved money and resources
With this, efficiency also increased
It was like a visionary like Atal ji who changed the situation and healthy traditions flourished in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot
There was a change in the time of presenting the budget during his tenure .
Earlier , according to the tradition of the British , the budget was presented at 5 o ' clock in the evening because at that time it was the time for parliament to start in London .
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 a.m.
Many such rules have been made in this code, which made it possible to hoist the tricolor at public places
Due to this, more and more Indians got the opportunity to hoist their national flag
So they brought our life - loving tricolor closer to the masses .
Similarly, nowadays you are seeing that the discussion is going on in the country about holding elections of central and state together.
People are talking about this subject both in favor of this subject and opposition
It ' s a good thing and a good sign for democracy
I would certainly like to say that for a healthy democracy, developing good traditions for a good democracy, making constant efforts to strengthen democracy, moving ahead with open minds in the discussions will also be a great tribute to Atal ji.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfill his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I pay tribute to Atal ji on behalf of all of us.
Just a few days before the monsoon session of Parliament has ended
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 74 .
All MPs above the Dalit tried to make the monsoon session more useful and this is the result that the Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and the Rajya Sabha passed 14 bills.
This monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and welfare of the youth .
This session passed several important bills benefiting the youth and the backward communities .
You all know that for decades, just like the SC / ST Commission, there was a demand for setting up a B Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes this time the country has fulfilled its resolve to form a BC Commission and also gave it a constitutional right .
This step will prove to be the driving force of social justice .
In order to safeguard the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes , the amendment bill was also passed in this session .
This law will further safeguard the interests of SC and ST communities
At the same time it will prevent criminals from being tortured and believe in Dalit communities
No civilized society can tolerate any kind of injustice against the women power of the country .
The country is not ready to tolerate the culprits of rape, so Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and has made provision for the harshest punishment.
The culprits of rape will be punished for at least 10 years, they will be punished for raping girls under the age of 12 years.
A few days ago you will have read in the newspapers, a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, after hearing only two months, has sentenced two convicts of the rape to death.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh, after only five days of hearing, sentenced the culprits to death.
Rajasthan has also made similar quick decisions by the courts there .
This law will play an effective role in preventing crimes against women and girls .
Economic progress is incomplete without social change
Although this session of the Rajya Sabha has not been possible , I assure Muslim women that the whole country stands with them in full strength to get justice .
When we move forward in the country, the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived can be changed.
This time in the monsoon session, everyone has presented an ideal
These days the attention of millions of people is on the Asian Games in Jakarta
Every day in the morning, people first watch newspapers, television, news, on social media and watch which Indian player has won the medal
Asian games are still running
I would like to congratulate all the players who have won medals for the country .
I also convey my best wishes to those players whose matches are yet to be held.
India's players are performing outstandingly in shooting and Resting, but our players are also bringing medals in those games in which our performance has not been so good before, like in sports like Joshua and rowing, these are not just medals but proofs - Indian sports and players are touching the sky with enthusiasm and dreams.
Among the medal winners for the country are our daughters in large numbers and this is a very positive sign - even among the young players who win the medal are our 15-16 year olds too .
It is also a very good sign that most of the players who have won medals are from small towns and villages and these people have achieved this success with hard work.
On August 29, we will celebrate National Sports Day. On this occasion, I offer my best wishes to all sports lovers and also pay my tributes to the great hockey magician, Shri Dhyanchand ji.
I request all citizens of the country to play and take care of their fitness because a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
Once again I congratulate the medal winners in the Asian Games and also wish the rest of the players a very good performance
Best wishes to everyone on the National Sports Day
Namaste, I respect your feelings.
All of us have seen houses and buildings being constructed with bricks and stones but can you imagine that about 1200 years ago a huge mountain which was just a single stone mountain, was given the shape of an excellent, huge and wonderful temple - perhaps it was difficult to imagine, but it happened and that temple is- Kailashnath temple in Ellora, Maharashtra.
If someone tells you that a column of granite more than 60 metres was built about a thousand years ago and on its summit a rock of about 80 tons of granite was placed - will you believe it ?
However, the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this incredible match of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everybody gets surprised to see the 11th century queen in Patan of Gujarat .
India has been a land engineering lab
There have been many engineers in India who have made unimaginable and presented examples called miracles in the world of engineering.
We also got a gem in our heritage of great engineers whose work is still amazement of the people and it was Bharat Ratna Dr. M. Visvesvaraya.
He is revered in that part of the country, the rest of the country remembers him with great respect and intimacy.
In memory of them , September 15 is made as an engineer ' s day
Following their footprints , the engineers of our country have distinguished themselves all over the world .
When I talk about the miracles of the engineering world, I remember one incident of the terrible earthquake that had occurred in Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
At that time I used to work as a Volunteer and I got the opportunity to visit a village and there I got the opportunity to meet a mother who was more than 100 years of age and she was mocking me and looking at me, she was saying, look, this is my house - this is my house - I will call her in Kutch. She said, this house has seen 3-3 earthquakes.
But you haven ' t seen any harm anywhere .
This house was built by our ancestors according to the nature here and it was according to the environment here and it was saying this thing so proudly that I had the idea that centuries ago the engineers of that period had constructed according to the local conditions that kept the common man safe.
Now that we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think about the future.
Workshows should be done at places
What new things have we to learn in the changed era
The world is struggling with natural disasters
What should be the new form of structural engineering
What are his courses?
What to teach students ?
How did zero waste become our priority ?
There are many things when Engineers Day is celebrated , we must think .
There is an atmosphere of festivals and along with that the preparations for Diwali begins .
We will continue to meet in Mann Ki Baat, keep on talking about our minds and will continue to work for the progress of the country with our own minds.
With this spirit, my best wishes to you all
Thank you
Will meet again
Good rainfall reports are coming in many places these days .
Somewhere there is also news of anxiety due to excessive rainfall and in some places people are still waiting for rain.
India's vastness, diversity, sometimes rain also shows the form of liking and dislike, but what do we blame for the rain, it is man who has chosen the path of struggle with nature and as a result of that nature sometimes leans on us
And that is why we all have the responsibility to be the lover of nature, we should be the protector of nature, if we become the promoter of nature, then there is a balance between what Nature has given us.
In the same way, the incident of a natural calamity attracted the attention of the whole world, shocked the human mind.
All of you must have seen on TV that a team of 12 teenage football players in Thailand and their coach went to the cave to visit
It usually takes a few hours to go into the cave and get out of it.
But on that day fate had something else to accept .
When they entered the cave , and were filled with water at the entrance of the cave , suddenly , because of a heavy rain .
You can imagine how those moments will happen when you see death in front of a teenage state and have to spend moments.
On the one hand, they were struggling with crisis, on the other hand, humanity was united all over the world and expressing the divine virtues of humanity.
People all over the world were praying to take these children out safely
Everyone, be it the government, the parents of these children, their family members, media or the citizens of the country, everyone has done a wonderful job of peace and patience.
Everyone was engaged in his mission as a team.
In this entire operation a Thai Navy soldier lost his life too
The whole world is astonished at the fact that he did not give up his hope with so much courage and patience in a dark cave full of water despite such difficult circumstances .
It shows that when humanity comes together, there are wonderful things
Just need us to focus on our goal with a calm and stable mind, keep working for it.
In the past, our country's beloved poet Neeraj ji left us.
Neeraj ji had a special feature - hope, faith, determination, faith in himself
However , the months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth .
Because this is the time when the collages have a pack session
Millions of young people like Satyam leave school and go to college
If you go to exams in February and March in exams, papers and answerers, then in April and May holidays, together with fun, results, decide the direction ahead in life and the career choice is put in place.
July is the month when young people step in that new phase of their lives when they leave the focus options and go to the cut-off stage.
Students' attention goes from home to hostel
Students come under the shadow of processors from the shadow of parents
I'm sure my young friends will be very excited and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time, going out of the house, going out of the village, getting out of a protective environment, you have to become your own charioteer.
For the first time, so many young people leave their homes and come out to give a new direction to their lives.
Many students have joined their college so far, some will be going to join
I would like to tell you this thing: be calm, enjoin life, enjoy inner peace in life
There is no choice but to study, but there should be a tendency to find new things.
Old friends have their own value
Childhood friends are valuable, but choosing, making and maintaining new friends is a very wise task in itself.
Learn something new, like new skills, learn new languages
The youth who have left their homes and have gone to some other place to study, find out about those places, the people there, the language, the culture there, the tourist places there - go there, know about them.
My best wishes to all the youngsters on the start of a new innings
His father takes care of his family
I congratulate them for their success
There are many students who belong to the poor family and despite the adverse circumstances, they have done something with their hard work and passion, which inspires us all.
Bitia of Afreen Sheikh of Ahmedabad, whose father runs auto rickshawshav, the daughter of Nagpur is happy, whose father is a driver in the school bus or Kartik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand whose father wages in brick and kiln.
Ramesh himself used to sell toys at the fair or Anushka Panda, a Divyang daughter of Gurgaon, who has been suffering from a genetic disease called spinal muscular trophy since birth, all of them have achieved such a success by crossing every obstacle with their determination and courage.
If we look around us we will find many such examples .
Neeraj ji has said that the song is to recite the sky to the earth. I have to call every darkness into light. I have to head the sword with the smell of flowers, and to awaken the mountains of the song. My dear countrymen, a few days ago my eyes went on a news, it was written - Two young people did Modi's dream come true.
The incident was that once in America's San Jose City, known as Technology Hub, I was discussing with Indian youth
I had appealed to them that they should think about how they can use their talent for India and they should do something by taking time out.
I appealed to change brain-rain into brain-gain
Using his professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have jointly developed a SmartGaon app.
This app is not only connecting the people of the village with the whole world but now they can get any information and information on their own mobile
The residents of this village of Rae Bareli, the villagers, the villagers, the district magistrates, all the people made people aware about the use of this app.
If you look at this incident closely then one thing will be remembered that the youth of America is leading a life in the midst of the life, thinking and thinking of that place. They must have left India several years ago but still they know the nuances of their village, understand the challenges and are connected to the village.
For this reason, he probably found something in the village exactly what he wanted.
There is a natural tendency in every Indian to do something for the village, for the village, for its roots and for the country.
But sometimes due to time, sometimes due to distances, sometimes due to circumstances, a slight ash accumulates on it, but if a small spark comes in its touch then all the things come up once again and they draw it towards their past days.
Even in our case, it has not happened. Conditions, circumstances and distances have not separated us.
Santosh ji, thank you very much for your phone call
In fact Pandharpur Vari is a wonderful journey in itself .
Friends, The day of Ashadhi Ekadashi, which was on July 23, is also celebrated as the grand culmination of Pandharpur Vari.
Pandharpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra .
About 15 - 20 days before Ashadhi Ekadashi pilgrims come out on foot to visit Pandharpur .
This journey, which is called Warri, includes millions of Warkaris
Keeping in the palanquin of great saints like Saint Dnyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram, Vitthal singing, dancing and playing walk towards Pandharpur
Pilgrims reach there for the visit of Lord Vithal, also called Vithova or Pandurang.
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived, the victims
There is immense reverence among the people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
Going to Vithova Temple in Pandharpur and having its own different experience of glory, beauty and spiritual happiness.
I urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to experience Pandharpur Vari once they get an opportunity.
Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram countless saints are still educating the masses in Maharashtra.
They are giving strength to fight against superstition and in every corner of India this saint tradition has been giving inspiration .
We receive important messages of harmony, love and brotherhood from them, be it their pride or disillusionment.
It gives a mantra to fight society with reverence against superstition
These were the people who stopped the society from time to time, showed the tone and the mirror and ensured that the old evils were eradicated from our society and the values of compassion, equality and purity were inculcated among the people.
It is our Bharat- Bhumi, multi-ratna Vasundhara. Just like there was a great tradition of saints in our country, in the same way the great men who dedicated their lives to the powerful mother-Bharati, sacrificed their lives.
One such great man is Lokmanya Tilak who has left a deep impression in the minds of many Indians .
We remember the birth anniversary of Tilak ji on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence .
They had the power and wisdom to show the mirror of their mistakes to the British rulers .
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that they tried to sedition them three times in 20 years, and this is not a small thing.
I would like to present before the countrymen an interesting incident related to Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad today.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40,000 people welcomed him in Ahmedabad almost a hundred years ago and during his visit Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with him and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was very impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 1, 1920, he had decided that he would build his memorial in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected the Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and immediately he selected the Victoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak and this Victoria Garden which was named after the Queen of Britain.
Finally, the statue was built and Sardar Saheb inaugurated it not from anyone but from 28th February, 1929 and it is a matter of great pleasure. In that inaugural ceremony, Pujya Bapu said that after Sardar Patel's arrival, the Ahmedabad municipality has not only got a person but also got the courage that has made it possible to build the statue of Tilak ji.
And my dear countrymen, the specialty of this statue is that it is a rare statue of Tilak in which he is sitting on a chair. It is written just below Tilak that Swaraj is our birthright and I am listening to this period of the British.
With the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak , the tradition of public Ganesh festival started .
Public Ganesh Utsav became an effective medium for promoting traditional reverence and celebration as well as social awakening, collectiveness, harmony and equality among the people.
At that time, it was a period when it was necessary that the country should unite for the fight against the British. These festivals broke the barriers of caste and creed and worked to unite everyone.
over time the popularity of these events grew
This shows that even today our young generation is crafty towards our ancient heritage and our brave heroes of history .
Today in many cities it happens that you get to see Ganesh - Pandal in almost every street .
This is also an excellent opportunity for our youth, where they can learn the qualities of leadership and organization, and develop them within themselves.
I had requested for the last time too and when I am remembering Lokmanya Tilak ji, I will once again urge you to celebrate Ganesh Utsav with great fanfare and celebrate it with great fanfare.
From the statue of Ganeshji to the decoration everything should be eco-friendly and I would like that in every city there should be separate competitions for eco-friendly Ganesh festival, they should be rewarded and I would like that on MyGov as well as on Narendra Modi App, all the items related to eco-friendly Ganesh Utsav should be kept for wider publicity.
I will convey your message to the people.
Lokmanya Tilak instilled confidence in the countrymen. He gave the slogan Swaraj is our birthright and we will take it.
Today is the time to say that Swaraj is our birthright and we will take it
Every Indian should have access to good governance and good results of development .
I'm talking about Chandra Shekhar Azad
Who will be such a young man in India who will not be inspired to listen to these lines
Chandrasekhar Azad's passion for bravery and freedom, it inspired many young people
Azad put his life on the stake, but he never bowed before foreign rule
It has been my good fortune that I had the privilege of going to Alirajpur in the village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
I also had the opportunity to pay homage at the Chandrasekhar Azad Park in Allahabad and Chandrasekhar Azad Ji was a brave man who did not even want to die by the bullet of foreigners - if you live then you fight for freedom and even if you die then you will die by being free. That was his specialty.
Once again I salute the two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland, a 400 meter race, in that competition, India's brave daughter and farmer daughter Hima Das has created history by winning the gold medal.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhyan, emailed me from Indonesia in response to my letter. Right now she is preparing for Asian Games there.
-Mail writes unity: The most important moment in the life of an athlete is when he catches the tricolor and I am proud that I have done it
Unity is the pride of all of us
You have illuminated the name of the country
Unity in the World Para Athletics Grand Pre 2018 in Tunisia has won Gold and Brone medals.
His achievement is special because he made his challenge the medium of success .
Daughter Ekta Bhyan in 2003, due to road accident, half of her body failed, but this daughter did not lose courage and achieved this position while strengthening herself.
One more Divyang Yogesh Kathunia ji, he won the world record by winning the gold medal in the discus thread in the Para Athletics Grand Pri in Berlin. Sunder Singh Gurjar also won the gold medal in the Javelin.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is full of events and festivals, but due to the weather, sometimes the disease also enters the house.
I wish all of you the very best for the best of health, for the best of patriotism, for the month of August and for many festivals which have been going on for centuries.
Then verily , we shall meet for the Word of the Mind .
Hello!
My dear countrymen, once again I have got the opportunity to be with you all in this episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Just a few days ago there was a historic cricket match in Bengaluru .
You must have understood that I am talking about a Test match between India and Afghanistan.
This was Afghanistan ' s first international match and it is a matter of pride for every Indian that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India .
Both the teams performed the best in this match and the other one from Afghanistan, Rashid Khan, this year
I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani had tacked me on his twitter saying Afghanistan is extremely proud of his hero Rashid Khan
I am also grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our players to show their skills
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan
He's an asset to the world of cricket and at the same time he didn't even write it in a funny way. We're not gonna give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable one for all of us .
Well this was the first match , so it ' s very natural to remember , but I will remember this match for a particular reason .
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world
What can a winning team do when the Indian team takes the trophy
- While taking the trophy, the team of Afghanistan, who was playing the international match for the first time, invited the team of Afghanistan and both the teams took photographs together
We can experience this one event - what happens to sportsman spirit, what happens to sportsmanship
Sports is a tremendous way of uniting the society and exploring the talent of our youth.
My dear countrymen, this June 21 had a different view on the fourth Yoga Day.
The whole world looked united
Be it the European Parliament in Brazil, the United Nations Headquarters at New York, the Japanese Navy's fighters and people everywhere can be seen doing yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia , there was a historic program of yoga and I have been told that many Asanas were demonstrated by women .
On the high snowy peaks of Ladakh the soldiers of India and China have together practiced yoga .
Yoga works to break all the boundaries, add
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have made this occasion a big celebration by going beyond race, religion, region, color or gender.
If people from all over the world were so excited and participating in the Yoga Day programmes then why would it not be encouraged in India
Our air warriors stunned everyone by performing yoga at an altitude of 15,000 feet from the ground in the middle of the sky.
The sight of seeing was that they swim in the air, not in the airplane.
Be it school, college, office, park, high building or playground, yoga is everywhere
Yoga has worked to unite the people of the world by going beyond caste, creed and geography. The spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have lived for centuries
Our sages, ascetics, who always insist on Yoga, have proved it in true sense.
more and more people will make it a part of their lives .
Many people have written to me on MyGov and NarendraModiApp that I will talk about the Doctors Day on July 1 in this episode of Mann Ki Baat - is the right thing
We are those people who naturally worship mother as God, consider it equal to God because mother gives us life, mother gives us birth, so many times the doctor gives us life.
Doctor ' s role is not limited to just treating diseases .
Today the doctor is not only having medical expertise but also has a deep experience about the general life style trends and its impact on our health.
Indian doctors have made their mark all over the world with their capabilities and skills .
Our doctors are known to solve complex medical problems as well as hard work in the medical profession.
We are fortunate people who have been born in this land of India
India has a rich history when there is no such month, there is no such day in which no historical event has happened.
Look, India has its own legacy everywhere
There is a saint associated with it, there is a great man, there is a famous person, everyone has his own contribution, it is his greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on the 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, you know very well the Kabirwad of Gujarat.
When I used to work there, I had also organized a large national convention of the people associated with the tradition of Sant Kabir.
You people know why Kabirdas Ji had gone to Maghar
At that time there was a belief that who dies in Maghar, he does not go to heaven
On the contrary, the body that sacrifices in Kashi goes to heaven.
Maghar was considered impure , but Saint Kabirdas did not believe it .
They had broken the superstitions and customs of their time , and so they went to Maghar , and that is why they took to death .
Sant Kabirdas Ji, through his teachings, emphasized on social equality, peace and brotherhood.
That was his ideal
We see this ideal in his writings , and in today ' s era he is equally inspiring .
Meaning the true saint is the one who knows and understands the pain of others, who do not know the misery of others, they are cruel.
Kabirdas ji laid special emphasis on social harmony
They thought far ahead of their time .
Put it on you, show mercy to all
Kabir writes in another couplet - Where mercy is religion, where greed is sin
They said: - Do not ask the caste, the sadhu, ask the knowledge
Such is the greatness of the guru and such a guru, Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev
Those who showed the path to crores of people, kept inspiring for centuries.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God
Wherever they went they took many initiatives for the good of the society
A system of kitchen free from social discrimination where a person of every caste, creed, religion or sect could come and eat food, Guru Nanak Dev started this anchor system.
Guru Nanak Devji's 550th Prakash Parv will be celebrated in 2019
I want all of us to engage with enthusiasm and excitement .
I also urge all of you to think, prepare and prepare for the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji and celebrate it in the entire society and across the world, whether it is new ideas or new ideas, whether it is new or new and it should be celebrated with great pride.
My dear countrymen
India's struggle for independence is very long, very wide, very deep and full of countless martyrdom.
There is another history associated with Punjab
In 2019, 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh that embarrassed the entire humanity.
We can all think about how to remember 100 years of this incident, but always remember the immortal message that this incident has given, this violence and cruelty can never solve any problem.
Victory is always of peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice
Shri Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi has written on Narendra Modi Mobile App that on July 6, it is Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's birthday and he wants to talk to the countrymen about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this program.
Raman ji first thank you very much
It was great to see your interest in the history of India.
You know, yesterday was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on June 23,
Very few people would be aware that in 1937 on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convention in the University of Kolkata in Bengali.
This was the first time that the British had a Sultanate and someone at the University of Kolkata addressed the convolution in Bengali.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industries Minister of India and in a sense, he had laid a strong foundation for industrial development of India, built a strong base, prepared a strong platform.
Dr. Mukherjee's dream was that India should be industrially self-reliant, efficient and prosperous in every field.
He wanted India to develop big industries as well as focus on MSMEs, handloom, textiles and cottage industry.
He was quite Passionate about the development of West Bengal .
It is the result of his understanding, conscience and activism that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still a part of India.
For Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the most important thing was the integrity and unity of India - and for this, at the age of 52, he also lost his life.
We should always remember the message of unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, with the spirit of harmony and brotherhood and keep alive for the progress of India.
In the last few weeks, I have had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video call.
I got the opportunity to know about the changes that are taking place in the lives of people beyond the files.
People spoke about their resolve, their happiness and misery, their achievements
I believe that this was not just a government program for me but it was a different kind of learning experience. And what could be a moment of greater satisfaction than the happiness that has been witnessed on the faces of the people during this time
When he used to hear the stories of a common man, his innocent words touched the heart of what he was saying.
In the remote villages, the daughters are providing services from the pension of the elders of the villages to the construction of the passport through the Common Service Centres.
When a sister of Chhattisgarh selects Sitaphal and does her business by making her office-cream
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, millions of young people of the country are running the drug center as well as providing cheap medicines by going to the nearby villages .
At the same time a young man from West Bengal is looking for a job two to three years ago and now he is only doing his successful business
Not only this, giving more jobs to ten to fifteen people
Here, students from schools of Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working at the school's tinkering lab on import topic such as waste management.
Do not know how many stories were there in no corner of the country where people should not talk about their success
In such an environment, when the common man (human) comes with new hope, new excitement and incidents in his life, then he is not credited with the government.
Even the incident of a small girl from a remote village becomes an inspiration for 1.25 billion people .
For me, with the help of technology, with the help of video bridge, one moment of spending time with the beneficiaries has been very pleasant, very inspiring and it not only gives me satisfaction of working but also encourages to do more.
Another new joy, another new enthusiasm, another new inspiration, comes for the poorest of the poor.
I am very grateful to the countrymen
40-40, 50-50 lakh people joined this video bridge program and you have given me new strength.
I once again want to express my gratitude to all of you
I always feel that if we look around us then something good happens somewhere or the other .
are people who do good
We can also experience the aroma of goodness .
One thing came to my notice in the past and this is a very unique combination
On the one hand there are professionals and engineers while on the other hand there are farm workers and our farmer brothers and sisters associated with agriculture.
They came together with the TV engineers and created an intuitive prosperity trust and activated this trust to double the income of the farmers.
Connecting with the farmers, making plans and making successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers
The farmers producing grains are also associated with it .
On the one hand, farmers have a major role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing and on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure the participation of the farmers in the profits.
A separate Seed-Bank has been created for the crops to be good, for the seeds of good breed.
Women see the functioning of this seed-bank, women have also been added
I congratulate these youth for this innovative experiment and I am glad that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, technology and engineering have come out of their scope to connect with the farmers, to connect with the villages, to the fields and to the barn.
Once again I would like to congratulate the young generation of my country for their innovative experiments, which I might have to go, which I might not have to go, some people might have known, some may not have known, but continuously millions and millions of people are doing something good, all of them my best wishes to you all.
One nation, one tax was the dream of the people of the country and today it has turned into a reality.
One Nation One Tax reform, if I want to give credit to anyone the most, then I give credit to the states.
GST is a great example of Cooperative Federalism, where all the states together took a decision in the country and then by that time such a big tax reform could be implemented in the country.
So far 27 meetings have been held by the GST Council and we can all be proud that people from different political ideologies sit there, people from different states, different priority states are there, but in spite of this, all the decisions taken so far in the GST Council have been taken unanimously.
There were 17 different types of taxes in the country before the GST, but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country.
GST is a victory of honesty and a celebration of honesty
In the case of tax for a long time in the country, complaints of Inspector Raj used to come.
From returns to refunds, everything happens through online information technology.
With the introduction of GST, the check post was removed and the movement of goods increased, which is not only saving time but also benefitting the logistics sector.
GST may be the world's largest tax reform
Such a big tax reform in India was successful because the people of the country adopted it and it was through people's power that the success of GST was ensured.
It is generally believed that such a big reform, such a big country, such a large population takes 5 to 7 years to complete this task. But the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the celebration of the country's honesty and the participation of the people, it is the result of the participation of the people that within a year, this new tax system has made its place, it has achieved stability and it keeps improving as per the requirement with its input system.
Through Mann Ki Baat, once again I have got the opportunity to be amongst you
You might well remember the six women commanders of the Navy, one of whom had been on a sea trip for the past several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama - I want to talk about them .
These 6 daughters of India, their team has done more than 250 days through sea.
INS Tarini has returned to India on 21 May , on a tour of the whole world and was warmly welcomed by the whole country .
They traveled through different oceans and many seas and covered a distance of about 22 , 000 nautical miles
This was one of the first events in the world itself
Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet all these daughters, listen to their experiences.
I once again congratulate these daughters for their adventure, for increasing the prestige of the Navy, and for increasing the respect of India and especially for the world that India's daughters are not less. I congratulate them for conveying this message.
Who does not know the Sense of adventure
If we look at the development journey of the human race then progress has been made only in the womb of some adventure.
Development takes birth in the lap of adventure .
I believe that the intention of doing something, the meaning of doing something other than the leak, the meaning of doing something more or the other, I can do something - these feelings may be less, but for ages, millions and millions of people continue to get inspired.
On 16th May, five tribal children from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra climbed the highest peak of the world with Tribal students Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ala, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam.
These Ashram School students started training in August 2017 - they were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh, Ladakh.
These youth were selected under Mission Shaurya and they have honored the whole country by winning the best according to their name.
I heartily congratulate the people of Chandrapur School, my young friends.
Recently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to conquer the Everest from Nepal
Many congratulations to daughter Shivangi
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter became the first Indian daughter-in-law to climb Diya Everest
Not only that young people are climbing the Everest
Sangeeta Bahal climbed the Everest on 19th May and Sangeeta Bahal is more than 50 years old
This work is commendable and at the same time it shows their commitment towards cleanliness, towards the environment.
Over the years, people have been climbing the Everest and there are many who have successfully completed it.
I heartily congratulate all these bravehearts, especially their daughters.
so a large number of people from every area will come forward in its support
When I talk about Fit India, I believe that the more we play, the more the country will play
On social media, people are sharing videos of fitness challenge, tag each other in it and challenge them
Many times in the matter of mind, you have heard something from me about the games, about the players and the last time our heroes of the Commonwealth Games, talking to us through this programme - Namaste Sir
Image Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that the games that were once a part of every child's life, are becoming less today.
These games were specially part of the summer holidays .
Yes, it may be that at different places they were known by different names, like Pittu is now known by many names.
Someone do not know him Lagori, Satolia, seven stones, Dikori, Satodia, how many names are the same game
There are two types of games in traditional games .
There are outdoors too, too.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games .
The same game is known by different names, different places
I am from Gujarat. I know there is a game in Gujarat, which is called Chomal-Esto.
It ' s played with codes or tamarind seeds or dice and with 88 square boards .
This game was played in almost every state .
We used to play this game
Who of us will be, who has not played Gilli-Danda in childhood
Gilli-Danda is a game played in villages to cities
It is known by different names in different parts of the country .
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla .
In Orissa it is called Gulibari , in Maharashtra it is called Financedulu .
Some games have a session of their own
You must have seen many children, who are of a shy nature, but get very upset while playing
When everything from children to grandparents, when they play, then what they say is Generation Gap, it also changes.
At the same time we also know our culture and traditions .
Many games also make us aware about society, environment etc.
Through crowd sourcing we can create a very large archive of our traditional games
Videos of these games can be created, which can be shown about the rules of sports, how to play
On June 5, our country will officially host the World Environment Day Celebrations of India.
This is a very important achievement for India and it is also a sign of India ' s growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change .
This time the Beat Plastic Pollution
I appeal to all of you, considering the importance of this theme, let us all ensure that we do not use polythene, low grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on our lives and on our health.
Visit the World Environment Day website of WED-INDIA 2018 and many suggestions there have been very interestingly given - see, know and try to bring them into your everyday lives.
In the last few weeks, all of us have seen that there has been dust storms in different parts of the country, strong winds and heavy rains, which are unprecedented.
Loss of life, loss of goods
We have to live in harmony with nature, we have to stay connected with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated every step of his life
When India played a leading role in the COP-21 and Paris Agreement, when we united the whole world through the International Solar Alliance, all of them had a sense of fulfillment of that dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this Environment Day, let us all think about what we can do to make our plan clean and green.
How can you move forward in this direction?
Can we innovate?
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends
You always remember on June 21, not only you, but the whole world remembers on June 21.
21st June is celebrated as International Day of Yoga all over the world and it has been accepted and people start preparations months back .
These days the news is getting, there is a lot of preparations going on in the whole world to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21.
Centuries ago this thing has been said that by doing regular yoga practice some good qualities become like relatives and friends .
Yoga creates courage which always protects us like a father
There is a feeling of forgiveness as the mother does for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend .
Bhartrihari has said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our child, mercy, our sister, self-restraint, our brother, the earth itself becomes our bed and knowledge to eradicate our hunger.
When so many qualities become companions of someone , the yogi conquers all kinds of fear .
Once again, I appeal to all the countrymen to take forward their legacy of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today 27th May is the death anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru .
I salute Panditji
The memory of this month is also related to another thing and that is Veer Savarkar
It was the month of May in 1857, when Indians showed their strength to the British
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers stood up against injustice while showing their bravery.
Sadly , for a very long time , the events of 1857 were only described as rebellion or Sepoy Mutiny .
In fact , that event was not only reduced but it was also an attempt to push our self - respect .
It is also a wonderful coincidence that in the month when the first freedom struggle started, Veer Savarkar ji was born in the same month.
Savarkarji ' s personality was full of qualities
A wonderful description about Savarkar ji was made by our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji .
How accurate was Atal ji
Savarkar accompanied both poetry and revolution .
Along with being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary
I was watching a story on TV about our poor daughters of the villages of Sikar in Rajasthan.
Our daughters, who were once forced to pick up garbage and ask for a house-to-house, are now learning sewing and stitching clothes to cover the poor.
The daughters here are sewing from normal to good clothes, apart from themselves and their family's clothes today
They're also doing skill development courses.
Our daughters have become self-reliant today they are living their lives with dignity and have become a strength for their families.
I wish these daughters, full of hope and faith, the very best for their bright future.
They have shown that if you have the courage to do something and are committed to it then success can be achieved even in the midst of all the difficulties. And this is not just a matter of Sikar that you will get to see all these things in every corner of India.
If you look around you, you will notice how people overcome the difficulties.
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, enjoy the tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some people.
These discussions are political as well as social, film and sports as well as the problems of the country such as the problems of the country such as this should be solved. But often these things remain confined to discussion only but there are some people who move forward in the direction of bringing about changes with their work, their hard work and dedication.
Such a story of D. Prakash Rao, who lives in the slums of Cuttack city of Orissa, to make his own dreams and to fulfill them.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to meet D. Prakash Rao
Mr. D. Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the past five decades.
They make full arrangements for education, health and food to all the children who come to school
I congratulate D. Prakash Rao for his hard work, his passion and giving a new direction to the lives of those poor children.
They have cut off the darkness of their life .
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and the whole country.
Let ' s take the positivity forward
In the month of June , there is so much heat that people wait for rain and in this hope they look at the clouds in the sky .
A few days from now , people will wait for the moon .
The meaning of the moon is that the Eid can be celebrated .
After one month 's fast during Ramzan the festival of Eid is a symbol of the beginning of celebration .
I am confident that everyone will celebrate Eid with full fervor and on this occasion children will get a special Eidi .
I hope the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
Best wishes to everyone
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
Then once again next month we will meet in mind
Talk of mind, April 2018
V.
Connect with it India, lead it India and I am very happy that people are joining it with great enthusiasm. Many people have written to me, have sent letters, have shared their fitness mantras on social media, it has also shared India stories. A gentleman Mr.
Ruma Devnath writes, "I feel myself happy and healthy with the morning walk and she further says - for me fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy.
Make these holidays a learning opportunity for a new experience
When we hear that there are going to be wars about water in the world in the future , everyone speaks but is there any responsibility for us ?
Do we not think that water conservation should be a social responsibility?
That is, it is the responsibility of those who have knowledge that I do not know Bengali language to share it with the curious ones, but when I was young I had a habit of getting up very early - from my childhood and in eastern India the radio starts early, when it starts late in the western India, then in the morning I have a big idea.
Rabindra Sangeet started at 30 o'clock, and I did not know the language, I had a habit of listening to Rabindra Sangeet on radio early in the morning and I had a habit of listening to Rabindra Sangeet on radio and when I got an opportunity to listen to these poems Anandloke and Aguner, Poroshmoni, the mind was very conscious. You too must have been impressed by Rabindra Sangeet and his poems.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian. We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who has shown the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who has guided millions around the world. This Buddha Purnima reminds us of our responsibility to strive, resolve and walk on the path of Lord Buddha while remembering Lord Buddha. Lord Buddha is the inspiration of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Ambedkar emphasises that Lord Buddha has been a source of great inspiration in his social philosophy. He had said, My social philosophy may be said to be shared in three words
Today is the holy festival of Ramnavmi
My best wishes to the countrymen on this holy festival of Ram Navami.
We have seen the power of Ram in the life of revered Bapu every moment in his life .
On the 26th of January last year, when all the dignitaries of the ASEAN countries were here, they had come with a cultural trip and it is a matter of great pride that most of them were presenting the Ramayana to us.
That is, the Ram and the Ramayana are producing the same inspiration and influence not only in India but also in the entire world.
I once again wish you all the very best on Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, like every time, I have received a lot of letters, emails, phone calls and comments from all of you.
Komal Thakkar ji wrote on MyGov about the launch of on-line courses on Sanskrit.
It's great to see your love for Sanskrit as well as being a TV professional.
I have asked the concerned department to inform you about the efforts being made in this direction .
Listeners of Mann Ki Baat who work on Sanskrit, I would also request them to consider how to carry forward the suggestion of Komal ji
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar ji, Village Barkar, District Nalanda, Bihar - Read comments on your NarendraModiApp
The concern you have expressed on the decreasing water level in the ground is definitely very important.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animals and birds in the summer .
Sakal ji, I have conveyed your feelings to all the listeners.
Mr. Yogesh Bhadresh ji, he says that this time I will talk to the youth about their health.
They think that comparisons in the Asian countries are our youth who are psychologically weak
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time I will talk about health in detail with everyone.
Recently, the President of France had gone on a visit to Kashi. Shri Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the scenes of that journey were going to touch the mind, were going to create an impact.
And, he urged that all those photos, videos and live on social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had shared those photos on social media and NarendraModiApp the same day.
Ungha, Jayesh, I want to tell all the children that your letters make me feel tired all day.
There are so many letters, so many phone calls, comments, whatever I could read, whatever I could hear, and so many of these things that touched my heart even if I talked about them, perhaps for months I would have to say something or the other continuously.
This time most of the letters belong to children who wrote about the gym
Holidays have shared their plan, plan
There is concern about the water of animals and birds in summer .
The letters of the farmer brothers and sisters have come to know about the activities related to farmers, fairs and farming in the country.
Some active citizens have sent suggestions on water conservation
The festive season speaks of our festivals, our culture, our traditions.
That is, things of the mind also change with the weather and perhaps it is also true that the words of our mind, sometimes change the weather in someone's life.
and why not change
He has the power to change the weather all over the country .
13 years ago, due to lack of timely treatment, the sister of Kolkata's ab-driver Sadul Lakkar died - she decided to set up a hospital so that no poor person died due to lack of treatment.
Sadul sold the jewelery of his house in this mission and collected the money through donation.
In this way, after 12 years of raising the money, the Bhagirathi effort of the last person, brought that color and today due to his hard work and his resolve, he is ready to be a hospital with a capacity of about 30 beds in Punri village near Kolkata.
Many such inspirations introduce my country.
Today, in the entire country, in the youth, in women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class, in every section, this belief has arisen that yes
We can move forward, our country can move forward
A positive atmosphere of confidence filled with hope
This self-confidence, this positivity will prove to be our resolve and dream of a New India.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastriji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji, Chaudhary Devi Lal ji, everyone considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and the common man's life.
The attachment of Mahatma Gandhi to the soil, the field and the farmer, this feeling is reflected in his line. When he had said - To Forge how to dig the earth and to extend the soil, is to get rid of it. That is, if we forget to take care of the soil, it is like forgetting ourselves.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji often emphasized the need for protection of trees, plants and vegetation and better agricultural practices.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia spoke of greater public awareness for better income for our farmers, better irrigation facilities and ensuring them all and increasing food and milk production.
This low - area state has done a great job
Our farmers in Meghalaya have recorded their yield against the last five years during 2015-16.
They have shown that when the goal is set, the courage is high and if there is a resolution in the mind then it can be proved and shown.
In the letters that I have received, I was observing that a lot of farmers had written about the MSP and wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, A major decision has been taken in this year's budget to provide fair price for the crops to the farmers.
It has been decided that MSP for notified crops will be declared at least one and a half times of their cost.
Efforts are being made to connect the local mandis of the village with the wholesale market and the global market.
Farmers do not have to go very far to sell their produce - for this, 22,000 rural haats of the country will be integrated with APMC and e-NAM platform by upgrading them to the necessary infrastructure.
That is, in a way an arrangement is being made to connect the fields with any market of the country.
My dear countrymen, this year, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will begin.
How did the country celebrate this festival?
Clean India is our resolution. In addition to this, 1.25 billion Indians can pay the best tribute to Gandhiji by working shoulder to shoulder.
I urge you all to share your thoughts with everyone through MyGov.
What is the logo of Gandhi 150?
What are slogan or mantras or shlokas?
Give your suggestions about this .
We all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and by remembering Bapu and taking inspiration from him, we have to take our country to new heights.
Thank you. Thank you, you have rightly said and I believe that clean India and healthy India are complementary to each other.
Today, the country has moved ahead of the Conventional Approach in the field of health.
Every work related to health in the country where only the health ministry was responsible, now all the departments and ministries, be it the ministry of sanitation, AYUSH ministry, ministry of medicines and fertilizer, consumer ministry or the women and child development ministry, or the state governments, are working together for a healthy India and the emphasis is on preventive health as well as affordable health.
Preventive health care is also the cheapest and the easiest too.
And the more we are aware of Preventive Health Care, the more the individual, the family and the society will benefit.
The first requirement is to make life healthy - cleanliness
In the form of Preventive Health Care, Yoga has renewed its identity throughout the world.
Guarantees both yoga, fitness and wellness
It is the result of our commitment that Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached every household.
This time the International Day of Yoga is 21st June - between which less than 100 days are left .
On the last three International Day of Yoga, people from all over the country and the world participated enthusiastically.
This time also, we have to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and motivate the whole family, friends, everyone, for yoga right now.
My dear countrymen, I am not a yoga teacher.
I will share this video with you all so that we can practice asana, pranayama together.
Efforts are also being made to ensure that health care is accessible and affordable for the common man .
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are being made available at affordable prices.
More new centers are being opened
My appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat is to inform the needy about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras - their expenses will be reduced.
They will have a great service
The cost of heart stent for heart patients has been reduced to 85
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore families i.e.
The number of MBBS seats in the current 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand
A new medical college will be opened between every 3 districts
The goal of making the country TB free by 2025
That ' s a great job .
You need help in awakening people
We all have to make a collective effort to get rid of TB
My dear countrymen, April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of industrialization of India.
For them, the industry was such an effective medium in which employment could be provided to the poorest of the poor.
Today, India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy and today the world's largest foreign direct FDI
The whole world is looking at India as the FB for investment innovation and development
The development of industries will be possible only in cities. This was the thinking that led to Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar who trusted in urbanization and urbanization of India.
Moving forward with this vision, today a smart city mission and urban mission has been launched in the country so that every kind of facility in the big cities and small towns of the country - be it good roads, water arrangements, health facilities, education or digital connectivity can be provided.
Baba Saheb had a strong belief in self-reliance and self-reliance.
They didn ' t want a person to live his life in poverty .
At the same time, he also believed that by giving only a few shares to the poor, their poverty could not be overcome.
India, Stand up India Initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators, young entrepreneurs.
In the 1930s and 1940s, when only roads and railways were in India, Baba Saheb Ambedkar had talked about ports and waterways.
It was Dr. Baba Saheb who saw water power as a nation-power.
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built at different sea shores of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at the old ports.
During the 40s, most of the discussions were regarding 2nd World War, Emerging World War and Partition. At that time, Dr.
laid the foundation of India's spirit
He spoke about the importance of Federalism, Federalism and emphasized the need to work together with the Center and the States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, in every aspect of governance, we have adopted the mantra of Cooperative Federalism, Co-operative Federalism and above all, Competitive Cooperative Federalism and most importantly, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of people like me associated with the backward classes.
He has shown us that to move forward, it is not necessary to be born in a big or a rich family, but also those born in poor families in India can dream, try to fulfill those dreams and also achieve success.
Yes, it happened when many people ridiculed Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar
India which belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor, to the backward
Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organized from 14th April to 5th May on the occasion of birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.
Under this, there will be different programs on village development, poor-welfare and social justice across India.
I urge you all to take part in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, in the next few days, many festivals are going to come, Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Baisakhi.
The day of the birth of Lord Mahavira is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance .
The life of Lord Mahavira, the messenger of non-violence, will inspire all of us.
Best wishes to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti
As soon as the discussion of Easter comes, one remembers the inspirational teachings of Lord Jesus Christ, who has always given humanity the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion.
In April, the festival of Vaisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India, in the same days, in Bihar, Jodhital and Satuvain, in Assam, Bihu in Assam, will be the joy and joy of Poila Vaisakh in West Bengal.
All these festivals are associated in some way with our farm-yards and food providers. Through these festivals, we thank nature for the precious gifts that we receive in the form of produce.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for all the upcoming festivals.
Today, in the beginning, the mind begins with a phone call.
We have seen that the color of the sea is blue , but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no color of water .
Have we ever thought about the rivers, the seas, why the water becomes colorful
The same question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s .
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India .
When we talk of science then the name of India - Ratna Sir C . . Raman comes to us first .
One of his horoscopes is famous by the name of Raman Exact .
We celebrate National Science Day every year on 28th February because it is said that on this day he had planned the event of flight skating for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has produced many great scientists in the field of science .
On one hand, there has been a tradition of great mathematician Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta, on the other, Sushruta and Charaka in the field of medicine are our pride.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose have brought glory to India .
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, the name of the Camous Party Bose was also named.
It was interesting to know about the wonders that are happening in the field of science
Nowadays machines make their own intelligence smart by self learning .
Can we help farmers with crops ?
In the past, I had the opportunity to visit Gujarat, Ahmedabad, with the Prime Minister of Israel for the inauguration of the I-Create.
Science and Technology, values are neutral
They don't have values, themselves!
any machine will do the same as we want
But, it depends on us what we want to do with the machine
Thomas Alva Dyson inventing Fight Bulb failed many times in his experiments
Once asked about this, he replied that I have searched 10,000 ways to not make the Light Bubble, that is, Dyson also made his failures his own strength.
Fortunately , today I am in the Karmabhoomi of the Maharshi Aurobindo .
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against him, questioned his rule
Similarly, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life.
finding answers and leading to humanity
The feeling of asking questions repeatedly to know the truth is important.
That ' s the real inspiration behind scientific thinking .
Do not sit peacefully until questions like why, what and how can not be answered
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, many times I get a lot of messages on subjects like safety and disaster when people keep writing to me.
Shriman Rabindra Singh from Pune has spoken on local security in his comment on the NarendraModi mobile app.
He has written that safety standards are not as good at factories and construction sites in our country.
On the next 4th of March, India has a National Safety Day, so the Prime Minister should talk about safety in his Mann Ki Baat program so that awareness about safety is increased among the people.
If we are not aware of safety in daily life, are not able to achieve it, then it becomes difficult to get it during the disaster.
We all read the boards written on the roads many times and it says - vigilance is down, there is an accident - a mistake, loss of happiness and smile - leave the world so soon, do not leave the world with security - do not make any fun with security, or else life will be cheaper than that, that sentence has never been used in our life.
If we remain vigilant, follow the necessary rules, then we can protect our lives, but we can save our society from serious accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that many sources of security have been written on the work place but when we look at it, we do not see it anywhere.
As far as disasters are concerned, India is a country full of diversity in terms of geographical and climate.
This country has suffered many natural and man-made disasters, such as chemical and industrial accidents.
The initiative called "Disaster Friend" has also been taken for training volunteers in flood, cyclone prone districts.
is a very important role of training and awareness
Two - three years ago thousands of people used to lose their lives every year with the heat wave .
After this NMA organized workshops for management of Heat Wave, campaign to create awareness among the people.
Everyone's participation led to a good result
The number of deaths from Lu in 2017 unexpectedly decreased to nearly 220
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can get security
I would like to appreciate the countless people working in this way, be it social organizations, or be it conscious citizens, who work in relief and rescue operations, wherever there is a disaster in minutes.
And the number of such anonymous zeroes is no less
We have to be a risk conscious society
In our culture, we often talk about the protection of values, safety of values, but we also have to understand the values of safety, security.
We have to make him a part of our life!
I mean , what was the information system ?
Why ?
Because we are not conscious of nature and therefore our ears, ears and airplanes, listen to us after we sit down but none of us feels that this information is for me.
We have the same experience in every field of life .
We should not think that safety is for someone else, if we all become aware of our safety then the sense of safety of the society is also inherent.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, emphasis was laid on making Waste to Wealth and Waste to Energy through Biogas for the villages under Swachh Bharat.
Initiative was initiated for this and it was named as GBAR-HAN - Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources
The objective of this GBAR-HAN scheme is to clean the villages and to generate wealth and energy from it by converting animal dung and solid waste materials into MPST and BI-GAS.
Some European countries and China use animal dung and other organic wastes to produce energy but its full potential was not being used in India .
We are now moving in this direction under the Swachh Bharat Mission Gramin
Livestock dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste, all these have been set to be used to make biogas based energy.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to see dung and garbage not just as waste but as a source of income.
Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and help keep the village clean.
Animal health will improve and productivity will increase
Biogas will increase self-reliance in energy for cooking and lighting.
Farmers and animal rearers will help in increasing income
New jobs will be available for waste collection, transportation, sale of biogas etc.
An online trading platform will also be created for smooth processing of GobarDhan Yojana which will connect the farmers with buyers so that the farmers can get the right price for their dung and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially my sisters living in rural India, to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating cooperative societies.
I invite you to become a partner in this movement of clean energy and green jobs. Take the initiative to convert waste into wealth in your village and to make dung-rich money from dung.
My dear countrymen, till date we have been hearing about various kinds of festivals without knowing the music festival, food festival and film festival.
But in a unique effort in Raipur , Chhattisgarh , the first garbage festival of the state was organized .
The objective behind this festival organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about the cleanliness of the city's waste creatively and to create awareness about the various ways of reuse the garbage.
There was a variety of activity during this festival, from students to elders, everyone joined.
Different types of artifacts were made using garbage .
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of waste management
Inspired by Raipur , various types of garbage have also been celebrated in other districts .
Everybody took initiatives on their own and shared innovative ideas, discussed discussions and recited poems on cleanliness.
A festive atmosphere was prepared for cleanliness
The way schoolchildren took part, it was amazing.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the entire Chhattisgarh and its government and administration for the innovative way in which the importance of waste management and cleanliness was displayed.
International Women's Day is celebrated every year on 8th March .
There are many programmes in the country and the world .
On this day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar is conferred upon women in the country who have done exemplary work in different fields in the past.
I recall the words of Swami Vivekananda on this occasion .
He had said the idea of perfect womanhood is perfect independence - this idea of Swami ji 1.25 years ago expresses the thinking of women power in Indian culture.
It is the responsibility of all of us to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life today.
We are part of that tradition, where men were identified by women, Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-son, this was the identity of a son
They have not only advanced themselves, but have also done the task of furthering the country and society and taking them to a new position.
In the past , a great suggestion was given to me by some great man .
He had suggested that on 8th March, there are various programs like Women's Day, in every village city, who have completed 100 years.
Can a program of honor of such mothers and sisters be organized and can a long life be talked about in it .
Starting from 26th January 2018, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
It includes about 1 lakh Sakhi Mandals, 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water friends, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women Raj Mistry
You can imagine how big the event is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti is such a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will effectively transform the cleanliness campaign, the culture of cleanliness in normal life into a common mans habit.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in the news that electricity has reached the three villages of Elephanta island after 70 years of independence and the people there are so happy and excited about it.
You all know very well, Elephanta Island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai in the sea.
I was surprised to know that despite being such a big centre of tourism and near Mumbai, electricity did not reach Elephanta for so many years of independence.
For 70 years, the dark shadow that was there in the lives of the people of three villages of Elephanta Island, Rajbandar, Morbandar and Centabandar, now it is the dark sixth and has illuminated their lives.
I congratulate the administration and the people there .
I'm glad the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be illuminated by electricity.
It's not just electricity, but a new beginning of development.
May the life of the countrymen be illuminated, what can be a moment of greater satisfaction and happiness than happiness in their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, we have just celebrated the festival of Shivaratri.
Now the month of March is the month of March, the fields decorated with exciting crops, the golden earrings of the wheat and the beauty of the mango that blossoms the mind - this is the specialty of this month.
But this month is also dear to all of us for the festival of Holi .
On March 2, the whole country will celebrate Holi with joy
The importance of colors in Holi is as important as Holika combustion because this day is the day of burning evils in fire and destroying them .
Holi is an auspicious occasion to forget all the emotions and get together, to be a part of each other's happiness and happiness and also to convey the message of love, unity and brotherhood.
Best wishes and colorful greetings to all the countrymen on the occasion of Holi.
May this festival continue to be full of colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen - the very best
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
My dear countrymen, today I have written a long letter to Shriman Prakash Tripathi on the NarendraModiApp and urged me to touch upon the subjects written in his letter.
He has written, Kalpana Chawla's death date is going to space on February 1.
She left us in the Columbia space crash but inspired millions of young people around the world .
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash Ji that he started with the farewell of Kalpana Chawla in his long letter.
It is sad for all of us that we lost Kalpana Chawla at that early age, but she gave her message from her life to thousands of girls across the world, especially to India, that there is no limit to female power.
If there is a desire and a resolve, if there is a desire to do something then nothing is impossible.
It is a matter of great happiness to see that today women in India are moving fast in every field and making the country proud.
Since ancient times, the respect of women in our country, their place in society and their contribution, has surprised the whole world.
Indian scholars have a long tradition
Many scholars of India have contributed to the fabrication of the Vedas .
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi do not know how many names
It reflects the importance of women in our society .
And only then, in our society, women have been given the status of power.
This woman power binds the entire country, the entire society, the family, the thread of unity
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given many examples ahead
He has written that our courageous defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman's fighter plane will fly in Sukhoi 30, will inspire him
Three brave women, Sage Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avni Chaturvedi have built Fighter Pilates and are undergoing training at Sukhoi-30.
Capacity Vajpayee-led All Women Rue from Delhi to America's San Francisco and back to Delhi Air II
India took off in Boeing jet - and all the women
In the past , Hon ' ble President took a new initiative
The President met a group of extraordinary women who performed something in their respective fields first.
These women achievers of the country, first female merchant crew of the passenger train, first female fire fighter, first female bus driver, first woman to reach Antarctica, first woman to reach Everest, first woman to reach Everest, first woman to reach Everest...and first woman to reach Everest...and in every field, our women and women have achieved a remarkable feat by breaking the barriers of the society.
He showed that through hard work, dedication and determination, a new path can be prepared by crossing all the obstacles and obstacles.
A book on these women achievers, first ladies has also been prepared so that the entire country can take inspiration from these women power, their life and work.
It is also available as an e-book on NarendraModi website
Today, the women power of the country has an important role in the positive change in the country and society.
Today, as we discuss women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment, you might be wondering what is the connection between that
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India where all female employees are there .
In all the departments, be it the commercial department, railway policy, ticket checking, announcement or point person, the status of more than 40 women is complete.
This time, after watching the Republic Day Parade, many people wrote on Twitter and on other social media that one of the main points of the parade was the BSF Biker Content in which all the women were participating.
They were using courage and this scene was also surprising guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance
Today our women-power is leading
becoming self - reliant
When there is a mention of tribal women, a certain picture emerges in everyone's mind, in which there are forests, turbans, women carrying the burden of wood on their heads
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women-power have created a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is Maoist-affected area
Violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols - Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere of this
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running Rickshaws in such dangerous areas.
In a very short period , many women have joined it .
I also appreciate the district administration of this place, from providing grants to training, district administration has played an important role in the success of these women.
Leaving the time-out, accepting the improvement of what is necessary
Any life-society is recognized.
Against social evils and evils , there has been a continuous effort in our country at the individual and social level for centuries .
Just a few days ago Bihar took an interesting initiative
The world's longest human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometers was built to eradicate social evils from the state.
Through this campaign, people were made aware of evils like child marriage and dowry.
The whole state resolved to fight with dowry and child marriage
Children, elderly, enthusiastic and enthusiastic youth, mothers, sisters, everyone was involved in this war.
The human chain starting from the historic Gadi ground of Patna has been continuously connecting to the boundaries of the state .
It is important that our society is free from these evils , so that all the people of the society can truly benefit from development .
Let us all take a pledge to eradicate such evils from the society and a New I
Make India a strong and capable India
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration there and everyone involved in the human chain for taking such a special and comprehensive initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan from Mysore, Karnataka has written on MyGov that the cost of medicines used to be Rs 6,000 per month for his father's treatment.
He was not aware of the first Prime Minister Jan Aushadhi Yojana
But now that they got information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and they bought medicines from there, their expenditure on medicines decreased by 75 percent.
He wants me to talk about it in the Mann Ki Baat programme so that more and more people can access it and take advantage of it .
For the past few years, many people used to write to me on this subject, keep telling me
get a deep satisfaction
And I also liked it very much that this idea came to my mind that whatever they had received was also received by others.
The objective behind this scheme is to make health care affordable and promote ease of living .
The medicines available at Jan Aushadi Kendras are cheaper by 50 to 90 as compared to branded medicines available in the market .
This helps the common man, especially the senior citizens who take medicines on a daily basis, in a big way. It saves a lot.
Generic medicines purchased in this are according to the standard set by the World Health Organization
That is why good quality medicines are available at cheap prices .
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This is not only providing cheap medicines but also creating new employment opportunities for the FDI entrepreneurs.
Cheap medicines are available at nectar stores of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and hospitals .
The only objective behind all this is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mangesh from Maharashtra has posted a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
That photo was such that my attention was drawn to that photo.
That photo in which a grandson was participating in the cleaning campaign with his grandfather
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organized a cleanliness drive to clean the Morna river under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The river Morna flows for the first twelve months , but now it ' s seasonal .
The second pain is that the river was completely filled with wild grass, jalkumbh
a lot of garbage was being thrown on the river and its banks
An action plan was prepared and on January 13, a day before Makar-Sankranti, under the first phase of Mission Clean Morna, on fourteen places in the area of four kilometers, both sides of the river Morna were cleaned.
In this noble work of Mission Clean Morna, more than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, colleges, students, children, the elderly, mothers and sisters, everyone participated in it.
On 20th January, 2018, this cleanliness campaign was continued in the same way and I was told that this campaign will run on every Saturday morning until the river Morna is completely clean.
It shows that nothing is impossible if a person decides to do something .
Largest changes can be brought through mass movement
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and the administration of the municipal corporation, all the citizens engaged in this task of making this work a mass movement, I congratulate you all and your efforts will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot about the Padma awards these days.
In the newspapers too, on this subject, T. . also attracts attention.
There has been a tradition of awarding Padma awards every year but in the last three years its whole process has changed .
Now any citizen can nominate anyone
Transparency has arrived through the whole process online
In a way, the selection process of these awards has been transformed completely.
Padma awards have been given to those people who usually do not see a festival in big cities, in newspapers, in TV.
Now the importance of his work is increasing, not the identity of the person to give the award
You must have heard Mr. Arvind Gupta Ji, you will be happy to know that
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent his entire life in making toys for children
They have been making toys from garbage for four decades so that they can increase the curiosity of science in children .
His efforts are to motivate children to go to 3,000 schools across the country and show films made in 18 languages to encourage them to do scientific experiments with useless things.
What a wonderful life, what a wonderful dedication
A similar story is Karnataka's Sitawa Jodatti (SCI).
They are not said to be the goddess of women's empowerment
For the last three decades in Belagavi , she has made great contribution in changing the lives of countless women .
He had dedicated himself as Devadasi at the age of seven , but then spent his entire life for the welfare of Devadasis .
Not only this, they have also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shri Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family, tribal family.
They used to do normal jobs for living but they had the passion to make traditional tribal paintings
Today, due to this hobby, they have respect not only in India but in the whole world.
Bhajju Shyam ji ' s talent that illuminates India ' s name abroad was recognized and he was awarded the Padma Shri award .
Listening to the story of Kerala's tribal woman Lakshmikutti will fill you with a pleasant surprise
Lakshmikutti is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a cottage made of palm leaves in tribal area between dense forests.
He built five hundred herbal medicine on the basis of his memory
He is mastered in making medicines used after snake bites .
Lakshmi ji is continuously serving the society with herbal knowledge of medicines
He was awarded the Padma Shri for his contribution to the society by recognizing this anonymous personality .
I want to mention another name today. 75-year-old Subhasini Mistry of West Bengal was also selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils, vegetables in others' homes to build a hospital
When she was 23 years old , her husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired her to build a hospital for the poor .
Today, thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in their hard-working hospital.
I have full faith that there are many sons and daughters in our Bahutana-Vasundhara who do not know or recognize them.
Padma awards are a medium but I would also tell the countrymen that those living around us, those who are for the society, those who are for the society, those who are for the society, those who have been working for the welfare of the society, those who have been working for the welfare of the society, those who have been working for the welfare of the society, those who have been working for the welfare of the people, those who have been working for the welfare of the society, those who have been working for the welfare of the society, those who have never been in the middle of the society.
They do not work for honor but their work inspires us.
In schools and colleges, such people should be invited to listen to their experiences.
Beyond the award, there must be some effort in society too.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
This is January 9, when Pujya Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from STARIA
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond between Indians living in India and around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we organized a program where all MPs and mayors of Indian origin living around the world were invited.
You will be happy to know that in this program, from Malaysia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America, wherever our mayors are, there are original Indians, wherever our MPs are, they all have participated.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are not only serving those countries but also maintaining their strong relations with India. This time the European Union, the European Union, has sent me a calendar in which they have shown their contributions in different fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe in a very good manner.
Working in TV, someone is dedicated to Ayurveda, someone brings the mind of the society with his music, then someone with his poems
Someone is doing research on climate change, someone is working on Indian texts, someone has set up a gurdwara by driving trucks, so someone has built a mosque
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for recognizing the people of Indian origin and through them, to inform the people around the world.
On January 30, is the death anniversary of revered Bapu, who has shown us a new path.
On that day we celebrate Martyrs Day that day we pay homage to the great martyrs who lost their lives in the defense of the country at 11 o'clock.
The path of peace and non-violence, this is the path of Bapu
Whether it is India or the world, whether it is a person or a family or a social-venerated Bapu, the ideals with which he led us, the things that Pujya Bapu told us are still extremely relevant.
They were not just mere theories
Even at present, we see Dagar-Dagar how correct Bapu's words were
If we resolve to follow the path of Bapu - as much as possible, let's go - what can be a great tribute to him
My dear countrymen, giving my best wishes to all of you in 2018, I end my speech.
Where the youth of the age group of 18 to 25 years can sit together and brainstorm on New India, find ways and make plans
How can we accomplish our resolutions before 2022 ?
How can we build an India our freedom fighters dreamt of ?
B.
a.
I talked to them, there was no sign of despair there was no excitement, enthusiasm, energy, dreams and resolutions with those daughters, as much as I had spent, I was also inspired and these are the strength of the country, these are my youth, these are the future of my country, my dear countrymen, whenever there is a discussion about the famous religious places of the world, it is very natural to mention about the Sabarimala temple in Kerala.
And especially in that place which is situated between hills and forests, how can this problem be converted into a culture, how can one find a way to recover from the problem and how the peoples participation has so much strength - this Sabarimala temple is an example in itself.
Who will have made such rules?
There will hardly be any citizen of India who does not respect him or her
He is older than all of us and is a witness to the different stages and stages of the country.
She's 90 years old on September 28.
Before leaving for a foreign trip, I had the privilege of talking to Didi on the phone.
This conversation was the same, as in a very difficult time, the younger brother talks to his elder sister.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, salute
I'm speaking Narendra Modi!
Modi ji: So before I was thinking, helita ji: Hahmodi ji: Many good wishes to you on birthday, let me congratulate in advance.
Lata ji: There are many people older than age, but the one who is older than his work, getting blessings is a great thing.
Lata ji: Yes, I think it is the blessings of my parents, and the blessings of those who listen
I'm nothing!
Modi ji: This is your humility, this is a great education for all of us, this is a great inspiration for all of us that even after you have done so much in your life, you have always given priority to the values of your parents and the humility.
Lata ji: G
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you, ji Modi: You gave me some Gujarati
Lata ji: What are you, you do not know yourself
I know that the image of India is changing with your arrival and that is what makes me very happy.
That's great!
Modi ji: Just sister, keep your blessings, keep your blessings on the whole country, and people like us keep doing something good, you have always inspired me.
I receive your letter and I receive some of your gifts. So, I have a special pleasure in this spirit of belonging, with a family relationship.
Lata ji: Yes, yes
No, I don't want to hurt you, because, I see, I know how much business you do and how much work you do.
What to think
When you came to your mother and touched her feet, I also sent someone to her and took her blessings.
Modi ji: yes
I remembered my mother and she was telling me
Lata ji: And they blessed me on the telephone, so I liked Modi ji: Our mother was very happy, because of your love
And once again I wish you the very best on your birthday
Modi ji: This time when Mumbai came, I used to think that Rubru would come to me: Yes, yes
Lata ji: Yes, definitely, definitely
It will be a good fortune for me .
Modi ji: Pranam, sister
Lata ji: Pranam
Modi ji: Best wishes to you: Many greetings
Modi ji: Pranam ji
For many weeks, all over the country, the festivals will be pleasant.
Best wishes to all of you, to all the upcoming festivals.
In festivals, everyone in the family will come along.
Maybe, these proverbs are not just words, for us, for the people, an order, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Just imagine, on the one hand some houses illuminate light while on the other hand there is a darkness over the houses of some people near them.
In some houses, the sweets are getting worse, in some houses, the children yearn for sweets.
The real joy of these festivals is only when this dark sixth, this darkness is low - the light spreads
We share happiness, where there is lack, and, this is also our nature.
Just imagine a moment when there is a delivery in our homes, sweethearts, clothes and gifts.
At least in our homes, which is in excess, which we dont take to work now, we must deliver these things.
In many cities, many NGOs start-ups of young friends do this work.
They collect clothes, sweets, food, everything from the people's homes, search for the needy, transport to them and do anonymous activities.
Can this time, in this season of festivals, with full awareness and determination, remove the darkness under this lamp
Smiling on the faces of many poor families, on festivals, your happiness will double, your face will shine, your given, and will shine, your Diwali will be illuminated.
My dear brothers and sisters, In Deepawali, in the form of good fortune and prosperity, Lakshmi's house and house comes to life.
In our culture, daughters are considered Lakshmi, because, daughter brings good fortune and prosperity
Can we do this programme of honor of Lakshmi of India on this Diwali?
There will be many daughters around us, many times who will be doing extraordinary work
Someone will be working for the education of poor children, someone will be engaged in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health, then someone will be serving the society by becoming a doctor, engineer.
By becoming a lawyer, someone will try to get justice
Our society should identify such daughters, respect them, and take pride in them.
Their respect programs, be across the country
One more thing you can do, that share the achievements of these daughters, as much as possible in social media, and use bharatkilami (Lakshmi of India)
Just like we all had launched a grand campaign with daughter and she had spread all over the world.
Similarly, this time, we run the campaign Lakshmi of India
The encouragement of Lakshmi of India means strengthening the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen
My dear countrymen, even before talking about Mann Ki Baat, I had said that it is a great advantage that I get the opportunity to communicate directly to many unknown people.
A student from far-flung Arunachal has sent a big interest letter to me, Alina Tiang.
And it has written, I read the letter before you. Hon'ble Prime Minister, my name is Alina Tawang
I'm from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh
This time when the result of my eam came to me, some people asked me if you read the book Yam Arriors?
I told you, I haven't read this book.
But, going back, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times.
After that my experience was quite good
I thought, if I had read this book before Heam, I would have benefited a lot.
I liked many aspects very much from this book, but I also saw that there are many mantras for students but there is not much in this book for parents and teachers.
My little student friend, first, thank you for writing the letter
Thank you, for reading am warriors 2-3 times
What you have said that if I get out of the time of new edition then I will definitely try to write some things for parents and teachers in that direction.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to share your experiences and suggestions with each one of you on the aspects related to stress-free environment.
I'll study it!
I will think about it and I will try to write whatever I feel right about it in my own words, in my own way, and it may be that if your suggestions come out more then the issue of my new definition will also be confirmed.
So I ' ll wait for your ideas
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend, student Alina Taiang of Arunachal
My dear countrymen, you are well aware of the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers and TV, and also talk about busyness.
But, you know, I'm an ordinary person like you.
If there was someone else on this occasion, he would have become sad and disappointed, but, not his face, but he brought a smile on everyone's faces with his words.
The nature of sportsman spirit that was seen in his humility, simplicity and spirit in the true sense was evident to everyone.
His words were warmly welcomed by the audience present there .
Even after losing in a tough fight, he praised his opponent Nadal and gave the awakening evidence of sportsman spirit
However, on the other hand, champion Nadal also fervently applauded Daniel's game
In the same match , both the enthusiasm of the loser and the humility of the winner were worth seeing .
The thinking of our fathers is really great .
Mani Kanchan Incidentally, when a person's ability and humility are combined together, then who can not win the heart again
In fact, this young player has won the hearts of people all over the world
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, whatever I am going to talk about, I am doing it directly for your welfare.
It ' s very difficult to stop them later .
But, if we wake up early and stop him, a lot can be saved.
With this feeling, I feel like talking to my youth today, especially today.
We all know that tobacco addiction is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit addiction.
People consuming tobacco are more prone to diseases like cancer, diabetes, blood pressure etc.
Everyone says that
Tobacco intoxication is caused by the nicotine present in it .
The development of the brain is also affected by its consumption in adolescence .
But, today, I want to talk to you, on a new subject
You might be aware that recently India's e-cigarette has been banned.
E-cigarette is a kind of electronic device different from the normal cigarette.
While we all understand the dangers of general cigarettes, a misconception has been created about e-cigarette.
This misconception has been spread that there is no threat to e-cigarette
His only attempt is that, no member of the family should smoke or not smoke
They know that smoking causes a lot of harm to the body.
The drinker also knows and the viewer knows
But the case of e-cigarette is very different
People do not have so much awareness about e-cigarette
They are also completely unaware of its threat and for this reason sometimes the e-cigarette enters the house secretly in Kauthal.
Our youth goes on the path of waste and unknowingly .
In fact, many harmful chemicals are mixed in e-cigarette, which has a bad effect on health.
You know, that, when someone smokes around us, we smell it.
In such a scenario, many teenagers and youth, knowingly or unknowingly, proudly being seen roaming around in their books, in their office, in their pocket, sometimes in their own hands and become victims of this disease.
Young generation is the future of the country
E-cigarette has been banned so that this new method of intoxication does not destroy our young country.
Do not ruin the dreams of every family, the lives of children will not be wasted
These diseases, these habits should not be rooted in the society.
I urge you all to give up smoking and do not misconstrue about e-cigarette.
Let us together build a healthy India
You got it!
Remember India then?
India means there's a little bit that hands and feet in the morning and evening, if we go to gym, we'll be
This is our mother India, this is our country, the multi-faceted Vasundhara.
Many human gems come out of this earth .
India-year has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, has been the land of karma.
And these are the people who have spent their lives, not for themselves, for others.
Similarly, a great personality is being honored in Vatican City on October 13
It is a matter of pride for every Indian, that Pope Francis will declare Mariam Thresia a saint on October 13
Sister Mariam Thresia, who worked for the welfare of humanity in his 50 years of small life, is an example for the whole world.
From the field of social service and education, he had a wonderful attachment
He built many schools, hostels and orphanages, and throughout his life, he was engaged in this mission
I once again pay homage to Sister Mariam Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride for not only India but for the entire world today that when we are celebrating 150th Gandhi ji, 130 crore countrymen have pledged to be free from single use plastic.
Looking at the kind of leadership that India has taken in the world towards environmental protection, today the eyes of all the countries are looking towards India.
I am confident that all of you will be going to be a part of the campaign to get rid of single-use plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing in this campaign in their own way in place .
But, a young man of our country has launched a very unique campaign.
My attention was drawn to his work, so I tried to understand his new experiment by talking to him on the phone.
May be, these things have also benefited the people of the country.
Mr. Ripudaman Belvi, they're doing a unique effort.
When I first heard the Ploging word , it was new to me too .
In foreign countries , perhaps these words have been used in some quantities .
But, in India, Ripudaman Belvi ji has promoted this very much.
Let ' s talk to them
I congratulate you all and friends this time the Sports Ministry is also celebrating the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu.
2 kilometers long on October 2, these programs will be organized all over the country.
We have heard from the experience of Ripudaman ji about how to do this program and what happens in the program.
With this we will not only take care of our health but will also be able to protect the health of our mother earth .
This campaign is also creating awareness among the people about fitness as well as cleanliness.
I believe that if 130 crore Indians take a step in this direction then India will move forward by 130 crore steps towards the liberation of single use plastic.
Ripudaman, once again, thank you very much
And many congratulations to you, your team, and for this new imagination, on my behalf
want to move forward to transform your life into a countryman
One thing you want to remember in Advance
However, I would say it in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat but today I am saying this in advance so that you get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
So you start preparing now .
I will definitely talk about it in detail but it is time, some people can also start practice, some can also plan.
My dear countrymen, you will remember, on August 15, I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 you would visit 15 places in India.
Make at least 15 places and that too, one night, two night stay programs.
You see, understand, experience India
how many variations we have
And when they come on holidays in the festival of Diwali, people definitely go and I will again urge you to visit any 15 such places in India.
Today our number is 24 and five years ago our number was at number 65 , that is , in a way we have put a big jump .
If we try more then by 75 years of independence we will make our place in the top places of the world in tourism.
It is also important to see that in the days of Diwali, there is no loss of any person than fire crackers etc.
You should take any precaution for this.
Come on!
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat , November 2017
Can you imagine how hard he had worked to make a Constitution of his country full of diversity ?
The Konkan coast, where the sea has an important role, came under the rule of Shivaji Maharaj. Several forts like Sindhu Fort, Murud Janjira, Golden Fort etc. were either situated on the sea shores or were surrounded by seas. Maratha navy used to take responsibility for the safety of these forts. Maratha navy had a combination of big ships and small boats. His naval personnel were very capable of attacking and defending any enemy.
Even by thinking, there will be no fear of soil or trees and plants, where will human life be possible
Where will the animal be possible?
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific methods that the use of urea to the mother earth causes serious damage. The farmer is the son of the earth, how can the farmer see the earth and mother disease
There is a need of the hour, can our farmers, sons of our soil make a pledge to awaken the relationship of this mother-son again Can we make a pledge that by 2022, when it will be 75 years of independence, half the use of urea will be stopped
The person of North-India will not know what is in South-India?
The person of West India will not know what is in East India?
If we look at the diversity of our country, Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, then once it comes to the conclusion that when he walked on the path of India, he got a new inspiration to see India and to live for it. All these great men travelled widely in India and tried to understand India at the beginning of their work.
Can you keep Incredible India on hash tag IncredibleIndia
You see, if all the people of one state will say this then I will ask the government to secrete it and to prepare a publicity document on the seven things that came from every state of the country, that is, in a way, how to promote tourist destination with the public's views.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
On one hand the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand when news of violence comes from any corner of India then it is natural for the country to worry .
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who gave life to the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors have accepted the values of public life, non-violence and respect and have filled our minds.
Non-violence Paramo Dharma:, these have been heard since childhood, they have come to say
I want to assure my countrymen that no one will ever tolerate or tolerate any lawful person, no one who takes over the law, who has oppressed the path of violence, whether it is a person or a group, nor will any government tolerate it.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, lifestyle and clothing.
We see diversity in every behavior of life .
Even our festivals are full of diversity and look at cultural traditions, social traditions, historical events, if we see thousands of years old cultural heritage, there will hardly be a day left in 365 days when we are not connected with any festival
Now you must have seen that all our festivals, in the time of nature, go according to the leaflet.
There is a direct relation with nature .
Many of our festivals are directly related to farmers and fishermen.
Today I am talking about festivals , first of all I would like to call you all the bewildered .
Tomorrow the festival of Samvatsari was celebrated in Jain society
The festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra in Jain society .
The last day of the festival is the day of the Samvatsari .
This is really a wonderful tradition in itself .
The festival of Samvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship
It is also called forgiveness festival in a way and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other a cockroach .
Anyway , in our scriptures , forgiveness is the Bhushan of Veerasya Bhushanam , that is , forgiveness of heroes .
Forgiving is a hero .
We have come to hear these discussions and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say forgiveness is the specialty of a powerful person .
Shakespeare, while describing the importance of forgiveness in his play The Merchant of Defense, wrote that Mercy is a two flowerest, I t bleseth him that gives gifts and him that Takes , which is forgiving and forgiving, both receive the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, these days Ganesh Chaturthi marks the birth of Lord Ganesh in every corner of the country and when it comes to Ganesh Chaturthi, it is natural to talk about public Ganesh Chaturthi.
Balgangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and before 125 years of independence he became a symbol of the freedom movement .
And after independence they have become symbols of social-education, social-consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi runs for 10 days .
This great festival is called the symbol of unity, equality and purity.
Best wishes to all the countrymen for the Ganesh Festival
Onam festival is being celebrated in Kerala right now
One of the colorful festivals of India Onam is a major festival of Kerala .
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance .
The festival of Onam displays the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival brings a new hope, new faith in the minds of the people, along with the message of love and harmony in the society.
And now these festivals of ours are also becoming the reason for the attraction of tourism.
And I would like to tell the countrymen that like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or the Durga festival in Bengal has become an attraction of tourism in a way .
Our and festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
What can we do in that direction
A few days later in the series of these festivals the festival of Eid-ul-Zuha will also be celebrated across the country.
Id-ul-uha's many congratulations and best wishes to all the countrymen
Festivals are not only a symbol of faith and belief, but we also have to make festivals a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
Festivals and hygiene are associated with family life
Preparation of the festival means cleanliness
It ' s not something new to us , but it ' s a social habit .
The insistence of cleanliness publicly should not only be in the house but in the entire village, in the entire city, in the whole city, in our state, in our country and in our country, cleanliness should be an integral part of this festival.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of being modern are changing.
These days, a new dimension, a new Parameter, how many values you are, how modern you are, how modern your thought process is, how modern a scale is, a scale has also started to be used to know all these things and that is how aware you are about the environment.
You have an eco-friendly, environment-friendly behavior in your own activities against him.
In society , if it ' s against it , it ' s considered bad today .
And as a result of that today I have seen that these days a massive campaign has started in Ganeshotsav as well as eco-friendly Ganapati.
If you go to YouTube and see that the children of every household are engaged in the work of making Ganesh Ji with soil and making Ganesh Ji.
Various kinds of experiments are happening in every family
See how big the change has come and this is a pleasant change
And as I said, our country is full of millions and millions of bright minds.
Three years ago, when the campaign for cleanliness was started, it would be three years on October 2.
And, its positive results are visible.
Coverage of toilets has reached almost 67 from 39
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from open defecation.
There was a severe flood in Gujarat in the past
Many people lost their lives , but after the floods , when the water was reduced , so much dirt was spread everywhere .
At such a time, in Dhanera of Banaskantha district of Gujarat, activists of Jamiat Ulema Hind cleaned the flood affected 22 temples and 3 mosques in a phased manner.
Sweat yourself, all men come out!
The best example of unity for cleanliness, such an example that inspires everyone, all the workers of Jamiat Ulema Hind gave
Where can our country be reached if our efforts made with dedication for cleanliness become a permanent habit
My dear countrymen, I appeal to you all that once again, 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, we used to say - 'Swachhata Hi Seva' i.e.
Create an environment for cleanliness across the country
Wherever we get the opportunity, we find opportunities
But let ' s all join
Believe it in a way to prepare for Diwali, consider it as a preparation for Navratri, accept the preparation of Durga Puja.
My friends in social media can run some creative campaigns and work on the surface of the virtual world, and can draw inspiration from them.
The Swachh Sankalp se Swachh Siddhi Competition is being organized by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, in which you are competing for essay, short-film making competition, painting competition is being organized.
In this you can write essays in different languages and there is no age limit, no age limit.
You can make short film, make it from your mobile
Can make a 2-3-minute film that inspires cleanliness
She can be in any language, she can be silent.
You see, this October 2 of Gandhi Jayanti
You can imagine that after 15 days of this campaign of cleanliness, after Swachhta Hi Sewa, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, how a sacred joy it will be to pay homage to venerated Bapu
My dear countrymen, today, I want to accept the debt of all of you in particular.
I want to express my gratitude to you from the bottom of my heart, not because you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for such a long time, I want to express my gratitude, accept loans because millions of people from every corner of the country get connected with this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
The number of people who listen to me is in crores but lakhs of people sometimes write letters to me, sometimes send messages on the phone, and for me there is a huge treasure.
This has become a great opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I wait for your messages more than you wait for what you say .
I ' m so greedy because everything you ' re talking about makes me learn something
You must think yes, man, you've ever made such a mistake!
Sometimes certain things become a part of our habit that we don't think we're wrong.
Prime Minister, I am speaking from Poona from Aparna
I want to tell you about one of my friends
She always tries to help people , but I ' m surprised to see a habit
I once went to the mall to shop with him
On a sari, she spent two thousand rupees comfortably and 450 rupees on pizza, while the auto that was taken to the mall kept on bargaining for five rupees for a long time.
While returning buy vegetables on the way and save Rs . 4-5 after bargaining for every vegetable .
I feel so bad!
You must tell me about your mind .
Now after listening to this phone call, I am sure that you would have been shocked and alarmed, and perhaps you would have decided not to make such a mistake in the future.
Do you not think that when we come here to sell some goods around our house, a ferryman comes, a small shopkeeper, a vegetable seller comes in contact with the auto rickshaw driver, whenever we come in contact with a hard-working person, we start paying the price for that thing, dont buy two rupees, reduce five rupees
And if we go to a large restaurant to have food then we dont even see what is written in the bill, we pay the money in a big way.
Not only this, if you go to shopping in showrooms, do not make any purchases, but if you come from a poor person then you do not remain without bargaining.
Have you ever thought what would happen to the poor
Two rupees five does not make any difference in your life but how deep does this small habit of yours push his mind .
Madam, I am grateful that you have given me a message by calling the phone that touches so much heart.
I am sure my countrymen will leave it if they have a habit of dealing with the poor .
My dear young friends, On August 29, the entire country celebrates National Sports Day.
This is the birthday of great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to hockey was incomparable
I am reminding you that the new generation of our country is associated with sports.
Games became part of our life
If we are the young countries of the world then we should also look at this young sports field .
Sports means physical fitness, mental alertness and personality enhancement.
In a way sports is a very big plant of union of hearts .
The younger generation of our country came forward in the field of sports and today in the era of computer, I would like to warn that playing field is more important than play-station.
Play A , but even on the outside field , sometimes do the tricks with the football .
Play cricket on the computer but playing cricket under the sky in the open field is something else
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out , the mother used to ask when you would come back .
Today the condition is such that when the children come home they either get to see a carton film in one corner or get stuck on a mobile game and then they have to shout to their mother when will you go out
It is a matter of great happiness for our youth that in India from 6th to 28th October 2019, I will be organising IA under 17 World Cup.
24 teams from all over the world are going to make India their home
Come, let's welcome our young guests coming from around the world with the festival of sports, let's enjoy the game and create an atmosphere in the country.
When I am talking about sports today , I want to share one of my thoughts with my countrymen in the event that happened last week .
I had the opportunity to meet some young daughters and some of them were born in Himalayas .
Will spend 40-40 days together in water
Sometimes 30-30 days will be spent in water
Our six daughters are courageously amidst the waves of the sea and this is the first incident happening in the world.
Who will be Hindustani who do not care about our daughters
I salute the words of these daughters and I have asked them to share their experiences with the whole country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the NarendraModi App so that you can read it because in a way this is a story of courage, a story of self-realization and I will be happy to convey the stories of these daughters to you.
My best wishes to these daughters, it is a great blessing.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
It is the birthday of the former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was president but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life .
He always liked to live as a teacher
I salute them , said the great scientist Albert Einstein .
It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge. It is the most important quality of a teacher to awaken creative emotion and knowledge in his students.
Can we all make a pledge together when we celebrate Teachers Day this time ?
Can you run a campaign in a mission mode ?
If we make collective efforts then we will play a big role in the transformation of the nation.
Let's move on with this mantra to transform
Prime Minister
My name is Doctor Annya Awasthi
I am a resident of the city of Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre of the Howard University .
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana Financial Inclusion has been a subject of discussion not only in India but also in the entire world of economic scholars.
On August 28, 2014, this campaign was started with a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, August 28, the campaign of this Prime Minister Jan-Dhan Yojana is going on for three years.
300 million new families have been linked with this bank account.
this number is more than the population of many countries in the world .
Today, I have a very big solution that my poor brother, who has been sitting at the last end of the society within three years, has become a part of the country's economy, his habit has changed, he has started going to the bank, he has started saving the money, he is feeling the security of the money.
If you ever have money in your hands, if you live in a pocket, if you live in a house then you feel like spending money.
If you want to do some good work in the coming days then money will be useful .
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited by our poor people in banks.
In a way, this savings of the poor is his strength in the days to come.
And with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, whose account has been opened, it has also benefited from insurance.
Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana, Pradhan MantriSurakshaBimaYojana, Rupees 30, a nominal premium today, it instills a new faith in the lives of the poor.
In many families, due to the insurance of one rupee, when there was a crisis on the poor man, the life of the head of the family ended, in a few days he got 2 lakh rupees.
The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, the Start Up scheme, the Stand Up scheme, the Dalit, the tribal and the women, the educated youth, the youth who wanted to do something on their feet, the crores of youngsters were given money without guarantee from the banks. Not only this, everyone has also made a successful effort to provide employment to each and every one and half of them.
Today there is not a lot of time, but I will definitely ask the people of the bank to upload those incidents on MyGov.in. People will read, people will get inspiration from how a scheme can transform the life of a person, how a new energy fills, how a new confidence fills. Hundreds of examples have come to me.
I will try my best to reach you and there is such an inspiring event that the people of media can take full advantage of it .
They can also interact with such people and give new inspiration to the new generation
It is the mind of man that the rainy season is a very pleasant time for the mind.
Animals, birds, plants, nature all rejoice on the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a formidable form, it shows the power of destroying the water.
Nature gives us life, nurtures us, but at times natural calamities like floods and earthquakes cause great destruction.
There is also a very negative impact on the changing weather cycle and the environment.
For the past few days, some parts of India, especially Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan, parts of Bengal, have been facing natural calamities due to heavy rains.
There is complete monitoring of flood affected areas.
Relief work is being done at a large level.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers are also reaching there.
State Governments are also making every effort to help the flood victims in their own way.
Social organizations, cultural organizations, civil servants are also making every effort to help the people in such a situation.
On behalf of the Government of India, be it the soldiers of the Army, the people of the Air Force, the people of the NDRF or the paramilitary forces, everyone gets connected to the service of the disaster victims at such times.
247 control from helpline number 1078 is working continuously to deal with the flood situation.
People also tell their difficulties.
The entire government machinery was prepared by mock drills at maximum locations before the rains.
NDRF teams were set up.
Slowly we also made the nature that we can also create our activities according to the weather forecast, so we can avoid the loss.
Whenever I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I can see that the citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time so many letters have been received regarding GST so many phone calls have come and people still express happiness about GST and also express their curiosity.
I also tell you one phone call: Namaste, Prime Minister, I am speaking from Gurgaon to Neetu Garg.
I heard the speech of your chartered accountants day and was very impressed.
Similarly, in our country, Goods and Services Tax-GST was introduced on the same date last month.
Can you tell me, whether the results are coming a month later as the government did the expected results
I would like to hear your views about it, thank you.
The implementation of GST has been almost a month and its benefits have started to appear.
And I am very satisfied and happy that when a poor person writes to me that how the prices have come down due to GST, how things have become cheaper.
If a person living in the North-East, in the far-flung areas and in the jungles writes that initially he was afraid and he didn't know what he was saying but now when I started to learn and understand about it, I feel that the work has become easier than before.
Trade became easier.
And the biggest thing is that customers' trust in the trader has started to grow.
I was just seeing how the impact of GST was on the transport and logistics sector.
How the movement of trucks has increased now
How time is shortening distances
Highways have been cluster-free.
Due to the increase in the speed of the trucks, the pollution has also decreased.
The goods are also reaching very quickly.
This facility is there, but at the same time it also strengthens the economic momentum.
Earlier, due to different tax structure, the maximum resources of the transport and logistics sector used to be used to maintain the paperwork and they had to create new warehouses within every state.
GST, which I call Good and Simple Tax, has really created a very positive impact on our economy and in a very short time.
The speed with which the small transition has taken place, the speed with which the migration has taken place, the new registrations have taken place, this has created a new faith in the whole country.
And sometimes the scholars of the economy, the scholars of management and the technologists, will research and write the use of India's GST as a model before the world.
There will be a case study for many universities of the world.
It is a great achievement to implement and successfully move forward in such a large country with such a huge challenge and the investment of so many crores of people.
The world will definitely study it.
And GST has been implemented, all the states have a participation in it and all the states have a responsibility too.
All the decisions have been made by the states and the Center together with the unanimous consent.
And as a result of that every government had only one priority that there should not be any burden on the plate of the poor due to GST.
I heartily congratulate all the ministries, departments, and all the officials of the central and state governments involved in this work.
GST is a great example of the success of India's collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform but an economy that strengthens the culture of honesty.
In a way, there is also a campaign for social reform.
Once again, I salute millions and millions of Indians for making such a big effort a success.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of revolution.
We have been hearing this from our childhood and this is the reason that the Non-Cooperation Movement started on August 1, 1920.
The uit India Movement began on August 9, 1942, which is known as the August Revolution and was liberated on August 15, 1947.
In a way, several incidents in the month of August are associated with the festival of independence.
But very few people know that this slogan was given by Dr. Yusuf Meher Ali.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of the country who had been associated with the quest for freedom, had struggled, had fought hard, the pages of history were our inspirations for building a grand India.
The heroes of our freedom have sacrificed sacrifices, sacrifices and sacrifices, what can be a big inspiration
The uit India Movement was an important struggle of the Indian Freedom Movement.
This movement had resolved the entire country for the liberation of the British Raj.
This was the time when the people of India, in every corner of India, be it a village, a city, be it a city or a city, be it an illiterate, be it a rich or a poor person, everyone was shoulder to shoulder and became a part of the uit India Movement.
People's anger was at its peak.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were struggling with the mantra of Do or Die.
Millions of young people of the country had left their studies and had left their books.
The Non-Cooperation Movement and uit India Movement 1920 and 1942 are two distinct forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
The forms of the Non-Cooperation Movement were different and the situation of 42 came, the intensity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of Do or Die.
There was public support, people's strength, people's resolve and people's struggle behind all this success.
The whole country was fighting together.
And sometimes I think that if we look at the pages of history by adding a little bit then India's first freedom struggle was fought in 1857.
Starting from 1857, the freedom struggle continued to run in some corner of the country till 1942.
This long period has instilled a spirit of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone became committed to doing something or the other.
Generations changed, but there was no shortage of resolution.
People used to come, people used to get connected, they used to go, new ones came, new ones were added and the country kept trying every time to overthrow the British rule.
This hard work from 1857 to 1942 created a situation in which the movement reached its peak in 1942 and it was such a bugle of uit India that within 5 years the British had to go to India in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, he reached the masses.
And from 1942 to 1947, five years of independence became such a peoples mind. With this resolution, the country became independent with the success of the five decisive years of achievement.
These five years were decisive years.
Now I want to connect you with this math.
We were liberated in 1947.
Today is 2017.
It's been almost 70 years.
Governments came-yes
Arrangements were made, changed, flourished, increased.
In order to free the country from problems, everyone has made every effort in their own way.
Success also got success
Expectations also woke up.
For example, from 1942 to 1947, there was a decisive five years of accomplishment.
I see that from 2017 to 2022, a section of five years has come before us to achieve this goal.
On August 15, 2017, we celebrated the Sankalp Parva and in 2022, when we mark 75 years of our independence, we will continue to turn that resolution into accomplishment.
Crores and crores of resolve
Efforts should be made to fulfil the millions and crores of resolve.
So as the five years from 1942 to 1947 became decisive for the country's independence, these five years from 2017 to 2022, they can and will be decisive for the future of India.
Five years later, the country will celebrate 75 years of independence.
Then all of us have to take a firm resolve today.
2017 is the year of our resolve.
We have to join the August month resolution and we have to resolve.
Let us run a Mahabhiyan with the resolution from August 9 this month.
A resolution that we will accomplish in the next 5 years.
Youth organizations, student organizations, NGOs etc. can organize collective discussions.
You can highlight new ideas.
Where do we reach as a nation?
What can I contribute to it as a person?
Let us join this Sankalp Parv.
Using technology, videos, post, blogs, articles, new ideas came up with all these things.
Convert this campaign into a mass movement.
It is an effort to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to familiarize them with the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must spread it widely.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Servant of the country on August 15, I get the opportunity to interact with the nation from the Red Fort.
I am only for a moment but there is not a single person who speaks.
The voice of 1.25 billion people resonates with the Red Fort.
I try to word their dreams and I am happy that for the last three years on August 15, I get suggestions from every corner of the country that what should I say on August 15, which issues should be taken?
This time too, I invite you to send me your views on MyGov or on the NarendraModiApp.
I myself read it and will try to reveal it in whatever time I have on August 15.
In the last three years, I have heard a complaint continuously in my 15 August speeches that my speech becomes a bit longer.
I've tried to make rules for me.
I don't know if I'll be able to.
But I intend to try this time about how I ' m going to do my speech short .
See, whether success is achieved or not.
I would like to tell my countrymen, one more thing today.
There is a social economics in India's economy.
And we should never underestimate him.
Our festivals, our festivals, are not just occasions of happiness and joy.
Our festivals, our festivals, are also campaigns for social reform.
And a natural bliss is also associated with these festivals.
The festivals bring sweetness in relationships, affection in the family, brotherhood in society.
Connect people and society.
An intuitive journey runs from the person to the whole.
An opportunity to go from ego to age becomes an opportunity.
As far as the economy is concerned, many months before Rakhi, hundreds of families start making rakhia in small domestic industries.
From khadi to silken threads, no one knows how many types of rakhis and nowadays people like homemade rakhis more.
Rakhi makers, Rakhi sellers, sweetmeats, thousands and hundreds of businesses get associated with a festival.
Our own poor brothers and sisters, families run by this.
We light lamps in Diwali, it is not just that festival, it is just a festival, it is a celebration of a house, it is not like that.
He is directly related to those poor families who make small soils.
But today when I talk about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals, I would like to talk about the environment as well.
I have seen that sometimes I think that the countrymen are more aware and more active than me.
For the last one month, constantly conscious citizens have written letters to me.
And he has urged that you tell the story of eco-friendly Ganesh before time in Ganesh Chaturthi so that people can make a plan on the choice of the soil.
First of all, I am grateful to such conscious citizens.
He has urged me to speak on this subject before time.
This time, public Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
Lokmanya Tilak ji, the 1.25 billion people of the country, had started the public Ganeshotsav with the basic feeling of unity of the society and awareness of the society and the culture of collectiveness.
Let us once again make essay competitions, hold discussion meetings and remember the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak in this year of Ganeshotsav.
And this time I said very quickly .
I am sure that all of you will join me and the benefit will be that our poor artisans, poor artists, those who make idols, will get employment and fill the stomach of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the various festivals and festivals to come.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly watching that our daughters are bringing glory to the country, be it in the field of education, in the field of economy, in the field of social sector, in the field of sports and in the field of sports.
We the countrymen are proud of our daughters and are feeling proud of them.
Just recently, our daughters performed brilliantly in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those players this week.
I liked it very much by talking to them, but I was feeling that the World Cup could not win, it was a big burden on them.
There was pressure on his face too, there was tension.
I told those daughters and I gave me a different assessment.
I said - Nowadays, the age of media is such that expectations are increased so much and when success is not achieved, it also changes in anger.
We have seen many such games that if the players of India fail, then the anger of the country breaks down on those players.
Some people break the limits and say something like this, write such things, there is a lot of pain.
But this was the first time that when our daughters did not succeed in the World Cup, then 1.25 billion people took the defeat on their shoulders.
They did not let the burden fall on those daughters. Not only this, they praised the daughters for what they did.
I see this a pleasant change and I told these daughters that you people have got such a good fortune only, you people should take it out of your mind that you have not succeeded.
Whether you win or not, you have won 1.25 billion people.
My dear countrymen, once again I would like to remind you once again of the August Revolution. On 9th August, I would like to remind you once again on 15th August, 2022, 75 years of independence.
Every countryman should make a resolution, every countryman should prepare a 5-year road map to accomplish the resolution.
We all have to take the country to new heights, reach it and reach it.
Come, let us come together, let us do something or the other.
Let us move forward with this belief that the future of the country will be better.
Weather is changing
This time too much heat
But it is good that the rain is moving on its footsteps in time
Jhajjham rain has made the weather pleasant in many parts of the country
After the rains cold winds have experienced relief from the heat of the past days .
And all of us have seen that no matter how much trouble there is in life, no matter how much stress is, no matter how much stress is, whether it is personal life or public life, the arrival of rain also changes the condition of our mind.
Today Lord Jagannath ji's Rath Yatra is celebrated in many parts of the country with great reverence and joy .
Now in some parts of the world the festival of Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated .
And the poor of the country is associated with Lord Jagannath .
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor
And very few people would know that there is a word in English language juggernaut and it means such a grand chariot which no one can stop.
And it is also found in this juggernaut ' s departmental meaning that this word has originated from Jagannatha ' s chariot .
And so we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath, I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen and also bow down to the blessings of Lord Jagannath.
India's diversity is its specialty India's diversity is India's strength too.
The holy month of Ramzan was celebrated in a sacred veneration .
Now is the festival of Eid
On this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, my best wishes to everyone on Eid.
Ramzan is the month of charity, it is the month of sharing happiness and the more happiness you give, the more happiness increases.
Let us all, together, take inspiration from these holy festivals and spread the treasures of happiness, let us take the country forward.
In this holy month of Ramzan, a very inspiring event of Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh came to me .
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters reside there in that small village. In a way more population belongs to the brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
Inside this Ramzan the villagers decided to build toilets together .
And this personal toilet is also supported by the government , and a sum of about Rs . 17 lakhs was given to them .
You can spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for turning this holy occasion of Ramzan into an occasion for the betterment of the society.
We know that there are three states of Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala in our country which have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana were also declared this week
I express my special gratitude to the administration, administration and the people of these five states for fulfilling this task.
We know very well that if there is anything good in the life of a person or in the life of a society then it is very difficult to work hard.
If we have a bad handwriting, if we have to fix it, we have to be very conscious for a long time.
Then the habit of the body, the mind changes.
The subject of cleanliness is the same
Such bad habits have become part of our nature .
Everyone will have to draw attention
Good motivational events will have to be remembered repeatedly
And I am glad that today Swachhta has not been a government program
This mass movement is becoming a mass movement.
And when the people sitting in the government also take this task forward with public participation, then how much strength is there
I noticed a very good event in the past, which I'd like to say to you.
This is the incident of Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh
The administration there took up a big task with public participation .
100 hours non stop campaign
And what was the goal ?
To build 10 , 000 household toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats in a hundred hours
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the people and the government together have completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in the last 100 hours.
71 villages
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of those villages of Vizianagaram district for giving a very inspiring example of your hard work.
They come on the NarendraModiApp, come on MyGov.in, come from the letters, come on the All India Radio.
Shri Prakash Tripathi, while remembering the Emergency, has written that on 25th June he has presented as a black period in the history of democracy.
This awareness of Prakash Tripathi ji's democracy is commendable and democracy is not just a system, it is also a sacrament.
Democracy requires daily awareness , and therefore , democracy has to be remembered as a shock , and democracy has to move forward in the direction of good things .
1975 - June 25 - It was a black night, which no democracy lover can forget.
No Indian can forget
In a way the country was converted into a prison
The anti - vowel was dumped
The dignitaries of the country, including Jayaprakash Narayan, were locked up in prisons.
Even the judicial system could not escape the shadow of that horrific form of emergency
The newspapers were completely useless
The lovers of democracy fought a big battle and a country like India, such a huge country, when the opportunity was given, how democracy was prevalent in the veins of the people of India, through elections, they demonstrated that strength.
We have to strengthen this legacy .
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling the pride of taxing high on the world today.
June 21, 2017 - The whole world has become yoga
From water to mountains people welcomed the rays of sun in the morning through yoga .
Who will be Hindustani, who will not be proud of this!
It is not that yoga was not before, but today when Yoga is tied in thread, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Almost all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of yoga their own.
In China, the Great All of China people practiced yoga, while in Peru, people did yoga 2400 meters above sea level on World Heritage Site Machu Picchu.
In the shadow of the Eiffel Tower in France people did yoga
Programmes were held at 70 places in small places like Singapore and they have started a week long campaign .
UN removes 10 stamps of International Yoga Day
Yoga session with Yoga Masters organized in N Headquarters
UN's status, the world's Diplomats, everyone participated in it.
This time again Yoga also worked as a world record .
In Gujarat, nearly 55 thousand people together made a new world record in Ahmedabad.
I also had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow .
But for the first time I had the good fortune of doing yoga in the rain .
Our soldiers have done yoga in Siachen where there is minimum 20, 25, 40 degree temperature.
Be it TBP, CRPF, VIDEO, everyone has made Yoga their own part along with their duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that since it was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that three generations of the family should share their photographs while doing yoga together.
Some TV channels also carried this thing forward
Sir, I have a question that in Kerala we had heard that instead of giving a gift as a gift to the different departments, we should give them kind of good books as a maintenanceo.
You had started this thing during your tenure in Gujarat, Sir, but we are not getting to see this much in the recent days.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a tradition in the government that we will not give a booty, we will give a book or handkerchief or handkerchief.
And the handlooms of Khadi so that Khadi can be promoted.
As long as I was in Gujarat, I had become a habit of all of us, but after coming here I had missed that habit.
But went to Kerala, then once again he became aware
And I ' ve just started giving information to the government again .
We can also gradually make a habit .
and that ' s a very low income .
Take it in hand, then leave!
But if you give a book, then in a way it becomes a part of the house, becomes a part of the family.
And when I'm saying this, how historic it is for such things
When I went to UK last year, Queen Leabeth of Britain invited me to dinner in London.
was a mother - in - law environment .
He also had a meal with great love, but later he showed me a small khadi and a handkerchief woven with thread in an emotional voice and it was shining in his eyes, he said that when I got married, then this handloom Mahatma Gandhi sent me a gift in the form of a good marriage.
How many years have passed, but Queen Liabeth has kept this handkerchief handled by Mahatma Gandhi
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life, he became a part of his history.
I believe that these habits do not change overnight and whenever you talk like this, you have to be victim of criticism too.
But in spite of this, such things should continue, efforts should be made.
Now I cant say that I will go somewhere and if someone brings a boot, then I will refuse it, I will not be able to do it.
But still there will be criticism, but if you continue to talk, then there will be gradual improvement.
My dear countrymen, as Prime Minister, there are many types of things.
They are immersed in files, but I have developed a habit for me that I read some of the letters I receive daily and that gives me an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Various types of letters come, different types of people write letters
These days I got an opportunity to read such a letter, I think I should tell you
In the far south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewife from Madurai, Arulmozhi Sarvanan - he sent me a letter
And what was the letter, he wrote that if I thought about some economic activity by keeping in mind the education and education of children in my family then the family would get some financial help.
So I took money from the bank through the money scheme and started some work to supply some goods from the market.
In such a scenario, I came to know that the Government of India has created a system called Government Marketplace.
So I have registered myself as well. I want to tell the countrymen that if you also get the opportunity, then you will get the opportunity.
is a new type of arrangement .
And then he has to order .
So all the departments of the government keep looking at those people who get registered under the GEM.
Things get very cheap because there are no middlemen in the middle .
Now all these things have been registered by the government on the website of the Arulmozhi Madam.
And the interesting thing is that the letter he has written to me is interesting.
This is empowerment
This is the opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
Perhaps, had he not written a letter to me, I wouldn't have noticed that a housewife far from a distance was doing a small job by buying it from the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the power of the country
There is also transparency in it there is empowerment and there is also an interest in it.
I would like to add more to those who want to sell their products to the government in this way.
I believe this is a great example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance. What is the goal of this and its goal
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga, and on the other hand we can also take pride in our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the land associated with yoga then our dreams are also for crossing those horizons of far-flung sky.
In the past, India has done a lot in sports as well as in science.
Today India is not only on earth but also in space.
Just two days ago, ISR launched 30 Nano satellites with Cartosat-2 Series Satellite
And in these satellites, apart from India, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, America and almost 14 countries are involved in this.
And this nano-satellite campaign of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the field of farming and in the field of natural calamities.
And this is the heaviest satellite launched by India so far.
And the newspapers of our country compared it with the weight of elephants, so you can imagine the great work our scientists have done in the field of space.
A thousand days of Mars mission are over on June 19
You all must be aware that when we successfully created a space for Mars mission in orbit, this entire mission was for a period of 6 months.
Completion of a thousand days is an important milestone in our scientific journey, our space journey.
These days even in sports, we see that the trend of our youth is growing.
Now it has been seen that along with studies, our young generations have started to see their future in sports and because of their hard work and hard work, the name of the country also brightens up.
Recently, India's badminton player Kidwai Shrikant has increased the value of the country by winning Indonesia open
I heartily congratulate him and his coach for this achievement
A few days ago, I had got the opportunity to attend the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of the Sha School of Athletics organized by athlete P.T. Usha ji.
The more we promote sports, the more we bring sportsman spirit
Sports also plays an important role in the development of personality .
The game is very important in the overall personality development .
There is no shortage of talent in the country
If children in our family are interested in sports, then they should be given opportunities.
Everyone should dream for the next lympic
Once again my dear countrymen, the rainy season, the atmosphere of festivals, in a way the experience of this period is new.
I will once again convey my best wishes to all of you and talk about the next mind.
We will hardly forget the heat of this year.
But the rain is waiting.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan is beginning.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramadan, I convey my warm greetings to the people of India and the world, especially the Muslim community.
This is a country that believes in God, those who deny God, those who worship idols, those who oppose idol worship, those who worship idols, all kinds of ideologies, every type of worship, all types of traditions. We have embraced the art of living together.
And after all, be it religion, sect, ideology, tradition, these messages give us the same message of peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan is going to be helpful in furthering this path of peace, unity and harmony.
I once again convey my best wishes to all of you.
I am happy that a lot of people gave me feedback.
Personally, I showed the enthusiasm to tell my point of view.
I have not been able to read everything, I have not been able to hear everyone's message, so many things have come.
But, whatever I have seen from a glance, someone has tried to learn music, someone is trying to put his hand on a new instrument, some are trying to learn new things using your tube, and trying to learn a new language.
Some people are learning cooking, some are learning dance, some are learning drama, some are writing poems.
Knowing, living, understanding nature are trying in that direction.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much struggle had to be fought for Indias independence, how much sacrifices have been made by our freedom fighters and how many freedom fighters had spent years in prisons.
I am inspired by Bhagat Singh, who achieved so much at a very young age, so I request you to give some message to the present generation on this subject.
I am glad that the younger generation is interested in knowing our history, our freedom fighters and the people who sacrificed their lives for this country.
I had visited Andaman Nicobar many years ago.
Cellular went to see the jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a pre-born book in jail.
He used to write poems, write on walls.
They were closed in a small cell.
What kind of torture would the freedom fighters have suffered?
When I read a book on Savarkar ji's birth anniversary, and from it I got inspiration to see the Cellular Jail.
Even a light and sound show runs there, it is a great inspiration.
There was no state in India, there was no one to speak any language of India, who would not have spent their youth in the jails of Andaman Nicobar, in the Cellular Jail, in the wake of the punishment of black water for freedom.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji, who spoke every language, every region, every generation had suffered great pain.
I would certainly tell the young generation of the country what kind of torture and suffering we had suffered for the freedom we had got, if we go to cellular jail and see why it was called black water
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Connecting with nature means establishing a better plan.
And who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times that one must take care of the world one will not see. It is our duty to take care of the world as well.
You have come very tired, open the windows of the room, open the doors, breathe fresh air - a new consciousness emerges.
When those five great souls have made their bodies, when those five great souls come in contact with them, then a new consciousness emerges in our body, a new energy is revealed.
We all have experienced this, but we do not register it, we do not add it in a thread or in a thread.
After this you must see that whenever you come in contact with the natural state, a new consciousness will emerge in you and therefore the global campaign to connect with the nature of 5th June should also be our own campaign.
Our ancestors have protected the environment, we are getting some benefit from it.
If we protect, our future generations will benefit.
Earth and environment in the Vedas are considered to be the root of power.
And Atharvaveda is, in a way, the biggest guiding light of the environment and has been written thousands of years ago.
We have been told here: Mother land: Son ego separation:
The Vedas say that what we have is due to our Earth.
Earth is our mother and we are their sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, one thing is obvious that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the enlightenment of him and his Maha Parinirvana were under three trees.
These days I keep getting news from the states.
A massive campaign of planting trees is going on in almost all the states in the event of rains.
Plants are planted in crores of rupees.
School children are also connected, social-service organizations join, NGOs join, and the government itself takes initiative.
We should also promote this work of planting in this rainy season and contribute.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has now become a familiar day for the world.
The whole world celebrates it as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, this World Yoga Day on 21st June has been celebrated across the country, connecting people.
On the one hand, many forces of disintegration are showing their distorted face in the world. At such a time, India is a major contributor to the world.
Through yoga, we have added the world to one formula.
Like yoga connects the body, mind, intellect and soul, today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, due to lifestyle, adversities, increasing responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to lead a stress-free life.
And even at a young age, this situation has reached the point of view.
The role of yoga is important to take medicines and to spend the day, to lead a stress-free life in such a time.
Yoga is the guarantee of both well-being and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through yoga to experience the inner journey of fitness through body, mind, body, thought and conduct.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world regarding Yoga Day.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to yoga and have announced some prizes.
Slowly the work will go forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day and told me that you should appeal that this time on the third International Yoga Day, three generations of the same family will do yoga together.
Be it Dada-Dadi or Nana-Nani, parents, sons and daughters, all the three generations should do yoga together and upload a picture of it.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow there will be such a happy coincidence that Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that just as we had launched the campaign of selfie with daughter and had a very interesting experience.
This picture of this three-generation yoga will definitely awaken appreciation for the country and the world.
You must send me a photo at the NarendraModiApp, where the three generations of Yoga practice on MyGov.
This will be a picture of tomorrow, today and tomorrow, which will be the guarantee of a beautiful tomorrow.
I invite you all.
We have about three weeks to celebrate IDY now.
You too, for three weeks, propagate and globalize the theme of Yoga.
In a way, this is the movement for Preventive Health Care.
I invite you all to join me.
You will also get to know from this phone call: Namaste Modi ji, I am from Naina Mumbai.
Today, I always see that wherever you go, the people there pay special attention to cleanliness.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission on your call.
Big, children have also come to awareness about cleanliness.
Many times they have seen the elders spreading dirt on the road, spreading dirt.
There the government machinery does the work of cleaning, but these days there is a celebration of cleanliness in society too.
Five days before my departure, seven days ago, ten days ago, there are plenty of cleaning programs.
The media also gives it a big importance and just a few days ago I had visited Kutch in Gujarat.
There was a big cleaning campaign there.
I did not even see it by adding it.
But when this phone call came, I started thinking about it and I saw that it was right.
You can imagine how happy I am and how the country is also not neglecting these things.
What would be a greater pleasure for me than that that cleanliness has also been added to my journey.
The rest of the preparations that will be used to welcome the Prime Minister will be - but cleanliness will be the main thing.
It is pleasant and inspiring for any cleanliness-loving person in itself.
I congratulate all those who have emphasized upon this work of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
Well, that's a very funny suggestion.
I do not know whether I will be able to do it or not.
Modi ji, when you decide your migration, tell those people who ask for your stay that if I want to call you then what will be the level of cleanliness
On the basis of how many tons of garbage you will offer to me, I will decide my stay.
Dea is very good but I have to think.
How big will be the work of humanity.
One thing I would like to say is that we do not accept this waste, it is good, it is a resource.
Don't just look at it as a garage.
Once we start considering this waste material as wealth then several new methods of waste management will come up before us.
The Government of India, with the help of the State Governments, has decided to launch a major campaign of waste management through the help of the peoples representatives of the cities.
On the occasion of World Environment Day on 5th June, such resources are going to be available in about 4000 cities of the country to collect solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of dustbins will be available, one for green color and the other for blue color.
For example, the waste that comes out of kitchens, the peels of vegetables, the remaining food, the eggs, the leaves of trees and plants, etc., all these are wet waste and put them in green dustbins.
All these things are useful in the fields and if you remember that the color of the field is green, then you will remember what to put in the green dustbin.
Today, I have to proudly mention one thing - if a person decides in his mind then how big a mass movement can be created.
The work of cleanliness is the same.
And the way in which he connected the people of the entire region and converted them into a mass movement, this is an inspiring example in itself.
In the context of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Reasi block in Jammu and Kashmir was declared open defecation free.
I congratulate everyone for this.
And I was told that the women of that area of Jammu and Kashmir have led the entire movement the most.
He took out torch trips to spread awareness and inspired people from every corner of the house.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, for the past 15 months, continuous newspaper, TV channel, social media, the audit of the present government is going on for three years.
I see this whole process as very health signals.
This 3-year tenure has been done on every criterion.
People from every section of the society have analyzed it.
And there is an excellent process in democracy.
And I clearly believe that governments should be accountable in democracy and the public should give account of their work.
I would like to thank all those who took out time and discussed our work in depth, appreciated our work, supported it somewhere and the shortcomings were removed, I understand the importance of all these things.
The thing is good, it is good, it is bad, whatever it is, we have to learn from it and we have to move forward with it.
Constructive creativity strengthens democracy.
For an aware nation, a conscious nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I am an ordinary citizen like you and as an ordinary citizen, everything that is good and bad has a similar effect on me as it is on the minds of a common citizen.
Some people criticize him politically but after such a long experience, I feel that when I started talking about Mann Ki Baat, I did not even think about it.
It seems as if I sit at home in the middle of the family and talk about the house.
And there are hundreds of such families who have sent me these things by writing to me.
I am grateful to the President, Vice President and Speaker Madam for giving this importance to the people sitting in such a senior position by taking time out.
In a way, it gave a new dimension to the mind in itself.
When some of our friends were working on the book of this mind, they had ever discussed with me.
A artist living in Abu Dhabi is known as Akbar Saheb.Akbar Saheb had proposed in front of him that the topics discussed in Mann Ki Baat, he wanted to prepare his sketch through his art, and without taking a single rupee, to express his love, Akbar transformed his mind into an art.
I am grateful to Akbar.
My dear countrymen, by the time we meet next time, there will be rains in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the examinations will have come, the life of learning will begin with a fresh start, and as soon as the rains come, a new fragrance, a new fragrance and a new aroma will be there.
Come, let us all move forward in this environment lovingly towards nature.
My best wishes to all of you.
Talk of mind, April 2017
s.
Can a little emphasis be given on this aspect in skill development
You can run a cycle, but have you ever tried to run a cycle with a three-wheeler with the help of people
Most of the families in every corner of the country will be engaged in the gym of their children
There will be some relief in the case of the people who have lost their income and wherever there will be a problem in those families, there will still be some pressure on them.
But at such a time, I will only say that listen to what I have spoken to the students in my mind last time, those things will definitely benefit you at the time of the exam.
Today is March 26
March 26 is Bangladesh's Independence Day
A historic battle against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu
And I wish that Bangladesh should progress, develop and assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner and a good friend of Bangladesh and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development in this entire region by working shoulder to shoulder.
We are all proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories, is a shared heritage.
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the composition of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
One of the most interesting things about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913, he was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize, but also the title 'Knithhod' by the British.
And when the British killed and killed at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who raised their voices and this was the period when a 12-year-old child had a profound influence on his mind.
The brutal massacre of Jallianwala Bagh gave a new inspiration to the child while laughing at the farm-barn in teenage years.
And in 1919, that 12-year-old boy, Bhagat Singh, is our beloved, inspiration for all of us - Shaheed Bhagat Singh
Three days before today, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh ji and his colleagues, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know that incident on 23rd March - the satisfaction of serving Mother Bharati on the face of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru - there was no fear of death.
All the dreams of life were incorporated for the freedom of Mother India
And these three heroes are still our inspiration
We will not be able to beautify the story of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru
And the entire British Sultanate was afraid of these three young men
The prisoners were locked in jail, the hanging was fixed, but the British were worried about how to move forward with them.
And then it was to be hanged on March 24, but it was given on March 23.
Was done secretly, which is not usually done
And later by bringing his body to today's Punjab, the British quietly burned
Many years ago, when I had got the opportunity to visit that place, I used to experience a kind of vibrancy in that land.
And I will definitely tell the youth of the country - whenever there is a chance, whenever there is a chance to go to Punjab, whenever there is a chance to visit the Samadhi of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Dutt
This was the period when the lust for freedom, its intensity and its pervasiveness continued to increase.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the youth for the armed revolution.
So just a hundred years ago - April 10, 1917 - Mahatma Gandhi did the Champaran Satyagraha
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha .
In the freedom movement of India, Gandhi ji's thoughts and Gandhi's style, its manifestation was first seen in Champaran.
It was a turning point in the entire freedom movement, especially in the manner of struggle.
This was the period of Satyagraha of Champaran, Kheda Satyagraha, the strike of mill-workers in Ahmedabad, and in all these, the profound impact of Mahatma Gandhi's thought and style of working was seen.
In 1915 Gandhi returned from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country .
Today, we can not evaluate Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
Imagine a person who came back to India in 1915, a tenure of just two years
Neither the country knew them nor had their influence, it was just the beginning.
We can guess how hard they have to suffer at that time and how hard they have to work.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that in which Mahatma Gandhi's organization skills, the power to know the pulse of the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi's behavior, to organize the poorest of the poor, the illiterate, to organize the fight for the struggle, to bring the people to the ground, to see this amazing power.
And so in the way we feel the vastness of Mahatma Gandhi
However, if we think about Gandhi Ji a hundred years ago, if Gandhi Ji of that Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study for any person who started public life.
We can learn from how public life can be started, how much hard work it has to do and how Gandhi did it.
And that was the time when we hear the names of the great leaders, Gandhi had sent Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani Ji and everyone in the villages.
Put yourself in jail on one side, on the other hand, in creative work
A wonderful balance was in Gandhi's style of functioning.
What is the word Satyagraha, what can be the difference, what is the Non-Cooperation in front of such a great Sultanate - a new Vibhavana was established by Gandhi Ji not through words but by a successful experiment.
Today, when we are living in the 21st century then who would not want to change India, who would be an Indian who doesnt want to become a partner in the country's transformation
India is neither a government programme nor a political party mannister nor a project.
India is the call of 1.25 billion people
This is the feeling that 1.25 billion people want to make a grand India together
There are many people who go to hospital every day, help patients
There are many people, they run for blood donation as soon as they know
There are many people, if someone is hungry, they worry about his food.
Our country is a multi-ratna Vasundhara
Public service is the Lord-Service, it is in our veins
If we look at it as a collective, if we look at it as organized, then what a great power
When it comes to India, it is very natural to be criticized, to be discussed and to look at it from a different perspective. This is unnecessary in democracy.
But it is true that if the 1.25 billion people of the country make a pledge, if they make a pledge, if they take one step after another, then the dream of a New India can be realized in front of our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all these things are done by the budget, by government projects and by government money.
If every citizen resolves to follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen resolves that I will fulfill my responsibilities with full sincerity, if every citizen resolves that one day in a week I will not use petrol-diesel in my life
You see, the 1.25 billion people of this country, who are dreaming of a New India, will be able to see it in front of their eyes.
What I mean to say is that every citizen follows his civil religion, performs his duty
So why not we should not associate ourselves with Swaraj in this journey of Surajya by disciplined and determined way of life
I invite you
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you today.
In the last few months, an atmosphere has been created in our country, a large number of people have participated in the digital payment digital movement.
Without cash transactions, his curiosity has increased, he is trying to learn from the poorest of the poor, and gradually people are moving towards doing business without cash.
Since the demonetization ban, there has been considerable increase in different methods of digital payment.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
Can 1.25 billion people resolve to do 2.5 billion digital transactions in this one year
We have announced in the budget
we can do this in everyday life .
You do not have any idea, but you can serve the country with great service and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
In the past, there have been many programs for public education, for public awareness, for the Digitization Fair.
There is a resolution to do 100 programs across the country
80-85 programs have been done
There was also a reward plan
About 12.5 million people have received this reward with consumerism .
April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr . Baba Saheb Ambedkar .
And as it was decided earlier, this Digi-mela will end on 14th April on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And by the end of a hundred days , there ' s going to be a big event .
There is also a provision for a very large draw
How to reduce cash, how to reduce the behavior of notes, we contribute to it.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that whenever I ask people for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, many suggestions come from them.
But I have seen that there is a constant insistence on cleanliness .
A daughter named Gayatri from Dehradun, who is a 11th student, has phoned and sent a message: - Honorable Principal, Prime Minister, I salute you
First of all , many congratulations that you have won this election with a lot of votes .
I want to talk to you about my mind .
I want to tell people how important cleanliness is .
I go through that river every day, in which people throw lots of garbage and contaminate the rivers.
The river comes through the Rispana bridge and also comes to my house .
For this river we went to the settlements and took out a rally and talked to the people, but it did not benefit.
I want to tell you that by sending a team or through a newspaper, this matter should be exposed, thank you
Look brothers and sisters, how much pain a daughter of class 11
How angry he is on seeing the garbage in that river .
I consider it a good sign .
I want that anger in the minds of 1.25 billion countrymen
Once there will be anger, resentment and anger, we will start doing something or the other against dirt.
And it is a good thing that Gayatri is expressing her anger, suggesting to me, but at the same time she is also saying that she made many efforts, but failed.
He has also taken the form of a movement .
And hatred towards filth is increasing .
Be it awareness, active participation or movement, it has its own importance.
but it ' s more habituated to cleanliness .
Work is hard, but I have to do
I believe that this feeling of awakening in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students, in the youth, indicates a good result in itself.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, whatever you are listening to Gayatri, I will tell all the countrymen that Gayatri's message should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since the time I am talking about Mann Ki Baat, I have been getting many suggestions on one thing from the very beginning and most of those people have expressed concern about Food Waste.
Half of the plate you fill in does not fill in the stomach and then leave it there.
You have ever thought how much waste we waste from the juicy we leave
Have you ever thought that if you do not leave the shit, then how many poor people can fill the stomach?
It ' s not something that needs to be explained .
By the way, when the mother serves the little children in our family, she says that son, take as much as you can eat.
There is some effort, but still apathy on this subject is a social rebellion.
injustice to the poor
Second, if there is savings then the family also has economic benefits.
Think for the society, it is a good thing, but this subject is such that the family also has the benefit.
I am not urging too much on this subject, but I would like this awareness to increase.
You will find such people somewhere in every state of India.
His life can also inspire us not to embezzle .
We take as much food as I have.
Look, these are the paths for change.
And those who are aware of the health of the body always say - Keep the stomach also a little empty, keep the plate a little empty.
And when it comes to health, it is World Health Day on 7th April.
United Nations has set the goal of universal health coverage by 2030 .
We are also familiar with the word 'expression', but if we have to interpret it, then some people call it depression too.
One estimate is that more than 350 million people in the world are mentally suffering from depression.
The problem is that even in our neighborhood we do not understand this and perhaps we hesitate to talk openly in this matter .
Those who feel express themselves do not speak anything, because they feel a little embarrassed.
I would like to tell my countrymen that expression is not such that it cannot be freed from it.
is to create a psychological environment and it starts .
The first mantra is, instead of the suspension of the expression, its expression is needed.
Open to your colleagues, friends, parents, brothers, teachers, and say what is happening to you
Sometimes the problem of loneliness , particularly to the children living in the hostel may become more difficult .
If everyone in the house is going out somewhere then he says - No, no, I do not have to come today - I like to be alone.
You ' ve ever noticed why it does ?
You must assume that it is the first step in the direction of expression .
If he does not like to live in a group, if he is going alone in one corner, then try not to let it happen.
Give him an opportunity to stay in the midst of those people who talk openly with him.
While talking about laughter and happiness inspire him to express something in which frustration is there, take it out.
That ' s the best remedy .
and epression becomes the cause of mental and physical diseases
Just as Diabetics become the guests of all kinds of diseases, even then Expression destroys all our abilities to survive, to fight, to courage, to decide.
Your friends, your family, your complex, your environment - can stop you from going to the exhibition and if you have gone then you can bring it out.
There ' s another way I
Help with your mind, share their happiness and misery, you see, the pain within you will disappear.
If you try to understand their sufferings, you will be able to do it with service and a new self-confidence will develop in you.
If you join others, serve someone else and serve selflessly, then you can easily lighten your burden.
Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy .
Yoga helps a lot to get rid of stress, to get rid of pressure, to a happy mind.
21st June is International Yoga Day
This is the third year.
If there is any suggestion regarding 3rd International Day of Yoga in your minds, you must send your suggestions, guide me through my mobile application.
All the songs and poetical compositions you can create in relation to yoga, they should do it, so that people can easily understand it.
I would like to talk to the mothers and sisters today, because today there is a lot of discussion about health, there is a lot of talk about health.
So in the past , the Government of India has taken a very important decision .
Working class women in our country, our women in the working class and their number is increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and this is welcome, but at the same time, women have special responsibilities.
Government of India has taken a very big decision .
These working class women will be given 26 weeks at the time of delivery, at the time of delivery, at the time of maternity leave, which was earlier available for 12 weeks.
There are probably two or three countries in the world, which are ahead of us.
India has made a very important decision for our sisters.
And its basic purpose is to take care of that newborn baby, the future citizen of India, to take proper care of her in the early stages of her birth, and if her mother gets a lot of love then these children will grow up and become the security of the country.
Maternal health will also be good and therefore this is a very important decision .
And this will benefit nearly 18 lakh women working in the formal sector .
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of April is the holy festival of Ram Navami, on the 9th of April is Mahavir Jayanti, it is the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on the 14th of April.
May the life of all these great men inspire us, give us the strength to resolve for a New India
Two days later Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, Nav Samvatsar, my best wishes to you all for this new year.
This is the time for the harvest to begin after spring and the farmers to get the fruits of their hard work .
This new year is celebrated in different forms in different corners of our country .
Gudi-Padva in Maharashtra, Ugadi as a new year in Andhra-Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Samvatsar Puja in the area of Awadh, twin-pital in Mithila in Bihar and Satuvani festival in Magadha takes place on New Year.
countless, India is such a country full of diversity.
The winter season is about to go now
The season of spring has knocked us all in life .
After the fall new leaves start to appear in the trees .
Flowers blossom
Gardens become green
The color of the birds begins to smell the mind .
Not only flowers, fruits are also seen shining in the sun on the branches of trees.
Fruits of summer are visible in the spring only according to mango .
On the other hand, yellow flowers of mustard in the fields bind the expectations of the farmers.
Turmeric flowers of Tesu or Palash indicate the arrival of Holi .
Amir Khusro has made a pleasant description of the moments of this change of weather .
The festival of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi puts the color of happiness in human life.
We are going to leave Phalgun in the last month in an atmosphere full of love, brotherhood and humanity and are ready to welcome the new month Chaitra.
The spring is a coincidence of these two months .
First of all, I express my gratitude to millions of citizens of the country for coming up with a lot of suggestions before my mind, when I ask for suggestions.
On NarendraModiApp, on Twitter, on Facebook, by post, I am grateful to everyone for this.
And so he said I ' ll give you some information about the launch and interceptor missile of 104 satellites
Shobha Ji, thank you very much that you have remembered the example of India's pride.
Whether it is dealing with poverty, avoiding diseases, connecting with the world, providing knowledge and information Technology, science has entered its place.
February 15, 2017 is a glorious day in the life of India.
Our scientists have proudly raised India in front of the world
Through the mega mission, SER successfully launched 104 satellites into space in different countries, including the United States, Israel, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UAE and India.
India became the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites at one go.
And it is also a matter of great happiness that this is a successful launch of the 38th PS
It's a historic achievement for SER, but for the whole of India.
Brothers and sisters, One of the 104 satellites of these 104 satellites is of great importance - Cartosat 2 - this is the satellite of India and the pictures drawn through it, mapping of resources, infrastructure, assessment of development and planning of Urban Development will be of great help.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, this new satellite will help a lot in terms of the water resources of the country, how it can be used, how it should be taken care of.
Our satellite has sent some photos as soon as it goes
He has started his work
It is also a matter of great happiness for us that all this campaign has been led by our young scientists, our women scientists.
Such strong participation of youth and women is a great pride in the success of ISR.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
For the common man, for the service of the nation, for bringing in space science, they have always maintained their object and they have been creating new records.
The less we congratulate these scientists and their entire team.
Shobha ji has asked another question and that is in relation to the security of India
India has achieved a great accomplishment, about it
There is not much discussion yet, but Shobha ji's attention has been taken on this important thing.
This missile with Interception Technology has successfully scaled the enemy missile at a height of approximately 100 kilometers from the ground during his trial .
This is a very important achievement in the field of security .
And you will be happy to know that there are hardly four or five countries in the world who have mastered it.
When we look at new technology, there is a new scientific achievement, then we are happy.
And in the journey of human life , curiosity has played a very important role .
And those who possess special intellect, do not let curiosity remain in the form of curiosity. They also question within them, they find new curiosity, they produce new curiosity.
And the same curiosity becomes the reason for new discovery.
They do not sit peacefully until they get the answer
And if we look at the development journey of thousands of years of human life, then we can say that this development journey of human life is not a complete break.
Full break is impossible
Attempts to know the universe, the laws of the universe, the minds of humans are continuously going on.
New science, new technology emerges from it
And every technology, every new science form, gives rise to a new era.
My dear young people, when we talk of the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our young generation should be attracted to science.
The country needs a lot of scientists
Today ' s scientist causes a lasting change in the life of generations to come .
In the past, the NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a major unique type of competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Social useful innovation was initiated
Occasionally the problem also shows the importance of science for solving .
What I mean to say is that there are a lot of people in the society, in the country.
And our society is also becoming a technology driven
Arrangements are becoming technology driven
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our life
There is a big force on digital money in the past
Slowly people are moving from cash to digital currency .
Digital transactions are growing very fast in India too.
In our country, Lucky Grahak Yojana and Digi-dhan Vyapar Yojana have received huge support in the past few days.
It's been almost two months, 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And it is a matter of great happiness that so far 10 lakh people have received reward under the Digi-Dhan scheme, more than 50 thousand traders have received reward and more than 150 crore rupees have been given to those who have taken forward this great campaign.
There are more than 100 customers under this scheme, who have received a reward of Rs. 1 lakh each.
More than four thousand traders are those who have received reward of fifty thousand rupees.
Be it farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, domestic women, students, everyone is taking an active part in it and they are also getting benefit.
When I asked his analysis, "Brother, just young people come here and even older people come here, I am glad that those who receive the reward are 15 years old and those who are 65-70 years old.
Shri Santosh ji from Mysore expressed his happiness and wrote on NarendraModiApp that he got a reward of Rs. 1,000 under Lucky Grahak Yojana.
Now they run cars today but in a way they have become ambassadors of this scheme.
All the passenger is given the full time of these digital knowledge .
They keep talking with such enthusiasm, encourage others too.
I would urge the countrymen, especially the youth of the country, and the Lucky Grahak Yojana, the Digi-dhan Vyapar Yojana - to become their ambassadors.
You lead this movement .
You should take this forward and in a way the fight against corruption and black money has a very important role in this.
Everyone associated with this work, in my view, is a new anti corruption cadre in the country.
In a way you are a soldier of purity .
You know that Lucky Customer Plan - 100 days when I ' m complete
April 14 is the festival of birth and birth anniversary of Dr . Baba Saheb Ambedkar .
On 14th April the price of a big crore rupees will be dropped.
There are about forty-five days left
Can you do one thing while remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar ?
Right now, Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary has been completed.
This time Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary and CBI
MOP, give it special importance and therefore I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation laid by Dr. Baba Saheb.
I have to go home and add everyone to the 125 crore hands to reach the BHIM App.
The impact of this movement that has been going on for the last two-three months is that several townships, many villages have achieved great success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture is a major contributor to the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village strengthens the economic speed of the country.
I want to tell you something very happy today .
Our farmer brothers and sisters have filled the stocks with hard work.
The hard work of farmers in our country has resulted in record food production this year.
All the signs are saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time there is such a wave in the fields, it started every day, like Pongal and Baisakhi are celebrated today.
This year more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country .
This is also 8 more than the last record which was recorded in the name of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I particularly want to thank the farmers of the country
I am glad that the farmers of my country heard the voice of the poor and cultivated different pulses in about two hundred and ninety lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but the biggest service to the poor of my country by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters of my country deserve special thanks for the manner in which the farmers of my country worked hard and produced record pulses on their heads.
My dear countrymen, in our country, by the government, by the society, by the institutions, by the organizations, by everyone, there is something going on in this direction of cleanliness.
In a way, everyone is seen to be aware of cleanliness in some form or the other.
The government is constantly making efforts
Recently, a program of senior officers of 23 State Governments led by our Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, was held in Telangana.
And it is not just a seminar in the closed room in Warangal of the state of Telangana, but by using what is the importance of direct sanitation.
On February 17-18, a Toilet Pit Empowering Exercise was organized in Hyderabad.
The toilet pits of six houses were cleaned and the officials themselves showed that the pits used by the twin pit toilet can be used again.
He also showed how convenient this new technology toilet is, and there is no inconvenience about cleaning these toilets, there is no hesitation in it, and the psychological barrier is also not hindered.
And we can clean the pit of a toilet just like that.
And the result of this effort was that the media of the country publicised it a lot and gave importance to it and it is natural that when it comes to a single ID
If the AS officer himself cleans the pit of toilet, then it is very natural to pay attention to the country.
And this toilet pit is clean and whatever you consider to be garbage, but if you look at it from the point of view of manure, then it is black gold.
We can see what waste leads to wealth.
And it ' s proved
For a six - member family a standard Twin Pit Toilet - this model fills in about five years .
After this, the waste can be easily removed and reducted into another pit.
In six-twelve months, the waste deposited in pit is completely decomposited.
It is very safe to handle decomposited waste and most important fertilizer NPK
Farmers are well aware of NPK
Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium - these are rich in nutrients and it is considered to be very good manure in agriculture.
The manner in which the government has taken this initiative, others too must have done these very positive experiments.
And now there ' s a special program of cleanliness news in television .
The more such things will be exposed in it, the more will be the benefit
Different departments in the government also celebrate Swachhta Pakhwada Regular.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development along with them, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs - Tribal Affairs - this is going to give impetus to the Swachhata Abhiyan.
And in the second fortnight of March, two ministries - Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation - these ministries are also going to carry forward the cleanliness drive in the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever a citizen of our country does something good, the whole country experiences a new energy, increases self-confidence.
We all welcomed the performance of our Divyang sportspersons at Rio Parliament.
In the final of the Blind T-20 World Up organized this month, India defeated Pakistan and made the country proud by becoming a world champion for the second consecutive time.
I once again congratulate all the players in the team
The country is proud of the achievement of these divyang friends
I always believe that the Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, determined, courageous and determined.
We can learn something from them every moment.
Whether it is a game or space science - the women of our country are not behind anyone
They are moving forward in step by step and brightening the name of the country with their achievements
In the last few days, Asian Rugby Sevens Trophy has won silver medal by our women players.
Many congratulations to all those players
March 8 celebrates World Women's Day
Giving importance to daughters in India, raising awareness about them in family and society, increased sensitivity
Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao is moving forward at a rapid pace.
Today it ' s not just a government program
This has become a campaign of social compassion, public education
In the last two years, this program has added mass consciousness to the people, has forced people to think about this burning issue in every corner of the country and has changed the thinking of the people towards the old customs that have been going on for years.
When it comes to the news that the festival was celebrated on the birth of a daughter, it gives me immense pleasure.
In a way , positive thinking towards daughters is causing social acceptance .
I have heard that the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu state banned child marriage under a special campaign
More than 175 child marriages have been stopped so far
The district administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand daughters under the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to BetiBachao-BetiPadhao scheme and along with organizing Gram Sabhas, the district administration has been making efforts to adopt orphaned girls, ensure their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being run for the education of village-village home-home daughters under the program of ' Har Ghar Dakat'.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to motivate the girls who had dropped out of their school by running their own school campaign to enroll in the school again and motivate them to read again.
The meaning of saying is that daughter Bachao-Beti Teacho This movement has also taken many forms.
The whole movement has become a mass movement
New ideas are associated with him
has been diverted as per local requirements .
You ' re also actively connecting
You get me a lot to know from!
What is happening on the earth, what is happening in the minds of the villages and the poor, it reaches me
I am very grateful for your contribution .
Yesterday, Shri Krishna Janm Mahotsav was celebrated across India.
Can anyone imagine that what a personality can be today, even after thousands of years, every festival comes with a new inspiration, it comes with a new energy and thousands of years old life is such that even today, one can give examples and inspiration to solve problems of Lord Krishna, one can find solutions to the problems of the present.
Sometimes the work of lifting a rock, sometimes lifting a leaf of food, i.e. everything feels a bit fresh and therefore, today, when I am talking to you, I go to Mohan, to me.
One Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, the other Charkhadhari Mohan
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, leaving the banks of the Yamuna, went to the coast of the sea in Gujarat, settled in the city of Dwarka, and Mohan, born on the banks of the sea, came to the banks of the Yamuna and breathed his last, in Delhi, in Delhi.
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan had used his wisdom, his duty, his thinking, and his thinking in the circumstances of that time, thousands of years ago, to avoid war, to avoid conflict, and also to save human values, to give strength to the basic elements of personality - for this, he gave such a turning point which is unique to the whole world, even today.
Be it the importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge or the importance of moving forward smiling in the midst of all the ups and downs in life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna and that is why Krishna has also been known as Jagatguru.
Today, as we talk of festivals, India is preparing for another big festival and its discussion is not only in India but also in the whole world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi
He served the farmers who were being discriminated in Champaran. He served the mill workers who were not being paid proper wages. He considered the service of the poor, the destitute, the weak and the hungry as the supreme duty of his life.
Whoever, whenever required, Mahatma Gandhi was always present for the service.
He stressed not only on service but also on self-interest associated with it.
The meaning of the word ' service ' is in the sense that it should be done with joy - service Paramo Dharma :
But, at the same time, the experience of this feeling is also inherent in the service.
We can understand it very well from Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, individual and society, human and humanity, all this was
Whether it is Foni Farm in Africa, or Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram, or Wardha, in every place, in a unique way, he always emphasized on social promotion, community mobilization.
It has been my good fortune that I have had the opportunity to visit several important places associated with the venerable Mahatma Gandhi and bow down to him.
I can say that Gandhi used to emphasize the spirit of organization with the spirit of service
Social service and social welfare community service and community mobilization is the spirit that we have to bring in our practical life.
In true sense, this is a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, a true tribute to him.
No countrymen
And collectiveness has its own strength
In this entire, 150, programs of Gandhi 150, be collective, and also be serviced.
Our ladies club is
They will continue to do the work of modern-day schools club, but all the members of the ladies club will work together to accomplish some or the other service work together.
can do a lot
Collect books, divide the old and the poor, spread the knowledge, and I believe that perhaps 130 crore Indians have 130 crore ideas, 130 crore ventures.
There is no limit to those who have come to mind - be it good-will, goodwill, harmony and complete dedication, and that too for the feeling of a unique pleasure.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha is a very important turning point in the freedom movement.
In Dandi, I had inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
Perhaps, in today's time, in your eyes, in your pen, the form of Gandhi written by your pen, perhaps it will be even more relevant.
A lot of programs, competitions, exhibitions have also been planned in the coming days.
But one thing in this context is very interesting that I want to share with you
Haripura Panels were particularly interesting in this
You might remember that there was a Congress session in Haripura in Gujarat where the incident of Subhash Chandra Bose's presidential election was recorded in the history.
These art panels have a very beautiful past
Prior to the Haripura session of Congress in 1937-38 Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Prime Minister Nand Lal Bose of Shanti Niketan art building .
Gandhiji wanted to show the way of life of people living in India through art and this art work will be exhibited during the session .
This is the same Nand Lal Bose whose art work enhances the beauty of our constitution .
gives a new identity to the constitution .
And this art practice of his has made Nand Lal Bose immortal along with the Constitution .
Nand Lal Bose visited the nearby village of Haripura and finally made some art canvas showcasing the life of rural India.
There was tremendous discussion in this precious artist's defense
Once again, with the best wishes on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I expect every Indian to make a pledge.
For the country, for the society, something for someone else should be done.
This will be Bapu's good, true, authentic work
Son of Mother India, you will remember that in the last few years, we have been running Swachhta Hi Sewa campaign across the country for nearly 2 weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will start from 11th September .
During this time we will leave our homes and through Shramdaan we will give work to Mahatma Gandhi .
Whether it is a house or a street, a square or a drain, from school, college to all public places, there is a great campaign of cleanliness.
In the same way, we have to eliminate the use of single use plastic together.
This will save money and they will also be able to contribute to the protection of the environment .
This time, on October 2, when we celebrate Bapu's 150th birth anniversary, on this occasion, we will not only dedicate to him an open-defecation-free India, but will lay the foundation for a new mass movement against plastic across the country.
Celebrate October 2 as a special day
I also appeal to the corporate sector that when all these plastic wastes are collected, then we should come forward for its proper disposal, there should be a system of disposition.
It can be recycled .
It can be fueled
Thus , by this Diwali , we can also complete the safe disposal of plastic waste .
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhashitas are in a way gems of knowledge.
we can get what we need in life .
These days my contact is too short , but I had a lot of contact before .
Stupid people call stone as gems
In our culture there has been a lot of respect for food
Until We have turned the knowledge of food into science .
Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, especially for women and new-borns, because this is the foundation of the future of our society.
Under the Poshan Abhiyan nutrition is being made a mass movement through modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting malnutrition in new and interesting ways .
One thing was brought to my attention .
A handful of paddy in Nashik has become a big movement .
In the days of harvest , Anganwadi workers collect one handful of grain from the people .
This grain is used to make hot food for children and women
The donor becomes in a way a civil society servant .
After that he himself becomes a soldier of that movement .
We ' ve all heard about the food - prashan - sacrament in every corner of India .
This is done when the child starts feeding solids for the first time .
Quick food is not solid food!
In 2010, Gujarat thought that children should be given a comprehensive food on the occasion of a ritual of food, so that people can be made aware about it.
This is a very great initiative that can be adopted, everywhere.
In many states people run date food campaigns
If there is a birthday in the family, if there is a birthday, if there is a memory day, then the family members go to Anganwadi by cooking nutritious food, when they go to schools and the family members serve themselves and feed the children.
share their joys and enjoy themselves .
A wonderful union of service and pleasure is seen .
Friends, There are so many small things that our country can fight an effective battle against malnutrition.
Today, in the absence of awareness, the poor from malnutrition, and the rich, both families are affected.
The month of September all over the country will be celebrated as the Poshan Abhiyan
You must join it, get information, some new couples also contribute
If you bring one or two people out of malnutrition , we bring the country out of malnutrition .
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that there would be a lot of questions and it happened. And in the last few weeks, wherever I have met people, there is a mention of Man vs.
I have not only been associated with the youth of India from all over the world with this episode but I had never thought that this will make my place in the young hearts in this way.
I had never even thought about the diversity that our country and the youth of the world pay attention to .
I never thought that there would be a chance in my life to touch the hearts of young people all over the world.
And what happens ?
Just last week I went to Bhutan
I have seen that whenever I got the opportunity to visit as the Prime Minister and due to the International Yoga Day, the situation has become such that if I go to any person in the world then he would ask me about Yoga for five-seven minutes.
There is hardly any big leader in the world who has not talked to me about Yoga and I have experienced it all over the world .
But these days there ' s a new experience
Whoever gets a chance to talk wherever he gets a chance, he talks about the field, he talks about the environment.
Tiger, Dion, creature and I'm surprised how people are interested.
Discovery plans to broadcast this program in 165 countries in their language
I hope that in such a scenario, the message of India, the tradition of India, sensitivity towards nature in the cultural journey of India, this episode of Discovery Channel will help the world very much in familiarizing it with all these things. And now people want to know the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in our country.
But there is another interesting thing that some people ask me one thing with hesitation - Modi Ji please tell me that you were speaking Hindi and if you do not know Bear Grylls Hindi then how did it happen so fast between you ?
Is this done later?
This has been shot so often what has happened
with great curiosity .
Look, there's no secret in it!
The reality is that technology was used extensively in interaction with Bear Grylls
So I used to speak Hindi but it used to be heard in English and because of that the communication became very easy and this is the amazing thing about technology .
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discuss Jim Corbett, National Park.
You people too must visit places associated with nature and life.
I have said before, I must say that you must go North-East in your life.
will expand within you
A country full of diversities will also fill you with these diversities as a teacher, as well as you.
Last month I had the privilege of issuing the Tiger Census in the country
Do you know how many tigers are there in India ?
The population of tigers in India is 2967 .
Just a few years ago, half of it was hard.
Tiger Summit was held in Russia's Saint Petersburg in 2010 with tigers.
It took a resolution expressing concern over the decreasing number of tigers in the world
This resolution was to double the number of tigers in the whole world by 2022.
We doubled our tiger numbers in 2019 .
Not only the number of tigers in India, but the number of protected areas and community reserves has also increased.
When I was releasing the data of tigers, I also remembered the lions of Gir in Gujarat.
When I took charge of the chief minister there, the habitat of lions was shrinking in the forests of Gir.
their number was decreasing
We took several steps one after the other in the Gir .
In 2007, decided to deploy women guards there
Improved infrastructure to increase tourism
Whenever we talk of nature and wild life then we only talk of conservation .
But, now we have to go ahead with conservation and think about the situation.
Our scriptures also have a very good guidance in this regard .
Therefore, we need to not only conserve our forests, flora and fauna, but also create an environment that enables them to flourish properly.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on 11 September 1893, 1893,
This young monk of India , who shook the mankind across the world , came to leave India ' s glorious identity in the world .
The words of a great man like Swami Vivekanand on September 11, 1893 forced the world to change the perspective of looking towards India.
Come, Swami Vivekananda ji had seen the form of India that Swami Vivekananda had known to India.
My dear countrymen, all of you will remember that August 29 is celebrated as National Sports Day.
This will be a big interest campaign for every child, for the elderly, for the youth, for women all and this will be your own.
But today I ' m not going to tell her nuances
I want to make you aware of fitness and for Fit India, we should collectively set some goals for the country.
My dear countrymen, I will be waiting for you on 29th August in India.
Come, let's move with a new zeal, new resolution, new power
My dear countrymen, today we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat
I'll wait for your words, your suggestions.
Come, let us all come together to make Gandhi's dream come true to make India the dream of freedom fighters:
Let ' s go while expressing the inner joy in service .
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with great fervor and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duty of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, in a way, is also a sacrament which makes the future generations aware of democracy and democratic responsibilities.
But still, in our country, the greater the debate, the more the debate, the more it should be on the duties of citizens, the more it should be on the rights of citizens, the more it should be discussed in a comprehensive manner, it is not happening now.
I hope that at every level, every time, the more emphasis is given on rights, the more emphasis is on duties.
Only on two tracks of rights and duties can India's democracy move at a fast pace.
Tomorrow is January 30, our revered Bapu's death anniversary.
On 30th January, we all pay homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country by keeping silence for 11 o'clock in the morning, 2 minutes.
As a society, as a country, paying homage at 2 minutes at 30 January 11 at 11 o'clock should be a natural tendency.
Why not for 2 minutes, but it also expresses solidarity, determination and reverence for the martyrs.
In our country, there is a natural respect for the army, for the security forces.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the brave-hearts and their families, who have been honoured with various gallantry awards.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal, several categories.
When we learn from the depths of their courage, valour and bravery, we feel surprised, proud and inspired.
On one hand, we were all happy with the news of the excitement and enthusiasm of January 26, at the same time, our army personnel in Kashmir who are standing in the defense of the country, they got the gallant due to avalanches.
I pay my respects and salute all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you know very well that I keep on talking about the mind continuously.
January, February, March, April - all these months are months of testing in every family.
There are exams for each and every one and half of the children in the house, but the entire family is under the burden of em.
So I felt that this is the right time to talk to the student friends, to talk to their parents and to talk to their teachers, because for many years, wherever I went, wherever I got it, the examination was a big problem.
The family is troubled, the student is upset, the teacher is upset, a very strange psychological environment is visible in every home.
And I have always felt that we should come out of it and that is why today I want to talk to the young friends in some detail.
I received a telephone message of creation.
So I want to ask you so much that this atmosphere can't be pleasant?
Well, the question has been asked by Creation, but this question will be in everyone's mind.
The examination should be an opportunity of happiness in itself.
I have worked hard throughout the year and now I have got the opportunity to tell you that this should be a festival of enthusiasm.
There are very few people for whom there is a plan for e-NAM and for most of the people, e-NAM is a process.
You have to make a decision that you will consider it as a pressure.
Those who consider it as a place, they will find those who consider it as a pressure, they will regret it.
And that is why I am of the opinion that the examination is a festival, take the exam as if it is a festival.
And when there is a festival, when there is a festival then the best thing that happens within us comes out of it.
The strength of society is also felt at the time of the festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
There should be an atmosphere of celebration among friends and neighbours in the entire family as well.
You see, this pressure will convert into space.
The festive atmosphere will make the burden free.
And I urge the parents to create a festive atmosphere for the next three-four months.
The fact is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these examinations are conducted for three to four months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to turn these three-four months into festivals in our own way, taking into account our traditions and family environment.
And you must have seen that when you are happy and smile, you find Relax yourself and when you are relaxed you easily remember the old things of your age.
A year ago, a teacher in the classroom used to miss the entire scene.
And you should know that the power to recall the memory is the highest in relation.
If you are under stress, then all the doors are closed, they dont go inside, they dont come out.
There is a pause in the thought process, it becomes a burden in itself.
How did you remember outside You were the only one who told me not
But the one who was inside immediately came out and came out because you were relaxed.
Therefore, if there is any medicine to recall the memory, then it is a relaxation.
And I tell you this thing from my experience that if there is a pressure then we forget our things and if there are relaxation then we cant imagine it.
But when there is tension then your knowledge, your knowledge and your knowledge are suppressed and your attention is mounted on it.
And that is why it is necessary that A Happy mind is the secretary for a good mark-sheet. Sometimes it seems that we are not able to see the exam in proper performance.
It seems that he is a question of life and death.
The reward that you are going to give is the result of your education throughout the year.
This is not the criterion of your life.
What kind of life you have lived, what kind of life you want to live, there is no eam for that.
In your life, in the classroom, in the notebook, there must have been opportunities to pass through many tests.
Therefore, the examination has something to do with the success and failure of life, get rid of such a burden.
They got admitted to the Air Force, failed.
Suppose that if they had been disappointed with that failure, had they lost their lives, would India have got such a great scientist, would they not have met such a great President
The points have become the most important.
Due to this competition has increased a lot, along with the tension in the students has also increased a lot.
So I would like to be aware of your views on this current direction of education and its future.
By the way, he himself has given the answer, but uncle wants me to keep something in it too.
Marks and marks-sheets are a limited use.
It's not everything in life.
Life goes on, how much knowledge you have earned.
Life goes on, has you tried to live what you have to go and live
Life goes on to say that what you have received a sense of mission and what is your sense of mission, is there any coordination between your mission and mission
If you trust these things then you will come after you by asking the marks and you will never need to run behind the marks.
Knowledge is going to be useful to you in life, skills are going to be used, self-confidence is going to work, and the will power is going to be used.
You tell me, there will be some doctor from your family and all the family members will go to him and they will be family doctors.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a bigger case, do you see the marks-sheet of that lawyer?
You see his experience, his knowledge and his journey of success.
And that is why the burden of these marks also sometimes stops us from going in the right direction.
But this does not mean that I should say that just, there is no reading.
It needs to be used for its test.
I was yesterday, today I have said that it is necessary to know.
But if you focus on marks, and focus on marks, then you slowly shrink yourself and limit yourself to a certain area and get marks only.
So it may be that despite being a promising person, sometimes he fails in his life.
Cha ji, one thing has said this is competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
A special feature of the life of most of the successful players is that they compete.
If we take the example of Mr. Sachin Tendulkar ji.
To break our own records for twenty years, to defeat and move forward every time.
It is a great journey of life, because they have adopted the path of competition more than competition.
Friends, in every field of life, and when you are going to give prizes, if you were able to study for two hours peacefully, could you do it for three hours
From within, that energy is produced automatically.
If you are better then you will become careless and trustworthy.
If you spoil it, you will become sad and frustrated, you will be filled with jealousy, you will eat yourself and if you are equal, you will never feel the need for improvement.
How to do it ahead of what I had done earlier and how to do it better Just concentrate on this thing.
You see, you will feel a lot of change.
Shri S. Sunder ji has expressed his feelings regarding the role of parents.
They say that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
He further wrote that my mother was not read-written, yet she used to sit with me and asked me to solve the questions of mathematics.
Once you learn to accept, the maximum problem will be solved.
Accessibility opens the way to solve problems.
Expectations make the path difficult.
Accepting the state gives an opportunity to open new avenues and therefore accept what is there.
You will also be burden free.
One of our acquaintances was in the hospital due to heart attack, and the first speaker of our Lok Sabha, Ganesh Dada Mavalankar, and his son Purushottam Mavalankar, was also an MP who visited him to see his health.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not ask any question about his health by coming.
As soon as they sat and came, they started to recite jokes, no matter what the disease is, and in the first two-four minutes they made such an atmosphere light.
In a way, going to the sick person, we scare the disease.
I would like to say to parents, sometimes we do the same with children.
Have you ever thought of giving children an atmosphere of laughter and happiness during the days of exam
You see, the environment will change.
I have received a phone call for a great surprise.
They do not want to tell their name to the gentleman.
After listening to the phone, you will know why they do not want to tell their name?
Hello, Prime Minister, I can not mention my name, because I did something like that in my childhood.
Once I tried to copy in my childhood, I started preparing a lot for this thing that I tried to find out how I could copy and how it was done, due to which a lot of time was wasted.
In that time, I could have brought as many numbers as I had spent on copying.
And when I tried to pass by copying it then I was caught in it and because of me many friends around me had a lot of trouble.
Your point is right.
These short-cut paths become the reason for copying.
So copy doesn't benefit. To chit.
Copy makes you bad, so do not copy.
You must have heard many times and again that don't copy, don't copy.
I'm telling you the same thing again.
And once there is a habit of copying then there will never be a desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you reach?
If you give the same creativity, the same time on the issues of your income, then perhaps there is no need for a copy.
The result of the hard work of your own self will increase the self-confidence of the person, it will be amazing.
This basic perception is wrong, the root cause of the problem is that.
If we want to make all-round development then there is a life outside the books as well and it is very huge.
This is the time to learn to live.
Someone will say that I will complete all the examinations first, I will play later, if I do this then it is impossible.
Have you ever thought that when you are in such a scenario, then you should come out in two moments to look at the sky, look at some trees and plants, look at some minds, you will see that with a freshness you will come back in your room and in your books.
Whatever you are doing, take a break, wake up, go out, go to kitchen, find something of your choice, find a biscuit of your choice, then eat and laugh a little.
Even if it's not five minutes, but you break it.
You will feel that your work is getting easier.
Whether everyone likes it or not, I do not know, but I have experience.
There is no need to stay in a room to take a deep breath.
You come under the open sky, you go to the roof, you take five minutes of deep breath and then sit for your reading, you see, the body will be completely relaxed and the relation of the body with which you feel it, you will feel it as well, you will feel it, you will feel it, you will feel it, you will feel it, you will feel it, you will feel it, you will feel it, you will feel it, you will feel it, you will feel it, you will feel it, you will feel it, you will feel it.
When I hold meetings in elections, sometimes my voice sits down.
So I came to meet a folk singer.
They came and asked me - how many hours do you sleep?
I said - Why brother, are you a doctor?
No-no, say- This is your voice that gets spoiled during the election, it is related to it.
You will get complete sleep only then your local card will get complete rest.
Now I had never thought of sleep and my speech and my voice, they gave me a herb.
So really, we understand the importance of these things, you see, you will benefit.
But this does not mean that just keep sleeping, but you will say something that the Prime Minister has said, there is no need to just wake up, we have to keep sleeping.
So don't do that, otherwise your family will be angry with me.
And if your marks-sheet comes on, then you will not see it, I will see it.
So do not do this.
And that is why I would say that this is a very big medicine to keep the mind, intelligence and body conscious of the person who plays the role of 'Pe for Preparedness and P for Play'.
Well, young friends, you're preparing for the exam and I'm stuck in your mind.
Perhaps, these things will not only work for you people but will also work for you people in this regard.
If you can do it or not, then do not do it or else it will also become a burden.
So as I advise the parents of your family not to be burdened, they apply to me too.
Make the criterion a celebration to cross every criterion.
Then there will never be a test, the criterion.
Take this mantra and move forward.
On this occasion, I thank all officers and jawans of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has kept its place among the four largest Coast Guard of the world, with all its 126 ships and 62 aircrafts built in the country.
While fulfilling this motto, the jawans of the Coast Guard continue to be prepared day and night in adverse circumstances to protect the maritime borders and maritime environment of the country.
And very few people would know that in our country there are not only men in the Coast Guard but women are also playing their responsibilities equally on the shoulders and successfully.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard are not only men and women who are working as pilots, but also command the Overcrats.
It is considered an opportunity to worship.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
Give me my color, Basanti Chola - this is the inspiration.
My best wishes to the people of our country on the auspicious occasion of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio always fills new colours with its imagination.
Since last month, he has started talking about the mind in regional languages immediately after the completion of my mind.
This has received widespread approval.
People from far and wide are writing letters.
It gives me a great opportunity to connect with you.
Best wishes.
Mind talk, December 2016
However, in newspapers, new people are being caught everyday, notes are being caught, raids are being conducted and good people are being caught. How is this possible
L.
Rahul played the innings of 199 runs. Test captain Virat Kohli gave good batting as well as good leadership.
Last month we were all enjoying Diwali
Like every year on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border, on the border of China, to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I go every time, but the experience of this Diwali was something else
In a unique way, the 1.25 billion people of the country, dedicated it to the soldiers of the Diwali army, dedicated it to the security forces, its impact was on the faces of every soldier there.
They looked full of emotions and not only this, the best wishes and messages sent by the countrymen, they included the security forces of the country in their happiness and there was a wonderful response.
And people just sent messages, it was not like that, they were connected with the mind.
Someone wrote a poem, someone made a picture, someone made a cartoon, someone made a video, that is, every house became a post of fighters.
The work is going on, the contribution of all of you, the feelings of the soldiers of the country's army with your imagination, your feelings towards the security forces of the country will be compiled in this book.
A soldier of the army wrote to me - Prime Minister, for the soldiers, Holi is celebrated on the border, Diwali is always in the security of the country.
Yes, but at the time of festivals, the house is remembered.
But to tell the truth, this time it did not seem
It's not a festival and I'm not home.
It seemed as if we were celebrating Diwali with 1.25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, the feeling that has arisen in this Diwali and the feeling that has arisen in the security forces of our country and the jawans, should they be limited to just a few occasions
I would like to appeal to you that as a society, as a nation, we must remember our soldiers of our country in some form or the other, be it any festival or festival or be it an atmosphere of happiness or be it any occasion for us to develop our nature.
When the whole nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases 125 million times
Some time ago, I had come to meet all the heads of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir.
I had the opportunity to talk to him for a long time
They had come up with a few things about the development of their village, they had come up with some demands, but when the talk started, it was natural that the situation in the valley, the legal system, the future of the children, all these things were natural.
And with so much love, so much openness, these heads of the village talked about, everything was going to touch my heart.
I urged them to go and focus their attention on the future of these children .
Today I am happy that all these princes who came from Kashmir valley fulfilled their promise to me.
He went to the village and awakened all the people away
Just a few days ago when the board's gym took place, the sons and daughters of Kashmir took part in the board examination, about 95, fifty percent of the students of Kashmir, students of Kashmir took part in the board examination.
The presence of such a large number of students in the board examinations indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development for a bright future, through education.
I congratulate the students for their zeal, but I congratulate their parents, their family members, their teachers and all the village heads from the bottom of my heart.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I ask people's suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that suggestions from all of you are one and all.
Everyone used to say that on 500- and 1000-note notes and talk in detail
However, on 8th November at 8 pm, while addressing the nation, I had discussed the launch of a Mahabhiyan to bring about reforms in the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, even then I had told everyone that the decision is not normal but it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is to implement that decision.
And I was also convinced that in our normal life we would face many new difficulties .
And even then I had said that the decision is so big that it will take 50 days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move forward towards a normal state.
The campaign to get rid of the diseases that we have been facing for 70 years can not be easy .
I can understand your difficulties.
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation.
Despite a lot of efforts being made to mislead you, despite repeated incidents, you have well understood this path of truth and have accepted this thing in the interest of the country.
500 and 1000 notes and such a big country, so much of currency, billions and billions of notes and this decision - the whole world is looking at it very closely, everyone is making a lot of analysis of it, and assessing it.
The whole world is looking at the fact that 1.25 billion Indians will be able to achieve success even after facing difficulties.
There may be a question mark in the mind of the world
India has only reverence for 1.25 billion Indians and belief that 1.25 billion Indians will fulfill their resolutions.
And our country, like gold, will come out in every way by doing penance and refinement. And the reason for this country's citizens is that you people are the reason behind this success.
The central government, state government, all the units of local self government, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1.5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank friends, are engaged in this work day and night.
In the midst of different kinds of stress, all these people work very peacefully, considering it as a sacrifice for the service of the nation and considering it as an effort to bring about a great change.
Start in the morning, when the night will complete, the address does not last, but all are
And this is the reason that India will succeed in this thing, it is clearly visible.
And I have seen that all the people of the bank, post office are working amidst so many difficulties
And when it comes to the issue of humanity, they appear two steps ahead.
Someone told me that an old man in Khandwa had an accident .
suddenly needed money
I came to the notice of the local bank employee there and I am glad to know that he himself went to his house, to deliver the money to that old man so that he could help in the treatment.
Such countless stories come to the fore every day in TV, in the media, in the newspapers, in the media.
He showed his strength .
Today, once again, he has taken up that challenge and I am confident that the resolution of 1.25 billion Indians, the collective hard work of all, will pave the way for this nation to become a new force.
But the evils are so widespread that some people still do not get used to the evils
Still, some people feel that this money of corruption, this black money, this unaccounted money, this anonymous money, can find some way to re-establish the system.
They're looking for illegal ways to save their money.
Sadly , even in this , they have chosen to choose the way to use the poor .
Some people are trying to save money by confusing the poor, by talking about greed or temptations, by putting money into their accounts or by doing some work with them.
But, please don't play with the lives of the poor
Don't do anything to get the name of the poor on the record and later when you check, my dear poor man gets into trouble because of your sin.
And there is such a strict law of Anonymous property, which is being implemented in it, how difficult it will be
And the government doesn ' t want our countrymen to face any problem
Someone from Madhya Pradesh, Mr. Ashish has telephoned me and appreciated the fight against corruption and black money through this 500,000.
I am a common citizen of village Tirali, Tehsil Tirali, District Harda, Madhya Pradesh
The currency which has been closed by you, thousands of five hundred notes, it is very commendable
A similar call has come to me from Mr. Yelapappa Velankar ji of Karnataka: - Modi ji Namaste, I am talking to Yelapappa Velankar from this village of Koppal district of Karnataka.
I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, because you said good days would come, but no one thought you would take such a big step.
Five hundred and a thousand notes, seeing all this, taught a lesson to black money and corrupt people
Every citizen of India will never have a better day than this
That is why I want to thank you with all my heart .
Some things are known through media, through people, through government sources, the enthusiasm for working is also very high.
There is so much joy and pride that what a wonderful power the common man has in my country
And people go there, eat food, and after 2-4-6 days when they go there again, they return the money again.
This is the strength of my country, which includes service, sacrifice and honesty.
But I don't know that in the discussion on tea, there's marriage too.
I came to know that on 17th November in Surat, there was a marriage that took place with discussion on marriage tea
In Gujarat, a daughter in Surat, who came to her marriage, gave only tea to those who came here and did not do any burnt, no food program, nothing - because there was some difficulty due to the ban on bondage.
Baratis also considered him as the same honor
Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar of Surat - through their marriage, against corruption, against black money, the contribution made by them in this fight is a motivation in itself.
I also bless the newly born Bharat and Daksha and congratulate them for turning the occasion of marriage into this great sacrifice and turning it into a new opportunity.
Tea-worker lives and Tea-worker gets paid weekly
Now got a note of 2000 rupees, what did they do?
Four of the women from the neighborhood got together and four of them bought it and paid a note of 2000 rupees, they did not need a small currency, because the four of them bought it together and decided that the next week, then we will calculate it by sitting
People are looking for ways themselves
See, how the life of the village is also changing.
Some people have got the immediate benefit of this campaign
The country will get the benefit in the coming days, but some people have got immediate benefit
Every municipality hardly gets 50 of the tax .
But this time , due to this decision on the 8th , everyone ran to deposit their old notes .
In the 47 urban units this year, a tax of about three and a half thousand crore rupees had come.
You will be surprised to know that in this week, Rs. 13 thousand crores have been deposited to them.
Said three and a half thousand and said 13 thousand
And that too from the front ,
Now if this amount has come four times in those municipal areas then it is natural that there will be arrangement for gutters, water arrangements will be made in poor habitations and arrangements for Anganwadis.
There are many examples of this in which its direct benefit has also begun to be seen .
Brothers and sisters, Our village, our farmer, this is a strong pivot of our countrys economy.
On the one hand, due to this new transformation of the economy, amidst difficulties, everyone is adjutting themselves.
But I would like to especially congratulate the farmers of my country today
Right now I was taking data on sowing of this crop
I am glad that whether it is wheat or pulses or oilseeds, I had an account of 20th November till 20th November, sowing has increased in considerable quantity compared to last year.
Even in the midst of difficulties, the farmer has found the way
The government has also made many important decisions, in which priority has been given to farmers and villages.
Even after that there are difficulties, but I believe that the farmer who is always standing firmly behind him while facing all our difficulties and natural difficulties, is still standing firm even at this time.
Small traders of our country, they also provide employment and also increase economic activity.
Millions of crores of rupees have been given to such small people through the money-plan because they do small business, crores of people and give a boost to the business of billions and billions of rupees.
But it was natural for them to have trouble because of this decision .
But I have seen that now our small traders are also serving the customers in their own way through technology, through mobile app, through credit card, through mobile app and also on the basis of trust.
And I want to tell my younger brothers and sisters that there is a chance, you too should enter the digital world.
You can also download the app of banks on your mobile phone
You also have a PDS machine for the credit card
I invite you to make a huge contribution in creating a cashless society. You can increase your business, create a complete banking system on mobile phones and today there are several ways but notes, so that we can run the business.
There are technological ways, safe, and quick!
I would like you to help in making this campaign a success not only, but also to lead the change and I am confident that you can lead the change.
I also want to tell the laborer brothers and sisters that you have been exploited.
There is a salary on paper and when given in hand, then there is another
Whenever a salary is paid, someone is standing outside, someone is required to cut it and the labor force makes this exploitation a part of life.
With this new system, we want your bank account, your salary and money to be deposited in your bank so that the minimum wages are complied with.
And once money has come into your bank account, then you too do not need a big smart phone, nowadays your mobile phone also works as an e-botway - you can pay from the same mobile phone to any small shop in the neighborhood, you can buy money from that mobile phone.
Therefore, I urge the labor brothers and sisters to partner with this scheme because after all I have taken such a big decision for the poor of the country, for the farmers, for the labourers, for the deprived, and the oppressed, and should get the benefit of this scheme.
Today I specially want to talk to young friends
We shout in the world that India is a country that has 65 population below 35 years of age
You young and young people of my country, I know, you have liked my decision.
I also know that you support this decision
I also know that you contribute a lot to positively this point
But friends, you're my true soldier, you're my true partner.
A wonderful opportunity to serve Mother Bharati has come to us, an opportunity to take the country to greater economic heights.
My young men, can you help me?
You'll give me a hand, not so much talk.
The more you have the experience of today's world, the older generation is not
Perhaps the elder brother in your family will not even know and parents, uncle and mother-in-law may not even know
You know what the app is, you know what it is online banking, you know how it is online ticket booking.
Things are very common to you and you use them too .
But today the great work that the country wants to do, our dream is cashless society.
It's fine that 100 percent cashless society is not possible.
And I want your physical help in this, I want your time for myself, I want your resolve for myself and you will never disappoint me, I believe that because all of us are those who want to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know, how many opportunities are there for cashless society, digital banking or mobile banking
Every bank offers online facility
Vallet's direct meaning is E-Batuwa
There are many types of cards available
Commonly, the natural phone can also be a cash transfer.
Be it a dhobi, a vegetable seller, a milk seller, a newspaper seller, a tea seller, a gram seller, everyone can use it comfortably.
And I ' ve given more emphasis to simplify this system .
All the banks are engaged on this, doing
My young friends, even after all this, an entire generation is unaware of it.
And all of you, I know very well, are active in this great work
The kind of creative messages you give on WhatsApp - slogan, poems, stories, cartoons, new imagination, laughter and jokes - I see everything - and amidst the challenges this is the creative power of our younger generation, it seems as if this is the specialty of the land of India that during the times of war the Gita was born in the field of war, similarly today we are going through such a big phase of change, then the original creativity is appearing in you too.
But my dear young friends, I say once again, I need your help in this work.
G-G-G, I repeat, I need your help and you, I believe millions of young people of my country will do this work.
teach the shopkeeper how to do business .
You have to voluntarily take out this cashless society, a campaign to get rid of the problems of these notes, a campaign to free the country from corruption, a campaign to get rid of black money, a campaign to free people from difficulties and problems.
Once you teach people how to use RuPay card, the poor will bless you.
If you teach these facilities to the common man, then he will probably get rid of all the concerns. And if all the youth of India start this work then I dont believe it will take much time.
Within a month, we can stand as a new modern India in the world and you can do this through your mobile phone by visiting 10 houses daily, by adding 10 houses daily.
This country has made a big revolution
My young people, I once again urge you to take this campaign forward.
You must have seen that Amitabh ji, the most popular artist of this century, is pushing the campaign of cleanliness with a lot of enthusiasm.
It seems as if the subject of cleanliness has spread in their veins and only then on the birth and birth anniversary of his father he remembered the work of cleanliness.
He has written that Harivansh Rai ji has a poem and he has written a line of it, the body of the soil, the mind of the fun, the life of the moment, my introduction
Harivansh Rai ji used to introduce himself through this medium .
My introduction to the mind of the soil, the mind of the fun, the life of the moment, his son Shri Amitabh ji, who is running the mission of cleanliness in his veins, has written to me, using the poetry of Harivansh Rai ji - clean body, clean mind, clean India, my introduction
I respectfully bow down to Harivansh ji.
I also thank Mr. Amitabh ji for his involvement in Mann Ki Baat and for taking forward the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your feelings continue to keep me connected to you through your letters, on MyGov and on NarendraModiApp.
Now it is a matter of mind at 11 o'clock, but in regional languages it is going to start immediately after completing it.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all on the occasion of Deepawali.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated with enthusiasm and excitement in every corner of India.
India is such a country that for 365 days, some or the other festivals are visible in some or the other corner of the country.
The person watching from afar will ever feel that this is the second name of the festival like Indian public life and this is also natural.
The festivals that have been the tradition of India since the Vedic period have been timeless, they have been timeless, we have seen the courage to end the tradition of timeless festivals and the changes in the festivals as per the demands of the society have been easily accepted.
But one of these things we can see very well that the entire journey of India's festivals, its depth, its penetration in the masses and its fundamental mantra is related to taking the self towards the whole world.
Efforts should be made to expand the personality and personality, to broaden the scope of our limited thinking, from society to the universe and through these festivals.
All these things, our ancestors have gathered in a scientific way, in a festival.
Today the whole world talks about environment.
Nature-destruction has become a matter of concern.
The tradition of India's festival has been that of strengthening nature-love, it has been that of the values of every person from child to child.
Be it trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains or birds, there are festivals that have a sense of responsibility towards everyone.
Nowadays we celebrate Sundays holiday, but you must have seen that for centuries we had the tradition of celebrating full moon and new moons on Sundays.
That is, the tradition of celebrating holidays with the universe and science has also developed here.
Today, when we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I said, every festival of ours is an educationist, it comes with the understanding of education.
This festival of Deepawali gives a message of Tamso Ma Jyotirgamaya - moving from darkness to light.
By lighting the lamp of Deepawali, by lighting the lamp of social evils and by spreading darkness, one gets salvation from the evils of the person and that is the festival of Diwali.
We all know one thing very well, go to any corner of India, go to the houses of the rich and the rich, go to the hut of the poor, and in the festival of Diwali, a cleanliness drive is visible in every family.
Every corner of the house is cleaned up.
If the poor will be the utensils of their soil, then the utensils of the soil will also be cleaned like this, just like Diwali has come.
Diwali is also a cleanliness campaign.
But, the need of the hour is not just to clean the house, but to clean the entire area, to clean the entire village, and to broaden our habit and tradition.
The festival of Deepawali is no longer limited to the boundaries of India.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in some or the other form in all the countries of the world.
Several governments of the world are also becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
He has put a photo on the Instagram, and has shared that photo with the world and has done it with great pride.
And what is the picture.
16 women MPs of Singapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament wearing Indian sari and this photo has been viral.
And all this has been done for Diwali .
Just now the Prime Minister of New Zealand had come, he told me that I have to return early because I have to attend the festival of Diwali there.
I mean to say that Deepawali, this festival of light, is also becoming an inspiration for bringing the world community from darkness to light.
They invite a lot of suddenness in trying to raise the voice of the tax by collecting firecrackers.
Never even remember what things are in the neighborhood, there will be no fire.
In the days of Deepawali, the news of the suddenness, the news of the fire, the news of the death, brings great concern.
And there is also a problem that in the days of Diwali, even the doctors have gone to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers, a crisis gets added to it.
It's not just one day.
If you call it Govardhan Puja, say Bhai Dooj, call it profit Panchmi, and take it to the festival of Kartik Purnima, then in a way there is a long period of time.
Along with this, we also celebrate the festival of Deepawali and also prepare for Chhath-Puja.
The festival of Chhath-Puja is a very big festival in the eastern part of India.
In a way, Mahaparv is held for four days, but one of its special features is that it gives a great message to the society.
But the saying goes that Bhai, people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath-Puja is a festival in which the sun is also worshiped.
There is a great social message in it .
It is time to convey my best wishes to all of you, but at the same time there is more time for me, especially to the countrymen, thank you and express gratitude.
For the past few months, the events that are taking shape, our army personnel are looting everything for our happiness and peace.
My thoughts are with the soldiers of the Army, the soldiers of the security forces, these sacrifices, penance, hard work, my heart and soul.
And one of those things was done in mind that it was dedicated to Diwali in the name of security forces.
I invited the countrymen for a campaign called Sandesh to Soldiers.
But today I want to say this thing by bowing my head and saying that there will not be any human being in India, who has immense love for the soldiers of the country, who has pride in the army, who has pride in the security forces.
The way it has been expressed, it will give strength to every countryman.
We cannot imagine the soldiers of the security forces, we are so courageous, and your message has been revealed in the form of strength.
Be it schools, colleges, students, villages, poor, traders, shopkeepers, politicians, players, cinema, there is hardly anyone who has not lit a message for the soldiers of the country.
The media also overturned this festival in an opportunity to express gratitude to the army and why not, whether it is BSF, CRPF, VIDEO
Be it the Indo-Tibetan Police, the Assam Rifles, the Army, the Army, the Navy, the Coast Guard, I cant mention all the names and countless names.
When we remember him in the mood of the festival then a new strength comes in that memory as well.
Capacity increases in a message and the country has shown tax.
I really express my gratitude to the countrymen.
Many, who had art, did it through art.
Sandesh-Soldiers, so many things have come on this Ashtag - all these things have come in a symbolic way.
I have sent a poem by Mr. Ashwani Kumar Chauhan, I would like to read it.
Ashwini ji has written - I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I am smiling, I am happy, I am smiling, this is all this, because I tell you today, because you are the cause of my freedom, I sleep peacefully, because I sleep peacefully, because you are posted on the border, I bow down to the summit of India, I bow down to you, I bow down to the summit of India, I bow down to you, I bow down to you, I bow down to you, I bow down to you, I bow down to you, I bow down to you, I bow down to you, I bow down to you, I bow down to you, I bow down to you.
My dear countrymen, whose mother-in-law is full of soldiers and whose in-laws too are full of soldiers, one such sister Shivani gave me a telephone message.
Come, let us hear what the army family says: - Namaste Prime Minister, I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
The Sandesh-Soldiers campaign that has been launched on this Diwali is encouraging our military brothers.
I'm from an army family.
My husband is also an army officer.
My father and father-in-law have both been army officers.
So we are full of family soldiers and there are many officers on the border who are receiving such good messages and getting a lot of encouragement from everyone in the army circle.
And I would like to say that along with the army officers and soldiers their families, their wives also carry a lot of sacraments.
Thank you, my dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the army are found standing on every front of their lives and not just on the border.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh has become Open Defecation Free.
Earlier Sikkim had become a state, now Himachal was also there, Kerala is also going to be there on 1st November.
TBP Jawan, Shri Vikas Thakur - originally from a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
So at that time he was going to have a village council in the village, he reached there and was discussing in the meeting of the village, construction of toilets and it was found that some families were unable to build toilets due to lack of money.
This development is full of patriotism .
And only then Himachal Pradesh got the strength to free the Open Defecation Free.
Similarly, in Kerala, I really want to express my gratitude to the youth.
It is difficult to reach such a tribal panchayat, Idmalakudi, even after walking on foot all day long in the remote forests of Kerala.
People never go.
Near him, in urban areas, students from engineering were reminded that toilets were to be constructed in this village.
The cadets of NCC, NSS, engineering students and all of them together decided that we will build toilets.
All the stuff that was required to be taken for making toilets, bricks and cement, all these youths picked up on their shoulders and went to those forests on foot all day long.
Work is going on at a very fast pace in all the states.
I have mentioned something.
The way they have taken up this task, the entire state, I am confident that the Kerosene will be free very soon.
What a big change it will bring, it will stop theft, it will also benefit the environment, it will also save our foreign exchange, and it will also increase the convenience of the people.
Yeah, if there is a problem, the middlemen will be, the dishonest will be.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guiding light for all of us.
Every thing about them should be said about the country today, how to go, the standard is set for it.
You decide on the basis of this standard.
It is the need of the hour that we will have to address the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the difficulties.
Why should our old thinking be anything, but society must be freed from the distinction of son and daughter.
Now there are toilets for girls in schools as well as for children.
This is an opportunity for our daughters to feel free from discrimination.
Even though vaccination is being done on behalf of the government, lakhs of children still get rid of vaccination and become victims of disease.
Mission Indradhanush is a campaign to reach out to the missing children, which empowers children to get rid of serious diseases.
After so many years of independence, the poor mother used to cook food on a wooden stove and used to smoke 400 cigarettes a day. What would happen to her health
The effort is to provide smoke free life to 5 crore families and to move towards success.
Small traders, small traders, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, barbers, barbers etc., used to be trapped in the interest of the moneylenders.
MUDRA Yojana, stand-up scheme and Jan Dhan account are a successful campaign to get rid of interest evaders.
To deposit the money directly into the banks through Aadhaar, the beneficiaries can get the money directly.
This is an opportunity to get rid of middlemen in the lives of the common man.
We have to run a campaign where there is not only improvement and change, but also to ensure the path of liberation from the problem and it is happening.
My dear countrymen, Tomorrow, 31st October is the birth anniversary of the great personality of this country - the one who made the mantra of his life and showed the same to him - Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's birth anniversary.
But the phone call of a gentleman from Punjab, his pain also touched me: - Prime Minister, Namaskar, Sir, I am speaking from Punjab.
Sir, as you know, on the 31st of this month is the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
And as we all know how events took place in the country after his assassination.
Sir, I wanted to say that how can we prevent such unfortunate events that take place.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of one person.
A Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, History is witness to the fact that after Chanakya, the Bhagirathi task of uniting the country was done by Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
We bow down to the great man who had done such a great work of bringing freedom to India under a flag, who had done such a great work.
But it is also painful that Sardar Saheb lived for unity, due to his priority of unity, many were also victims of resentment, but never left the path of unity.
It is on the birthday of that great man who lived his life for unity, and on the birthday of Sardarji, oppression with Sardars, a page in history that hurts all of us.
But, in the midst of these crises, we have to move forward with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of the country.
We should also protect the country from the pervasive thinking and perversion.
Sardar Saheb gave us an India, it is the responsibility of all of us to make a better India.
The essence of unity is the strong foundation of a better India.
The journey of Sardar Saheb started with the struggle of the farmers.
The farmer's son was.
Sardar Saheb had a very important role in bringing the freedom movement to the farmers.
It was a successful effort of Sardar Saheb to make the freedom movement a strength of the village and the result of his organization's strength and skill.
But Sardar Saheb was not only a person of struggle but also a person of structure.
Today, sometimes we hear Amul's name.
Today, people are familiar with every product of Amul within India and outside India.
But very few people would know that Sardar Saheb's vision was that he had imagined the union of co-operative milk producers.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Poornima in this series of Diwali is also a festival of lights.
Guru Nanak Dev, his teachings are still a guiding light for the entire mankind, not only for India but for the entire humanity.
Service, truth and sarbat da good, this was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and goodwill were the basic mantras.
Be it discrimination, superstition or evils, the campaign to get rid of the society was in every aspect of Guru Nanak Dev's life.
When there was untouchability, caste system, high and low then Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo as his colleague.
Come, let us also, who has given us the light of knowledge, who inspires us to shun discrimination, orders us to do something against discrimination, everyones development with this mantra, who can be a better guide than Guru Nanak Dev ji.
I salute Guru Nanak Dev Ji for coming out of this festival of lights.
My dear countrymen, once again, my best wishes to you all on this Diwali in the name of the soldiers of the country.
May your dreams and resolutions be successful in every way.
May your life be full of joy and peace, that is what I wish you all the best.
Thanks a lot
In the past, in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir, in a terrorist attack, we lost 18 brave sons of our country.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
And that is why today I would like to tell the countrymen that what I had said on the same day, I would like to repeat it again today that they will be punished.
My dear countrymen, we trust our army.
We are proud of our army.
I want to talk to the citizens of Kashmir in particular today.
The citizens of Kashmir have started to understand the anti-national forces well.
And as they have started to understand the truth, they are moving on the path of peace by separating themselves from these elements.
Every parents wish that school-colleges work fully as soon as possible.
Farmers are also feeling that their crops, fruits etc., have been prepared so that they reach the markets across the country.
Economic business also runs well.
And for the last few days, business has started to run smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and goodwill are the ways to solve our problems, the path to progress and our development.
For our future generations, we have to scale new heights of development.
I believe that we will find solutions to every problem together, find ways and at the same time will pave the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
In order to make the law and order, the government has to take some steps.
Sometimes people who think differently from what we think are new ideas.
In social media these days I get a lot of opportunity to know
Every corner of India provides an opportunity to know and understand the feelings of all kinds of people and it promotes the power of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harshavardhana of class 11 has given me a different kind of idea.
He wrote that after the Uri terrorist attack, I was very distracted.
But there was no way of doing anything and what a small student like me could do.
So I came to know how to work for the welfare of the country.
And I resolved to study 3 hours a day.
I will become such a worthy citizen of the country's work.
Brothers and sisters, It is a matter of great happiness for me that in this atmosphere of resentment, you can think about health at such a young age.
But Harshvardhan Ji will also say that there is a lot of value for the resentment of the citizens of the country.
It symbolizes the consciousness of the nation.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had tried his best to touch this emotional world of the country in a very good way.
And he had inspired the common man of the country by giving the mantra of Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan for the welfare of the country.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had presented that another way for every citizen is to express patriotism amidst the voices of the gun.
Mahatma Gandhi too, when the freedom movement was launched, when the movement was at a fast pace and there was a need for a stop in the movement, he used to make great use of that intensity of the movement to inspire it towards constructive work within the society.
If we, our army and the people sitting in the government discharge our duties, and if we, our countrymen, every citizen, with the zeal of this patriotism, make some or the other constructive contribution, then the country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.S. Kartik has written to me on the NarendraModiApp that the athletes who went to the Paralympics created history and their performance was the victory of Human Spirit.
Shri Varun Viswanathan also wrote on the NarendraModiApp that our athletes did a very good job and you should mention it in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only you two, every person in the country has a emotional attachment to our sportspersons in the Paralysis.
Probably more than sports, the performance of these Paralysis and our players has completely changed the attitude of humanity and the attitude of seeing the attitude of the differently abled.
And I will never forget this thing of our winning sister Deepa Malik.
When he received the medal he said that with this medal, I have defeated the disability itself.
This sentence has great power.
This time 19 athletes, including 3 women from our country, took part in the Paralysmpics.
In comparison to the rest of the games, when Divyangs play physical capacity, skill in sports, the biggest thing is - will power, determination power.
You will be pleasantly surprised to know that our players have won 4 medals in the best ever performance - 2 Gold, 1 Silver, 1 Bronze medals.
Devendra Jhajharia, the brother who received the Gold Medal, brought the Gold Medal again in the throwing of the spear and brought it back after 12 years.
And they were not Divyang from birth.
They had to lose one hand because of the electricity current.
Just imagine, a person who gets the first gold medal at the age of 23 and gets the second gold medal at the age of 35 years will have done a lot of hard work in his life.
Mariappan bagged the Gold Medal at Thangavelu High Jump.
And Thangavelu lost his right leg only at the age of 5.
Even the poor did not come in the way of their resolve.
They are not from the big city, nor from the middle class rich family.
Despite having a difficult life at the age of 21, despite physical hardships, the country was given a medal by the strength of resolve.
Athlete Deepa Malik has been named after her to hoist many kinds of Vijaypatayas.
Varun C. Bhati won a bronze medal in a high jump.
These medals are not only important for our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood, but also for our Divyang brothers and sisters. These medals have done a great job.
We have awakened our feelings, but the attitude of looking towards these people has also changed.
Very few people would be aware of the valour of the Divyangjans in the Parliament this time.
Just a few days ago, Olympics was held in the same place.
One can imagine that the people with disabilities have broken the record of General Olympics.
This time it has happened.
The record that the recipient of the Gold Medal in the Olympics event in the race of 1500 meters has created a new record in the race of 1500 meters by Abdelatti Baka of Algeria in the race for 1.7 seconds.
Moreover, I was surprised to know that the number of Divyangjans who got their fourth rank, as the runner-up, did not get any medal, they ran in less time than the person who got the gold medal in the general runner-up.
Once again, I congratulate all these players and in the coming days, India is moving forward in the direction of making a smooth plan for the Paralysis as well as for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience at Navsari in Gujarat.
He gave me some excerpts, and I presented them to the people, and people were astonished.
On that day, I had the opportunity to release a book, which had compiled successful stories of the lives of some Divyangjans.
There were big motivational events.
The Government of India has set a world record on the land of Navsari, which I believe is important.
Within eight hours, six-hundred divyang people, who could not listen, successfully used the machines to eed.
He got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for us, the people of our country, to have three World Records in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of Pujya Bapu.
And on that day also I had said that cleanliness should be the nature, the duty of every citizen and an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt should be created.
Now, on October 2, when we are celebrating two years, I can say with confidence that the awareness about cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 1.25 billion citizens of the country.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today all of us can say that everyone has tried to move one step forward.
This means that the country has moved forward towards 1.25 billion steps towards cleanliness.
This is also certain, the direction is right, the direction is right, the results are so good, what happens with a little effort, and therefore everyone, be it the common citizen, be it the government offices or roads, bus stands or be it railways or schools or colleges or be it religious places or be it hospitals or be it hospitals or be it children or be it the old people, village poor, farmers, women, everyone is contributing something or the other in cleanliness.
Friends from the media have also played a positive role.
But the beginning has been good, efforts have been full, and we will succeed, this belief has also arisen.
And if we talk about rural India then about 2.25 crore toilets have been constructed so far i.e. about 2.5 crore toilets and in the coming one year it is intended to build 1.5 crore more toilets.
I had just gone to Gujarat, the officials told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will achieve the goal on October 2 this year.
My best wishes to those who have done this thing and those who are trying to do it and I appeal to the countrymen that for the honour of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children, we have to free the country from this problem and we should move forward with this resolution.
Especially, I would like to present a plan for young friends who are using technology in a big way nowadays.
Everyone has the right to know about the cleanliness mission in your city and for that the Government of India has given a telephone number 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
You will not only be able to know the status of construction of toilets in your city by phone, but will also be able to apply for the construction of toilets.
The Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward.
Assist your young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent in the form of Swachh Bharat fellows in the districts.
This cleanliness campaign is not limited to just rituals.
Cleanliness becomes a habit, it is not enough.
In today's era, health is linked to cleanliness. In the same way, a new model is also essential with cleanliness.
Waste to health is also important part of it and therefore, along with the cleanliness mission, we have to move forward towards waste to compost.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the compost produced from the waste.
Provide these facilities to the farmers who want to go to the organic farming.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, think about the health of the earth, and those who have suffered a lot due to chemical fertilizer, if they need some such manure, then they should be provided it.
And Mr. Amitabh Bachchan is contributing a lot in this work as Brand Ambassador.
This is a work like doing.
From all over the country, ministers, chief ministers, mayors of metros, commissioners of these governments are going to think deeply about cleanliness and cleanliness.
What can happen in technology?
How can employment opportunities be increased
All topics are going to be discussed.
And I can see that there are new news for cleanliness continuously.
One day, I read in the newspaper that the students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and started a Jagaran Abhiyan for the construction of toilets.
He himself worked hard and contributed to the construction of nearly 9,000 toilets.
You must have seen in the past that a team led by Wing Commander Paramveer Singh had travelled 2,800 kilometers from Devprayag in Ganga to Ganga Sagar and gave a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also set up a calendar for one year by its respective departments.
Every department focuses on cleanliness in particular for 15 days.
In the coming October, from 1st to 15th October, all the three are going to work together to create a road map for cleanliness in their respective areas by working together with the Linking Water and Sanitation Department, the Panchayti Raj Department and the Rural Development Department.
And last two week of October, 16th October to 31st October, 3 more Department Agriculture and Farmers Welfare - Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing I
I also request my citizens that if you have any connection with the work being done by these departments then you too should join it.
You must have seen that these days a survey campaign of cleanliness is also going on.
The situation of cleanliness was presented before the people of the country by surveying 73 cities first.
Now it is the turn of those people who have more than 1 lakh population who are close to 500 cities and due to this there is a belief in every city that we have left behind, we will do something good next time.
There is an atmosphere of competition for cleanliness.
I hope all of us can contribute in this campaign, as much as possible.
The coming 2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
The Swachh Bharat Mission has been completing 2 years.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali, I continue to urge you to buy something or the other of Khadi.
This time also, I urge every family to have something or the other about Khadi so that the lamp of Diwali can be lit in the homes of the poor.
On this 2nd of October, while Sunday, as a citizen, can we be connected to cleanliness somewhere or the other
You can add yourself for 2 hours, 4 hours physically and I tell you to share one photo of the cleanliness drive that you have been involved in.
If there is a video, then share the video.
You see, with the efforts of all of us in the country, once again this movement will get a new strength and a new momentum.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something or the other for the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a joy in itself for giving something in life, whether someone recognize it or not.
His mission is to collect food items, clothes and all these for the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the streets and used to ask for the donation of the old toys that were used to come to the families, they used to offer gifts to the poor people of Anganwadis.
This is a kind of donation festival.
I convey my best wishes to the youth who are engaged in this work from the bottom of my heart.
My dear countrymen, today is the 25th of September, the occasion of the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji, and the beginning of the centenary year of his birth is from today.
The principle of Sarvajan Hitaya - Sarvajan Sukhaya Antyodaya - this is their contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also used to talk about the welfare of the last person.
How can the poor get the fruits of development?
He had presented the entire economic agenda in two words: water for every farm and water for every farm.
The country celebrates their birth centenary year as a poor welfare year.
The focus of the society, the governments, everyone's attention, the benefits of development should be on the poor and only then can we get rid of the poverty of the country.
It is a symbol of the poor welfare year of the same century.
I respectfully bow down to the venerable Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji, who is an inspiration to all of us.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Vijaya Dashami, I started talking about Mann Ki Baat two years ago.
It was my sincere effort that this episode of Mann Ki Baat should not become a program of praising the governmental work.
How the common man of this country continues to inspire me.
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
Today, when I am completing 2 years this week, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the way you have appreciated the way you have blessed me, the way you have blessed me.
I am also grateful to AIR that they not only broadcast these words of mine but also made every effort to convey it to all languages.
I am also grateful to those countrymen who wrote letters after Mann Ki Baat, made suggestions and knocked on the doors of the government, highlighted the shortcomings of the government and gave a platform to solve the problems by organizing special programs on such letters and inviting the people of the government.
So the talk of the mind was not just a 15-20 minute conversation but a new opportunity for social change.
What could be the reason for greater satisfaction for anyone and that is why I thank everyone involved in making it a success.
My dear countrymen, next week is the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja, the festival of Vijayadashmi, the preparations for Diwali. In a way, a different atmosphere is spread all over the country.
This is a festival of power and worship, the unity of the society is the strength of the country.
Whether it is Navratri or Durga Puja, how should this worship of power be celebrated as a festival of unity of the society
How did the festival of connecting the masses?
And that is the practice of true power and only then by going together we can celebrate the victory of victory.
Come, practice power, let's move with the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar is the birth anniversary of the hockey magician Dhyan Chand Ji on August 29.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day throughout the country.
I pay tribute to Dhyan Chand Ji and on this occasion also remind all of his contributions.
In 1928, in 1932, in 1936, in the Olympic Games, he played an important role in bringing the gold medal of hockey to India.
We all know the name of the cricket lover Brahmin.
He had asked Dhyan Chand Ji - e-scores goal like runs.Dhyanand Ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, an opposition player hockeyed on the head of Dhyan Chand ji.
At that time, there was only 10 minutes left to finish the match.
And Dhyan Chand ji gave three goals in those 10 minutes and said that I gave the revenge of the injury to the bullet.
My dear countrymen, whenever the time for Mann Ki Baat comes, many suggestions come from MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
I see a very positive attitude of the common man towards Rio Olympics, a lot of awareness and a lot of pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to speak on this.
Even outside cricket, the citizens of India have so much love, so much awareness and so much information about sports.
For me, reading this message has also become a cause of great inspiration in itself.
A Shriman Ajit Singh has written on the NarendraModiApp. Please speak in Mann Ki Baat about the daughters education and their participation in sports as they have made the country proud by winning medals in Rio Olympics.
Someone Mr. Sachin writes that you are requested to mention Indus, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in this episode of Mann Ki Baat.
The medals we received, the daughters gave.
Our daughters once again proved that they are no less than anybody, in any way.
It seems as if the daughters of the whole of India have taken the initiative to illuminate the country's name
On MyGov, Shikhar Thakur has written that we could do even better in Olympics.
He has written Respected Modi Sir, First of all, congratulations for the two medals we won in Rio.
But I want to draw your attention to this whether our performance was really good?
And the answer is, no.
We need to go a long way in sports.
Our parents continue to focus on studies and academics even today.
In society, sports is still considered a waste of time.
We need to change this thinking.
Society needs motivation.
And no one can do this work well with you.
Similarly, Shri Satya Prakash Mehra Ji has written on the NarendraModiApp that there is a need to focus on extra-curricular activities especially in sports by children and youth.
In a way, thousands of people have expressed the same idea.
It can not be ruled out that we could not perform according to our hope.
In some cases, it has happened that those who performed in India, those who performed in the games here, they could not even reach there and only two medals were awarded in the medal tally.
But it is also true that even if you look closely at the medal tally, for the first time in many disciplines, Indian players have shown great feats.
Now you see, in the shooting our innovative Bandra ji was in fourth place and he missed the medal in a very short span of time.
Deepa Karmakar also did wonders in Gymanastics - she remained in fourth place, she missed the medal due to a very small difference.
But how can we forget this one thing that she is the first Indian daughter to qualify for Olympics and Olympics.
Something similar happened with the pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna in tennis.
We performed well in athletics this time.
After P.T. Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babur standardized the track field findings.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, the women's hockey team has reached the Olympics.
Vikas Krishna Yadav reached the parlor-inal in Bong, but could not find Brone.
Many players, such as Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das, are many names, whose performance is good.
But my dear countrymen, we have a lot to do.
But whatever we have done, we will continue to do the same, perhaps we will be disappointed.
I have announced a committee.
The government of India will go into the depths of the house and will study the practices that are taking place in the world.
We will make a roadmap for what we can do well.
We have to plan for 2020, 2024, 2028 - with a far-reaching vision.
I also urge the state governments to make such committees and to show what can we do in the field of sports, what can each state do, what can the state do, what can be done by playing one game or two games
And I urge every citizen of India to send suggestions on the NarendraModiApp that whoever is interested in them.
Write to the government, discuss and give your memorandum to the government.
State Governments should send their suggestions by discussing and discussing.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is the Teacher's Day.
I used to learn a lot from these little boys too.
For me, 5th September was also the Teacher's Day and for me, it was also the Education Day.
But this time I have to go to the G-20 Summit, so I feel that today I can express my feelings in Mann Ki Baat.
The more the mother's place in life, the more the teacher's place.
And we have seen such teachers who are more concerned about themselves than themselves.
He spends his life for his disciples, for his students.
These days, after the Rio Olympics, there is a discussion of Pulaila Gopichand ji all around.
They are players, but they have presented an example of what a good teacher is.
Today, I see Gopichand as an additional teacher for a player.
And on Teachers' Day, I salute Pullila Gopichand Ji, his penance, his dedication to sports and his methods of enjoying the success of his students.
The contribution of the teacher in our lives is always felt forever.
5th September is the birth anniversary of the former President of India, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan ji and the nation celebrates it as Teachers Day.
He reached any place in life, but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Sometimes I think that I remember so many stories of my teachers because they used to be our eros in our small village.
But today I can happily say that one of my teachers - now he is 90 years old - his letter comes to me every month.
And even at the age of 90, I am surprised to know that even at this stage, he writes very beautifully words, and because of this, whenever I see someone's good letters, I feel a lot of respect.
If you have a photo with your teacher on the NarendraModiApp, if there is any incident with your teacher, if there is any motivation for your teacher, then you must share it.
Look, seeing the contribution of teachers in the country from the perspective of students, this too is very valuable in itself.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Utsav is going to come in a few days.
Ganesh ji is averse and we all want that our country, our society, our family, every person and his life remain uninterrupted.
But when we talk of Ganesh Utsav, it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public Ganesh Utsav is the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak.
Through the Ganesh Utsav, he made this religious occasion a festival of national awakening, a festival of social values.
There should be a lot of discussion about the issues that touch the lives of the people through the Ganesh Utsav, the programs that give a new energy and a new momentum to the society.
Even today, public Ganesh festivals are taking place not only in Maharashtra but in every corner of India.
All the youngsters are prepared to do it and there is a lot of enthusiasm.
And some people have still made every effort to follow the spirit of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
They hold discussions, essays, competitions, rangoli competitions on public topics.
The glimpses that he has in him also highlight the issues that touch the society in a very artistic manner.
In a way, a big campaign of public education runs through the public Ganesh festival.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us this inspiring mantra, Swaraj is our birthright.
Suraj is our priority, cant we communicate with the public Ganesh Utsav due to this mantra
Come, I invite you.
It is true that festivals are the strength of the society.
The festival fills new lives in the life of the person and the society.
Life is impossible without a festival but it has to be moulded according to the demands of time.
This time I have seen that many people, especially Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja, have written a lot to me.
And they are worried about the environment.
Some people are associated with Shriman Shankar Narayan Prashant, he has urged them to explain to the people in Mann Ki Baat that they should not use the idols of Lord Ganesh made from plaster of Paris.
Why not use Ganesh ji made of mud of village pond
The statues made of POPs are not favorable to the environment.
They have expressed a lot of pain, others have also done it.
I also pray to all of you, why not use the soil, the idols of Ganesh and Durga, why not come back to our old tradition.
Protecting the environment, protecting our rivers and ponds and protecting the small creatures of this water from the pollution caused in them is also the service of God.
Ganesh ji is averse.
So we should not make such a Ganesh ji, who create obstacles.
I do not know how you will take these things from me.
Many such institutions and people work very hard for the Ganesha cow protection.
Co-friendly Ganesh Festivals - this is also a work of social service.
There is still time between Durga Puja.
Now we should decide that the idols that our old families used to make will also get employment and if we go to the pond or the soil of the river then the environment will also be protected.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be conferred the title of Saint Mother Teresa on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had spent her entire life serving the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud of the fact that those who have served the poor of India for their lifetime and when Mother Teresa is conferred with the title of Saint.
On the 4th of September, an official delegation will also be sent by the Government of India, led by our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, on behalf of 1.25 billion Indians.
We get to learn something or the other from saints, sages, as well as great men.
We will continue to get something or the other, we will continue to learn something or the other.
My dear countrymen, how big a change comes when development becomes a mass movement.
Manpower is considered to be the form of God.
The Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments, has made a successful effort to connect the people to clean Ganga and to clean Ganga.
On 20th of this month, people were invited to Allahabad who were the heads of villages living on the banks of Ganga.
There were men too, women were also.
They came to Allahabad and the heads of the villages of the Ganga coast took oath in the testimony of Mother Ganga that they would immediately stop the tradition of going to open in the villages of the Ganges coast, run a campaign to build toilets and the village in Ganga Safai Will not allow the village to become dirty.
I would like to congratulate these leaders for coming to Allahabad for this resolution. Some people came from Uttarakhand, some from Uttar Pradesh, some from Bihar, some from Jharkhand and some from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all those Ministries of the Government of India and the Ministers who have realized this vision.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the 5 states that they have taken an important step in cleaning the Ganga by adding manpower.
My dear countrymen, some things touch me a lot sometimes and those who imagine it, I have a special respect for them.
On July 15, more than seventeen-hundred-lakh students of more than seventeen-hundred schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote a letter to their parents.
Someone wrote in English, someone wrote in Hindi, someone wrote in Chhattisgarh, he wrote a letter to his parents and said that there should be toilet in our house.
These children from seven to seventeen years of age did this work.
And so much effect was there so much emotional impact that after getting the letter, when the school came to school the next day, the parents handed him a letter to the teacher and the parents had promised to make the toilet by the date of the receipt.
Congratulations to those students who have been able to accomplish this task and also to those parents who have decided to take the decision of making their child's letter of seriously and make it a toilet.
This is what inspires us.
In Koppal district of Karnataka, Mallamma, a daughter of sixteen years old in this district - this daughter made satyagraha against her family.
They say that they had given up their food and that too for asking for something for themselves, not for bringing good clothes, not for eating sweets, the insistence of daughter Mallamma was that there should be toilet in our house.
Now there was no financial condition of the family, the daughter was attached to Jid, she was not ready to leave her satyagraha.
Mohammad Shafi, the head of the village, came to know that Mallamma had made a satyagraha for the toilet, so also see the specialty of the village chief Mohammed Shafi that he waited for eighteen thousand rupees and within a week he made a toilet.
Look at the power of this daughter Mallamma's insistence and look at the head of a village like Mohammad Shafi.
How to solve problems, this is the manpower I
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become the resolve.
Some Indians have made it their own purpose.
But everyone is connected to it in some form or the other, everyone is making their own contribution.
It will be a competition and those who will be victorious on October 2, Gandhi Jayanti will be rewarded.
Hey, nowadays you can also make a film with your mobile phone camera.
Come, move forward, you are my invitation.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to ensure that our relations with our neighbours are deepened, that our relations are smooth and vibrant.
A very important thing has happened in the past, our President Respected Pranab Mukherjee started a new program in Kolkata, Akashwani Maitri Channel.
Now many people will feel whether the President should also inaugurate a radio channel.
But this is not the channel of ordinary radio, it is a very important step.
Bangladesh is in our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
They will share the content and enjoy the AIR on both sides.
All India Radio has a major contribution in terms of people-to-people contact.
The President launched it.
I also thank Bangladesh for joining us for this work.
I also congratulate the friends of All India Radio for giving their contribution in foreign policy as well.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the job of a good Prime Minister, but in the end, I am also a person like you.
And sometimes emotional events touch me a bit more.
Such emotional events give a new energy and a new inspiration and this is what inspires the people of India to do something or the other.
In the past, I received a letter that touched my mind.
A mother of nearly 84 years, who is a retired teacher, wrote this letter to me.
If they had not denied me in their letter that they would never declare my name, then at any time I had the mind that today I would talk to you by naming them and they wrote that when you had appealed to leave the gas subsidy, then I had given up the gas subsidy and later I had forgotten it.
For me, the Prime Minister of India's letter is not less than a Padma Shri.
Brothers and sisters, You must be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those people who had left the gas subsidy and some of my representatives should go and give them a letter.
My effort is to write letters to more than one crore people.
Under the same scheme, my letter came to this mother and she wrote to me that you are doing a good job.
Your mission of liberating the poor mothers from stoves and therefore I am a retired teacher and in a few years I am going to get 90 years of age. I am sending you a donation of Rs.
You can imagine that as a teacher you spend 50,000 rupees as a teacher when you give to the poor mothers and sisters to get rid of the stove and to provide gas connection.
The question is not of 50 thousand rupees, the question is of the spirit of that mother and such crores of mothers and sisters are their blessings, which makes my country confident and strong for the future of the country.
And he did not write to me as the Prime Minister, he wrote a simple letter - Modi brother
I salute that mother and salute these crores of mothers of India who always strive to do something or the other for the welfare of others.
My dear countrymen, we were troubled by the famine last year, but this month of August was constantly full of floods.
There have been frequent floods in some parts of the country.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the units of the Local Self Government, the social organizations, the citizens, did their best to do whatever they could.
But in the midst of these reports of floods, there were some reports that needed to be remembered.
What is the strength of unity, if we move together, how big can it be achieved
This will be remembered in August this year.
In August, 2016, there were a lot of political opposition parties, parties that did not give up any chance against each other, and nearly 90 parties in the whole country, a lot of parties in the Parliament, all the parties together passed the law of GST.
Its credit goes to all the parties.
And if all the parties come together in one direction then this is an example of what kind of great work is being done.
Similarly, in relation to the situation of Kashmir that happened in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together spoke about Kashmir in one voice.
He also sent a message to the world, sent a message to the separatist elements and expressed his condolences to the citizens of Kashmir.
And it is the opinion of all of us, 1.25 billion people of the country, from the head of the village to the Prime Minister, that if any person knows about Kashmir, whether he is a young man or a security personnel, this loss belongs to us, it belongs to his own country.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by furthering these small children, sometimes they will have to answer these innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is huge, it is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, all of us have the responsibility to strengthen, to highlight and to maintain a country full of diversity in order to unite, and to make the country a bright future.
I believe in the power of 1.25 billion Indians.
I thank you very much today.
My dear countrymen, Namaste, I got a chance to spend a few moments with the youth of Delhi this morning and I believe that in the coming days, the color of the game in the entire country will energise every young person.
We all know that in a few days, the world's largest sports Mahakumbh is going to be.
Rio continues to resonate in our ears.
There are many hopes and aspirations, but the 1.25 billion people of the country have got the courage to inspire those players who have gone to play in Rio.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organized a grand event - Run for Rio, Sports and Live, Sports and Games.
In the coming days, wherever we may be, we should do something to encourage our players.
No matter how fond of eating, everything has to be left.
I am ready to do this on your behalf.
The Prime Minister of the country is ready to become the postman to convey your message to these players.
If there are no research and innovation, then just like the water that is stuck spreads dirt, technology also becomes a burden.
And if we continue to live with the trust of old technology without research and innovation then we will become out-of-the-box in the world and in the changing age. And that is why the government has also taken several steps for attracting science in the new generation, research and innovation towards technology and that is why the government has also taken several steps.
And that is why I say - Let us aim to innovate. And when I say Let us aim to innovate, then let me AI.
If we want to prepare the next generation innovators then our children will have to be associated with it. And that is why the Government of India has taken an initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
Wherever such tinkering labs will be set up in schools, they will be given Rs. 10 lakh and Rs. 10 lakh for maintenance will be given in five years.
If we have a strong and prosperous Incubation Centre, then there is a system for innovation, start-ups, start-ups and to bring them to a level playing field.
In the same way, India is facing many problems.
We see problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find a technological solution.
We have called upon the younger generation of an Atal Grand Challenge to see that you find problems, find ways to find solutions, research, innovate and bring solutions.
The Government of India wants to promote technology by giving special awards to solve our problems.
My dear countrymen, some time ago we were worried about famine and these days it is also enjoying rains and the news of floods is also coming up.
The State Government and the Central Government together are making great efforts to help the flood victims.
In spite of some difficulties due to rain, every mind, every human heart gets drenched because there is rain at the centre of our entire economic activity, it is cultivated.
Sometimes such a disease comes that we regret the whole life.
Enguie can be avoided.
Pay attention to some hygiene, be careful and try to stay safe, pay special attention to the children and this is not the case that such a disease occurs in the poor habitation, it is not the case of the enzyme.
Anguage comes first in a happy and prosperous area and therefore we understand it.
You must have seen the advertisement on TV, but sometimes we are indifferent to the action taken on it.
The government, the hospitals, the doctors, they will do their work, but we too, in our home, in our area, in our family, should not enter the enzyme and be careful about not getting any water-related illness.
I would like to draw your attention to another problem, my dear countrymen.
Life has become so life-threatening that we have become so busy that we do not have time to think for ourselves.
If you get sick, then you feel better and recover quickly and therefore someone takes antibiotics and puts it in the body.
Immediate relief can be obtained from this disease, but my dear countrymen, the habit of taking antibiotics on these paths can create a very serious crisis.
Maybe you will get some relief for a while, but without the advice of the doctors, we should stop taking antibiotics.
I urge you to complete the course of the day the doctor has asked you to take.
The bacteria that spread TB and malaria are transforming themselves at a rapid pace that does not affect medicines.
It is called antibiotics in the medical language and therefore it is equally important to follow the rules of how to use antibiotics.
When it comes to health, I want to add one more thing.
In our country, the mothers who are in pregnancy, sometimes worry about their lives.
Every year about 3 crore women in our country have pregnancy, but some mothers die at the time of delivery, sometimes the mother dies, sometimes the child dies, and sometimes both the child and the mother die.
It is fine that in the last decade there has been a decrease in the rate of untimely death of the mother, but still a large number of pregnant mothers can not save lives.
Lack of blood during or after pregnancy, child-related infection, high BP - which problem can destroy his life.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign in the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Under this campaign, on the 9th of every month, all pregnant women will be tested free of cost at the government health centres.
The life of both mother and child can be saved and I am particularly concerned about the geneticist that you cant serve these poor mothers on the 9th of the month free of cost.
Can my doctor, brother and sister not apply for this work for the poor for twelve days in a year
I'm sure you'll get involved.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is concerned about climate change, global warming and the environment.
It is discussed collectively in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
Even in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna discusses the tree, worrying about the tree in the field of war also means that how much it will be important, we can guess.
Lord Krishna in the Gita says - Ashwathah: Sarvavrikshana i.e. in all the trees I am peepal.
It has been said in the Shukracharya policy - Nasti radish - There is no such plant, which does not have any medicinal properties.
The one who donates the tree, he also wires it in the world like a tree child.
Therefore, parents who wish for their welfare should plant good trees and follow them like their children.
Be it our Shastras-Geetas, Shankaracharyas policy, Mahabharats Disciplinary Festival, there are some people in todays generation who live up to these ideals.
A few days ago, an example of Sonal, a daughter of Pune, came to my mind.
It is said in the Mahabharat Disciplinary Celebrations and not in the Tree, the tree fulfills the responsibilities of a child, Sonal has taken the responsibility of fulfilling not only the wishes of his parents but also of the society.
Khandu Maruti Mahatre, a farmer of Narayanpur village in Junnar taluka of Pune in Maharashtra, married his grandson Sonal in a very inspiring way.
Such a scene that touched the mind was in that picture.
Sonal, who himself is an agricultural graduate, this idea came to him and presented mango plantations at the wedding. See, the love of nature has been revealed in the best way.
In a way, Sonal's marriage has become an immortal saga of love.I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Shri Mahatre Ji for this innovative effort.
And many people do such experiments.
I remember, when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, when a large number of pilgrims visit the temple of Ambaji during the month of Bhadra, then once a social worker organization decided that those who come to the temple will plant a plant in Prasad and they will tell them that this plant will grow up in their village and will continue to bless you.
I repeatedly tell the farmer brothers that we waste our land by fencing on the banks of our fields, why not we cultivate timber in the place of that fence.
Today, in order to make India a house, in order to make it a country, billions and trillions of timber have to be brought from abroad.
If we plant such trees on the banks of our farm that can be used for irrigation and housing, then after 15-20 years of the government's permission you can also cut them and sell them. You can also become a new source of income and you can also avoid importing timber.
In the past, several states have run a lot of campaigns using this weather, the Government of India has just passed an AMPA law, due to which more than 40 thousand crore people will go to the states for plantation.
I am told that the Maharashtra government has planted nearly 1.25 crore plants in the entire state on July 1 and next year they have pledged to plant 3 crore plants.
The government created a mass movement.
Rajasthan has organized such a big forest festival and has pledged to plant 25 lakh saplings.
Twenty-five lakh plants in Rajasthan are not small.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they know how big the effort has been taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its green cover city percentage by 2029.
There is a very bright tradition of Van Mahotsav in Gujarat too.
This year, Gujarat has taken up many such projects like Amer Forest, Ekta Van, Shaheed Van-Dhan as Van Mahotsav and launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I am unable to mention all the states, but deserve to be congratulated.
My dear countrymen, I have had the opportunity to visit South Africa recently.
This was my first visit and when there is a foreign trip, there is diplomacy, trade talks, security talks, there are many MoUs, all these things have to happen.
But for me, the journey to South Africa was in a way a pilgrimage.
When we remember South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness are heard in the world, then the faces of Gandhi and Mandela appear before us.
During my visit to South Africa, I visited Phoni Settlement and the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
The train that Mahatma Gandhi had travelled and the train that had planted for making Mohandas a Mahatma Gandhi, I also had the good fortune of visiting the Piitreburg Station.
But what I want to tell you, this time I got the opportunity to meet those great men who had spent their youth for equality and equal opportunity.
They fought shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela in the fight for twenty-two and twenty-two years.
In a way, he had sacrificed his entire youth and I have had the privilege of visiting close friends of Nelson Mandela, Ahmed Kathda, Mr. Lalu Chiba, Mr. George Bezos, Ronnie Kasarils.
The original Indians, but wherever they went, they became the ones who lived among them.
Even after doing such a great penance on his face, it was not visible anywhere.
In a way, a sense of duty was seen in the Gita as a sign of duty.
I will always remember that meeting - equality and equal opportunity.
There can be no bigger mantra for any society and government.
These are the paths that lead us towards a bright future.
Want a good future for children.
Priority will be different, but the path is the same and that path is development, equality, opportunity, equality and equanimity.
Let us take pride in these Indians who have fulfilled the basic mantras of our life in South Africa.
As a woman, I'm sorry for her family.
And as technology is playing a very big role in the economic system, the people who abuse it also come to the ground.
You too must be confused and write letters to you in such a great way, just like it seems, right letter.
Any officer who makes a letter pad, sends your credit card number and debit card number and your account becomes empty through technology.
This is a fraud of new methods, this is a digital fraud.
I believe that this love should be avoided and should be alert and if such false statements come, then by sharing it with your friends, you should make them a little aware.
I would like that Shilpi Verma has brought good things to my mind and you must have experienced it all but you might not have seen it so seriously but I feel that there is a need to look at it.
My dear countrymen, these days the Parliament session is going on, and during the Parliament session, I also get the opportunity to meet a lot of people of the country.
But these days I had a pleasant experience.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
Art paintings have been done at the station.
Not only this, he searched and collected the plastic bottles or oil cans in the village which are lying in the same garbage and they planted the soil and planted it in them and they produced electrical Gardens.
And this vertical garden has been converted into plastic bottles towards the railway station and in a way it has been converted into a new one.
If you ever visit Aligarh, you will definitely see the station.
These days I am getting news from several railway stations of India that the local people are identifying their areas on the railway station walls through their art.
Feeling a newness.
This is an example of what kind of change can be brought about through public participation.
Congratulations to all those who have worked like this in the country and my colleagues in Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with the rainy season, there is an abundance of festivals in our country.
Festivals will be celebrated in temples, in places of worship and you will also be associated with festivals outside your homes as well.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a celebration of our special importance.
Just like in the previous year, on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, can you not offer Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of your country
Just imagine, give such a gift to the sister who really protects her in life.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in independent India.
75 years of uit India and 70 years of India's independence can give us new inspiration, new zeal, new zeal and an opportunity to pledge for doing something for the country.
The entire country should be painted in the colors of the freedom fighters, once again feel the joy of independence all around.
This atmosphere should be created by all of us and the festival of independence should not be a government programme, it should be of the countrymen.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope that you too will do something good related to the inspiration of patriotism.
Send the photo of him on the NarendraModi app.
Create an environment in the country.
Dear fellow citizens, On the 15th of August, I had the privilege of talking to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
There will be some things in your mind, which you would like that your talk should be kept as intense from the Red Fort.
I invite you, the ideas that come to your mind, which think that as your representative, as your Prime Servant, I should tell you this thing from the Red Fort, you must write to me and send it.
What can be said from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it is about 1.25 billion people.
I invite you, let us remember the virtues of our freedom fighters, the great men who spent their lives for India and let us move forward with our resolve to do something for the country.
Greetings to all fellow citizens.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
I am also grateful to AIR for making a successful effort to present this mind in regional languages at 8.00 pm.
And I am also happy that those who listen to me later convey their feelings to me through the letter, through the telephone, through mygov website, through the Narendra Modi App.
Many of your things help me in the work of the government.
How active the government should be in terms of public interest, how primary the public interest should be. My interaction with you for these things is very useful.
I hope that you will be more active and will strengthen the democracy with public participation.
The heat continues to grow.
The maximum part of the country is experiencing the fierce heat of the heat.
Mercury is touching the sky.
Due to the environment, these problems are increasing.
The forests were reduced, trees were cut down, and in a way, mankind had destroyed nature and paved the way for their own destruction.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
There are discussions and concerns for the environment around the world.
This time, on the occasion of World Environment Day, United Nations has put the theme of 'ero Tolerance for Wild Life'.
It will be discussed, but we have to discuss about trees and plants, we have to discuss water as well, how to increase our forest cover.
Because you must have seen, in the past, Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir - in the lap of the Himalayas, there was a fire in the forests.
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha - I could have held a meeting with all the drought affected states, but I did not do so.
What the states have to say, they heard closely.
Generally, how much money was spent by the government, how much money was spent by the government of India and how much was spent - it does not matter much more closely.
It was also surprising for the officers of the Government of India that many states have made great efforts in terms of water, environment, drought for animals, for affected people and in a way in every corner of the country, even if there is a government of any party, it was felt that what are the workable solutions, what are the permanent solutions to deal with this problem in the long run.
In a way, it was also a learning experience for me and I have told my Policy Commission that there should be some work on the best practices that should be taken up in all the states.
Some states, especially Andhra, Gujarat have made extensive use of technology.
I would like to further carry the special successful efforts of the States through the NITI Aayog to us and the States.
Public participation is the basis of a huge success in solving such problems.
As we go to the temple, give some prasad and even a little prasad falls, then there is irritation in the mind.
Pick him up and apologize to God five times.
This water is also the offering of God.
If a drop is also wasted, then we should suffer.
And that is why water conservation is equally important and water irrigation is equally important and that is why per drop-more crop, micro-irrigation and at least water crop.
Now it is a matter of great happiness that in many states our sugarcane farmers are also using micro-irrigation, some are using drip-irrigation, some are using sprinkler.
While I was sitting with the states, some states have also successfully used drip-irrigation for cultivation of crops and due to which their yield has also increased, water has also been reduced and wages have also been reduced.
When I heard from these states, there are several states that have taken huge targets, especially in Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
Three states have done a lot of work in the area of drip irrigation and they have tried to add two to three lakh hectares of micro-irrigation every year.
If this campaign is going on in all the states, then agriculture will also benefit a lot and water will also be stored.
Our brothers from Telangana have tried to make the best use of Godavari and Krishna river water through Mission Bhagirathi.
Andhra Pradesh has also tried to use technology and ground water recharge in the Niru Pragati Mission.
People are sweating and giving money in the mass movement that Maharashtra has created.
I can feel that this movement will really be of great help to save Maharashtra from the future crisis.
Chhattisgarh has launched Loksuraj - Jalsuraj campaign.
Madhya Pradesh has planned the Balram Talab - approximately 22 thousand ponds these are not small figures .
Rajasthan and Gujarat, where there are more old Bavadis, have started a massive campaign to revive them in the form of a Jalmandir.
Rajasthan has launched the Chief Minister's water-swavalamban campaign.
Jharkhand is a wild area, but there are some areas where there is a problem of water.
He has launched a massive campaign of 'Heck Cam'.
They have tried to stop the water.
Some states have launched a campaign to stop ten-ten, twenty-two kilometers of water by making small dams in the rivers.
This is a very pleasant experience.
I also tell the countrymen that this June, July, August, September - let us decide that even a drop of water will not be wasted.
And this is not just a matter of farmers
This village, the poor, the laborers, the farmers, the urban, the rural, the rich and the poor is a subject related to everyone. And that is why when the rainy season is coming, water should be our priority and this time when we celebrate Diwali then enjoy how much water we have saved, how much water we have stopped.
You see, our happiness will increase manifold.
How precious is this treasure given by God ?
The media has given a detailed account of the problem of water in the past.
I hope that the media should guide the people in the direction of saving water, run a campaign and become a partner in the media for ever-widening the crisis of water. I invite them too.
My dear countrymen, we have to make a modern India.
We have to make a transparent India.
If we want to bring many systems in a uniform way from one corner to the other in India then our old habits will also have to be changed a bit.
Today, I want to touch upon a subject on which if you help me, we can move forward successfully in that direction.
If you want salt, give so much vegetable in return.
The business used to run from the barter system itself.
But now the time has changed.
The whole world is moving towards cashless society.
We can also get the money and also pay the money through the electronic technology system.
You can buy things, even pay the bill.
And there will never be any question of the theft of the wallet from the pocket.
There will not be any concern for keeping an account, but there will be an automatic account.
The beginning will look a little difficult, but once you get used to it, this system will become easier.
And this is the possibility because the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country that we have launched the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana these days.
So, we can move towards this cashless society by coordinating with Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile (JAM), JAM.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given along with the Jan-Dhan account.
In the coming days, this card is going to be useful in terms of both credit and debit.
There is no need to withdraw money from the pocket, count it.
There is no need to walk together.
How to pay money through a UPSC in whatever initiatives have been taken by the Government of India
It will be very easy to transmit money through your mobile phone and it is a matter of happiness that N.P.I.
In a way, the bank has worked in that direction at your doorstep.
Post Offices have also been made aware of banking services.
If we learn to use these systems and inculcate the habit then we will not need this currency, we will not need notes, we will not need money, business will run automatically and due to this there will be a transparency.
You see, if we start once we will move forward with a lot of ease.
Twenty years ago, who had thought that so many mobile phones would be in our hands
Slowly got used to, now you can not live without it.
Maybe this cashless society also takes the same shape, but it will be better if it happens in less time.
My dear countrymen, whenever sports is played for Olympics, and when sports is started, we sit back in the Sir Pataka. How far behind in the Gold Medal, we have not got silver, we have not got it, we are not running with brown.
To encourage and encourage our players who are going for Rio Olympics, everyone has their own way to encourage them.
Some songs, some cartoons, some greetings, some may some encourage a game, but the whole country should create a very positive atmosphere for our players.
The result that will come - will come.
It becomes a great strength in itself. When a player feels that 1.25 billion people are standing with him, he gets a boost.
I had talked about under-17 World Cup and the suggestions that came to me from all over the country and these days I have seen that an atmosphere of football has started appearing all over the country.
Many people are making their own teams with initiatives.
I have received thousands of suggestions on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
There may not be a lot of people playing, but the interest of thousands and lakhs of youngsters in the country is so much in sports, it was a pleasant experience for me in itself.
We all know the love for cricket and India, but I have seen that this affection for football also indicates a very pleasant future in itself.
So, in the days to come, we will create an atmosphere of excitement and enthusiasm for all our players, who are eligible for Rio Olympics.
Do not let everything be tested by the test of victory and defeat.
With the sportsman spirit, India has made its mark in the world.
I appeal to the countrymen that we should also do something to create an atmosphere of enthusiasm and excitement towards our sports friends.
New results are coming from somewhere or the other for the last eight-ten days.
I am talking about those students who have worked hard for the entire year, who have given the results after 10th or 12th standard.
It is clear that our daughters are showing strength.
It's a pleasure.
My best wishes and congratulations to those who have succeeded in these results.
Once again I would like to tell those who have not been able to succeed that there is a lot to do in life.
If there is no result as per our wish, no life gets stuck.
Should live with faith, should move ahead with faith.
But a new kind of question has come to me and I had never thought about this thing in the same way.
But I was surprised that everyone in the house told me this thing: man, four marks would come up more and you would get 90 per cent.
That is, my family and my friend, my teacher - no one was happy with my 89.33 percent marks.
Everyone was telling me, man, you had 90 per cent for four marks.
Now I cant understand how to handle such a situation.
Is this everything in life?
Was it not good what I did
Did I fall short?
I do not know, there is a burden on my mind.
Gaurav, I have read your letter with great care and I think, perhaps this pain will not only be for you, it will be for millions and millions of students like you, because an atmosphere has been created that instead of being content with it, finding dissatisfaction with it is another form of negativity.
We can never take the society towards satisfaction by finding dissatisfaction with everything.
It would have been better if your family, your friends and friends had appreciated your 89.33 per cent then you would have decided to do more on your own.
I have also written Santosh Giri Goswami from Jodhpur. He has written almost the same way.
They say that people around me are not accepting our results.
I do not fully remember the poem, but long ago I had read it, some poet wrote that I made a picture of pain on life's canvas.
I wish that even a single viewer on my picture of this pain would have shed tears.
This was the words of this poem, I do not remember it now, but it is a poem of a long time ago, but this was the feeling.
You become a burden to meet the expectations of the people.
I will only tell you that in such a situation you do not lose your balance.
Everyone expresses his expectations, listen to them, but remain firm on your point of view and try to do something better.
But you will not be satisfied with what you have got, then you will never be able to build a new building.
The strong foundation of success is the basis of big success.
The dissatisfaction created out of success can not be made a ladder to success. It becomes a guarantee of failure.
But I would like to say this thing more to my neighbors and parents and friends that you please do not impose your expectations on them by graciously supporting your children.
And friends, if they failed in life, would their lives stop
Those who can never produce good marks in the gym only move ahead in sports, move ahead in music, move ahead in the art work, and move ahead in the business.
God has given a wonderful mode to everyone.
Just recognize your inner strength, emphasize on it, you will come forward.
And it happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard the instrument named Santoor.
There was a time when the Santoor instrument was associated with the folk music in the valley of Kashmir.
But there was a Pandit Shiv Kumar, who touched him and today made an important instrument of the world.
Shehnai - Shehnai was in a limited space in the entire area of our music.
Most of the princely states used to have a place on the gates of the court.
But when Ustad Bismillah Khan touched the clarinet, today the world has become the best instrument, its identity has become.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I see that the expenditure incurred on the health of our poor families also disrupts the way of life.
And it is true that the cost of not getting sick is very low, but the cost of getting healthy after getting sick is very high.
Why should we not live such a life, so that there is no economic burden on the family and not the disease.
One is the biggest basis for saving cleanliness from disease.
If one can do the greatest service to the poor, then one can do cleanliness.
And the second thing that I constantly urge is Yoga.
Some people also call him Yoga.
21st June is International Yoga Day.
There is an attraction, a reverence for Yoga all over the world and the world has accepted it.
Our ancestors have given us a precious gift that we have given to the world.
The world suffering from stress gives the strength to live a balanced life.
Prevention is better than cure, being healthy, being balanced, being rich in strong will power, living a life full of immense self-confidence and concentration in every work, these are natural achievements.
June 21 - Yoga Day is not just an event, its scope should increase, it should become a place in the lives of every person, every person should spend 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes for yoga in his daily routine.
And for this, 21st June Yoga Day inspires us.
And sometimes the collective environment causes a change in the life of a person.
See that, get them done in your village, get them done in your neighborhood, get them done in your city, in your school, in the institute and in even offices.
Start one month from now, see, you will become a partner on June 21.
I have often read that in many offices, yoga and Pranayama are organized in the morning at regular intervals, so the efficiency of the entire office increases so much, the culture of the entire office changes and the environment changes.
You too must join that day, the whole world is going to do yoga.
I urge you not to be left behind.
Staying healthy is very important for making India healthy.
My dear countrymen, I constantly connect with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Dear fellow citizens, Namaskar again to all of you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hello.
Talk of mind, April 2016
Please change this situation. Ravi ji has expressed great anger, but I believe that perhaps he is not angry with me, he is angry at the situation.You will remember that the former President of India, Dr.
P.
J.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that only positive news should be printed on the first page of the newspaper, he used to say this continuously. A few days ago a newspaper had written a letter to me. He had said that we have decided that on Monday we will not give any negative news, only positive news. These days I have seen, some T.
This time also I have seen that there are many letters, comments phone calls, there are many stories, suggestions, inspiration everybody wants to do something or the other and wants to say something or the other. There is a lot of these things that I would like to sum up, but there is a time limit, so I do not even get the same thing.
You will remember the last time I had discussed about a book on the stories of Premchand ji and we had decided to share some of the things with everyone through the NarendraModi App.
I saw that a large number of people have shared information about a variety of books .
I liked that people are discussing about the books written on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business, life history and so on.
Some people have also advised me to talk about many more books .
But one thing I have to admit is that I can ' t afford to spend too much time reading books
But there is an advantage that whatever you write and send, I get the opportunity to know about many books.
But with the experience of the last one month, I feel that we have to move forward.
Why not make an appointment book corner on the NarendraModi App and whenever we read a new book, write about it there, discuss it and you can name a good name for this book corner of ours
Friends, it seems as if I had touched upon the subject of water conservation - Mann Ki Baat, but perhaps today I feel that water conservation was a subject that touched your heart even before I said it was the favorite subject of the common man.
And I feel that these days the hearts of India have been shaken by the issue of water .
With regard to water conservation, there are many Vidyas and effective efforts in the country.
People have shared information about traditional methods
Media has launched several innovative campaigns on water conservation
Be it the government, the NGOs - are doing something or the other at the war level
Seeing the power of collectiveness, the mind is feeling very good, it is very satisfied.
The villagers donated their labour and worked towards giving a certain direction to the waterfall from the mountains.
That too pure native way
This not only stops soil erosion and crop waste, but fields are also getting water
You will be happy to know that the beautiful state of North East Meghalaya has become the first state in the country to have formulated its water policy and water policy.
I congratulate the government there .
In Haryana, the cultivation of those crops which require less water and there is no loss to the farmer too.
I would especially like to congratulate the Government of Haryana for communicating with the farmers, motivating them to go beyond traditional farming and for crops with less water.
Now is the time for festivals
Many fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals .
Why not use these fairs for water conservation
Fairs are attended by people from all sections of society .
In these fairs, we can effectively convey the message of water conservation, exhibitions, street plays, festivals as well as the message of water conservation.
Friends, Some of the things in life fill us with enthusiasm and specially the achievements of the children, their actions and actions give us a new energy. And so today I want to talk about some children, and these children are Nidhi Baipotu, Monish Joshi, Debashish Rawat, Tanus Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aronyatesh Ganguly and Hritik Ala-Manda.
What I'll tell you about them will be filled with pride and passion.
We all know that cancer is a word that scares the whole world
It seems, standing at the entrance of death, but all these ten children, in the battle of their life, have not only defeated the deadly disease like cancer, cancer, but have illuminated the name of India in the whole world through their actions.
In sports, we often see that players form champions after winning tournaments or having a medal, but this was a rare opportunity, where they were champions before they took part in the Games, and that too in the battle of life.
Actually, this month, World Children's Winners Games were organized in Moscow.
This is such a unique sports tour in which those who have come out of cancer in their lives take part.
Competitions like Shooting, Hess, Swimming, Running, Football and Table Tennis were organized in this competition.
All these ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament
Some of these players won medals in more than one game
In fact, in terms of space, 2019 has been a very good year for India
Our scientists had launched the A-Sat in March and after that there was not much discussion about the big and important news like A-Sat at that time during the Chandrayaan-2 elections.
While we got the ability to kill the satellite three to a hundred kilometers away from the A-Sat missile, in just three minutes.
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve this feat. And now, on 22nd July, the whole country proudly saw how Chandrayaan-2 took his steps towards space from Sriharikota.
Pictures of the launch of Chandrayaan-2 have filled the countrymen with pride and zeal.
Chandrayaan-2, this mission is special in many ways
Chandrayaan-2 will further clarify our understanding of the moon
This will give us more detailed information about the moon, but if you ask me what two major lessons I have received from Chandrayaan-2, I will say, these two are air and air, that is, faith and fearlessness.
We should trust our talent and capacity, believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is completely Indian
It's Indian from Heart and Spirit
is a completely indigenous mission
This mission has once again proved that when there is something new in the new field, VIDEO
The way our scientists have launched Chandrayaan-2 by correcting all the technical issues day and night in record time, it is unprecedented in itself.
The whole world saw this great penance of scientists
We all should be proud of it and despite the disruption they did not change the time they reached , many wonder .
We also have to face temporary set backs in our lives, but always remember that we have the strength to overcome them.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share information about competition, competition with young friends of the country and invite young women of the country for a quiz competition.
I request my young friends, students, to participate in this quiz competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with your participation.
I specially urge schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers and teachers, to work hard to make their school victorious
For these winning students, it will be a historic event in their lives, but for this, you have to take part in the quiz competition, you have to get the highest marks, you have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have observed one thing.
Our Mann Ki Baat has given momentum to the Swachhata Abhiyan from time to time and similarly the efforts made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat .
The journey that started five years ago today, with the participation of the people, is setting new standards of cleanliness.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal position in cleanliness but the way we have achieved success in the cleanliness campaign from public places, it is the strength of the resolve of 1.25 billion Indians, but we are not going to stop there.
This movement has now moved from cleanliness to beauty .
Just a few days ago, I was watching the story of Mr. Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and left his job in the US and returned to serve Mother Bharti
He took the lead in making Delhi not only clean but also beautiful
He started with his team with the dustbins of Lodhi Garden
Through the street art, many areas of Delhi were decorated with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of the Over Bridge and the school to the slums, when they started to energize their skills, people went on getting together and in a way the process started.
You will remember how during Kumbh, Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings.
There may not be any voice in the colors and lines, but the message of the rainbow that comes from these pictures is more effective than thousands of words and we also feel this in the beauty of the cleanliness campaign.
It is very important for us that the culture of making Waste to Wealth develop in our society .
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making garbage from garbage
My dear countrymen, in the past, I have read a very interesting comment on MyGov.
This commitment was from Mohammed Aslam, brother of Shopian of Jammu and Kashmir
He wrote that it is good to listen to the program of mind
I am happy to share that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in my State of Jammu and Kashmir.
This program was organized in June
I think such programmes should be held every three months .
At the same time, there should be provision for online monitoring of the program.
In my view, this was the first of its kind, in which the public interacted directly with the government.
After reading this message from Bhai Muhammad Aslam ji, after reading this message, my eagerness to know about the Back to Village Programme increased and when I went in detail about this, I felt that the whole country should also know about it.
This program shows how desperate the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development, how enthusiastic they are
In this program, for the first time, the senior officials reached the villages directly. The officers who had never seen the villagers themselves went to their doorsteps to understand the obstacles in development and to solve the problems.
These programs went on throughout the week and in all the about four and a half thousand panchayats in the state government officials gave detailed information to the villagers about government schemes and programs .
How can Panchayats be strengthened ?
How can their income be increased ?
How can their services affect the life of the common man ? The villagers also spoke openly about their problems .
Friends, This program was not a government arrangement that the officers returned after visiting the village throughout the day. But this time the officers spent two days and one night in the panchayat and they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
Many more things were also included to make this program intersting
Sports competition for children under Khelo India
The same Sports Kits, job cards of MNREGA and SC / ST certificates were also distributed
People of Kashmir became openly partner in this festival of development
The joy of the fact is that the Back to Village program was organized in such remote villages, where the government officials had to travel on foot for one day, one and a half days by climbing the hills through inaccessible roads.
Many officers were so overwhelmed by their reception that they stayed in villages for more than two days .
Organizing Gram Sabhas in these areas, participation of a large number of people in it and preparing plans for themselves, all this is very pleasant.
New resolution, new zeal and great results
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, want to create obstacles, they can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandra, honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented the glory of the month of Sawan in one of his poems in this way.
Throughout India people of different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Savan in their own way .
In this season whenever we look around us , it seems as if the earth has covered the green sheet .
All around, a new energy begins to communicate
In this holy month, many devotees visit Kawand Yatra and Amarnath Yatra, while many people fast regularly and eagerly wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami.
During this time the festival of Raksha Bandhan is also a symbol of the love of brother and sister.
When you are talking about the month of Savan, you will be very happy to know that this time more devotees have joined the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave since July 1.
More than the number of pilgrims involved in this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, this time it has joined in just 28 days.
For the success of Amarnath Yatra, I especially want to praise the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality.
Those who return from the journey, they are convinced of the warmth and intimacy of the people of the state.
All these things are going to be very beneficial for tourism in the future .
I am told that in Uttarakhand since the start of Chardham Yatra this year, more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within a month and a half.
After the horrific disaster in 2013, for the first time, such a record number of pilgrims have arrived there.
I appeal to all of you that you must visit those parts of the country whose beauty is seen only during monsoons.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of the people of our country, there can be no greater teacher than tourism and travel.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and vibrant month of Savan, convey new energy, new hope and new hope to all of you
In the same way, the month of August comes in the memory of uit India .
I would like you to make some special preparations on August 15 to find a new way to celebrate this festival of independence.
On the other hand, this is the time when heavy rains are happening in many parts of the country.
By the way, when we look at T, only one aspect of rain shows floods, filled water, traffic jams
The second picture of the monsoon in which our farmer, chirping birds, flowing waterfalls, covered with greenery, to see this, you will have to go out with your family yourself.
Rains, freshness and happiness bring both with them, I wish that this monsoon always fills you with happiness
My dear countrymen, many greetings to all of you
Today, the people of the Christian community are celebrating Easter across the world.
I convey my best wishes to all the people of Easter.
And for some people, it will also be a criterion that on the one hand you will find a match between India and Australia and on the other you will probably wait for a match between India and Australia.
In the past, India has won two best matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
A great moment is visible.
Today, when Australia and India are going to play, I convey my best wishes to the players of both the teams.
65 per cent of the population is young and we are lost in the world of sports. This thing is not possible.
Time is the era of a new revolution in sports.
24 teams from all over the world are coming to play in India.
In 1951, 1962, India won the Gold Medal in the Asian Games and in 1956 India was ranked fourth in the Olympic Games.
Unfortunately, over the past few decades, we have been moving on to the lowest level, moving backwards, falling, and falling.
Totalball is an opportunity. Can you give me your suggestions?
I consider it a great opportunity to brand India globally.
I consider it an opportunity to identify the youth power of India and what they have achieved in the middle of a match, not in that sense.
With the preparation of this host, we can cherish our strength and might as well and we can brand India as well.
Can you send me your suggestions on NarendraModiApp, please?
My dear students, during the holidays, you must have thought of tourism.
Some people go out of their states.
Last time also, I had urged you people to upload photos from wherever you go.
People, language and food do not know what to see.
India is full of diversity.
Once you get out to see, you will be watching all your life, you will keep watching
I am fortunate that I got the opportunity to travel a lot.
When I was not the Chief Minister, I was not the Prime Minister and I was a very young person like you.
I consider it a good sign.
It gives an opportunity to see something new in itself.
I hope that when you visit these holidays, can you make some contribution in cleanliness
Maybe it's not happening in a very scientific way, but it's happening.
Can you also emphasize upon cleanliness as a tourist destination
I believe my youth will definitely help me in this.
India is far behind in terms of tourism as compared to the world.
But if we 1.25 billion Indians decide that we have to strengthen our tourism then we can attract the world.
A large part of the world tourism can attract us and provide employment opportunities to crores of youth of our country.
Be it the government, institutions, society, citizens, all of us together have done this.
Let us try to do something in that direction.
My young friends, let's go on holiday like this. I do not like this.
You also think in this direction.
Will you let your holidays, the important year of your life and its important time go like this
I have an idea to think of you.
Can you make a pledge to add a new thing to your personality, a skill in holidays
If you do not swim, you can resolve on holidays, I learn to swim, I do not have to ride a bicycle, then decide on holidays, I will ride a bicycle.
Even today I type the computer with two fingers, so do I learn typing?
How many skills do we have for the development of our personality?
Why not learn him?
Why not remove some of our shortcomings?
Why don ' t we increase our powers ?
Now think about it and someone needs a big class, a trainer, a big eye, a big budget is not needed.
Suppose you in your neighborhood too, you decide that I will make the best of the waste.
Look at something and start making it from it.
Hello, Prime Minister, you said during the last summer holidays that even the birds get hot, so we should keep a pot in water and keep it in our balcony or on the terrace, so that the birds come and drink water.
I did this work and I enjoyed it, on this pretext I became friends with a lot of birds.
I request you to repeat this task back in Mann Ki Baat.
And I was not in my mind that today I would say something on this subject but that Abhi reminded me that last year I had prepared a clay pot for birds outside the house.
My dear countrymen, I wish to express my gratitude to A.B. Chaturvedi, a child.
He called me and remembered a good job.
Abhi told me that she has been doing this work for a year and many of her birds have become her friends.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi, loved the birds very much.
He wrote in his poem - Do not let you go away, fill the courtyard with donations and fill the hod we will fill the sweet and sweet cold water.
Let us also do this thing of Mahadevi ji.
I also congratulate Abhi and express my gratitude that you have reminded me of very important things.
Shilpa Kuke from Mysore, she has kept a very sensitive issue for all of us.
They have said that those who sell milk near our house come, those who sell newspapers and postmans come.
Sometimes those who sell a vessel pass through it, those who sell clothes pass through it.
Have we ever asked them for water in the summer days?
Have we ever met him with water
Shilpa I am extremely grateful to you people that you have kept the sensitive subject in a very simple manner.
It is true that this thing is a small thing but if the postman comes to the house in the midst of the heat then how good it will be for him to drink water.
Well, this is the nature in India.
But Shilpa, I am grateful that you have served these things.
What is the situation in the market, what is the situation in the mandis, what is the trend of good crop these days, what are the medicines suitable
Moreover, there is a button in it that connects you directly with agricultural scientists and with experts.
If you put any of your questions in front of him then he replies, explain it to you.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
Try it, do you have anything to do with it
And even if there is some deficiency then you should also complain to me.
But we will also have to think about what will happen without water.
Is this the time when water supply in our ponds and ponds is available, if there is garbage or some damage to it then water supply is stopped and due to this the water collection is gradually decreasing.
Can we once again dig up those old places and prepare them for more water conservation by cleaning them
If the amount of water will be saved in the first rain, if the water is saved, the ponds are filled, our river basins are filled, then if the rain comes back then our loss will be reduced.
This time you would have noticed that you have taken the initiative to construct 5 lakh ponds and farm ponds.
MNREGA has also been emphasized for creating sewage treatment facilities.
There will be several such villages in the country, there will be many such progressive farmers, there will be many such conscious citizens who have done this work.
But still more needs to be done.
I welcome it.
We are the sons of Mother Earth. How can we see our Mother Earth sick
This is the case with the fertilizer, however good it may be, but if we use the fertilizer in excess of the quantity then it will become a cause of waste.
The more water will be saved the more it will benefit the farmers the more it will save their lives.
My dear countrymen, World Health Day is on the 7th of April and this time the world has focused on World Health Day on this theme, defeat diabetes.
Diabetes is such a host that he is eager to host every disease.
Once the diabetes has penetrated, a lot of illness behind it, the Kurupi guests enter their home and body.
It is said that in 2014 there were about six and a half million diabetic patients in India.
The cause of 3 deaths is said to be diabetes.
And there are two types of diabetes, one is of type-1, type-2, type-1, hereditary, parents and so the child is born.
And because of Type-II habits, due to age, due to obesity.
The world is worried about diabetes, so on the 7th of this month, it has been kept in the World Health Day.
We all know that our life style is the biggest reason for that.
Physical labor is decreasing.
Sweat is not the name of sweat, it is not happening.
Can we take some inspiration from the 7th and do something to defeat diabetes in our personal life
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we dont hesitate in getting medical check-up done.
And after a very bad situation, it comes to the notice of me that I had very old diabtes.
The world celebrated TB Day on March 24.
We know that when I was young, I was afraid to hear the name of TB.
But there is a lot of TB patients in comparison to the world.
This means that this disease is such that it can be tested soon.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is being done in this direction.
You should check once.
And this disease can go away.
Just get the right treatment and continue treatment till the disease is destroyed.
I would urge you that whether it is TB or diabetes, we have to defeat it.
India has to get rid of these diseases.
But this is not done by the government, the doctor, the medicine until you do it.
And that is why today I urge my countrymen to defeat diabetes and we should get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, there are many important occasions in the month of April, especially the birthday of Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambedkar on the 14th of April.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country throughout the year.
We are constantly trying to develop these five pilgrimages.
I am fortunate that on 14th April this year, I have got the opportunity to visit Mau, the birthplace of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot to become a good citizen.
We can pay a great tribute to them by following that path and becoming a good citizen.
In a few days, Vikram Samvat will start.
Celebrated separately in different states.
Best wishes to everyone for my New Year.
You can listen at your own time.
You can listen to your mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you.
The youth of India takes time to get information about it, watch it on TV.
Probably there will not be any district of India where I have not got the opportunity to visit.
Like before, they dont go on the same route, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
And tourism has a lot of potential for employment.
And the identity of your personality will increase so much that your self-confidence will increase so much.
It may be a matter of concern in your colleagues.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
If you download this farmer's facility through the app in your mobile phone, then you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and weather in your palm.
My farmer brothers and sisters, It has been an opportunity for the rest of the country for summer holidays, but it becomes an opportunity for the farmers to sweat even more.
He waits for the rain and before waiting, the farmer is alive to prepare his field so that he does not want to waste even a drop of rain.
For the farmer, the time for the start of a farmer's season is very important.
It's the same food, isn't it?
You must worry about him.
But when TB and death were added, we were afraid but now we have become careless about TB.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
You might be listening to my mind on radio, but the mind would be wondering that children's exams are starting, some people's 10th-twelfth exams are starting on March 1.
So the same thing will happen in your mind too.
I also want to join you in this journey of yours.
I am equally concerned that you are concerned about the well-being of your children.
But if we change the way we look at the exam and look at the exam then perhaps we will be free from worry.
I had said in the last episode of my mind that you must send me your experiences, your suggestions on the NarendraModiApp.
I am glad that the teachers, very successful students who have been in the career, have sent me a lot of things by writing to me.
Secondly, thousands of things came to my mind that perhaps this is a very important topic.
However, most of the time, we have restricted the topic of e-NAM to the school premises or to the family or to the students.
The suggestions made on my app seems to be very big and there should be continuous discussion on these issues of students across the country.
Today, I want to talk to my parents, examinees and their teachers especially in this matter of my mind.
I have heard what I have read, which I have been told, I will also tell some things from it.
I will add whatever I think.
But I believe that these 25-30 minutes will be very useful for the students who want to give their exams.
I would like to tell you the message that India's youth have towards whom they are proud India's Bharat Ratna Shri Sachin Tendulkar, they have sent me: - Namaste, I am speaking Sachin Tendulkar.
I know that exams are about to start in a few days.
Many of you will also be tensed.
I have only one message to you that your parents, your teachers, the rest of your family members, friends will do the same.
Wherever you go, everyone will ask how your preparations are going on, how many per cent you will score.
I would like to say that you will set some targets for yourself and will not come under the pressure of someone else's expectations.
You must work hard, but set a realistic target for yourself and try to achieve that target.
So it was very important for me to find a solution.
And I always tried to achieve those targets.
My focus used to be on Ballet and Targets automatically become self-sustaining.
I would like to tell you that it is very important for you and your thinking to be positive.
Positive results will be followed by positive thinking.
So you must be positive and the person above must give you good results. This is my full hope and I would like to give you the best wishes for the exams.
Friends, see what Tendulkar is saying.
Do not put this under the burden of expectation.
You have to make your future.
You should set your goals by yourself, decide your targets by yourself - free from mind, free thinking and free power.
Why not compete
Why do we waste our time in competing with others?
Why do not we compete with ourselves?
Why do not we decide to break all our previous records?
You see, no one will be able to stop you from proceeding and when you break your own previous record, you will not be expecting anyone else for happiness and satisfaction.
Satisfaction will appear from within.
Friends, do not consider examination as a game of marks.
Where to reach, how much to reach?
Do not be trapped in that book.
Life should be connected with a great purpose.
We should move ahead with a dream, we should move forward with a resolution.
These examinations, whether they are going right or not, they account for it.
And that is why, if you dream big, if you dream big, then the exam will become a celebration in itself.
Every examination will be a step towards fulfilling that great purpose.
Every success will become the key to achieving that great objective.
If we move ahead with a very big objective and if there is anything less than expected then we will not get disappointed.
And to strengthen, and to strengthen, and to try.
Thousands of people have written to me small things on my app from the mobile phone.
Shreya Gupta has emphasized that a healthy mind remains in a healthy body.
Students should keep in mind their studies as well as their health, so that you can write in a healthy way in the gym.
Today, on the last day, I will not say that you should start holding a meeting and go for three kilometers or five kilometers to run.
But one thing is true that how your routine is especially in the days of Eam.
Anyway, our routine 365 days should be compatible with our dreams and resolutions.
I agree with Shri Prabhakar Reddy Ji, who has urged him to sleep on time and get up early in the morning and review.
Admissions should be made in advance at the examination centre along with documents and other things in advance.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said, I probably do not dare to say this because I am a little indifferent to gold and many of my friends also complain that you sleep very little.
This is one of my shortcomings, I'll try to fix it too.
Fixed sleeping time, deep sleep - is as important as your day-long activity and this is possible.
Otherwise there is a habit of some people who talk on telephones for a long time before sleeping.
And when I talk of gold, don't think that I am asking you to sleep for the gym.
At the time of the exam, I am talking about sleeping for a stress-free state to give you a good test.
I'm not talking about sleeping.
Otherwise, it should not happen that the marks should come down and the mother asked why the son should come down, then tell him that if Modi had asked him to sleep, then he had gone to sleep.
Don't do that!
I'm not gonna believe it.
If one or half of our body and part of our body suffer a bit of pain, then you must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable.
Not only this, our routine also ends.
And that's why we do not consider anything small.
You see, do not get entangled in the habit of competing with yourself in the prescribed manner.
Decide and see.
You must have seen these two types of people.
There is a negative impact on the result of the kind of paper that is produced in the penance of the paper.
On Viswanathan Anand, he will share his experiences.
You must have seen that their eyes do not even go around.
Sometimes we used to hear about Arjuna's life and how he used to look at the bird's eyes.
When we look at Viswanathan as a sports person, his eyes are absolutely bigger than the target and he is an expression of inner peace.
It is true that if someone says so, then the inner peace will return, it is difficult to say so, but one should try.
You are not talking to friends or you are walking alone, you are struggling, you are also moving a lot of books in the last moment so that they cant feel calm.
Imagine that you are standing on the bank of a pond and looking at the best things below.
But suddenly if someone kills a stone and the water starts moving in the water, then what looks good below, what does it look like
If the water is calm, then you can see how deep things are.
But if the water is disturbed, then nothing looks down.
There is a storehouse of hard work throughout the year, but if there is a disturbed mind then you will not be able to find that treasure.
If you feel calm, then your treasure will come out in front of you and your face will become very easy.
So sometimes I try to understand with greater concentration, and I feel stress within myself.
Then I think, no-no, I'll relax a bit, so I'll be fine.
So I have developed my technology automatically.
I do deep breathing.
Take a deep breath.
I breathe deeply thrice and the time goes by 30 seconds, 40 seconds and 50 seconds, but then my mind is completely calm and ready to understand things.
Maybe this is my experience and you can also work.
Rajat Agarwal has told a good thing.
If parents are also educated in the house and if parents are also teachers in it, then they write the whole paper again, tell me what you wrote, what happened
Man, I made a mistake.
Hey man, I knew this, but I did not remember.
We get trapped in that.
Sing with your family and other subjects and refresh the memories of your old laughter.
If you ever have gone somewhere with your parents then remember the scenes there.
Just spend half an hour after leaving them.
Rajat ji's point is really like understanding.
Ramcharitmanas speaking in the present context is trying to bring this Sanskar Sarita to the country and to the world.
I am also grateful to venerated Murari Bapu that he gave us a very good message.
Friends, today I want to tell you one more thing.
I can see that this time the people have made a mention of Yoga in their experiences.
And it is a matter of great happiness for me that no one in the world meets me these days, why cant I get some time
Well friends, let me tell you this very day, start doing yoga from tomorrow morning, it will be injustice to you.
But those who do yoga are at least exam so do not do it today, do not do it.
Do it then do it.
But it is true that yoga is the key to the journey of inner development, whether it is in the life of a student or the later half of his life.
Simple to the key is.
You must pay attention to him.
Yes, if you are well aware of some yoga close by yourself and ask them if they have not done yoga earlier in the days of gymnasium then they will tell you about two or four things that you can do in two to four minutes.
Look, if you can!
Yes, I have a lot of faith in it.
My young friends, you are in a hurry to go to the examination hall and want to sit at your bench as soon as possible.
Why do these things hurry?
Why not manage your whole day's time so that even if we stop in traffic, we will reach on time.
Or these things create a new tension.
And one thing is that in the time we have got, the question paper, the constructions that we have got, we sometimes feel that this will eat our time.
It's not like that.
You should read those structures closely, it will take two minutes or three minutes or five minutes, and there will be no harm.
But the same paper is with me again with confidence, now this paper is with me, no new questions are going to come, I have to deal with so many questions and when I started thinking again, he wrote that I understood this paper so easily, for the first time I read it, but if I read the same thing again, then I noticed that no question has been put in other ways, but this is the same thing that I know.
It is very important to understand the questions.
Sometimes the question seems difficult if you do not understand the questions.
I stress on the fact that you should read the questions twice, read the questions three times, read four times and try to match what you know and see, it will become easier before writing the questions.
It is a matter of great happiness for me today that Bharat Ratna and our most respected scientist, C.N.R. Rao, have emphasized upon patience.
In very few words, but very good message has been given to all the students.
What I take half an hour to say, they say in three minutes.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am very grateful to Rao Saheb that he inspired the children of the country.
Whatever he has said, with determination, with devotion and penance, this is the same thing that you have dedicated yourselves, you have dedicated yourselves, you have to keep up, you have to stay up, you have to stand up.
If you stay up, then fear will also be scared.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do good.
Now on my app, Ruchika Dabas has shared her e-mail experience.
He said that in his family, there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere at the time of gym, and this was also discussed in his fellow families.
Together, there is a positive environment.
This is true, as Sachin ji has said, positive approach highlights positive frame of mind positive energy.
Even if you are at any stage of life, the best examples, true events give a lot of inspiration, a lot of strength and also create a new path in times of crisis.
We all read about it in our syllabus, Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the electricity bulb.
But today that electricity, that LED bulb also illuminates the lives of us.
This is said to be, failure also has the possibilities of success.
J.K. Rolling is a great example that success can be achieved by anyone at any time.
Harry Potter series is popular all over the world today.
But from the beginning it was not so.
How many problems they had to suffer.
Rolling himself said that in the difficulties, all the energy used to be used in that work, which really meant for them.
Today, aam becomes not just a student, but also a family and a teacher of the entire school.
But without the support system of parents and teachers, the situation alone is not good.
Be it teachers, parents, senior students, together we can become a team, be a unit and move forward in a planned manner, then the examination becomes easy.
Shri Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the app. He has complained that the parents should never pressurize their children to ask for more marks.
You should be encouraged just to make preparations.
They should remain relaxed, they should worry about it.
Vijay Jindal writes, do not burden children with their expectations.
This thing is right.
I do not want to say more to the parents today.
Please do not pressurize.
If he is talking to any of his friends, do not stop.
Create a light-hearted environment, create a positive environment, see how much contribution your son or daughter will get.
We like to join him.
We also want to go beyond the pace of science.
Inquisitive is the mother of science.
All these things should become an easy part of our development journey and this time the theme of National Science Day is Make in I.
Friends, Sometimes success comes very late and when success is achieved, then the perspective of the world also changes.
Probably you might have been doing a lot of business in the gym, perhaps, there might not have been a lot of news in your mind.
But I would like to reiterate this thing to my countrymen.
You must have heard in the past that there has been a very big and important combination of science in the world.
The scientists of the world worked hard, generations came, did something or the other and nearly 100 years later a success was achieved.
Global initiatives were highlighted and adopted for our scientists.
This is a very far-reaching success of science.
This discovery not only proves the theory of Einstein, our great scientist of the last century, but is also considered a great discovery for physics.
This entire humanity is going to benefit the whole world, but as an Indian, we are all happy that the son of our country, the talented scientists of our country were also involved in the entire process of discovery.
I would like to heartily congratulate all those scientists today.
In the future, our scientists will continue to strive for this goal.
There are two such systems in the world, India is third.
Connection of India will give a new strength to this process and a new momentum to it.
India will certainly be an active partner in the process of this great scientific mine of human welfare even in its limited resources.
I once again congratulate all the scientists and convey my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I write a number and you can listen to me from this number by calling a missed call from tomorrow and also in your mother tongue.
I also have to give eam tomorrow.
1.25 billion Indians are going to take my decision.
But yes, you must have seen that I must have heard how healthy I am and how confident I am.
Just let me end tomorrow, let's start the day after tomorrow.
And if all of us succeed, then the country will also succeed.
So friends, I convey my best wishes to you all.
Get rid of the stress of success and failure and move forward with a free mind.
Mind talk, December 2015
I keep a close watch on this portal. From Pune, Shri Ganesh V.
No, we have to change that according to the requirements of India, if a poor person earns his wages, he gets physical labor, but if a young person creates something that will facilitate the poor in the form of a job, I consider this as a start-up.I will ask the bank to help such a young man, I will also tell him to move forward with courage.Will the market be available so that the talent of our young generation is limited to some cities
Then I came to my mind that we might feel that with our eyes we feel that we are disabled, but we feel that we have some extra power, we feel that we have some extra power, and then I thought that why not use the word Divyang in place of the disabled person in our country. These are the people who have such a part or more than one organ, in which there is divinity, there is a communication of divine power, which we do not have the common man.
On the 26th of January, when we celebrate Republic Day, can we celebrate the 26th of January, by the citizens, by the school-college students, as to the 26th of January, can we celebrate the 26th of January, the cleanliness of the premises, the cleanliness of that premises, the best sanitation and the best decoration of that place
My dear countrymen, Namaste
During the holy festival of Deepawali, you must have celebrated holidays very well.
There will also be an opportunity to go somewhere.
And with the new zeal and enthusiasm, business jobs have also started.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas will also begin.
Festivals have their own importance in social life.
Sometimes festivals work to fill the wounds, and sometimes festivals give new energy.
But sometimes when there is a crisis in this time of celebration, it becomes more painful, and it seems painful.
Every corner of the world constantly reports of natural calamity.
And there are reports of such natural calamities, which have never been heard or imagined.
We are now experiencing how rapidly the impact of climate change is increasing.
In our own country, the way in which excessive rainfall and heavy rainfall have taken place in the past, the way in which there has been heavy rainfall and heavy rainfall for a long time, especially in Tamil Nadu, and the states have also been affected.
Many people were killed.
I express my condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
State governments gather with full force in relief and rescue operations.
The central government also always works shoulder to shoulder.
Now a team of the Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But I believe that despite this crisis on the strength of Tamil Nadu, once again they will move forward at a very fast pace and the role played by them in furthering the country will continue.
But when we look at the crisis around us, we need to bring about a lot of change.
15 years ago, the natural calamity was a part of an agriculture department, because then more and more natural calamities i.e.
Today, its form has changed.
After the Nepal earthquake, I spoke to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif.
A good start has happened.
I have received the phone call of Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar, Punjab today.
I am speaking from Lakhwinder Singh, Punjab district Jalandhar.
We cultivate organic farming here and guide a lot of people in farming.
One of my questions is how to guide the people who set fire to these fields, how to guide the people about the damage caused to the soil by micro-organisms and how the pollution is taking place in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
Lakhwinder Singh Ji I was very happy to hear your message.
One is happy that you are a farmer who cultivates organic farming.
And it is not only this that you people understand the problem of farmers very well.
And your concern is right but it does not happen only in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of us all over India and we traditionally follow the path of burning the residue of our crops.
Second, what are the measures, there is no training.
And when the impact of this crisis started coming to the cities, a voice was also heard.
But the pain you have expressed is right.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are also very valuable.
They themselves are an organic manure in themselves.
Secondly, the upper layer of the earth gets burnt due to burning.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Just imagine that our bones are strong, our heart is strong, the kidney is good, everything is good but what will happen if the skin above the body is burnt
Similarly, burning of the remains of this crop does not burn just the dirt, it burns the skin of the earth mother.
The upper layer of our land is burnt, which leads our fertile land to death.
And that's why he should make positive efforts.
Once again this shit is dumped into the ground, even then it becomes manure.
Or if a pit is stacked in a pit and put some water in it, then it comes in the form of a good kind of organic manure.
Once I got the opportunity to talk to the farmers who cultivate bananas.
And they told me a great experience.
Earlier, when he used to cultivate banana and when the banana crop was finished, he had to spend Rs.5000, 1000 or 15 thousand rupees per hectare in order to clear the stubble of bananas.
And till the people who raised him did not come with a tractor-weight, he used to stand like this.
However, some farmers promoted that 66, 8-8 inches of stubble and buried it in the soil.
So it has been experienced that there is so much water in the trunk of this banana that if there is a tree, there is a plant, there is a crop, then there is no need to get it out for three months.
Today, the demand for that shit has increased, which had to be spent on cleaning the dirt.
Even a small experiment can be of great benefit. Our farmer brothers are no less than a scientist.
My dear countrymen, on the 3rd of December, I will remember the whole world on International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
The last time in Mann Ki Baat, I had discussed the organic connection.
I had also discussed the helpline of NEET for organ donation and I was told that the phone calls increased almost 7 times after that talk of my mind.
Famous people, including film actress Raveena Tandon, are associated with it.
Organic nation can save precious lives.
Angadan comes with immortality in a way.
When the organ goes from one body to another, that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
What can be the best donation from this?
I am confident that there will be greater awareness on this sector as well and in the true sense of the word, the needy will get the best help, as these help cannot be received from anywhere else unless one donates.
As I said earlier, 3rd December is celebrated as Disabled Day.
Physically and mentally disabled, they are also rich in immense courage and strength.
Occasionally pain occurs when sometimes they laugh.
Occasionally the feeling of compassion and mercy is expressed.
But if we change our vision, if we change the way we look at them then these people can inspire us to live.
Can inspire to do some tax.
If we have a small problem then we sit down to cry.
Then I remember that my crisis is very small, how does it live
And so these are all sources of inspiration for us.
His willpower, his way of dealing with his life and his desire to turn the crisis into strength is immense.
Javed Ahmed, I want to tell him today.
4042 is the age of age.
In 1996 Kashmir, Javed Ahmed was shot by the terrorists.
I lost a part of the intestine and the intestine.
The serious nature of this kind has been a spinal injury.
The ability to stand on his feet went forever, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
The injury of terrorism could not even bother them.
His own words, but the biggest thing is that without any reason an innocent person has to face such a big problem, his youth is in danger, but no resentment, no anger, nor any anger, this crisis has also been changed by Javed Ahmed.
He offered his life in social service.
The body does not accompany but for 20 years they have been immersed in children's studies.
How did infrastructure improve for physically challenged people
In public places, how to develop facilities for disabled people in government offices
They are working on it.
Is Javed's life not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I specially remember the life of Javed Ahmed, his penance and dedication to him on 3rd December.
In the absence of time, even though I am talking about Javed, the lamps of such inspiration are burning in every corner of India.
Giving new light of living, showing the way.
3rd December is an occasion to remember everyone and get inspiration from them.
Our country is so huge.
There are many things in which we are dependent on the governments.
The middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the dalits, the oppressed, the exploited and the deprived sections of the society are constantly in touch with the government.
And as a citizen sometimes a bad experience comes from some government servant in life.
And that very bad experience changes our attitude towards the government system throughout our life.
There is a reality in it, but sometimes lakhs of people sitting in this government work with dedication and service, which we never see.
Sometimes we do not even know that because it is so easy, we do not know that a government system, a government servant is doing this thing.
The ASEAN workers in our country who are connected to the entire country.
We have never heard of the discussion about the ASEAN workers among the people of India, nor have you heard of it.
But when I see Bilgats Foundation's world-renowned family as a entrepreneurship, his success in the world has become an example.
The last time we had given the joint Padma Vibhushan to both these Bilgats and Milinda Gates.
They do a lot of social work in India.
They are spending their retirement time and whatever they have earned throughout their life working for the poor.
Whenever they come, they meet and those who have got the opportunity to work with the ASHA workers, they praise them so much, they praise them so much, and to tell them this thing is so much that what dedication and hard work they do to the ASHA workers.
How much enthusiasm is there to learn new things, they tell them all these things.
In the past, the Orissa Government has given special honor to an ASA worker on Independence Day.
A small village in Balasore district of Orissa, Tendgaon is a hope worker and the entire population of that district is Scheduled Tribes.
And there is an area affected by malaria.
And one of the hope-workers of this village, Jamuna Manisingh, decided that now I will not let anyone die from malaria in this Tendagaon.
If you come to know about a small fever, go to your house and go to your house.
Take treatment on the basis of the primary arrangements that have been taught to him.
Emphasis on the use of insecticide mosquito nets in every house.
As soon as your own child sleeps properly and as much care should be done, ASA worker Jamuna Mani Singh continues to work with complete dedication for the entire village to escape mosquitoes.
And he fought malaria and prepared the entire village to fight it.
How many such Jamuna Mani will be.
There will be millions of people who will be next to us.
We will look at them with a little respect.
Such people become the strength of our country.
How do the happiness and misery of the society become big partners?
I would like to honor all such ASA workers through the Jamna Mani.
I urge you to look at it.
See, not only this, you should also show others, read it and maybe you want to add such things.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
Discussion on books and if an enthusiastic young man goes to nearby schools regarding these books and tells the students of class 8th, 9th and 10th to tell them that this happened here.
So you can become a social teacher in the true sense.
I invite you to join us in nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is concerned about climate change.
There is also a discussion on climate change, global warming, dgar-dagar. There is also concern and prior approval is being given as a standard before doing every work.
Earth's temperature should not increase anymore.
It is also the responsibility of everyone and there is also concern.
I had once said that on the night of full moon one should stop the street lights and take a bath in the moon for an hour.
Should experience the light of that moon.
When a friend sent me a link to see it and I got the opportunity to see it, I felt like telling you the same thing.
In Kanpur, a woman does not seem to have got the opportunity to read more from TV.
But one such thing is being done which probably no one would have thought.
He is working to provide light to the poor using solar power.
He is fighting a war from the darkness and is illuminating his name.
He has set up a committee of women and a solar lantern has installed a plant and it gives lanterns for rent of Rs.100 per month.
It costs about Rs 3-4 per day but the entire house is illuminated and this Noorjahan works to recharge the lantern with solar energy throughout the day.
Now see what big people of the world will do for climate change, but a light house may inspire everyone, it is doing such a thing.
And by the way, Noor Jahan means illuminating the world.
The lights are spreading through this work.
I congratulate Noorjehan and I also congratulate eTT because he has presented this work going on in a small corner of Kanpur to the country and the world.
Congratulations a lot
Thank you Abhishek ji.
The message you sent me from Gorakhpur.
The Prime Minister laid the foundation stone of the MARKA scheme.
Those who do not get the money get the money.
However, the speed at which I want to go is still to come.
But the beginning has been good. In such a short span of time, nearly 66 lakh people got Rs. 42 thousand crores under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Be it a dhobi, a barber, a newspaper seller, or a milk seller.
I am glad that out of these 66 lakh women, 24 lakh are women.
And most of these beneficiaries are SC, ST, OBC, and they try to run the family with their own hard work and respect.
Abhishek himself has told his enthusiasm.
I've got a lot of news.
Someone just told me that someone in Mumbai is Shailesh Bhosale.
He got a loan of Rs 8.5 lakh from the bank under the MRA scheme.
And they started the business of cleaning and cleaning the sewage.
I had said in the context of my cleanliness campaign that the cleanliness campaign is such that it will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhosale did it.
They have brought a tanker, and I was told that in such a short span of time they have also returned the bank.
After all, this is our intention under the MARKA scheme.
I was told about Mamta Sharma of Bhopal that she received 40 thousand rupees from the bank through the Prime Minister's MRA scheme.
He is working to make a wallet.
Earlier it used to bring more money and it used to run the business with great difficulty.
Now due to the good amount of money coming together, he made his work more good.
And due to the excess interest that was spent on him earlier and due to the reasons, this money came into his hands and almost Rs. 1000 was saved every month.
And his family started to grow a good business gradually.
But I would like to have more publicity for the plan.
All our banks should be more sensitive and help more and more small people.
These people really run the economy of the country.
The people who do small things are the economic power of the country's meaning.
We want to emphasize the same.
It's good, but it's good to do.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had discussed 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'.
These are things that should continue to remain alive in the life of the society.
The unity and integrity of the country should be maintained with the help of Jagaranyam Vyas, Internal Vigilance and Sanskar.
I want to make it an India-Shreshtha Bharat scheme.
MyGov was asking for suggestions on it.
How is the structure of the program
What are the people?
How to increase public participation
I said for all the suggestions.
I was told there's a lot of suggestions.
But I expect more suggestions.
Some big prices have also been announced.
You should also put in your creative mind.
How can we make this mantra of unity- Ek Bharat- Shreshtha Bharat connect this mantra of 'Ek Bharat- Shrestha Bharat' to every Indian
What is the plan, what is the program?
Be it a living person, be it a magnificent one, be it a life-long one, and it is easy to connect everyone.
What will the government do?
What will the civil society do?
There may be many things.
It's fun to wear clothes, but I'll urge you to exercise.
I would urge you to use this good weather for some time or the other to keep the body fit. Exercise Yoga will definitely help you.
And it is necessary to create an environment in the family itself, be it a family festival or an hour together.
So there is a good weather, then there is a good habit.
Once again I have got the opportunity to connect with you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Today the fifth one-day match between India and South Africa is going to be played in Mumbai.
This is the series which has been named Gandhi Mandela series.
And that is why the importance of the last match has increased further.
Best wishes to all my players.
Today I want to congratulate the friends of AIR's Kannur Centre.
Congratulations because when I started talking about the mind, many people went on joining him.
In it, a 12th student of Kerala was associated with Shraddha Thamban.
I have to talk to Kerala once again today.
A letter has been sent to me by the girl students of St. Mary's Upper-Primary School, Chittoor, Kerala.
The letter is special in many ways.
One, these girls have made a picture of Mother India with their thumb impression, on very large clothes.
He has sent me that picture of the map of India, of Mother India.
At first I was surprised why he made a map of India with his thumb impression.
However, when I read his letter, I understood what a wonderful symphony he has given.
These are those girls who have just tried to awaken the Prime Minister, it is not so.
They are trying to make people aware even in their area and their mission is Angadan.
They are running mass awareness campaigns for organ donation.
He has also performed drama by going to many places, so that the understanding of Angadan spread among the people.
Angadan became a tendency and tendency.
These girls have written to me in a letter that you should appeal to the people about organ donation in your mind.
They say that Angadan should make a festival.
These days I receive a lot of messages on phone call as well.
Devesh of Delhi has given me one such message.
Every year one lakh eyes need light.
On the death of a road accident, the organ of the body can be donated.
There are too many legal conflicts.
Efforts have also been made to guide the states in this direction.
Some states have made great efforts to reduce the paperwork and speed it up.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the front line in the field of organ donation.
Many social organizations, many NGOs are doing a very good job in this direction.
In order to promote organ transplant, the National Urban and Tissue Transplant Organization (NTT) has been established.
A 24x7 helpline 1800114770 is also available.
And it has been said in our scriptures that the joy of renouncing Ten Teykten Bhunjitha is very good in this mantra.
Recently, we had seen on TV that a poor handkerchief, Hawker and his wife had been transferred to Delhi's G.B. Pant Hospital.
And this five-wheeler was brought from Lucknow to Delhi.
And that operation was successful.
A life was saved.
Angadan Mahadan
We should realize this idea and we must emphasize this point.
My dear countrymen, we have just celebrated Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days, we will celebrate Diwali.
Eid is also celebrated, Ganesh-Chaturthi is also celebrated.
This is the first time that such a big scale is being organized on the soil of India.
Leaders of Chavwan African countries and unions have been invited.
African countries are getting the largest conference outside Africa.
The relationship between India and Africa is deep.
The more population India has, the same population belongs to African countries.
And both of us are one-third of the world's population.
And it says millions of years ago, this was the same terrain.
Later these two pieces were divided from the Indian Ocean.
There is a lot of equality between us.
And nearly 27 lakh people of India are living in these countries for a very long time.
India has economic ties with African countries, cultural ties, diplomatic relations, but India plays a very important role in training the younger generation of African countries.
Human Resource Development and Capacity Building have studied more than 25,000 African students in India.
And today there are leaders from many countries of Africa who have studied in India.
So how deep is our relationship.
And in that sense, this Summit is very important.
Generally, when the summit takes place, the heads of different countries meet.
In the same way, a meeting of the leaders is going to be held in a summit.
See, it is our endeavor that these people should also meet.
And this time, the Government of India, especially the KR Ministry, did a very good program.
A child competition was organized among the children of all the qualified schools of CBSE, a program was organized to write poems and to increase their participation.
About 16 hundred schools participated in it.
There were also schools outside India and India.
And thousands of school children wrote about strengthening India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi from Porbandar to Memories of Mahatma Gandhi, an exhibition, mobile exhibition from Porbandar to the northern states is reaching Delhi on 29th October.
Millions of school children saw this exhibition, the village-village people saw it.
The competition that took place, there were very good compositions.
I pay attention to a composition, I like it, so I want to tell you.
But we can clearly see the opportunity to connect with the people.
I congratulate the dignity, the participation of all the children, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of HRD.
On August 15, I had last proposed a proposal regarding MP Adarsh Gram Yojana.
After that many MP friends realized this work.
Staying with a big mind.
Last month there was a workshop in Bhopal.
In which these model villages are being developed, the head of that village, the collector of that village, some MPs of that place, the government of India, the state government together discussed the subject of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Under the influence of these leftist militants, many areas of the area have been wasted.
However, our MPs are very senior, they have also been deputy speakers in Parliament, Shriman Kriya Munda ji, for the tribals, they have spent their lives.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to make Adarsh Gram Panchayat.
I congratulate Respected MP Mr. Kriya Munda ji.
That's what I got from Andhra.
Andhra MP Ashok Gajapati Raju ji himself got involved in the scheme of Adarsh Gram and he chose Puri Gram Panchayat for Adarsh Gram Panchayat through Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The rest of the arrangements are being made, but they have done a very special innovative work.
Mr. Ruvala ji started the Kurtay Kut Sugarcane festival in the village on 11th March.
People from all regions got united in it.
How can the village be made a centre of economic activity how can it be marketed for the village itself.
His efforts to build an Aatmanirbhar village along with the Adarsh village is truly commendable.
My dear brothers and sisters, How can this be possible without talking about cleanliness and cleanliness
From Mumbai, Savita Roy has sent a message through a telephone. Every year we clean our homes for the preparation of Diwali.
We should clean this Diwali with our homes as well as the environment outside us and keep it clean even after Diwali.
They have attracted attention to the right thing.
I want to remind you, my dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali last year, the media of our country, especially the people of our country, launched a massive campaign and wherever the crackers were lying after Diwali, all these things were visible and they said that this is not right.
So your point is that we should do as much before the festival as we worry about it even after the festival.
Should be done in every public program.
And today I specially want to congratulate the entire media world of India.
He gave India awards and I was also watching how many activities are going on.
How-how are people working for this as a one-like forest mission?
How are the places in our country that have been kept so clean
All these things were highlighted and at that time I had heartily congratulated the commendable work of India TV Group.
However, since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan has been launched, I have seen that Tamil Nadu from Andhra, Telangana and Shri Ramuji Rao are very old, but their enthusiasm is not less than that of a young man.
And he added about 51 lakh children from nearly 55-56 thousand schools in Andhra and Telangana to this work.
Be it public places, stations, religious places, hospitals or parks, we have launched a massive campaign of cleanliness in many places.
Now these news stories give a glimpse of the power to realize the dream of a Swachh Bharat in themselves.
ABP News started its programme in the name of India and trained the countrymen by raising the awareness about cleanliness among the people.
There are hundreds of channels of our country, thousands of newspapers, I am unable to take the name of everyone, due to lack of time, but this campaign has been launched.
And that is why Savita Roy ji has suggested that today the whole country is accepting this work and is taking it forward.
From Meghalaya, our Governor, Mr. Shanmugaratnam, he has written a letter to me and has written a letter to me about the Mavalyannong village of Meghalaya.
He has written that for the past several years, this village has taken up a mission of cleanliness, and almost every generation is completely dedicated to it.
And it is said that a few years ago, he received the award in the form of the Cleanest Village of Asia.
This is what makes us believe that our country will be clean.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to say with pride that 1.25 billion Indians will be able to call our mother India free from dirt.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, I had said from the Red Fort that there are some things where corruption has gone home.
When a poor person goes for a small job, I do not know if he has to suffer for the recommendation of someone and how a group of brokers grab the money from him.
I have never heard of a psychologist in the world who fully examines a person in an interview of one minute or two minutes.
And with this idea, I had announced that why not we should eliminate this tradition of middlemen and it is the job of a small job.
My dear young friends, today, I proudly want to say that the government has completed the entire process and now there will be no interview for recruitment to Non-Gazetted posts in Group D, Group C and Group B.
January 1, 2016 will be applicable
We will not obstruct the process where the process is going on, but it will be implemented from January 1, 2016.
My best wishes to all young friends
Similarly, in the last budget, we had announced an important plan.
In a way, gold has become a part of social life in our country.
Gold is considered to be the medium of economic security.
The key to crisis time is considered to be gold.
Gold can become the economic wealth of the country and every Indian should contribute to it.
Today, I am glad that we are going to launch important schemes before the budget which we had promised in this festival of Diwali and when Dhanteras and others buy gold specially that day.
We have brought the Gold Monitoring Scheme.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the bank and the bank will give you interest on it as you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier we used to keep the gold locker and we had to pay the locker rent.
Now keep the gold in the bank and the money bank will give you as interest.
Can't you say that gold can become a property or not
Can't gold be converted into a vibrant force from lead-money
That's what we have to do.
Now do not keep gold in the house.
The other thing is that in sovereign gold bonds, you dont have a gold chain in your hands.
So you'll get two and a half thousand rupees in exchange for that paper.
So this is what we are starting.
Where to keep the gold, his concern will go away, and no one will come to steal the paper.
So I will definitely put this security guarantee in front of the countrymen in the coming weeks.
I am happy to say that we are also bringing gold queens.
It has been almost 70 years since the independence of the Ashok Chakra, but till now we have been using only the Foreign Gold Line or using the Gold Bullion Bars abroad.
With this, the 20 grams of gold will also be available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring a new change in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, is the birth anniversary of the Iron Man Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat
Remembering Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the map of the whole of India comes out.
This great man has made a great contribution to the unity of India.
He has shown his strength as a man of iron.
We will pay tribute to Sardar Saheb, but his dream of uniting India was.
Geographically he showed the tax, but the mantra of unity should constantly be the medium of our thinking, behavior, expression and expression.
Several sects, many sects, many dialects, many castes, many surroundings, how diverse our country and this diversity is our splendor.
Had it not been for this diversity, perhaps we would not be able to do the kind of beauty that we take pride in.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, goodwill and unity are the herbs of development.
For the last several years, on 31st October, there are Run for Unity programmes in many corners of the country.
I have heard that this time also its plans are being made all around, people are preparing for the race for unity with enthusiasm.
The race for unity is the race for development in the true sense.
In the second sense, the guarantee of the race for development is also a race for unity.
Let us pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Move forward the mantra of unity.
Dear sisters and brothers, You all must be engaged in the preparations for Diwali and cleanliness at home.
New things will be purchased.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated separately in every corner of our country.
I wish you the very best for the auspicious festival of Deepawali.
But, in the days of Diwali, some accidents also come to mind.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Diwali, I have to visit the UK.
I'm very excited about my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also give scholarships to such talented children who go abroad, be it Dalits, Adivasis or backward classes.
I believe that this place of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage centre for him when such children of India go to study in the UK. And to learn something in life but to live for the country later this message was given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And that is why I am saying that during my visit to Britain, I am very excited, the topic was confused for many years and now that building becomes the property of 1.25 billion people, if Baba Saheb Ambedkar's name is associated with it then you can guess how much happiness people like me will be.
I will also get another opportunity in London to unveil the statue of Lord Visvesvara.
Several years ago, the work done by Lord Visvesvara for democracy, for the empowerment of women is a truly study aspect of the world.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Visvesvara to the soil of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India thought centuries ago.
So you know that when such incidents are related then the minds of all the countrymen get thrilled .
My dear countrymen, you are associated with Mann Ki Baat.
Through telephone, I keep getting your suggestions through MyGov.in.
Akashwani is also discussed in the matter of your letters.
Calling government officials is discussed.
Some people write their problems, efforts are also made to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
I have had the privilege of learning some languages, but still there are so many languages that where I have learned?
But still I am grateful to AIR that it broadcasts this episode in the regional language of every state at 8 pm.
Even if that voice is of someone else, but the matter is of my mind.
The last time I was completing one year, today we are entering a new year.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind.
Talk of mind, September 2015
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you
On the other hand, Parliament on the one hand, and on the other hand, on the other hand, on the one hand, Parliament on the other hand, and on the other hand, both the children of this country should talk about cleanliness, on the other hand, what can be the good fortune of a big country than this. This movement that is going on, an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt, an awareness towards cleanliness will also compel the governments to work.
The institutions of local Swaraj, be it Panchayat, Nagar Panchayat, municipality, municipality, municipality, state or centre, everyone will have to work on this.We have to carry forward this movement, we have to move forward despite shortcomings. And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we should work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say.
Similarly, I met Sonam Patel, a very young girl at the age of 9, she is the daughter of a very poor family and I was surprised that the entire Gita is in her throat, but the biggest thing I used to tell her was that when I asked her, she used to interpret in English, she used to define in Hindi. I asked her father, she said, she is speaking at the age of 5.
So I said, what is the situation in studies, only the Gita keeps reading and does anything else
Once again, I have got the opportunity to be with you, to talk about your mind.
In the far south, people are painted in the festivals of Onam and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Government of India has implemented many new schemes related to social security for the common man.
I am glad that in a very short time, in a comprehensive manner, everyone has accepted these schemes.
I had made a small effort to provide this security scheme to our sisters on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
I have received a lot of information that so far 11 crore families have been associated with this scheme since the launch of the scheme.
And I was also told that nearly half of the benefits have been received by the mothers and sisters.
I consider it an auspicious sign.
I also convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up on a massive scale a year ago.
I also saw the prosperity of the poor.
We had to open an account with zero balance but the poor saved money and deposited Rs.25000 crores.
There is also a banking sector in the economy and that is why this system has reached the house of the poor and has also emphasized the scheme of bank-friendship.
Today more than 1.25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
And now thousands of people have also been entitled to get the loan under this Jan Dhan Yojana and they have taken it.
And this belief has also arisen that the poor can get money from the bank.
I once again congratulate all the concerned and I also urge all the poor brothers and sisters who have opened the bank accounts, not to break the bond with the bank.
This bank is yours, you should not leave it now.
I brought it to you, now it's your job to hold it.
Our accounts must be active .
But in a very short span of time, the enlightened, my citizen brothers and sisters of Gujarat took care of the situation.
He played an active role in preventing the situation from deteriorating, and once again Gujarat went on the path of peace.
Peace, unity and brotherhood is the right path and we have to walk shoulder to shoulder with us on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the past, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of Sufi tradition.
I got an opportunity to listen to them.
And I can tell the truth that in the way I got the opportunity to listen to them, in a way a music is playing.
The selection of his words, his method of conversation, i.e. the generosity in the Sufi tradition, which is the softness in which there is a rhythm of music, I have experienced all of them in the midst of these scholars.
I liked it very much.
Perhaps it has become most necessary for the world to reach the right form of Islam.
I believe that the Sufi tradition which is associated with love and generosity will convey this message far and wide, which will benefit humankind and will also benefit from Islam.
And I also tell others why we do not believe in any sect, but sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider this invitation as my good fortune.
In India, scholars of the Buddhist tradition from many countries of the world are going to come to Bodh Gaya, and I am also invited to discuss the global issues related to mankind. And I am glad that those people have invited me to Bodh Gaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, went to Bodh Gaya.
I am going to get the opportunity to go to Bodh Gaya with these scholars from all over the world. It is a moment of great joy for me.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to tell you something of the mind, especially today.
I have already mentioned this subject in the matter of mind.
You must have heard me in Parliament, you must have heard me in public meetings, you must have heard me in Mann Ki Baat.
I have been saying this thing every time that the government's mind is open about the dispute regarding the Land Acquisition Act.
I have been saying this again and again that I am ready to accept any suggestion of the interest of the farmers.
This means that my government was formed and the situation before that has been revived.
But one thing was incomplete in that and it was 13 such points which were to be completed in a year and that is why we brought them in the ordinance, but the issue got entangled in these disputes.
We are implementing those 13 points which are directly related to the benefits of the farmers, by bringing them under the rules so that the farmers do not suffer due to economic losses and therefore the 13 points that were left out of the earlier laws are now being fulfilled today and I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is not a slogan for us. This is our mantra for the welfare of the poor farmers. And then on 15th August we had said that not just the Agriculture Department but the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be created which we have taken forward.
I have to say one more thing that it took fifty years for the 1965 war two days ago and whenever it comes to the 1965 war, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is very natural to remember Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan Mantra.
And it is very natural to remember all the martyrs of India's tricolor and its glory.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 65 war.
I salute the heroes.
And the events of such history continue to inspire us.
Just as I got the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi tradition last week, I had a very pleasant experience.
I had the opportunity to talk to the distinguished scientists of the country for hours.
I got the opportunity to hear them, and I am glad that India has been doing very good work in many directions in the field of science.
Our scientists are really doing a great kind of work.
Now there is an opportunity in front of us to reach out to the common man.
How to convert principles into devices?
How to add Lab to Land?
We have to move forward as an opportunity.
I also got many new information.
I can say that it was also very inspiring for me and it was also a positive one.
And I saw how many young scientists were saying things with great enthusiasm how dreams were visible in their eyes.
And when I had said the last time in Mann Ki Baat that our students should move towards science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are many opportunities, there are many possibilities.
I keep getting many letters from the citizens.
From Thane, Mr. Parimal Shah has written to me on mygov.in regarding educational reforms.
Emphasis has been laid on reforms in the education sector.
I especially want to tell my young friends that on August 15, I had told from the Red Fort that why this interview for the lower level job
Everyone runs, and perhaps this is one of the reasons for corruption at the lower level.
And I had said on 15th August that I want to get rid of the system of interviewing below one level.
I am glad that in such a short span of time, it has been 15 days now, but the government is moving forward at a rapid pace.
Notices are being sent, and now almost the decision will be taken that small jobs will be missed due to the interaction.
The poor won't have to run for recommendations.
There will be no exploitation, there will be no corruption.
These days guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For the health, especially for the maternal and infant mortality rate, all the 24 countries of the world together thought about India's land for its action plan.
This is the first time outside the United States, this program was held in another country.
And it is true that even today about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children die every year in our country during and after delivery.
This is worrisome and scary.
Well, that's enough.
India is also being appreciated at the international level, yet this figure is not low.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of tetanus in the death of mothers and children.
The world has accepted it.
But we still have to save our mothers and our newborn babies.
Brothers and sisters, Today news of dengue continues.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but its defense is very easy.
And whatever I am talking about a clean India, it is directly related to it.
We look at the advertisement at TED but our attention is not drawn.
The advertisement is published in the newspaper but our attention is not paid.
There are ways to maintain cleanliness in small things in the house with clean water.
There is a lot of public education in these things, but we dont get the attention. And sometimes it seems that we live in a very good house, there are very good arrangements and we dont know that we are flooded with water and we invite dengue.
I would urge you all that we should not allow death to become so cheap.
Life is very valuable.
The compulsion of water, apathy on cleanliness, become the cause of death, this is not right.
Free testing facilities for dengue are available at around 514 centers across the country.
Imparting time, checking is useful for life-saving and for this, cooperation with all of you is very important.
And cleanliness should be given great importance.
These days, in a way, festivals are celebrated in our country from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali.
Why not add our every festival with cleanliness now
You will see that culture will become a habit.
My dear countrymen, today I have to give you a good news. I always say that we will not get the opportunity to die for the country, but we have got the opportunity to live for the country.
These two brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
There is a cycle-race in America. There is a race of about four thousand eight hundred kilometers.
This year these two brothers won the race.
See, how everyone is making their own efforts to take the country forward.
And this is what happens when you hear such incidents, then the chest gets tired.
Occasionally, we commit grave injustice to our youth due to practice.
And the old generation always feels that the new generation has not understood anything and I believe that this series has been going on for centuries.
The experience about my youth is different.
Sometimes we talk to the youth and we also get to learn a lot.
I have met many young people who say, "Brother, I have taken a fast in life on Sunday.
Some people say that I have kept cycle-days for one day in a week.
It's good for my health too.
And I also enjoy being a young person.
Nowadays, bicycles are running in many cities in our country and there are many people who promote bicycles too.
But they are good efforts to protect the environment and improve health.
And today, when two young people of my country have hoisted the flag in America, then I liked to mention about the direction in which the youth of India also thinks.
I would like to especially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
I enjoy it.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar The land of Indu Mill in Mumbai had been pending for a long time to build a memorial for him.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now Baba Saheb Ambedkar's grand and inspiring memorial will continue to inspire us to work for the dalits, the oppressed, the exploited and the deprived.
But at the same time, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar in London, now he has purchased 10, King Henry Road.
When Indians traveling around the world go to London then Baba Saheb Ambedkar's memorial that is going to be built by the government of Maharashtra will become our inspiration.
I salute the government of Maharashtra for these two efforts to honour Baba Saheb Ambedkar. I take pride in him.
My dear brothers and sisters, You must tell me your thoughts before the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, because I believe that democracy runs with peoples participation.
The country can move forward only by joining the shoulder with the shoulder.
My best wishes to you.
This year the rain has started well.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will definitely help in sowing the kharif crops.
And a happy thing has come to my notice and I am very happy.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor should have pulses, some oil should also be required to eat vegetables etc.
I specially congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this thing. I congratulate them.
My dear countrymen, 26th July marks Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The farmer's relationship with the country is as much as with the land as it is with the youth of the country.
In the Kargil War, each one of our soldiers was heavily armed with 100 enemies.
I salute those brave soldiers who have been martyred while fighting the enemies and without caring for their lives.
The battle of Kargil was not fought only on the borders but also in every city and every village of India.
This war fought for those mothers and sisters whose young son or brother was fighting enemies in Kargil.
Those daughters fought with their hands, even now the henna of Pehar did not land.
And therefore, on Kargil Vijay Diwas today, I bow down to all these soldiers.
On 26th July, in another way, I consider it a matter of great significance because in a few months after the formation of our government in 2014, we had launched MyGov on 26th July.
Our resolve to increase public participation in democracy, to connect people with the work of development, and I am happy to say this after a year that nearly two crore people have seen MyGov.
About 5.5 lakh people made comments and it is a matter of great happiness that more than 50,000 people gave suggestions on PM applications, they took out time, they put in mind, they considered the work as important.
Now the matter is small, but never did anyone in the government get this attention, nor was it thought about it.
But on the suggestion of Bhai Akhilesh Vajpayee, the government seriously considered it, and today this system has been implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Today, the people who form the logo, the tag-line, the program is formed, the policy is formed, and very positive suggestions are received on MyGov.
One experiences a new fresh air in the governance system.
A new consciousness is experienced.
These days, I have also started suggesting on MyGov what I should say on August 15.
From Chennai, Suchitra Raghavachari, he has sent a lot of suggestions.
Speak on daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, speak on clean Ganga, speak on clean India.
But this brought to me an idea, what should I say this time on 15th August, can you send me suggestions
You can send it to MyGov, write letters to AIR and write letters to the Prime Minister's Office.
I believe, perhaps it is a good idea that my speech on August 15 should be suggested by the people of Janardan.
I'm sure you'll send good suggestions.
One thing I want to express my concern.
I do not want to preach nor am I looking for a way to avoid the responsibilities of the state government, central government or the units of local self government.
Just two days ago, I had a look at the scene of an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver suffered for 10 minutes.
He did not get any help.
Anyway, I have seen that many people constantly write to me that you should say something on road safety.
Be it Hoshakot Akshaya of Bengaluru, Amity Joshi of Pune, Prasanna Kakunje of Murbidari of Karnataka.
And when we look at the data, the heart is shaken.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
Due to the accident, due to road accident, one dies every 4 minutes.
And the biggest concern is that nearly one-third of those who die are young people in the age group of 15 to 25 years and one death shakes the whole family.
The government should do whatever it wants to do, but I urge the parents to take care of their children - be it running two-wheeler or running four-wheeler - the atmosphere of security should also be increased in the family.
There is another project for us, it is going to expand in the future, it is going to expand in the future, it is going to expand in the future, it is going to be a cashless treatment for the highways of Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, and from there to Mumbai, Ranchi, Ranagaon and Mandya.And that means, who will not pay the money for the first fifty hours, who will not pay the money, who will not pay the money, who will give the best care to those injured in the road accident, we are giving priority to them.
To provide information about the accidents across the country, toll-free number 1033, ambulance facility, all these things have been done after the accident.
We have really loved one life, each and every life is very dear to us and we need to look at it as a result of that thing.
Sometimes I say, be an employee Karmayogi.
Some incidents came to my notice in the past few days and I liked to talk to you, sometimes the person doing the job gets tired and the thing is right for some years, the salary is given, the job is done, this is the feeling.
I liked to see such a big example that how life can be brought to my work.
Vijay Biswal has described how his interest, his art and capacity can be linked to his work.
Maybe now the discussion about Vijay Biswal's painting will be necessary in the coming days.
And one more thing came to my mind - the entire team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh started a work that touched my heart and I like their work.
They started Operation Malawi - now this one, listening to it will be something else.
See, how the meaning of Raksha Bandhan changed, I congratulate the entire team of government officials of Harda district.
Sometimes these small things give me a lot of pleasure, so I am sharing with you.
There is a small village by doing Keshla in Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh.
The people of that village have been trying their best for the last few months to build toilets.
And now no person in that village has to go to the open defecation.
He did this, but when the entire work was completed, the entire village celebrated such a big festival.
This is an excellent example of how values are changing in the lives of the people and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
I am writing from Bhavesh Deka, Guwahati about the questions of North-East.
However, the people of North-East are also very active.
They keep writing a lot, it's a good thing.
But today I want to tell them with happiness that there has been a separate ministry for the North-East.
We will go to the districts, go to the villages, meet the local government officials, talk to the people's representatives and talk to the citizens.
We will listen to the problems, we will do whatever the government of India has to do in order to solve the problems.
These efforts will bring very good results in the coming days.
And those officers who come after visiting the area also feel that how beautiful the state, how good the people, now we have to develop this area, we have to solve their problems only.
When they return with this resolution, even after coming to Delhi, it has become very easy to understand the problems there.
So a good effort, an attempt to go far and wide from Delhi to the East, which I am saying Act East Policy, is not this the Act.
My dear countrymen, we all take pride in the fact that we enjoy the success of the Mars Mission.
But sometimes this idea comes to mind that if we talk to the younger generation today and ask them what they want to do next, they will hardly get one or half of the 100 students who will say that I have to become a scientist.
It is a matter of great concern that the trend towards science is low.
There is a great need to take interest in innovation, to encourage them and to know their capabilities.
I also keep telling the IAS officers of the government that if you have gone ahead with so much study then you too must go to a school and college near you for two to four hours a week and talk to the children.
Your experience and your strength will definitely help this new generation.
Work is difficult, but to do.
We have launched it and in the coming years, we will provide 24x7 electricity to the villages.
If the children of the village also want to read in the days of examination then there should not be any problem of electricity.
If there are small industries in the village, then there is electricity.
Today, even if you want to do mobile fare then you have to go to another village.
The villages should get the benefits that the cities get.
And that is why we have started the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Program.
I know that such a large country, lakhs of villages have to be reached far and wide.
But, it's only for the poor to run.
Today, in the matter of mind, I feel like talking about different things.
In a way, the month of August, the month of September, is the occasion of festivals in our country.
There are many festivals.
My best wishes to all of you.
Send me suggestions for August 15.
Your thoughts will be of great help to me.
In the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had made a prayer to you people that if you go somewhere during the holidays, and if there is a memorable picture of it, then I would like to convey my best wishes to you.
When I said, I did not think that such a tremendous result would be achieved.
Millions of people posted photos, Twitter pay, Facebook pay, in Instagram.
I can say that India is full of diversity to see a scene more than one.
Be it architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas.
Probably the Government of India has never thought that people can do such a big thing in terms of tourism, which you people have done.
And I was so fond of it that I re-tweeted it too.
We will take it forward, we will continue, the world will see, our countrymen will see, our new generation will see it.
My dear countrymen, you have made me the Prime Minister, but the person within me sometimes loses his position, loses his position.
On 21st June, International Yoga Day, I can say that my mind was stirred in the same way as I had put it in the NCC.
We can say with the claim that the sun never falls in the world of yoga practitioners.
The way the world has honoured Yoga with its glory, the way the world has raised it on its shoulders, who will be an Indian who will not be proud of it.
The mind became pulsed.
And when the people of France, for whom the Sin River and the Fiel Tower are very proud, they chose that place to do yoga, and gave it an equal place.
People in New York did yoga on Times Square.
When it comes to Australia and Sydney then the image of the para house comes to us.
The citizens of Australia made yoga at par with the para-house.
Whether it is North America, Silicon Valley or the home country of Milan, it is a matter of pride in itself.
Similarly, the N Peace Keeping Force also performed very well in Yoga.
In India too, our youth were doing yoga on Siachen, on white ice sheet, through the Navy, everywhere in the sea, wherever our naval ships were, yoga programmes were organized.
Delhi has registered its place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Rajpath became Yogpath.
I am grateful to the heart of the country and the world, and I can say that this was not a good program of any program.
It seemed as if a new curiosity, a new happiness, a new excitement and a new attachment was received from every corner of the world.
A few days ago when I had tweeted on Twitter, a family from Vietnam using a photo of a young child, it was so cute that it became so popular all over the world.
Everyone, every man, every man, every woman, every village, every village, every developed country or developing country, everyone has joined us.
Yoga became a reason to connect the world in the true sense.
But I feel one thing, and every Indian can feel proud that the world is very eager to know India.
A curiosity has increased towards India.
The world wants to know the values of this place, the traditions and heritage of this place.
It is the responsibility of all of us that we should share this legacy of ours without any lapse, we should introduce the world to the world.
But we will be able to introduce this only when we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we become so aware that what is new in our things, what is new in it, it seems like our family values, we do not know that India's family values are very important for the world.
I'm sure it'll be a surprise.
There are a lot of things that our ancestors have given us and the world has the right to the best.
The success of International Day of Yoga has brought a new responsibility with joy and satisfaction.
It becomes our responsibility to give the best yoga teacher to the world.
It is our responsibility to see all the traditions of Yoga from the world through a platform.
Introduction of institutions related to yoga, knowledge of yoga gurus, information about yoga.
If you want to learn yoga then where you can learn, if you want a yoga teacher then where you will get it, you should prepare a database and I believe that you can do it.
Come, let's start from somewhere, this too will become a new power.
I have seen the events of the last few days, the government working in the government, the government running, we have seen these things in the past, how the results can be achieved once the goals are set.
And when there was despair all around us, we should not forget that a year ago there was only one voice from all sides, nothing happens, nothing happens.
You can imagine that AYUSH is a department in the government and no one pays attention to that.
In the last 2-5 years, if a small news item appeared in the newspaper then it came to be so, in one corner, a small department, but he led the Yoga Day.
And the small department has organized such a big work in the world.
If the goal is to be achieved then how good a small unit does, it is a sample of it.
In the past, the world has seen how our people saved the people from Yemen.
Within hours, people of India reached Nepal and ran for help. When the working government was to open a Jan Dhan account in the bank, the people of the bank came to the ground and in a short span of time they had connected crores of people with the bank.
On 15th August, I had appealed for toilets in schools from the Red Fort and I had said that by the next 15th August, we have to complete this work.
The work that was not completed in 60 years was bold enough to construct nearly 4.5 lakh toilets in a year, but today I can say with satisfaction that there is a delay of 15th August but it has not been completed but people have completed the work of constructing toilets in almost every school.
That is, the government, the people, the government, everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month we had launched three public security schemes from Calcutta.
There has been a very positive result in such a short time.
There has been very little work in terms of public safety in India but due to these three schemes we are putting up a big jump.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have joined the schemes of these people, but we have to take it forward.
The Raksha Bandhan festival comes in August.
On behalf of Raksha Bandhan's brother, sister can have a very big gift.
Let us make all efforts to fulfil this resolution together with me.
When I talk about my mind, many people also send me suggestions.
This time many people have sent such suggestions to me to say something for the monsoon.
Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harshavardhan ji of Mysore, Pravin Naddakar ji, Divyanshu Gupta ji, he said that for the monsoon, you must tell something about the mind.
They have sent good suggestions.
You might also be enjoying tea with hot pakoras, nieces, corns in the rain.
But at the same time, the way the rays of the sun give life, the same rainfall gives strength to our life.
The water of the village should be in the village, the water of the city should be in the city, it should be our resolve and efforts should be made to stop the water.
And if the rain water stops and goes back to the ground and there is a recharge on the ground then the problems of a year are solved.
I always tell people that if you visit Porbandar in Gujarat, and if you visit the house of Mahatma Gandhi then there is a underground tank in the house of two hundred years old, in which there was an arrangement to directly visit the water of the rain.
Porbandar is on the coast of the sea, but sweet water was stored in the house by collecting rain water, so much care was done at that time too.
We can also do that.
All of us, the campaign to plant trees and plant trees during this rainy season, should be done in large quantities by social organizations and youth.
And I give a suggestion and I have a direct experience and a very successful experience.
This is my rural technology.
When you plant a plant, plant an old clay pot in the plant's bag and fill it with water.
Even if you fill water twice a month, it will also run.
I keep telling the farmers that instead of fencing on the banks of their fields, they should plant trees.
They will become your property.
And we know that in the rainy days, the disease spreads a lot with water.
Because of the increase in moisture in the environment, bacteria start to grow and cleanliness becomes very important for this.
The request to drink pure water is necessary.
It is true that the more we care, the disease will stay away from us.
Water should be required, rain should also be avoided but disease should also be avoided.
Friends, Just now we have launched three new schemes, especially for the urban population.
There are about 500 small towns in our country.
Under the AMRUT scheme, we have launched a big campaign to make our cities liveable.
In the same way, such a country should be equal to the world.
On the other hand, the poorest of the poor person of the country should have his own house, and on the other hand there should be arrangements for schools to study nearby, to provide electricity, water, toilets and so on.
In 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of independence, we want to give home to the countrymen.
We have started a big scheme with these three things.
I believe that all these schemes will be useful in bringing about changes in urban life.
I myself have been associated with you through social media and I keep getting many new ideas from you people and good information about the government.
But sometimes even a person sitting in a remote village touches our heart.
You know that the government is running a Beti Bachao-Beti Teacho program.
But when a person, a society, a village becomes his own, then how much strength he gets.
Recently, a Sarpanch of Bibipur village of Haryana, Shri Sunil Jaglan ji took him a very interesting initiative.
In Haryana, the number of girls is very low compared to boys.
There are about 100 districts in the country in which this condition is worrisome.
Most in Haryana
But if the Sarpanch of a small village of Haryana gives this kind of change to the Beti Bachao Abhiyan then it gives a lot of happiness to the mind and a new hope is awakened.
That is why I express my happiness.
But this incident has also inspired me and therefore I also urge you to post with your daughter, ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..... ... ... ... ..... ..... ..... ..... ..... ...... ...... ........ ..........................................
Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao will give a boost to this idea by writing a tagline, write a good line, it can be in any language, English, Hindi, your mother tongue and any language.
What I will have of them is a very inspiring tagline, it is selfie that will be your daughter and I will review you.
In a way, we can convert this thing into a mass movement.
The work that Bhai Sunil started from Bibipur village in Haryana and we all should move forward together and I urge you to post with self help.
So my best wishes to you all in this rain, enjoy the rains.
Make our country green.
Not for a day on the occasion of International Yoga Day, but you must keep the practice of Yoga going on.
You see, you'll see the benefit of this.
Make it a part of your life, do it.
Incredible India, you must travel anywhere and send photographs.
The country and the world will know how much diversity our country has.
One thought that there was very little about handicrafts in it.
We have to reach the world, we have to bring the specialities of India around.
And we have a simple medium, we will definitely reach it.
My dear countrymen, today I will meet you next time just for the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
He used to hear and repeat several words in the form of a swajnana of the family of 130 crore Indians, and sometimes he used to become an inspiration for his own words and deeds.
You can imagine how it must have been in the middle.
Probably, this wasn't an imbecile program.
There was a sense of belonging, a sense of belonging, a sense of attachment, a sense of attachment, and because of this thing, the time spent in the middle was very difficult for me.
I was missing something every moment and when I talk about the mind, I speak, even if I am, the word is probably mine, the voice is mine, but, the story is yours, the meaning is yours, the power is yours, the power is yours.
feeling an emptiness
But this Sundayy made a lot of wait
Well, we've got a chance.
Many messages have come in the last few months in which people said they are missing the mind .
Occasionally I think this is the journey from my own self to the whole
This is my important trip to Vietnam
My silent conversation with you, in a way, was also a part of the experience of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions, why did I go to Kedarnath in the calamity of elections
Most people have derived political meaning from it .
For me, that was the opportunity to meet me.
In a way I went to meet me,
I will not tell you more things today, but I will do so much that in the valley of Kedar, in that solitary cave, perhaps he had given an opportunity to fill up something.
The rest is your curiosity - I think I ' ll ever talk about it .
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, your effort to boost a positive thing, I feel constantly in your talks.
The letters that come for the talk of mind, the inputs that are received are completely different from the routine official work.
In a way your letter also becomes a source of inspiration for me and sometimes it becomes a cause of energy .
Occasionally, you have some words to sharpen my thought process.
If people keep the challenges facing the country and society, then they also tell the solutions.
If someone writes for cleanliness , he has been expressing his resentment towards dirt but he also appreciates the efforts of cleanliness .
Somebody talks about the environment, he feels pain, but at the same time he tells the experiments he has conducted - he tells the experiments he has seen - and he portrays the imagination he has in his mind.
It tells us that there is no dearth of inner strength, strength and talent among the countrymen.
We need to incorporate those strengths and talent, provide opportunities, implement it.
This episode of Mann Ki Baat also tells us that all the 130 crore Indians want to be actively involved in the progress of the country and I must say one thing that so many letters come to me in Mann Ki Baat, so many phone calls are received, so many messages are received but the element of complaint is very low and someone has asked for something for himself. One such thing has not come to my notice in the last five years.
When I analyze these things, you can imagine how much my heart will enjoy, how much energy I will get.
You have brought me here, you have given me the opportunity to speak once again.
With this feeling, let's go ahead with the talk of mind.
When an emergency was imposed in the country, its opposition was not limited to political circles, it was not limited to politicians, the movement was not limited to prison bars.
In an emergency, every citizen of the country felt that something had been snatched away.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, the massive election campaign, the rich and the poor in our country, all the people were happily ready to decide the future of our country in this festival.
When something is very close to us, we underestimate its importance, and ignore its ill-effects.
In India, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, more than 61 crore people voted, City One more
This number may seem very common to us but if I say in terms of the world if we leave China then in India more people than any country in the world had voted
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of America, it is almost double
The number of total voters in India is more than the population of the whole of Europe
It represents the vastness and pervasiveness of our democracy .
The 2019 Lok Sabha election was the world's largest democratic election in history
You can imagine how much resources and manpower would have been required to complete such elections.
Elections were possible with the hard work of millions of teachers, officials and employees day and night
In order to successfully complete this great wisdom of democracy, where nearly 3 lakh security personnel of paramilitary forces performed their responsibility, 20 lakh policemen from different states also peaked hard work
As a result of the hard work of these people this time more voting was done than last time .
About 10 lakh polling stations across the country for voting, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines, you can imagine how big a Tam-Jham
All this was done so that it can be ensured that no voter is deprived of his franchise.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station was built for just a female voter.
Polling stations located at the highest height in the world are also in India
This polling station is located at a height of 15000 feet in Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Apart from this, there is another fact that gives pride in this election.
Perhaps, this is the first time in history that women have voted enthusiastically like men
The percentage of voting percentage of women and men was almost equal in this election
Another encouraging fact related to this is that today there are a record 78 women MPs in Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person involved in the election process and bow down to the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth many times, you must have not booked me, I was urging you if we can give books instead of flowers in welcome
Since then , people have started giving books in many places .
However, I could not find much time, but during my stay I got an opportunity to read some of his stories again
His stories contain the spirit of the whole of India .
When I was reading the story of his name intoxication, my mind went on its own to the economic inequalities prevailing in the society.
The story of the zamindar's son Ishwari and the poor family's birch learns that if you are not careful then when the effect of bad company gets over, it does not seem to be known.
The second story, which touched my heart, was Idgah, the sensitivity of a child, her pure love for her grandmother, so mature at such a young age
4-5 years old Hamid reaches his grandmother with a pinch from the fair, in fact, human sensation reaches its peak.
The last line of this story is very emotional because it has a great truth in life, child Hamid played the part of the old Hamid played the old Amina and girl Amina.
One such big poignant story is the night of Puss
There was a live picture of the irony of a poor farmer ' s life in this story .
Even after the loss of his crop, the light farmer is happy because he will not have to sleep in the field in the cold winter.
Although these stories are about a century ago, their relevance still remains the same.
After reading these, I had a different kind of feeling.
When talking about reading, then in any media, I was reading about Kerala's Akshar Library
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village in the middle of the thick forests of Idukki .
P.K. Murlidharan, a teacher from the primary school here and P.V. Chinnathampi, who runs a small tea shop, both of them have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by filling in the gutter and putting on the back
Today this library is showing a new way to everyone with tribal children.
Gujarat campaign in Gujarat was a successful experiment
Millions of people of every age group had participated in this campaign to read books
In today's digital world, during the time of Google Guru, I will also urge you to take some time out and place the book in your daily routine.
You will really enjoy a lot and write about whatever book you read on the NarendraModi app so that all the listeners of the mind will also be able to know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that the people of our country are thinking about issues which are a big challenge not only for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on the NarendraModi App and Mygov and I saw that many people wrote a lot about the problem of water
Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar besides Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about the challenges related to water.
Water is of great importance in our culture .
May you bless us like a mother , may you continue to shower your blessings on us
Due to lack of water many parts of the country are affected every year
You will be surprised that only 8 of the water received from rain in a year is saved in our country .
I am confident that like other problems, we will also solve this crisis with public participation, manpower and the strength, cooperation and resolve of 1.3 billion Indians.
Keeping the importance of water above all , a new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created in the country .
This will enable quick decisions on all issues related to water.
A few days ago I tried to do something different .
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanchs across the country
I wrote to the village heads that they should convene a meeting of Gram Sabhas to save water, save water, save water and drop outs of rain and discuss with the villagers.
I am happy that they have shown full enthusiasm in this work and on the 22nd of this month, crores of people have donated their labour in thousands of panchayats .
People in the village resolved to collect one drop of water
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I want to tell you about a Sarpanch.
Listen, what is the message given to all of us by the Sarpanch of Lupung Panchayat of Cuttackmasandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand? My name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
People there, once again, are ready to play their active role for water conservation.
On my behalf, my best wishes to all the village heads, all the Sarpanchs and their activism
There are many Sarpanchs across the country who have taken the lead in water conservation
In a way, it has become an opportunity for the entire village.
It seems that the people of the village, now in their village, have gathered in the competition to build a water temple
As I said, collective efforts can lead to very positive results
There can be no single formula for dealing with water crisis across the country .
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country in different ways.
But everyone's goal is the same, and that is to save water, water conservation
Rainage lines are being fixed in Punjab
This effort is getting rid of the problem of water logging
The lives of the people of the villages are changing due to the construction of the tank in Thimmaipali (Thimaipalli) of Telangana.
In Kabirdham, Rajasthan, a major change has been brought about by the small ponds built in the fields.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore in Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Naga river .
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are working very well together on water harvesting.
I am confident that many such efforts are being made and when we come together and strive hard, we can make the impossible possible.
When people connect, water will survive
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I request 3 from my countrymen.
My first request is to start a mass movement for water conservation just as the people of the country have turned cleanliness into a mass movement.
Together, we should resolve to save every drop of water. And I believe that water is the gift of God, it is the form of a parasa.
Earlier they used to say that iron becomes gold from the touch of Paras
I say, the water is parasa and the parasa, by the touch of water, the new life is created.
Start an awareness campaign to save one drop of water
Tell about the problems related to water in it, as well as propagate ways to save water.
I particularly urge the personalities from different regions to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Be it the film fraternity, sports persons, media persons, people associated with social organizations, people associated with cultural organizations, story-tellers, everyone should lead this movement in their own way.
Wake up society, connect society, join society
You see, we'll see the change in front of our eyes
My second request to the countrymen is that many traditional methods of conserving water in our country are being used for centuries.
I urge all of you to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had the opportunity to visit Porbandar and the birthplace of Pujya Bapu, then there was another house behind the house of Pujya Bapu. There is a water storage tank of 200 years old and there is water in it even today.
Let us connect to water conservation by creating a list of more and more ways and motivate people to conserve water.
All of you can share your content using Janashakti4Jalshakti hashtag
My dear countrymen, I also have to express my gratitude for one more thing and also express gratitude to the people of the world.
On 21st June, once again on Yoga Day, three-three-four generations of each family, together, celebrated Yoga Day with great vigour and enthusiasm.
In the awareness about Holistic Health Care, the importance of Yoga Day is increasing.
Everybody, in every corner of the world, if a yoga lover welcomes him as soon as the sun sets, then the entire journey of the sun rises.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from the Siachen to the Submarine, from air-force to air-carriers, from A-gyms to the desert and from villages to cities, Yoga was not only practiced everywhere, but it was also organized collectively.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, well-known personalities, ordinary citizens of many countries of the world showed me on the Twitter that they celebrated Yoga in their respective countries.
That day, the world looked like a very happy family
We all know that a healthy society requires healthy and sensitive people and that is what Yoga ensures .
Therefore the spread of yoga is a great work of social service .
Should not he be honored by recognizing such a service?
The announcement of Prime Ministers Awards for outstanding contribution to the promotion and development of Yoga in 2019 was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
This award has been given to those organizations around the world about which you must not have imagined how they have made significant contribution in the spread of yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, who has made Yoga popular throughout Japan
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutes and training courses there or take the name of Ms. Antonietta Roi of Italy who started the Sarva Yoga International and spread yoga throughout Europe.
These are inspiring examples in themselves .
If this is a subject related to yoga, can Indians stay behind?
Bihar Yoga School, Munger was also honored. For the last several decades, Yoga has been dedicated to Yoga.
It is a very important journey for me to connect with your thoughts .
Let's keep meeting, keep talking
Keep listening to your feelings, preserve it, keep understanding
Sometimes I try to live those feelings
Be your blessings
You are my inspiration, you are my energy
Come and sit together and enjoy the things of mind - let's play the responsibilities of life as well .
Then meet again next month for mind talk
Thank you very much to all of you
This season is also of heat on one side, and there is a lot of happiness somewhere.
Talk of mind, April 2015
Mind talk, December 2014
And I have seen that there was not only the program of government's evils but also a concern and I believe that in a way there was a lot of hard work to get out of the problem and because of that a good atmosphere of discussion was started. They feel that the government's responsibilities have also been sensitized and now they can't remain indifferent.
Have you ever thought?
Imagine
That ' s the money for drugs if they go to the terrorists .
With these money, the terrorists would have bought weapons.
And with those weapons , a terrorist will stain bullets in the chest of a young man in my country .
The young man of my country will be martyred
Have you ever thought that the one who kills a mother, the one who loves the life of a mother India, one who dies for the country, one who is shot in the chest of a soldier or not
Have we ever seen that we mostly discuss their secular progress with our children?
Modi ji, do not you tire?
One month is a long time .
A lot of events take place in the country and the world .
All of you also celebrated the festival of Diwali with great zeal and enthusiasm .
It is festivals that fill the lives of people from time to time, be it the poor, the rich or the villages, be it the cities or the cities, the festivals have their own importance in everyones lives.
Sometimes they think that leave it, man, people are useless, people dont have to do anything, this is our country.
I am talking about the past and today I say that it is very important to change this thinking. Our country is not such, the people of our country are not like that.
Sometimes I feel that the country is far ahead and governments are far behind.
And when I say from experience that perhaps even governments need to change their thinking .
And I am saying this because I see that these young people are committed, eager, looking for opportunities, especially for India.
and doing it in its own way .
I had said the last time, buy at least one Khadi fabric.
I didn ' t ask anyone to become khadi . But I came to know from Khadi stores that in a week there was an increase in sales of about 125 cents , handloom and Twenty Five percent .
In a way more than double the sale of Khadi in a week since 2nd October as compared to last year .
This means that the people of the country are many times ahead of what we think.
I salute the people of India .
Cleanliness someone can imagine that cleanliness will take the form of a mass movement.
There are many expectations, and should also be there.
And I can see a good result. Cleanliness is now being seen in two parts.
One that is old dirt, which is the root cause of dirt, the government machinery is there. What will the people sitting in the government take for it
There is a big challenge but you can ' t run away with responsibility .
All governments have to take steps for this responsibility by all municipalities as public pressure is going to increase.
And the media is playing a very good role in it .
But the other aspect which is very exciting, pleasant and is satisfying to the mind, the common man has started to feel that let's leave the issue before and don't mess with it anymore.
We won ' t raise a new mess .
I am from Satna, Madhya Pradesh and some from Shriman Bharat Gupta. They sent a mail on mygov.
He was going to visit the railway, his own experience said. He said that sir, I used to go to the railway even earlier, this time also went to the railway, but I am seeing that every passenger in the railway. People keep eating and drinking in the railway, throwing paper and paper. Because no one was throwing, not only that, they used to find that there is a dustbin in the compartment, put garbage in it.
And when he saw that there was no such arrangement in the railways , he collected all the garbage in the corner itself .
He said , It was a very pleasant experience for me .
I am grateful to Bharatji for giving me this information .
But I am seeing that the biggest effect has been seen in the small children .
Hundreds of families talk about the fact that if our child eats chocolate somewhere , the paper will be picked up immediately .
I just saw someone in the social media that ... someone had written. Today's hero. And in today's my hero he gave a picture of a child.
You see, everyone is beginning to feel that our country, we will not pollute.
We won ' t raise dirt .
And whatever they do, they feel ashamed and immediately someone gets to touch them.
I consider it an auspicious sign .
One good thing is also happening that the people who come to meet me these days, people from all walks of life come to meet me.
Someone talks about cleanliness, someone talks about education, someone talks about social reform.
Someone is discussing the destruction of our family life .
I think , otherwise , if a merchant comes first , he will speak to the Government of his own interest .
But I see a big change .
They talk less about self-interests, they talk more about taking some responsibilities related to society.
These are the things that I see after adding together, I am reminded that we are moving towards a very good change.
If a poor family of mine is not ill , there will never be a financial crisis in his life .
If he is healthy then he will work hard, earn and run his family.
Therefore, my cleanliness is directly related to the health of my poor brothers and sisters.
Whether we are able to serve the poor or not, we should not pollute or it is good for the poor.
I have seen , however , that those who are working in this field are sending me stories of their success .
But two things came to me from my government .
After my saying we had the officers of the HRD ministry that we should also do something .
And the officers together planned a plan .
See , this is an example of how a change begins in the government .
One, he decided that if he wants to go to technical education then he has planned to give special scholarship to those children who have special child.
I congratulate all the officers of the Department for their views .
I had the opportunity to visit Siachen in the past .
I spent my life among the soldiers who died for the country of Diwali .
When the country was celebrating Diwali, I went to Siachen.
Because due to them we are able to celebrate Diwali, so I went among them.
I experienced the difficulties that they have been facing.
I salute the soldiers who protect the country .
But today I have to say another matter of pride .
The soldiers of our country work in the field of security .
In times of natural calamity , by putting one ' s life at stake one ' s courage is prepared to protect us .
I specially congratulate these soldiers .
I had just got the opportunity to have a tea programme from the youngsters of our country, young students, young women and those who had come here for sports.
I got a new energy .
Their enthusiasm, zeal and enthusiasm I could see that compared to other countries, our arrangements are very few but instead of complaining, they were talking about doing more with enthusiasm.
For me, the programme of tea for these players was very inspiring.
One thing I want to tell the countrymen, and I really want to say it with my heart.
And I believe that the countrymen have faith in my words and trust in my intentions.
But today , once again , I would like to repeat it on my behalf .
As far as black money is concerned, black money is concerned, my countrymen, trust your principal servant, this is an article of faith for me.
This is my commitment that the money that has gone out of the poor people of India should be returned to every penny.
There can be a difference of opinion about the path, the way and the method.
And democracy is natural , but on the basis of my understanding and knowledge I have , I assure you that we are on the right path .
Today no one knows, no one knows, no one knows, no one knows, no one knows, no one knows how much money is there in the previous government.
Everyone keeps telling different figures in their own way.
I do not want to get involved in those figures, my commitment is - Rs.2, Rs.5, crores and billions of rupees, it is the money of the poor of the country, it should come back.
And I assure you that there will be no dearth of my efforts .
There will be no excuses .
Just keep me blessed.
Whatever I have to do for you, whenever I have to do, I will definitely do it.
I assure you of this .
I have a letter .
Mr . Abhishek has come from Parekh .
Even though I was not the Prime Minister, several mothers and sisters had expressed this kind of sentiment.
He has told me that you must discuss this subject in your mind .
I agree with his suffering .
When I talk about the next mind, I will definitely discuss about this drug, this drug mafia and how big a crisis can befall the youth of India due to this thing.
If you have some experience in this regard, if you have some information, if you have some methods of protecting the children who are addicted to drugs then if a government servant plays a good role, if you give me any such information, then I will convey these good efforts to the countrymen and together we will create an environment in every family that no child will be able to walk on this path due to stress, we will definitely discuss it in detail.
I know that I am dealing with matters in which the Government comes first in the dock .
But how long will we keep things hidden ?
I too have this courage . Your love .
I will continue to do so because of your blessings .
Some people have told me this too Modi ji, you were saying that you should suggest to us on the face book, give it on the Twitter page and send an e-mail.
But there is a large section of the country, who do not have this or what to do.
Your point is correct .
This facility is not available to all .
So I tell you that if you want to say something about my mind, if you listen to me on village radio then you will send a letter to me, Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio, Parliament Street and New Delhi if you give some suggestions then you will definitely reach me.
And I will definitely take it seriously because an active citizen is the largest capital of development.
You write a letter, that means you are very active.
For the sake of my mind, it should also be associated with your mind.
Maybe you ' ll definitely write a letter .
I'll try to talk to you next month.
I will try, whenever I talk, I will do it on Sunday, at 11 o'clock in the day.
So I am getting the facility to reach you .
Slowly the beginning of cold is on .
The weather is very good for health .
But along with this there is also a very good season for health .
Don ' t let it go .
Use it a lot .
My dear countrymen, today is the holy festival of Vijayadashami.
Best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Vijayadashami.
I will try, if possible, twice a month or twice a month, I will talk to you once in a month.
Later, I have also thought in my mind that whenever I talk, it will be Sunday and the time will be 11 o'clock in the morning, you will also have the facility and I will also be satisfied that I have been successful in conveying my thoughts to you.
Today, the festival of Vijayadashami, the festival of Vijayadashami, is a festival of victory of good over evils.
But a gentleman from Mumbai, Ganesh Venkatadari, he sent a mail to me, he said that in Vijayadashami, we should resolve to eliminate ten evils within us.
I express my gratitude for his suggestion.
Everyone must have imagined that they would be able to conquer the evils within themselves. But as a nation, I feel that on the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashami, let us all resolve to liberate ourselves from dirt and conquer the dirt and dirt. We can make this pledge on the occasion of Vijayadashami.
I had said one thing yesterday in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that I will invite nine people and they will upload their videos to social media while cleaning themselves and they will invite nine more people.
When we talk of Mahatma Gandhi, the talk of Khadi comes naturally in our mind.
You know, our own scientists have successfully used Mars in the least cost, successfully.
There is no dearth of strength, only we have forgotten our power.
Have forgotten yourself.
I always remember one thing Swami Vivekananda used to say one thing. Swami Vivekananda used to say one thing often.
Once, the one who went with the lioness had grown up now.
He said, "Hey, what are you doing?"
You're a lion.
They've made me big.
Look at my voice, see the way of my conversation.
So Lion said that let me show you who you are.
He took him to a well and showed his face inside the water in the well and said to him with his own face- Look, the face of both of us is one.
I am a lion, you are a lion, and as soon as he awakened self-esteem from within, he also started fluttering among the sheep, like that lion.
The essence within it was awakened.
Swami Vivekananda used to say this.
My countrymen, there is immense strength and potential within 1.25 billion Indians.
We need to recognize ourselves.
We need to recognize the strength within us and as Swami Vivekananda ji had said, if we move ahead with that self-respect, with our right identity then we will win and our nation will succeed.
I spent two hours with them, perhaps it was a very emotional and inspiring event of my life.
God may have liked that family, but that child is the responsibility of the entire nation.
Later, I was so emotional that I used to do different Olympics for specially-abled children in Gujarat.
Thousands of children used to come, their parents used to come, I used to go there myself.
This kind of atmosphere of trust was created and that is why I liked Gautam Pal's suggestion that he has given me and I felt that I should share these suggestions with you.
One story me gets even more attention.
You knew why you did not tell.
My countrymen, unless we resolve to walk, we will not stand by ourselves, we will not find even those who show the way.
We will not find those who hold the finger.
We will have to start the journey and I believe that 1.25 billion people will definitely be able to walk, they will continue to walk.
Many suggestions that have been received by me for a few days are sent by people with great interest.
Some people have told me that when they start small scale industries, the process of registration should be easy.
I will definitely inform the government for it.
Some people have written to me and sent me to teach the children skill development from the fifth grade.
Someone has written to me that there should be dust beans within every hundred meters, there is a need to arrange cleanliness.
Some people have written to me that the polythene pack should be banned.
A lot of suggestions are sending me.
I would like to tell you from the front that if you send me a true event anywhere, which is a positive one, which inspires me, inspires the countrymen, if you send me such truths with evidence, then I will definitely tell you the truth when I talk about it, I will definitely convey the things that have touched my heart to the countrymen.
All this is my intention to have a dialogue. Come, let us all serve our Mother India.
Let us take the country to new heights.
As you come to mind, I will definitely talk to you in the future.
I have told you the things that came to my mind today.
Then when I meet you on Sunday, I will meet you at 11 in the morning, but I am confident that our journey will continue, your love will continue.
After listening to me, if you want to say something to me, definitely convey it to me, I will like it.
I liked all of you today and the radio. It is such a simple medium that I will be able to reach far and wide.
I will reach to the poorest of the poor because my country's strength is in the hut of the poor. The strength of my country is in the villages, the strength of my country is in the mothers, sisters and youth, the strength of my country is in the farmers.
The country will move forward with your trust.
I express my confidence.
There is faith in your power, so I have faith in India's future.
Starting the talk of mind today is full of mind
10 days ago, Mother India lost her heroic sons
These brave-hearts have sacrificed their lives to protect 1.25 billion Indians.
The countrymen could sleep peacefully, so these brave sons had kept themselves awake day and night.
In the Pulwama terror attack, after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, there is a shock and resentment in the minds of people and people across the country.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families, all around
I salute all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives for the protection of Mother India.
We have to face this challenge before the country by forgetting all the differences of casteism, communalism, regionalism and other differences so that our steps against terror are stronger than ever before, stronger and more decisive.
Our Armed Forces have always displayed unparalleled courage and valour .
For the establishment of peace , where they have shown amazing ability , the attackers have also responded in their own language .
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack .
The army has resolved to destroy the terrorists and their helpers .
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspiring stories of their families through the media have further strengthened the fame of the whole country.
Ramniranjan ji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, also inspired us all in this hour of grief.
They said , “They will send their second son to fight the enemies , and they will fight themselves , if necessary . ”
The whole country salutes the indomitable courage of Meena ji, wife of Shaheed Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
He has decided to join his only son as well.
When the body of martyr Vijay Shoreen wrapped in a tricolor reached Gumla in Jharkhand, the innocent son said that I will also go to the army.
The response of this innocent child today expresses the feelings of children and children of India .
Similar sentiments are being seen in the houses of our brave, brave martyrs.
None of our brave martyrs is an exception, their family is not an exception
Whether it is the family of the martyr Vijay Maurya of Deoria, the parents of the martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six-year-old son of the martyr Hemraj of Kota, the story of every family of martyrs is full of inspiration.
I would urge the younger generation to learn and understand the emotions shown by these families.
What is patriotism, what is sacrifice and penance, for that, we will not need to go towards the old events of history.
These are living examples in front of our eyes and these are the reason for the future of bright India.
My dear countrymen, for such a long time since independence, the war memorial waiting for all of us is going to end.
The curiosity and curiosity of the countrymen about it is very natural.
On the NarendraModiApp, Shri Omkar Shetty ji of Karnataka has expressed her happiness at the National War Memorial.
I was surprised and pained that there was no National War Memorial in India.
A memorial where the bravery of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives to protect the nation can be preserved.
I decided that there must be a monument in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am glad that this memorial has been built in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, i.e. on 25th February, we will dedicate this National Soldiers Memorial to our Army.
The country will make a small effort to repay its debt
The heart of Delhi i.e. the place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are present, just near it, this new monument has been built.
I am sure it will be like visiting a place of pilgrimage for the countrymen to visit the National Military Memorial .
The National Soldiers Memorial is a symbol of the nation ' s gratitude to the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice after independence .
The design of the memorial displays the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The concept of the National Soldiers Memorial is centered on four concentric circles, which depicts the journey from the birth of a soldier to the martyrdom of a soldier.
The flame of Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyr soldier
The second circle is of bravery which shows the courage and bravery of the soldiers .
It's a gallery where the actions of the soldiers' bravery on the walls are engraved
After that, the sacrifice cycle shows the sacrifice of the soldiers.
It contains the names of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the country in golden letters .
After this the guard circle displays security
This circle has a row of dense trees
These trees are a symbol of soldiers and conveying to the citizens of the country that every guard is stationed on the border and the countrymen are safe .
Overall, the identity of the National Military Memorial will be made in the form of a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country, express their gratitude, and research them.
Here is the story of those who have laid down their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can be safe and developed .
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the development of the country in words.
In October last year, I had the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our idea under which we believe that the country should be grateful to the men and women policemen who are constantly engaged in our security .
I hope you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you visit, you must share your pictures taken on social media so that other people are also inspired by it and they too are eager to see this holy place, this memorial.
My dear countrymen, for the sake of Mann Ki Baat, thousands of letters and comments from you keep getting read through different mediums.
This time when I was reading your comment, a very interesting comment from Ashish Mukhopadhyay came to my attention.
He wrote that on March 3, 1900, when the British had arrested Birsa Munda, his age was only 25 years old, it is a coincidence that on March 3, it is also the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata.
And he further writes that these two personalities belong to two completely different family backgrounds who enriched Jharkhand's heritage and history.
In one way of paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in mind is like bowing down to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand .
These two great personalities have enhanced the name of not Jharkhand but of the whole country .
The whole country is grateful for their contribution
Today, if our youth need an inspiring personality to guide, then it is Lord Birsa Munda
The British had concealed them, very cleverly caught them at the time they were asleep
Do you know why they resorted to such cowardly action ?
because the British who built such a big empire were also afraid of them .
Lord Birsa Munda had only shaken the British rule equipped with guns and guns with their traditional arrows and arrows .
Indeed, when people get an inspiring leadership, then the collective will of the people is overwhelming on the power of arms.
Lord Birsa Munda fought not only for political freedom from the British but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals .
They did all this in their little life .
The sun shines in the dark life of the deprived and the exploited .
Bhagwan Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the young age of 25 years .
India's son like Birsa Munda has been in every part of the country.
Probably there would be no corner of India that no one has contributed in this war of independence for centuries.
But unfortunately, the stories of their sacrifice, bravery and sacrifice have not reached the new generation.
If a personality like Lord Birsa Munda made us realize our existence, then a person like Jamshedji Tata gave the country big institutions
Jamshedji Tata was truly a visionary, who not only saw the future of India but also laid its strong foundation
He knew very well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry is essential for the future.
Not only that, he also established many world-class institutions like Tata Steel and industries .
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Desai was born on 29th February.
As you all know , this day comes only once in 4 years
Intuitive, rich in peaceful personality, Morarji Bhai was among the most disciplined leaders of the country.
The record of presenting the highest budget in Parliament in independent India is the name of Morarji Bhai Desai .
Morarji Desai led India in that difficult time, when the country's democratic fabric was in danger
Morarji Bhai Desai threw himself in the movement against Emergency to protect democracy
For this he had to pay a heavy price even in his old age .
At that time the government arrested him and put him in jail
But when the Janata Party won the election in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country
The 44th constitutional amendment was brought during his tenure .
This is important because the 42nd amendment that was brought during Emergency, which included reducing the powers of the Supreme Court and other provisions that violated our democratic values was returned to them.
For example , through the 44th amendment , a provision was made to publish the proceedings of the Parliament and the Legislative Assemblies in the papers .
Under this, some powers of the Supreme Court were restored in the same amendment, it was also made that the fundamental rights under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution can not be violated during the Emergency.
For the first time, arrangements were made that the President will announce the Emergency on the written recommendation of the Cabinet, and it was also decided that the period of Emergency cannot be extended to more than six months at a time.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that by imposing emergency, the manner in which democracy was murdered in 1975, it could not be repeated again in the future.
The future generations will always remember his invaluable contribution in maintaining the greatness of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my tribute to such a great leader
My dear countrymen, like every year, there was a lot of curiosity among the people about the Padma awards.
Today, we are moving towards a New India in which we want to honor those people who are doing their job at the grass-root level with a sense of completeness.
With their hard work they are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in different ways .
Indeed, they are true Karmyogis, who are selflessly engaged in public service, social service and above all in the service of the nation.
You must have seen when the Padma Award is announced , people ask who it is .
In a way, I consider it a great success because these are the people who are not on the front page of TV, magazines or newspapers.
They are away from the world of glare, but these are people who do not care about their name, just believe in working at the grassroots level.
Yoga : They live in a way the message of Karmasu Kaushalam Gita .
I want to tell you about some of these people .
You must have heard about the Daitari Nayak of Odisha, he is not only called the "anal man of the Odisha", the Daitari Nayak cut the mountain with his hands in his village and made the way for a canal for three kilometers. With his hard work, the problem of irrigation and water was finished forever.
Take Abdul Gafur Khatri of Gujarat, he did a wonderful job of reviving the traditional Rogan painting of Kutch.
They are doing a great job of bringing this rare painting to the new generation .
I had gifted to former US President Barack Obama , the 3rd of life by Abdul Gafoor .
Among the recipients of the Padma awards Shabbir Syed of Marathwada is known as Gautama 's servant .
The way he spent his entire life in the service of the mother cow , it is unique in itself .
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who first tried to empower the victims and the exploited through the Collegium movement in Tamil Nadu and started a community based small financial system.
Even at the age of 100 , he is training yoga to people all over the world and so far 1500 people have been made yoga teachers .
Jamuna Tudu, popularly known as Eddie Taran in Jharkhand, did the courage to take the iron from Timber Mafia and Naxalites. He not only saved 50 hectares of forest but also motivated ten thousand women to protect trees and wildlife.
It is the glory of the hard work of Jamuna ji that today the villagers plant 18 trees on the birth of every child and 10 trees on the marriage of the girl
The story of Muktaben Pankajkumar Dagli of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration, despite being Divyang, it is difficult to find such an example that he did for the upliftment of Divyang women. By establishing an institution called Chakhu Mahila Sevakunj, he is engaged in the pious task of making the visually impaired children self-reliant.
The story of the farmer's aunt of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, i.e. Rajkumari Devi is very inspiring
They have set an example in the direction of women empowerment and making agriculture profitable .
Farmer Aunty linked 300 women from her area to Self Help Groups and motivated them to become financially self-reliant
He trained the women of the village as well as other means of employment. The special thing is that they have done the work of connecting technology with agriculture and my countrymen, perhaps for the first time, it has happened in the Padma awards given this year that 12 farmers have received Padma awards.
In general , very few people associated with the agricultural world and very few people who do direct farming have come to the list of Padmashree .
This in itself is a living picture of a changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk to you all about the experience that touches a heart that I have been experiencing for the past few days.
Nowadays wherever I go in the country, it is my endeavor to meet some beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat - PMJAY or PM Jan Arogya Yojana.
He was treated by this scheme and he became healthy and the head of the house became a victim of the accident while taking care of his family by working hard and was unable to work. This scheme benefitted him and he became healthy again and started living a new life.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme.
I found out what a big change was coming in the lives of the poor .
If you all know any poor person who is unable to get treatment for lack of money , tell him about this plan .
Different educational boards across the country will start the process for examination of board of class X and XII in the next few weeks.
My best wishes to all the students who take the exam, their parents and all the teachers.
A few days ago, a major event of the examination in Delhi was held in the format of Town Hall .
A special feature of the examination was that there was an open discussion on various subjects related to the examination .
There are many aspects that can definitely be beneficial to the students .
If all the students, their teachers and parents can see the recording of this entire program on YouTube, then best wishes to all my e-mail warriors for the forthcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, it is not possible to talk about India and not to talk about festivals.
There is hardly any day in our country, which does not have any significance, which does not have any festival
because we have this legacy of thousands of years old culture
After a few days the festival of Mahashivratri is about to come and this time Shivratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday then a special importance of it gets covered in our temple .
He discussed many topics and his confidence was really inspiring .
When I was talking to a bright young man during the conversation, he said, "I am a stage artist, I am a mistress in the entertainments programme, so I asked him the same thing, who do you mimicry?
So he told me that I am a prime minister
So I told him to do something, and it was a pleasant surprise for me, so he made a complete mimique of the way I talk about him in Mann Ki Baat.
I am glad to hear that people not only listen to me but also remember it on many occasions .
I was really impressed by the power of that Divyang young man .
My dear countrymen, it has been a unique experience for me to connect with you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Through radio , in a way , I come from millions of families every month .
Many times, talking to all of you, reading your letters or listening to the views sent on your phone, it seems to me that you have considered me as a part of your family.
It has been a very pleasant feeling for me .
Friends, Elections are the biggest celebration of democracy
The next two months, we'll be busy in all the elections.
I myself will be a candidate in this election
Respecting the healthy democratic tradition, the next mind will be on the last Sunday of May
That is, in the month of March, in the month of April and in the month of May, all our emotions of these three months, after the election, with a new faith, with the strength of your blessings, once again I will start the process of our conversation through Mann Ki Baat and I will keep talking to you for years.
Once again I thank you all from the heart.
The doctor of Shri Siddhaganga Math of Tumkur district in Karnataka Shri Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji was not among us .
Sivakumar Swamiji devoted his entire life to social service
Lord Basaveshwara has taught us that Kayakave Kailasa means performing our duties with hard work, is like being in the abode of Lord Shiva, Kailasha Dham.
His fame was as a scholar who had a wonderful hold on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer
He spent his entire life in the matter that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge
There was a priority in the life of Swami ji for the welfare of farmers in every way.
Siddhaganga Mutt regularly organizes animal and agricultural fairs .
I have had the privilege of receiving the blessings of Swamiji , the supreme god , several times .
In 2007, our former President Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had visited Tumkur on the occasion of the Centenary Celebrations of Shri Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for Swamiji on this occasion .
On giving, you receive happiness by inviting Almighty Will Blesss, all your actions. This poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhaganga Mutt in a beautiful way.
Once again, I pay my respects to such a great man
Election Commission was the founding day on January 25, which is celebrated as National Voters Day
Seeing the scale at which elections are held in India, people of the world are surprised and it is natural for every countryman to be proud of the Election Commission by seeing the very manner in which our Election Commission organizes it.
In our country, no stone is left unturned to ensure that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, gets a chance to vote.
When you listen to these things, it is very natural to be proud of the Election Commission
Keeping in mind that single voter, to get the opportunity to exercise his franchise, the entire team of Election Commission employees goes to far-flung areas and arranges for voting - and that is the beauty of our democracy.
I commend the Election Commission for constantly striving to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other staff who take part in the voting process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country, this will be the first time that the youth born in the 21st century will use their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
It is time for them to take responsibility for the country on their shoulders .
Now they ' re going to be part of the decision making process in the country .
It's time to connect your dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register themselves as voters if they are eligible to vote.
It is my duty to vote together - these values should grow within us .
For any reason in life, if not able to vote, there should be great pain
If you ever see something wrong in the country , it should be sad
I appeal to the well-known personalities of the country to join hands in voter registration or vote on the day of poll to make people aware about this campaign.
I hope a large number of youth will be registered as voters and with their participation will further strengthen our democracy
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done something wonderful, unforgettable for humanity.
Our country is multi-ratna-Vasundhara
On January 23, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different style .
On the birth anniversary of Netaji , I had the privilege of inaugurating a museum dedicated to the heroes of India ' s freedom struggle .
You know, many such rooms and buildings had been shut since independence in the Red Fort.
Those closed Red Fort rooms have been converted into beautiful museums, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and II.
Dedicated to the Indian National Army
In every brick of these museums, the fragrance of our glorious history has settled.
The tales of the heroes of our freedom struggle on every corner of the museum inspire us to go into history.
At the same place, the brave sons of Bharat Mata, Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan were tried by the British Government.
When I was visiting the Red Fort, Kranti Mandir, and the memories associated with Netaji, the members of Netaji's family presented me a very special cap.
Netaji used to wear the same hat
I kept the hat in the museum, so that the people coming there also see that hat and take inspiration from it for patriotism.
In fact , the bravery and patriotism of our heroes need to be repeated repeatedly to the new generation separately .
Just a month ago on 30th December I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands .
The tricolor was hoisted at the same place in a program, where Netaji Subhash Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted at the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because it was the tradition on August 15.
It was an occasion to complete 75 years of the formation of Azad Hind Government .
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a heroic soldier and efficient organizer
A brave soldier who played an important role in the freedom struggle .
Come to Delhi, you give me blood, I will give you freedom, as Netaji made a place in the heart of every Indian with powerful slogans
For many years it has been demanding that the files related to the leader be made public and I am happy that we can do this work.
I remember the day when Netaji's entire family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together we talked about Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose .
I am glad that efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26, Alipur Road related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir.
If you come to Delhi you must visit these places
My dear countrymen, today, when we are talking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share with you an episode related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered radio as an important medium of connecting with people . Similarly , Netaji had a very deep connection with the radio and he also chose radio to communicate with the countrymen .
I was told that these radio stations also broadcast weekly news bulletins which were in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashtun and Urdu languages.
The programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were popular among the masses and their programmes also gave great strength to the warriors of our freedom struggle .
In the same Kranti Mandir , a visual museum has been built .
This is an attempt to tell Indian art and culture in a very attractive way .
The museum has 4 historical exhibitions and there are more than 450 paintings and art works three centuries old
The Museum showcases the outstanding works of great artists like Amrita Sher-Gil, Raja Ravi Verma, Avinindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Roy, Saloz Mukherjee.
And I would especially urge you to visit there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
Now you might be wondering that art is happening here and I am talking to you about the outstanding work of Gurudev Tagore .
You have yet to go to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician .
But I would like to point out that Gurudev was also a painter
And the most important thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not name most of his actions .
He believed that the person watching his painting himself understood that painting, knowing the message given by him in painting from his perspective
His paintings have been displayed in European countries, in Russia and also in the US.
I hope you will go to the Kranti Mandir to see their paintings
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints
Our saints have given a message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
One such saint was - Saint Ravidas
Ravidas Jayanti is on February 19
Sant Ravidas ji ' s couplets are very famous
Saint Ravidas ji had given the greatest message through a few lines .
He had said that there is a caste in the caste-caste, which can not be joined by the radas man, unless the caste or the caste of banana is peeled, then the leaf under the leaf and nothing in the end comes out, but the whole tree is over, in the same way the person has been divided into castes and not human beings.
They used to say that if in fact God is in every human being, then it is not fair to divide them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi .
Saint Ravidas ji through his messages tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his life .
It would not be wrong to say that they have explained the real meaning of labor prestige to the world .
He used to say , If the mind is healed , then in kathauti , that is , if your mind and heart are holy , then the face of God resides in your heart .
Saint Ravidas ji's messages have influenced every section, every section of the people be it the Maharaja of Chittor or be it the Queen of Chittor or be it Meerabai, all of them were his followers.
I once again salute Sant Ravidas ji
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on MyGov that I should highlight the aspects related to India's space program and its future.
He also wants me to urge students to take interest in space programs and think beyond the sky, apart from something. Kiran ji, I appreciate your thoughts and especially the message given to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad, where I had the privilege of unveiling the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
The contribution of innumerable young scientists of the country to our space programme
We take pride in the fact that satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today are reaching space
The Kalam set created by our students on January 24 has been launched
Sounding rockets created by university students in Odisha have also made many records
The number of Space Missions that have been launched since the independence of the country till 2014, almost the same space mission has been started in the last four years.
We have also created a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft
We will soon record India's presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is also using space technology to protect lives.
Whether it is cyclone or rail and road safety, all of these are being assisted by space technology.
NAI devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which are helpful in their security as well as economic progress.
We are using space technology to improve the delivery and accountability of government services
Housing for All means that nearly 40 lakh houses of 23 states have been geo-tagged in this scheme.
Along with this, about three and a half million properties under MNREGA were also geo-taged
Our satellites today symbolize the country's growing power
It has a major contribution to our better relationship with many countries of the world .

Through its highly competitive launch services, India today launches satellites not only from developing countries but also from developed countries.
The sky and the stars are always very attractive for children .
Our Space Program gives children an opportunity to think big and move beyond the boundaries that were considered impossible so far.
It's a vision for our children to keep watching the stars, and inspire them to discover new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that the players who played, the players who played, and this time in 'Khelo India', a lot of young players and youngsters have come forward.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 games in Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January.
When our local ecosystem of sports will be strong, that is, when our base will be strong, only then our youth will be able to perform the best of their ability in the country and around the world.
This time in Khelo India, players from every state have done well at their own level.
The life of many players who have won medals is a tremendous inspiration .
They live in a parking shad with their family
At the same time, the captain of Maharashtra's Under-21 women's kabaddi team is from Sonali Helvi Satara.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother promoted Sonali's skills
It is often seen that in sports like kabaddi, daughters do not get so much boost
In spite of this, Sonali chose Kabaddi and performed outstanding
Asansols 10-year-old Abhinav Shaw is the youngest gold medal winner in the Khelo India Youth Games.
Akshaya Baswani Kamti, a farmer's daughter from Karnataka won gold medal in weightlifting
He credited his victory to his father, his father is a farmer in Belgaum
When we are talking about the creation of India, it is the resolve of youth power, it is New India.
These stories of Khelo India show that not only the people of big cities are contributing to the creation of a New India but they also contribute to the youth of small towns, villages and cities, young sports talent.
