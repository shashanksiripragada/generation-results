Ram Janmabhoomi: The High Court is likely to pronounce its verdict today on the request of the Muslim community seeking reconsideration of the Supreme Court's 14th verdict on the rights of Babri Masjid Malik.
It may be noted that the High Court has said that Namaz is not an integral part of Islam in the mosque.
According to the News Agency, the Chief Justice of India, Deepak Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice S. Abdul Nazir, will hear their verdict on the matter.
The bench had reserved it on 20th July.
This special conclusion was raised in the 1949 judgment of a radical M. Siddike M. Isla Faruqi in the Ayodhya case.
It is said that the mosque is not an integral part of the prayer performed by the followers of Islam.
Siddik has died and his representatives are being legal heirs.
The Muslim community has given a ruling in front of a bench headed by the Prime Minister to review the decision of the High Court with a bench of five members.

In the first visit itself, Secretary had predicted Earth Shaw.
Sports Desk: Earth Shaw has made a mark for the century-old fast track in his Test Match Dubai.
The Earthquake is comparable to Sachin Tendulkar.
Just as the Earth has played a major role in school-level, Sachin has also been in the discussion of Inning Rama.
Sachin Tendulkar, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr.

Sachin Tendulkar was also happy from the beginning of the Earthquake.
Secretary also appreciated the Earth.
Secretary recalled that it was for the first time that he had seen the Earthquake batting out and had asked for it.
Sharing his experience to the Secretary, his friend Jagdish Chavan asked me once to watch the Earth Sheena batting, about 10 years ago.
Chavan said, These young players want to meet you and it would be good if you can meet them.
Secretary accepted his friend and reached to see his sitting.

How can the court language of the sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi of Ghazni be a part of Sanskrit, a participative language of the Somnath temple and a participative language of the common man
In fact, the research by Professor Shanta Pandey, historian of Delhi University, has shown that Ghaznis Rajbhasha was Sanskrit.
Just now, when Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr Gautam Patel and Dr Manibhai Prajapati for their service in Sanskrit, Sanskrit was only a folk language that was the language of the so-called higher Brahmins, it was natural for them to question.
Remembering the pundit slave document of Mumbai, the Prime Minister said.
Even today, the 87-year-old priest, who speaks in a simple Sanskrit manner with a rickshaw, is giving the final shape to the Sanskrit translation of the holy Quran.
The word Kuran is Sanskrit in his view.
The sound of the "Run" i.e. the sound of the press is heard on the earth.
Not only did he teach in Solapur's school, but today he is one of the greatest Sanskrit scholars of this country, who has been known as finger tips.
However, Panditji, who spent his normal life, did not look forward to interpreting him as a Sanskrit scholar in America or other countries for his marketing.
The princess of Thailand is a Sanskrit scholar.
Sanskrit is definitely taught there.
Interested people have to go to Bon University, Germany to learn Sanskrit from America.
In India, apart from Banaras Hindu University, in most of the universities, PHDs of Sanskrit are also written in the language of that state.
In Gujarat, the education of Sanskrit has been imparted in Gujarati, but it should be remembered that education was imparted in Taxila and Nalanda universities only in Sanskrit.
Prasad Pandey has said that the court language of the Sultan of Ghazni was not only Sanskrit but also his coins and coins have been inscribed in Sanskrit.
Pandey also noted that Panini, the architect of Sanskrit interpretation, was a resident of Shalapur in Afghanistan.
Pt. Nehru in his visit to Maru Hind has said that the power of Sanskrit language and the power of abiding power of Afghans and Pathans came down from Sanskrit.
Today, everyone accepts that not only Indian languages but also Indo-European languages are also derived from Sanskrit.
Dr. Ambedkar's words of nationalism are astonished that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution, and members of the other Muslim and South Indian Constituent Assembly, proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
When English was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on 13th September, 1949 against Hindi, Deputy Foreign Minister Dr B.V. Keshkar and Najruddin Ahmed were among those who proposed Sanskrit in the national language.
Considering the discussion on the day and the report published earlier in the National Herald of 11 September 1949, the Balkanisation of Sanskrit language is estimated.
Unfortunately, even today, we have not been able to determine our national language.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, have a place in our Constitution as Official Language.
As per the 2011 Census, Sanskrit is now the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country.
Nehru also spoke with great respect about Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly.
In the relevant editions of his book, he speaks about Sanskrit and the importance that the world scholars have attached to Sanskrit: Sir Williams Jones in 1874 said, "God knows how old Sanskrit language is.
It is completeer than a Greek language, more extensive than a Latin, and more familiar than both.
Nehru further notes: I do not know how many times Sanskrit has become a dead language i.e.
Today, the Sanskrit language is a prayer and as a Member of Parliament, Union Minister Smriti Irani is the only language to swear by.
We need to preserve the years of Sanskrit and make it a living and democratic language.
If the dead language of Israel can be revived, then Sanskrit is still a vibrant language.
It is a matter of pride if serious efforts are made to make it a public language or instead of symbolic efforts.
