Welcome
I welcome you all to this hall, which is home to a wide range of resources related to Odisha and Odisha.
A number of books and journals have been published in the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).
Some books written in other languages about Odisha are also available here.
You can see these things, you can take them to your computer.
I've been in the main part of this collection, from a special job on the coast.
Launched in 2004, the objective of the project is to make it easier and more efficient to computerize in the language of Odisha and to promote the heritage of Odisha with the help of computers.
The first outcome of the second volume was the digital version of Purna Chandra Palani Linguistics, dedicated to the people of India in 2006.
1811-1942 (2008), 1856-1950 (2012), 1856-1950 (2012), 1811-1942 (2008), 1811-1942 (2008) and 18156-1950 (2012) 100,000 (2012).
In the first phase, these digital products were made available through devices like CD-DVD.
The internet is now available in all parts of the world.
I hope that new friends will become eager to digitize their books and connect them with them.They will also be able to do the job of preparing books, but they will also do the job of doing the job of making books, so that there is no need of technology, the role of the institutions will be crucial.
The boat.
The team has played a pivotal role in shaping the Web Site of Audio-Vishwa.
In the beginning of 1980s, the boat was born as a centre of science and education, with an aim to take science to the masses.
It sought to bring about a vast and profound experience in science.
It used to inspire the elders to become the medium of laying the foundation of science mind in the minds of children.
The key way of our strategy was to connect the living links with each other.
Organizing workshops, camps, seminars, lectures etc. for children, teachers, workers and aspiring adults was the hallmark of this relationship.
These were supplemented by visual aids such as science sports and models, pak kits and posters and slides.
The science wave magazine, based on education, science and development, sought to play the origins of this science into the reader's mind, as well as to connect science to children and workers with the quest to foster curiosity and creativity.
An attempt was made to explain the science in a simple language and to connect the modern language of science to the language of the town.
The two main tasks which were to be undertaken were to collect and synthesize the words and interpretations of science in different sanitary languages, and to review the science-related words and commentary in different sanitaries.
One of the two important things is to understand the difficulties being faced by the language and the old market book and the magazine.

The use of the developed Unicode System has the potential to overcome this pandemic.
However, there was no one in the town to use it, and there was a small reason behind this thing that there was no one to use it.
A number of channels have been developed to improve it, but most of them are not based on inscriptive standards.

Daud was not interested in creating or creating a web site for the reserved items.
This was because there was a need to disrupt the maintenance of the infrastructure while increasing the availability of technology and resources.
Discussions were held with some parties and institutions for the same but no specific results were received.
In the end, the work on its website started in the middle of April and today it completed one step, but it is far from complete.
Todays web site is mainly a digital library, which is the main feature of 1950s journals and referrals and special departments.Today, the number of books is very low, but we plan to add new books every week, some of which have not been done in the department, some of which have been pending with the resources and associations, and some are yet to be completed in technical terms.

Newspapers and other regular publications are very important for the development of any language or literature.
In 1866, Utkal Deepika, the first newspaper in Odisha, brought out a new model in the market - Odisha.
Its publication was very important in view of the social conditions of that time.
And it was published as a newspaper.
In order to address the shortage of journals, the journals of the time used to provide space for short-term feature articles and important strategic discussions were also held on the subject.
From 1844 to 1866, three monthly monthly journals were published and closed down a few days later.
During 1866 to 1897, a few more magazines were published and closed.
Newspapers helped a lot in language development and instead of using lucid language, it became a medium for ordinary people to understand and use local words to publish stories from different parts of the country and in many ways newspapers played a role in popularizing the language.
The list of old track newspaper in the web site has been listed below: In this website, click on a mouse click on a key to the Khabarkaj list on the left side, the location of the labour news paper is also available on the website and the facility to download it is also available.

Newspapers played a vital role in strengthening the composition of raw material in the language of Goa.
This article could be further promoted through various magazines.
The long-standing journal of the magazine also facilitated intensive discussion.
They helped in the debate, and opened up avenues for the development of ideas, in a short span of time.
As the books were light and short, the common man also got the opportunity to read and know about various subjects.
The authors, through a magazine to give a written form to their initial thoughts, prepared the subject matter based on the reader's response and compiled it into a book.
In 1769, the first journal of the Kaushalya language, Kujibir Math was published as a Handlekha magazine by Mahant Sadhu Sundar Das.
After the closure of the magazine, Prabodh Chandraika was published in 1856-58 and it was published in 1861 in the name of Arunodaya, which was published for nearly three years, but it is sad that no number of the first and third magazines are available anywhere.
In 1873, Utakal Khashan, the first monthly magazine published in Balasore, was a Muslim literature.
After this, Utkal Madhup (1878), Pradeep (1885) and others were short-lived.
Maternal Literature, born in 1897, became a prestigious publication in the Maunal literature.
It has a long life span in the journals published till date.
In the 20th century, many more magazines such as Mukur (1906), Satyawadi (1915), Sahkar (1920), Navbharat (1934) were brought out, and each one of them was inspired by themes such as theme, editing, publications, etc., and encouraged each and every one of them in their own way to create and nurture a new national language and literature.
Most of them touched a wide range of topics.
But for special groups like girls, women, co-workers and some special journal on religion/theology, education and science came out from 1950 years ago, science-based science fiction (1880), shyabandhu (1885), pirika (1917, women), Panchamrit (1920, 200, children-kishor), etc., were some examples of these.
In the 1950s, some of the new journals like 'Jhanker' (1949), 'Sansar' (1951), 'Samabesh' (1955), 'Navjeevan' (1956), 'Konark (1958), and some of the new journals like 'Konark' (19558) closed in a few years and some more new journals came out.

This direction is very important because it is difficult to get all the contributions made by several eminent creators.

The publishers are busy hiding it, the creators are impatient.
