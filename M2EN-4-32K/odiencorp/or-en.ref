But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:
Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.
Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,
Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work. Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:
And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.
But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.
And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.
And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.
Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.
For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:
For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.
For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.
Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.
The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.
Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;
Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.
For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.
Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.
And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.
So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.
Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.
Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.
Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.
Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth.
For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.
Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.
And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.
For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.
Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.
Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.
If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed.
For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.
The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;
But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.
And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.
For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.
And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.
And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.
And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;
And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;
And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.

Welcome
Welcome to this treasure trove of many things Odia and Odisha.
At present it is primarily a digital library of Odia literature featuring mainly printed periodicals and books in Odia language.
It also presents some material about Odisha and Odia in other languages as well as translations of Odia writings.
The material presented on this website are being offered free for browsing and download with the aim of enhancing the dwindling interest in the language.
The material presented here have been generated primarily by Srujanika.
This work was started in 2004 under a special effort called Project Rebati which aimed to 1. develop and strengthen Odia language computing resources, and 2. to preserve printed material relating to Odisha and Odia language through digitization and to make these easily available.
The first output from the digitization work was the digital version of the Purnachandra Odia Bhasakosha (2006).
This was followed by other digital compilations like the Collection of Odia Dictionaries, 1811-1942 (2008), Odia Periodicals, 1856-1950 (2012) and the collected works of many individual writers.
So far these have been made available on physical media like CD/DVD/flash drive primarily for the use of researchers and individuals.
But this method had its limitations which this website intends to overcome and make everything available around the world.
Individuals and, more particularly Institutions, interested in taking up digitization and related works like compilation of bibliography are invited to join hands with us and carry the work forward.
Srujanika
The main group behind the ‘Odia Bibhaba’ website is Srujanika, an academic group interested in science, education and development.
Conceived around 1980, Srujanika evolved as a functional group during 1983-84 and was formalised as a Society for Research and Innovation in Science, Education and Development in 1987.
Its objective, in the broadest sense, was Learning With Things Around.
Operationally, it tried to create an excitement about and deeper appreciation for science in the young minds. Sensitizing the adults about this work and involving them in the process was an essential component.
Personal interaction with the children and adults through hands-on activities using easily available material was the main approach.
This was done through camps, workshops and informal short sessions and was supplemented with publication of illustrated manuals as well as other resource materials.
Science toys and kits, posters, slides etc. played a role in taking science beyond the classroom.
A magazine ‘Bigyan Tarang’ played a central role in linking all these activities and acted as a medium of interaction among the readers/workers.
Odia language, being central to this work, became a subject of deeper study for the senior workers. Developing simple linguistic style and common words for presenting matters science was a general area of emphasis.
As a result two special projects emerged: 1. compiling the science articles written in Odia language, and 2. examining the available dictionaries for scientific terminology and explanations. The latter work bought us into intimate contact with the Purnachandra Odia Bhasakosha and its rich science content.
One thing became painfully apparent from this endeavour – it is extremely difficult to get access to the copies of old Odia publications. Many were lost for ever.
This led to the thought of preserving and aggregating these rare resources in digital form.
That was the year 2004 when project Rebati was born.
Storehouse of Odia Publications
Different types of material housed in this digital library can be accessed from this page.
At present these are listed under the categories of Newspaper, Magazines, Books, Compilations and Reference.
The ‘Compilation’ category presents collections of individual creators or institutions/topics.
Books of great interest and of lasting value, like Dictionaries, Encyclopedias, Bibliography and Books giving broad idea about Odisha/Odia, are kept under the Reference category.
Other categories will be added in future as needed.
Each category presents a page with details of the material contained in it.
That page also provides facility for opening/downloading the material.
Early Publications
Early Odia Writing – Caryagitika
These poems composed by the Bhuddhist monks around the 10th century CE are cosidered the earliest Odia writings and have proven to be of immense value for the linguists trying to understand the development of Odia language.
Hence it would be worth at least a glance by all interested in Odia and Odisha.
Simple rendering of these poems in contemporary Odia language will be added here soon.
Early Prose – Madala Panji
The term ‘Madala Panji’ is known to all Odias, many use the word in a satirical sense for something fat.
Opinions still vary on its name and on when it was written with 11th-12th century CE being generally accepted. In the words of Prof. Arttaballav Mohanty Madala Panji “occupies a very important place in the discussions on the development of prose writing in regional languages of India.”
From Modern Odia Literature
First Drama – Babaji (Jaganmohan Lala, 1877). Reprinted version with Kabichandra Kalicharan Patnaik’s introduction.
First Novel – Padmamali (Umesh Chandra Sarkar, 1888)
First Short Story – Rebati (Fakir Mohan Senapati, 1898)
Rebati (English), Translation: Kishoricharan Das
Rebati (Hindi), Translation: Sibapriya Mohapatra
Odia Language Showcase
Everyone has some things she/he treasures – individuals, groups, societies... So also for the Odia nation. Some such treasures that are held dear to Odisha and Odias are showcased here.
This presentation aims at arousing interest about these treasures and to give a chance to the aroused to have a glimpse at them. More material on these subjects can be found in the book section.
Earliest Odia Writings – Caryagitika, Writings from the middle period – Madala Panji, From the modern period – first drama, novel, short story.
Gitagobinda – The immortal lyrics of Jayadeb with various translations of it – Original Sanskrit verses, Odia lyrics by Dharanidhar, Prose rendering by Nilamani Mishra and English translation by the Odisha State Museum.
Siddhant Darpan – the great work by naked-eye astronomer Samanta Chandrasekhar (Pathani Samanta), original Sanskrit along with its translations into Odia, Hindi, English and analysis/interpretations of his work.
The monumental lexicon of Odia language – Purnachandra Odia Bhasakosha
Odia Dictionary
It contains about 30,000 root words each in Odia and English along with their meanings.
The dictionary can be searched by typing any word in the ‘search’ field on the right.
Typing can be done on the computer keyboard or the onscreen keyboard provided here.
The keyboard can be opened by clicking on the ‘/Keyboard’ button and input can be switched between Odia/English by clicking on the language button.
One needs to have an Unicode Odia font installed on the system for this. Computers with windows 7 or higher usually have Kalinga font installed.
Otherwise such fonts can be downloaded free and used – please see the ‘resources’ section for details.
For typing in Odia:
1. click on the desired alphabet pressing the shift key if required,
2. Click on the matra after the alphabet as needed,
3. To type conjunct and compound characters, use halant between two consonants, e.g.,    = ,    = .
After typing with the onscreen-keyboard, press down arrow () key on computer keyboard to get word transfered to the dictionary search field.
Odia Unicode Keyboard
Unicode encoding developed later has the ability to overcome this restriction (Odia Unicode Chart).
But it is hardly used for Odia language work. One of the problems was the faulty keyboard layout in MS Windows 7.
Several keyboards have been developed to overcome this problem, but most do not adhere to the INSCRIPT keymap.
Presented here is a keyboard layout developed by Srujanika based on INSCRIPT.the downloadable zip file contains yhe necessary files for both Windows and Linux, Keymap and instructions for use.
It will work with Windows 7, 8 and 10.
Click here for keyboard download.
Keyboard is of paramount importance for working with computers.
ISCII encoding and INSCRIPT keyboard layout has been developed by C-DAC for the standardisation of Indian language computing.
Although notification has been made for their implementation, it has been largely ignored and many different encodings/keyboard layouts for the 8-bit fonts have been marketed.
This has led to a serious problem of non-iterchangeability of data composed with different engines. (Major coding charts for Odia).
Odia Romanization
Difficulties are faced with correct pronunciation of Odia words written with Roman alphabet.
Several methods have been developed to overcome this difficulty and the use of diacritic marks is one of these.
However, there is no standardisation for the use of diacritic marks for Odia.
This and the difficulties in typing these marks without the use of specialised software has hampered its use.
Srujanika uses a simple but adequate method using only six marks which can be typed with the operating system capabilities.
The diacritic marks are a part of extended Roman characters under the Unicode system.
The decimal codes for these characters are used for typing purposes.
A list of the marks used, their Unicode and decimal codes and instructions for use are given here.
The desired alphabet is typed first and keeping the alt key depressed the decimal code is entered on the numerical keypad (num lock must be on).
The combined character with diacritic mark is formed when the alt key is released.
A font like Arial or Times New Roman must be used since not all fonts have the diacritic characters.
It is also best to use a plain text editor like Notepad or Wordpad for typing these – word processors like MS Word Or LibreOffice Write do not form the combined characters in some cases. However, the typed material can be copied and pasted into other applications.
One needs to enter two diacritic marks on a single character which can be done by inputting the decimals codes one after the other with the alt key pressed.
Diacritics for some old characters not used now but found in old texts are also included. Odia Diacritic Chart and Instructions can be downloaded here
Font Converters
Programs for converting text composed in 8bit fonts to Unicode are given here.
Please click on any title to download it.
1. deisciify) [Runs on Linux] – Text files with correct ISCII encoding can be converted to Unicode with this program. It can convert multiple files at a time in batch mode. This will work with text composed with GIST engine, e.g, LEAP Office, iLEAP, LEAPpp, ISM, as these follow ISCII encoding. Will not work with Shreelipe, Akruti and other engines not conforming to the ISCII standard. It will not work on native PageMaker files even when composed with GIST, but the file contents can be converted after exporting as text.
2. convert [Runs on Linux] – PageMaker files composed with GIST can be converted to Unicode with this program after exporting the contents as text.
3. correction [Runs on Linux] – Problems with interchanging of ba/wa and ja/ya are face often when converting 8bit text to Unicode. This program corrects such mistakes.
4. PageMaker files prepared with various engines like GIST, Shreelipi and Akruti can be converted with specific programs given here. These converters were developed by Srujanika in an early phase of the work and have been further developed by the Wikipedia group – GIST, Akruti, Shreelipi. The unified converter developed by the Wikipedia group can be used for different engines – Wikipedia converter। These converters will work on both Linux and Windows.
Corpus Tools
Building and analysing word corpora form an important part of linguistic studies.
This can be done effectively through computer programs these days.
Selecting single instances of the words with multiple occurrence and counting their frequencies can be done in an automated manner with the odisort program [Runs on Linux].
deisciify, convert, correction, odisort (Utility Programs) download: These four programs are best run from a single directory as these have common dependencies. These can be downloaded together along with instructions for use here. Utility Programs.
Websites Hosting Odia Material
Odia digital material are now available at many places on the internet. Some of these are:
1. Internet Archive
2. Wikisource
3. NIT – Rourkela
4. Odia
5. Odia Virtual Akademy
Website numbers 4 and 5 above host some material digitized by Srujanika without contacting us or acknowledging the source.
The activities of the Odia Virtual Academy is the most improper and unfortunate in this regard – around 90% of its contents are taken from the CD/DVD’s prepared by Srujanika.
Although it is a Govt. of Odiash project, very little material from the State Archives, Museum, Sahitya Akdemi etc. (which have been spending significant amounts of public funds for digitization) are given.
Useful Websites of Associates
6. Arvind Gupta: It hosts all Srujanika’ publications along with an extensive collection of material on education and science.
7. Eklavya: Hosts many interesting books and magazines relating to education and science, mainly in Hindi and English. Very useful for children’s literature.
Odia Language Resources
Computer work in Odia language requires some special techniques and tools.
Some such tools have been developed by Srujanika and some others have been adapted from other sources.These are being presented here for use by anyone interested.
It is also hoped that the users will develop these furthe and add new ones as needed.
Also provided are links to other tolls which have been found useful in our work. There may be other such material which we do not know about – will add these if brought to our notice.
There are many websites now where digital Odia material are available. Srujanika is associated with some of hese either directly or indirectly. Some links to such websites and groups are given here.

12 November 2017, Sunday
The seeds of the website you are visiting today was sown some thirteen years back.
Efforts were initiated then by Srujanika for improving computer work in Odia language and for preserving Odia printed material using computers.
An outline of this can be found on the ‘about’ page, will add more details in future.
But Srujanika was hesitant to take up the work of hosting a website for these digital treasures.
The major reason was that this would take away from the limited manpower available for the main work of digitization. Another factor was the lack of expertise for the web work within the core group and of financial resourses.
Collaborations were sought with other institutions, both private and government, who could put up and manage a website on a long term basis.
All these led us to take the difficult decision, in April this year, of developing a website ourselves. And what you see today is the first results of that decision. Much remains to be done in the days ahead.
As it stands now the website is a digital library. The major contents are the Odia periodicals (newspapers and magazines) published before 1950, the sections reference and showcase and a working dictionary. The contents of the book section is still small, but this will grow to become the major section with regular additions. There are other gaps and technical deficiencies too which will addressed in the coming weeks.
We hope that the website will create some enthusiasm and bring in new involvements. Only that can help it to develop into an useful asset for the Odia language. Your feedback on the website will be most valuable for us in moving ahead.
Thoughts
Many thoughts appear in course of our work and reactions from friends too. These prove valuable in carrying the work forward. But the readers never get to know this.
Some things, however, need be shared and some are just fun to pass around. This is a place for some such musings.
Odia Newspapers
Periodical publications like newspapers and magazines play an important role in the development of any language and its literature.
The first Odia newspaper, a weekly in tabloid format, Utkal Dipika appeared in 1866 – a time of socio-political tumult in Odisha.
A devastating famine was raging through the region and the language was facing an issue of survival.
Utkal Dipika set about voicing the people’s concern about these and setting the tone for a feeling of nationalism among the Odia people.
In addition to meeting it journalistic role it contributed immensely to the development of Odia prose writing and to public debate on the current issues.
There were three earlier periodicals in Odia language published between 1849 and 1863, all being monthlies. But these did not survive for long.
Only two other major newspapers – Balasore Sambadbahika (1868) and Sambalpur Hiteishini (1889) – continued for some noticeable time.
During this period magazines carrying longer articles were not common. Perhaps because of this the newspapers often carried longer features along with smaller news items. This helped in attracting a larger readership and also helped in reading habit among the general public.
Clicking on the ‘Newspaper Index‘ button on the left will open a new page listing the digitized Odia newspapers available on this website. Details of the individual items as well as links for opening/downloading these can also be found there. published during the pre-independence period.
Odia Magazines
Newspapers played an important role in developing prose writing and in creating reading habit among the general public.
Magazines built upon this and took the development process much farther.
Longer articles in the magazines provided scope for delving deeper into a subject.
Their relatively high frequency was conducive for ongoing debates and for the refinement of ideas through reader reactions.
The articles were shorter and lighter than the contents of a book which attracted a larger readership interested in thought and information.
The magazines also became a vehicle for literary entertainment. Writers found that writing in a magazine helped them in developing a theme which could ultimately be shaped into a book.
The first Odia periodical – Kujibara Patra – was a hand written one published during the 1769 by Sadhu Sundar Das, the Mahanta of Kujibabra Math.
The first printed magazine, Gyanaruna, appeared in 1849 after the establishment of printing press at Cuttack by the Christian Missionaries in 1836. This was followed by Prabodha Chandrika in 1856 and Arunodaya in 1861. All three were monthlies and were published for less than three years. Unfortunately no copies of the first and the third exist today.
‘Utkal Darpan’ appeared in 1873 from Baleswar as a monthly and is considered as the first Literary magazine in Odia language.
This and the ones following it – for example, ‘Utkal Madhupa’ (1878), ‘Pradeepa’ (1885) – remained in publication for only a short duration.
Publication of ‘Utkal Sahitya’ in 1897 brought about a new era in Odia literary efforts.
Utkal Sahitya launched after much planning by a committed group and presented many new features on its pages.
It also went on to being one of the longest running publications in Odia language. More magazines appeared after the turn of the century, Mukur (1906), Satyabadi (1915), Sahakar (1920), Naba Bharat (1934) being the more notable ones, and enriched the Odia literature with writings in newer areas.
Most magazines carried writings on wide ranging subjects.
But there also existed magazines that addressed themselves to specific areas/audience like education, children, women, religion and science. Some examples of these are ‘Bigyan Darpan’ (1880, science), ‘Sikshabandhu’ (1885, education), ‘Paricharika’ (1917, women), ‘Panchamruta’ (1920, children). Satire/humor oriented magazines like Dagaro (1937) and Niankhunta (1938) also appeared before 1950 and continued long after.
It is interesting to note that most of the Odia magazines that were in publication during the first half of the twentieth century folded up by 1950. A new generation took their place prominet among which were ‘Jhankar’ (1949), ‘Sansar’ (1951), ‘Samabesa’ (1955), ‘Nabajivan’ (1956), Konarka (1958). Some of these went out of publication after some years and still newer one joined the scene. More information on these and other publications can be found in the reference>bibliography section.
The major problem faced while putting up this digital collection was the difficulty in getting the original copies. Many are lost for ever and many others in the custody of individuals/institutions are impossible to access. Whatever could still be collected are presented in this website. To access these please click on the ‘Magazine Index‘ button on the left.
Books
The first odia printed book, New Testanment, came out in 1807 from the Serampore Press in the neighbouring Bengal.
Interestingly it was followed in 1811 by a ‘Word Book’ titled ‘A Vocabulary: Ooriya And English For The Use Of Students’.
With the establishment of English schools need for text books arose and these were also printed at Serampore.
Most notable of these was a dictionary in 3 volumes by published during 1841-43.
The text book on physical science – ‘Padarthabidya Sara’ – by Amos Sutton published in 1832 was the first science book printed in Odia.
The table below lists most of the digitized books available on this site.
These can be sorted as desired by clicking on the arrows next to the headers in the first row.
The number of entries to be displayed on a page can be set on the ‘Show__entries’ window and the entire database can be searched through the ‘search’ window on the right.
Several other books are to be found under Compilation and Reference categories which can be accessed through the links on the left.
Compilations
There is a creator behind every creation.The creator can be an individual, a group or an institution.
When looked at in its totality these creations become more valuable than the sum of the isolated creations.
It helps in understanding the evolution of the work and the changing influence of the contemporary happenings on it.
That is the thought behind putting together compendiums of individual authors etc.
The idea is being extended here to form digital compendiums or granthabalis of important creators – individuals and groups – in Odia language. Also included are some collections of material on a particular subject or thought.

It consists of about 10,000 pages in seven volumes and presents about 1,85,000 root words with their meaning in Odia and English along with Bengali and Hindi equivalents.
Praharaj led an interesting life.
he was a lawyer by profession, but his prose writings occupy a special place in Odia literature.
Many of his contemporaries became the object of his sharp wit and satire. His views and personal life, however, were not free from controversy.
Praharaj has credited Pitambari as his most important co-worker in the compilation of Bhasakosha.
But she has also been mired in the family tussles of Praharaj as well as in his unnatural death.
Pitambari’s life became very difficult after Praharaj’s death and she died a homelss destitute in the end.

Siddhant Darpan
Mahamahopaddyaya Chandrasekhar Sinha Samanta (1835-1904), better known as Pathani Samanta to all Odias, was an accomplished naked-eye astronomer. He was one of the few ‘Siddhantic’ astronomers who had worked many centuries later than the recognised Siddhantic period. He lived and carried out his astronomical work at a time when advanced instruments were in use elsewhere. Yet the accuracy of Samanta’s data collected with homemade instruments still amazes those who study his work.
His painstaking observations and interpretations are chronicled in his magnum opus ‘Siddhant Darpan’. Presented here are the digital copies of his original Sanskrit text and Odia, Hindi and English translations along with mathematical interpretations of and discussions on his work.

Gitagobinda
Gitagobinda, composed in the 12th century CE by the Odishan poet Jayadeb, is an immortal Kavya describing the union and separation of Radha-Krishna.
It consists of 72 slokas distributed unevenly in 12 sargas and 24 gitas.
Gitas 1 and 10 have 11 and five stanzas respectively.
All other gitas have 8 stanzas – hence called astapadis.
The language of Gitagovinda is charmingly lyrical conveying the deep thoughts of the kavya.
This gives it an important place in the fields of music, dance and literature. Traditionally, Gitagobinda is sung in the temole of Lord Jagannath during the evening worship and on special occasions like the Badasinhar attiring of Jagannath.
Devadasis of earlier era used to sing Gitagobinda and dance to its tunes in front of the Lord.
Lord Vishnu’s dasavatar (ten incarnations) finds a place in many Indian classics.
But its presentation in Gitagobinda is the most popular, so much so that common people are found to be humming it. The original Sanskrit slokas of Gitagbinda has been translated into many languages since its composition. The early Odia rendering by Dharanidhar Das (Mishra) in the 18th century CE is among the most popular.
Gitagobinda is presented here as a composite of the original Sanskrit slokas, Dharanidhar’s Odia verses, Nilamani Mishra’s Odia prose and English prose by the Odisha State Museum along with thumbnails of the palm leaf folios. The palm leaf images have been sourced from the Odisha Virtual Academy (ova.odisha.gov.in) website – larger sized images of the palm leaf folios can be found there.
The Gitagobind composite given here is quite large (201 pages) – therefore it has been presented in six parts for easier viewing.
Encyclopedia
Almnac-like publications compiling various facts have been attempted in Odia language since early twentieth century.
‘Ratnakosha’ – a compendium of choicest facts published in mid-1930’s – is a majpr example of such books.
The famous lexicon – Purnachandra Odia Bhasakosha – published during the 1930’s acted as an encyclopedia in a minor way by included many short encyclopedic articles.
The first true encyclopedic work came out in the early 1940’s in the form of “Sisu Sankhali” compiled by Balakrushna Kar.
But it could not progress beyond only two volumes – Bichitra Jibajagata (1941) and Bichitra Itihasa (1943).
It tried to continue the planned series in 1957, but had to close after a single volume – Bichitra Biswa.
However, these three volumes were well produced with lots of illustrations and were quite popular.
Two new attempts were made during the 1950’s for compiling comprehensive encyclopedia with alphabetic entries.
The effort under the auspices of the Utkal University ended with a 4-volume set of condensed encyclopedia. The other effort be Binode Kanungo continued till his death in 1990 resulting in 40 volumes, but remaining quite incomplete. Some samples of the last effort, Jnanmandal, are given here along with other encyclopedia in Odia language.

Utkal Dipika
Utkal Dipika first appeared in 1866 during a critical time of the Odia Nation. This first newspaper from Odisha and in Odia language strived hard to present the grievous situation faced by the Odias because of the divastating famine – the Na’anka Durbhiksha – and the views of the Odia people to the Government. Gourishankar Ray, the founder and the editor of Utkal Dipika, was a wellknown writer and opinion-maker of the then Odisha and developed Utkal Dipika as a rallying point for the people concerned about Odia and Odisha. The newspaper and the people associated with it also played an important role in countering the attack faced by the Odia language at the time.
And it continued to fulfil its committment to the Odia Nation till the formation of a separate state in 1936. During this long life span it served as a vehicle for all discussions relating to the problems and development of Odia language and culture. In addition to news and views it carried some long essays on important topics, poetry and books reviews etc. The advertisements/announcements on its pages of other publications still serves as an important reference source.

Dictionaries play an important role in the development of any language.
These reflect the growth of the language and also help in strengthening the use of it. Dictionaries are being compiled in all languages for this reason.
The first dictionary in Odia language was compiled by the great poet Upendra Bhanja (c.1670-1740).
This was a rhyming dictionary – Gitabhidhan – which listed the words ending with similar letters to help in composing rhyming poetry.
The first Odia “dictionary” of the modern times was Mohun Prasad Thakoor’s ‘Vocabulary’ published in 1811.
This was more a collection of Odia words arranged by subjects along with English meaning and pronunciation to help the non-Odia missionaries and administrators.
The dictionary by Rev. Amos Sutton and colleagues, published in 3 volumes during 1941-43 was the first major dictionary covering English-Odia, Odia-Odia and Odia-English presentations.
Many dictionaries followed over the decades to enrich the Odia language.
Some noteworthy attempt among these were Utkal Abhidhan (J Rao, 1891), Sabdatattwabodha Abhidhan (G Nandasharma, 1916), Purnachandra Odia Bhasakosha (GC Praharaj, 1931-40) and Pramoda Abhidhan (P Deb, 1942), published during the centenary of Sutton’s work.
Still more dictionaries continued to be published, but these have not kept up with the time by incorporating newer words and ideas. However, a few specialised attempts kept the hopes of finding new directions alive.
