The right solution for this is that only if I believe that people will come forward to follow it.

Since it has been going on for 6 months, it has now become a habit.

There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.
However, it is not just praiseworthy that Bhagat Singh and his colleagues gave a new dimension and clear idea to revolutionary movements and then to Indian politics.
We can see today that there is an opinion among the people that revolutionaries are just morons and chisels that are not concerned about human life.
The period of Bhagat Singh gives us a glimpse of his humanism, his clarity of thought and capability.
On April 19, 1929, the name of Bhagat Singh became widespread in India only after the bombing of the House.
In Tamilnadu, he made his debut in the 1930s, a little further away.
But within a year of his introduction, his fame has spread rapidly in all corners of Tamilnadu.
This is the most surprising news in history that no leader of the northern country, including Gandhi, has ever spread to Tamil Nadu in such a short time.
That's because of the father Periyar.
The following week of the assassination of Bhagat Singh, an editorial appeared in the Republican Week magazine entitled Bhagat Singh.
The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's character interests and put forward some views on the political situation of the day.
Parts from the editorial: -
'In fact, we would like to say that if Bhagat Singh was convinced that all his policies were correct and he was the right way, and if he had decided that he was the right way, we would certainly say that if he had not done so, he would not have been a healthy man.
Now we call him a real man.
It is our strong belief that India really needs the principle of Bhagat Singh ji.
If Shri Bhagat Singh had not been hanged and his life had not been restored, there would have been no evidence of this success.
And we will say that if we had not removed Bhagat Singh then it would have been possible for Gandhi Ji to work even more.
Why was a mother who sacrificed her life so that she could show the path of true equality and peace for the people of India so that she could lead the life of the world with her own selflessness.
We appreciate Bhagat Singh as a man of mind, a man, and a man of hand!'
In the editorial of the Republic, Father Periyar mentioned this.
In this case, a police guard named Dennis Turner, who was in police service at the school, has arrested the girl who was holding her school for the reason she was beaten up by the teacher.
In fact, the girl's hand was tied with a plastic tag and taken to a police car, to a Juvenile Assessment Centre, where a photo of a girl with a name and name was taken to the culprits.
Copies of his handwriting have also been taken out.
This information was given to the family members of the girl child and handed over to her family.
I do not know if he had taken another child to the police station.
Her grandmother Kirkland, who agreed to release the identity of the little girl, said in an interview with the media: 'Sleep Appnea' is a sleeping problem, and this is the result of the medicines she takes.
I was shocked to say that he was arrested, saying that it is difficult to understand and explain to any six-year-old child.

The film was shot in a state-of-the-art valley between Vikram Lander and two faces - Sibbe Lies en and Mancinus C.
After examining these films, it is certain that Vikram lander will land on the ground.
That's why they have gone a little distance from the place where they had to land.

At that time, we sent films made during the dark hours of the evening.

Since the light will be good at that time, there is a lot of chance for Vikram Lander to take a film," said Vikram.

Ramanujam, a late cartoonist, was one of the best painters.
He has produced a lot of students through the Research and Education Foundation.

In the last 8 years, the chief minister has asked a question to Pazhanisamy about the restrictions made in the AIADMK regime.
In a statement issued by its Treasurer Duraimurugan in this regard, the chief minister criticised the public sector without knowing any details.
The DMK Treasurer, Durimurugan, in his statement, said that the water opened up in Cauvery is thrown into the sea due to lack of government care and lack of administrative efficiency.
Our leader, M.K. Stalin, had expressed his concern about the responsibility of being the Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly as he did not have any concrete plans for the ADMK government to stop and save it on the way to Cauvery.
Taking a reply to the chief minister, Adappadi Palanisamy said, 'D.M.K. Win, who makes us blame, has he built a blockade in Cauvery under his rule?'
'I want to tell him that under the D.M.K. regime, we have been barred by the League rule at Mayanur in Cauvery.
Without knowing the details, can the Chief Minister, who is in charge of the public service, speak out of the truth?
The water resources of the earth grew in that area due to the dam built in Mynaur.
So agriculture flourished.
That is why today thousands of farmers of that region, even the tribal people of that region will be able to get the opportunity to express their gratitude to the cooperative government.
At that time, the construction of the dam in Mayanur was done according to the requirement.
There was no need to build more detentions.
If necessary, Kalaignar, who was then the then Chief Minister, would have given his permission, had given him funds, would have stepped up his work.
Therefore, there is nothing to blame the corporate government for protecting the interest of the Cauvery.
I ask how many obstacles have you built in Cauvery during the last eight years of the tenure of A.D.M.K.
Secondly, we have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the DMK regime.
Can you point out that at least one dam has been constructed in the ADMK regime so far
Don't lie.
If the opposition leader had not responded to their allegations - tell the evidence as to where we are building a detention or planning to build it.
'I am obliged to point out that the fact that in the T.M.C. regime, a detention of Cauvery has not been built in fact, may be beautiful for a personal eloquence, but for the Chief Minister who holds it, it's not civilized, it's not beautiful,' Durimurugan said.

Is the BJP doing caste politics in Tamilnadu?
In Tamilnadu, it is said that BJP will take up caste politics at the end of the day if it is not possible to clean up anywhere and keep Tamarai free.
When Modi was the Prime Minister for the first time, there was a situation in Tamil Nadu where he had to give up his hand.
After this, for the second time, that is, during the 2nd Empathy elections, Shri Amit Shah strongly asserted, "No farm will be known and there should be a flower in Tamilnadu."
But in the 5 constituencies where the contest was held, only the soil was covered.
Even though the BJP is all over the country, there is a wave of protests in Tamilnadu.
Above all, Triple Talaq, the Kashmir issue, the imposition of Hindi, and One Nation One Language.
It's all so mixed up so it's still in the air.
It is said that the BJP leadership is under strict control of the BJP officials in Tamilnadu and that is why it is said that even the state leadership could not be appointed.
Even if this is the case, the BJP is planning to root out the BJP in Tamilnadu in the coming assembly elections.
It is understood that the BJP leadership has come to a close conclusion through direct field reports and intelligence reports.
Accordingly, whether it be AIADMK or DMK, there are two Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and two Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and the people of Vannir.
So it is said that the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) is sorry for the parties.
It is this formula that the BJP has started working on it in hand.
We have decided to honor and honor those communities by giving them a post or by giving them importance.
Soundararajan's appointment as Telangana Governor is similar.
Similarly, the BJP government is reportedly giving importance to ISRO's top positions.
It is true that if the BJP performs the same duties in honour of every race then it will be a matter of pride and happiness for the people of that race.
Moreover, one thing that does not magnify in any case, this caste will keep the BJP busy in politics.
At the same time, when Tamilnadu is already in a state of caste politics, it is not known whether this act of BJP will be like adding more oil to the burning fire.
It is true that if the caste fire starts to burn, even a little bit of a lotus will blossom in Tamilnadu, it will burn black in the same fire!
