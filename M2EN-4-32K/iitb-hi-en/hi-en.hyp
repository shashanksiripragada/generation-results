Black box in your car?
While the US road planners are struggling with the lack of funds to improve the highway system, many people are looking at the solution in a small black box, which fits into your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by a motor-driver and transmits that information to the authorities, has now become a controversial issue for Washington and the State Planning Office to revive the old system to finance major US roads.
Generally, boring work like highway planning has suddenly become an issue of intense debate and vibrant coalitions.
Details of the milestones you have driven, and possibly the location that you have driven - and then use this information to prepare a tax bill - have joined the Libertarian Environmental Groups to mobilize support for allowing the Government to use these black boxes.
The tea party is stunned.
The American Civil Freedom Union is also very worried about raising various types of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how they can go into a system in the next decade, in which the driver pays for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken black box for test drive, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is really essential for our country.
"It is not a matter of choosing or not elected by us, it is to say Hassan Ikharata, who is the executive director of the South California Government Association, who is planning to start tracking every mile set by motor-drivers in California by 2025."
The manner in which we pay tax is going to change.
There is technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's Highway Trust Fund has almost become bankrupt, which is financed by American citizens by paying taxes on gas pumps.
American people do not buy as much gas as before.
Now the car runs more than ever in a gallon gas.
There has been no increase in federal tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cent per gallon.
Due to high gas prices, politicians refrain from increasing a single penny in tax.
Lee Munikh, a transport policy expert at Minnesota University, says, "gas tax is not absolutely motorable.
His state has recently installed tracking device in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the long run, it will work as the most logical alternative."
Vanx is called a Mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea is good for urban liberals because it can, for example, change in taxes to change the way the car runs, which can help in reducing jams and reducing greenhouse gas.
California planners are eager for this system while they are developing strategies to fulfill the targets set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Ripp Bill Shustar (A-PA), also considers the black box to be the most viable long-term option.
Independent sellers in the Region Foundation are also in favor of payment per mile by the driver.
Adrian Moore, Vice President of the Policy in the Region, said, "This is not just a tax which is going to the blind well."
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
This campaign has also been supported by two former US Transport Secretaries, who in their report in 2011 had shown favor to move forward in the direction of payment per mile from the Congress.
The US Senate approved a $90-million test project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of the rural law makers, who were representing such persons who had to walk a lot of miles to go to work on a daily basis or go to the city, the leadership of the House terminated that proposal there.
However, many states and cities themselves are moving forward in this direction.
The most interested is Oragon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
The New York City is also moving forward in this direction.
Illinois is trying with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, including 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) with the Eastern Seaboard, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on cars of 50 voluntary car drivers shortly before, the drivers were very impatient to think that the government can monitor every step.
Alauddin Khan, who guided strategic and performance management in the Nevada Transport Department, says, "The concern about Big Brother and other similar things was a major problem."
This is not something people wanted.
As the test progressed, the ACLU of Nevada had warned on its website: "It would be quite easy to convert these devices into a complete tracking device."
There is no need to develop a large, non-regulated technology infrastructure, which must be spread effectively to keep a record of every person's daily visits.
Nevada is one of the many states who are doing everything to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get the details of how much the car is running every day, but not where and when it is going on.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology has brought some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
This firm was not originally in the business of helping the state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which the drivers had to pay on their mileage basis.
But the device that it is testing is good for highway planners as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information which is uploaded by the modem at a fixed time interval.
Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage, said, "If you do not track the speed and place of people, they will be more interested in adopting this method."
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programs of the state.
There are also very low cost and low intervention methods to do this.
In Organ, planners are using different options to provide drivers.
They can choose a GPS enabled or GPS device.
Or you can not choose to take any device again, but you can choose to pay the prescribed fee on the basis of the average milestones decided by the residents of the state.
Other places are expected to sell the concept to concerned citizens by providing more facilities than lower ones in the device.
In New York city, transport officials are trying to develop such a taxi device, in which parking will also be able to pay the meter fee, "payment insurance will be provided according to their drive, and from other drivers will create a collection of real-time speed data, which can be used to avoid motor-driver traffic. "
It has been mentioned in the city planning document, "The motor-driver will be attracted to participation due to the benefits received from it."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps the entire discussion on payment according to the mile is a big commentary.
In the San Francisco Gulf region, the Metropolitan Transport Commission has said that Congress can deal with the problem of bankruptcy Highway Trust fund by increasing gas tax.
Additional one-time or annual fee may also be levied on drivers of hybrid or other cars whose vehicles do not use too much gas so that they pay their due share.
Randy Rentseler, director of the commission's legislation and public affairs, said, "When the aspirin can work, then what is the need for surgery for him?"
If we do this then millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, his death was due to drowning.
Of course, his friend has been taken into custody by the police for hiding the deceased's luggage with him.
The police has submitted the final report of the investigation of death in the court.
It is understood that on August 26, the police had recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Dariya.
His family had accused his friends of killing him because his mobile and other belongings were missing.
In the report, the police said that the phone and SIM of the deceased were examined and it was found that his phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman told in the inquiry that she has given this phone to her relative Ruhal Gauhar.
Rohil also lives in Padshahi Bagh and he was a friend of the late Zahid.
Ruhal went to Jhelum with Zahid after Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
Zahid opened his clothes and kept all the stuff on the edge, while Rohil went on the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, he only had clothes.
Rohil searched Zahid, but he did not get it.
On this, he picked up his mobile phone, watch and other things and kept it for his use.
He did not tell anyone that Zahid has drowned.
Police told the court that Zahid's death was due to drowning and it has also been confirmed in the post-mortem.
Of course, Rohil has been taken into custody under section 404 to hide the facts and the goods of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister 77-year-old Silvio Berlusconi, popularly known for the Bunga-Bunga parties, has married a 28-year-old girl in a very intelligence manner.
This is revealed by his family friend Martel Polanko.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been prime minister three times, has married former TV anchor Francisco Pascal in his personal chapal.

In the lower areas, the rain continued to stop between the sun's eye-michauli.
Along with this, cold wave has started in the whole plaintiff.
The cold can be estimated from the fact that the minimum temperature in Srinagar has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius, Gulmarg below minus -0.2 degrees and Leh at -1.8 degrees Celsius.
Leh was the coldest in the entire state.
At the same time, due to rain and snow, strategically important Srinagar-Leh national highway has been closed for traffic.

Asaram, lodged in jail on charges of sexual harassment, was once again disappointed with the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being presented as a drawing of children's blood, but the court rejected his demand to ban media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P. Sathasivam, while refusing to order the media to stop the news about Asaram, said that he has seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason to interfere in it.
When they are getting information from the police and others, how can we stop them?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of showing the news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They should file a case against whom, but the bench was not impressed with these arguments and refusing to intervene in the matter said that they have more options.
Even before this, the court has rejected Asaram's demand to ban media coverage.
Department officials claim that this is the biggest TDS theft so far.
The group operator of the mall cut TDS and paid the related financial institutions, but did not pay it in the public exchequer.
By doing so, TDS's rupee was deposited with himself.
On October 17, the investigation team from Mumbai had taken action in collaboration with the Jaipur investigation team.
In the investigation of this link, it was found that this businessman had cut TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team started the income tax survey on this group on Thursday.
The risk of sealing the account was raided and surveyed on the group of this mall operator about 15 days ago.
Angered by this action, the businessman has clearly told the officials of the Income Tax Department that he is not ready to pay TDS to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is continuously targeting them and taking action.
Officials investigating in this case have clarified that in case of non-payment, the recovery will be done by sealing the account.
Given the Diwali, the demand for sweets increases.
Given this, the sale of poor and fake Mave increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more shiny, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against fake Mava and chemical sweets.
The department seized 5 thousand spoons from Mawa and Kweta Colony of 70 thousand from Madhya Pradesh.
With the increase in demand for sweets in the market, the demand for poor Mave from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The information department got the information to bring the poor Mave kept in the dirt from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
Nagpur is being procured from the transport garage.
The department took possession of this Mave, which was priced at Rs 70 thousand.
Fear of action has not given any right to Mave.
The department destroyed it by considering the claim (undeclared) property.
The department raided Jitendra Caters located in Kweta Colony and recovered about 5 thousand spoons.
Sodium Hydrosulphite was used to shine and stay for a long time.
Its sample will be sent to the laboratory.
Department's co-ordinator S. S. Deshmukh said that the campaign for the arrest of chemical sweet and poor and fake Mave will continue.
In the next few days, information about this campaign has been given by the department.
Consumption of these sweets can also cause toxicity.
The department asked the sweet businessmen to make good milk, sweet from the maw.
The appeal has been made to the people on behalf of the appeal department to be cautious of fake sweets and mawa.
Selected 42 senior BJP leaders of the state BJP received their strong reception at the airport.
It is notable that Modi has come on a tour of Bihar for the consolation tour organized by the BJP.
Organizing the Santana Yatra is the exercise of healing the families of those killed in the blasts in Patna by the BJP.
It is notable that during the Hunkar rally of Narendra Modi on October 27 in Patna, there were a total of seven blasts after one.
The intention of the terrorists of the Indian Mujahideen, who were involved in the blasts, was to make a stampede during the rally, so that more and more people would be casualties and there was panic in the state.
The motive of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
Party leaders have come out on a journey from Thursday after taking bones from their village.
On November 5, all the bones of them will be flown together in the Ganges in Patna.
As part of this journey, Sanstana Yatra is organized.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the village of people killed in the blasts from 7 a.m. on Saturday morning and meet their families.
During this meeting, they will also provide a check of five to five rupees to the relatives of the dead.
The BJP has already announced this financial help.
The Indian team, excited by the explosive victory in the last match, will have to capture the series with the victory when the seventh and final ODI against Australia will take place on Saturday at M Chinnaswami Stadium.
In order to stay in the series after two consecutive one-day matches were washed due to rain, India had to win Nagpur ODI in any case and its batsmen performed explosively and won the record, due to which the team won 2-2 in the series. .
In the series, Team India has achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice and once again the responsibility of crossing the team will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at the peak at this time and the biggest target is also proving to be dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but the team will also have great expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, the team has got such a salute pair as Rohit and Shikhar, which is making the work of the rest of the batsmen easier with solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had given Virat an opportunity to play without any pressure while making a great partnership in opening.
From the third place Kohli has performed so far, he is considered as Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
Rather, many cricket pundits have given them a better deal than Sachin.
Virat, who is going to be 25 years old next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, out of which India has won in 16.
Following the goal, their average is above 80.00 and they have emerged as the best financier.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can also be harmful to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were flopping badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bangalore ODI can work as 'Lifeline' for them.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially Captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with their performance.
There is also a demand for them to be taken in the Test team for the domestic assay series against England.
Australia has good batsmen till the ninth place.
In addition to Bailey, Shen Watson, Glen Maxwell, Adam Wogs and James Foxner have done a good batting in the series.
However, Phil Hugh and Aron Finch have not been able to leave any impact in the opening.
The lack of Michel Johnson in bowling can make Australia heavier.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly so far in the series, has been sent home for preparations for the Asheage Series.
BJP National Executive Member and Chief Spokesperson Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of this apparent peace.
Referring to the reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing the heel peak to infiltrate terrorists near 2000 in their training camps.
For this, he will never let peace on the border.
After the failure of the separatists to spoil the situation on a large scale by provoking people in Kashmir, Pakistan has become even more confused.
Referring to the Pakistani visit of separatists last year, the BJP leader said that the ISI Chief Lt Gen Zaheer ul Islam, Lashkar, Hizb's gangster Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be given in 2014.
Pakistan is engaged in fulfilling this promise seriously.
The killing of soldiers on the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand to eliminate the army's privileges in the state as fatal, the BJP leader said that such things are also anti-people till there is lasting peace in the state.
They get anti-national elements.
He emphasized that the statements of the leaders' army, the morale of the security forces should be banned.
Snow-den ready to cooperate with Germany on American surveillance
Edward Snow Den, American intelligence informant, has declared that Germany is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to respond to their activities. .
German MP Hans Christian Straw Belle, called on Mr Snow Den Segure in Russia, where he was granted asylum to talk about testimony in Germany.
The MP said in a letter presented by Mr. Snow Dan in front of the media in Berlin on Friday, "While the results of my efforts are positively positive, my government believes in disagreement as a party - and does not provide any defense, which is an attempt to criminalize political speech with allegations of felony. "
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Den said that he believes that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the US Department of Justice include intelligence and theft from the property of the government.
Hans Peter Frederick, Minister of German Internal Affairs, told online exit: "Mr. Snow Den is ready to talk to German officials, so we have to find ways to make it possible."
The relationship between the US and Germany has come under pressure because the NSA has bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Operman, MP who is the chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, oversees intelligence. He said that even if Mr. Snow Dan Kosunne was an opportunity to take 'the relationship with the United States completely by ruining and bringing them in danger, it should also be taken.'
Mr. Straw Belle, an MP from Germany's Green Party, published a photo of himself with Mr. Snow Den on Twitter feed.
He was on his trip to Russia with two German journalists.
Mrstro Belle said that according to the former NSA contractor lawyer, if he left Russia, Snow Den was not able to go back to Russia.
If Snow Dan testified in Germany, he would be "safe" there, which would require assurances, said the MP.
Mr Snow Den said in his letter, "He had to face a fierce and continuous campaign, for which he had to leave home.
He, however, said that he was happy and overwhelmed by world-wide reactions to his work of political expression.
World citizens as well as high officials, including the United States, have assessed the revelation of an irresponsible system of comprehensive monitoring of a public service.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities , when the problems of the human situation have been resolved .
Frontier Airlines charges carry - on baggage
There's a plan to charge $100 to store the luggage on for passengers on your plane board in Brontier Airlines.
In Frontier Airlines, there is a plan to start a charge for $100 for a carry-on bag and it will charge a fee of 2 for coffee or soda, although on Wednesday it was announced that passengers can keep the entire compartment.
The new carry - on charge is for bags in overhead bin, so, the small bags under the seat will still be charged free.
Frontier said that if $25 charges are paid in advance, $100 will wait if the passenger waits to pay until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Melli said that "100 fees are to be obtained for the passengers to take care of the charge in advance."
"We don't want to charge him, he said."
Airlines started charging for first and second check bags in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid the passenger fee are paying as much as they can in the carry-on baggage that has a stashe in the overhead compartment, that means there is often less space in this compartment.
There's a way to bring down passengers on the fee board.
O'Melli said it's not really about raising new charge money.
It's fast becoming difficult to find the place of that overhead bin for the most loyal customers about Rontier.
Passengers who buy tickets in the airline's own website do not have to pay this.
This means that the next man in line can pay $100 for the same bag, while a passenger on line at a frontier gate can get a bag free of charge.
O'Melli said that the frontier's website and check-in processes are being changed to ensure that passengers know about the fees before getting the gate.
Rentier's new carry-on fees will not start until summer, although a date has not been fixed.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction with baggage charges and other charges, but the airline likes them.
They argue that money is spent to handle the baggage, and those who want the passenger service should pay for it.
The baggage fee on Wall Street is a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most don't even touch carry-on bag charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started Carri-On Charge for the first time three years ago, and fellow discounter Aligent Air later.
Along with such a fee, the other airline is Hungary's i Air, which is said by Airline Advisor J. Sorensen, and who tracks the add-on fee.
He said that Spirit's carry-on charges of $50 million in a year, which was estimated in the December 2011 report.
A former official from Sorensen, Midwest Airlines recently flew in Spirit and expressed surprise at the passengers having to face carry-on unusual bag fees at the gate.
"The boarding process which I saw in my airline career was intuitive, he said."
I hoped to grind my teeth and watch out at a fight gate.
"The plane was full and he said that it got hickety-split."
Frontier is also following the F2 fee of Spirit for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
The passengers who take the soda, or the juice, who said that Frontier could keep the whole compartment, and give it free coffee only for one time.
It'll still give away the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but after seven months after the passengers complained, they retreated and followed any other main airline after there.
If passengers of Frontier's don't buy directly from the airline, then this step of the frontier to charge the charge on the carry-on is its latest effort to operate customers towards its own website.
Airlines pays online travel seller rbitt for such $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
That's why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from those people instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone further in this area.
In September many times the flight started giving half a mile to the customers who bought these persons from an online travel agency .
On Wednesday, it reduced the Mileage Award by 25 percent of the trip mile.
So, an online travel agency bought a 1000-mile-run trip will earn 250 miles of distance.
It also allows them to choose their seats in advance for the only passengers when they buy directly from the Frontier website.
Rentier's Denver has a loyal base of customers in the city of his home, but his business is decreasing and it's losing money.
The revenue declined by 9 percent and its flight capacity decreased by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial results released by the corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
The Republicans are trying to fix the finance of Rontier as part of the airline's sales.
NSA charged "Internal error" instead of hackers to crash the website
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that due to some technical lack, our website was closed for a few hours, not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
In a statement sent by the intelligence agency, the intelligence agency said, "The NSA.gov was not in reach for several hours today, which was due to internal error during pre-defined updates."
This problem will be resolved this evening.
This claim is not true that this obstacle came due to the distributed refusal of the service [D.O.S.] attack.
In the evening, online server trackers had found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and the site for some users is still not in reach.
The NSA spokesman told ABC News that "there was no "conciliation" with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesman said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hectare group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA website through the DDOS attack.
The DDOS attack is designed in such a way that so much traffic is sent to the target website as long as the site is not closed due to overloading of the server.
This cyber strategy is relatively crude and the purpose of the attacks is not to distinguish the internal network of the target system.
The past extremely mysterious NSA, which was once known as "no such agency", has become a matter of discussion and bitter criticism among the common people by the large number of incidents of foreign and domestic espionage programmes in the past months - after the theft and revelation of secret NSA files by the collectively divorced former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
Due to the rising controversy over the agency, after tonight's incident, speculation was made that this incident was the result of targeted cyber operation.
In the Dwapar era and today's circumstances, a beautiful expression was presented in line with the story of 'Ek and Dronacharya' showing harmony.
It was shown that in today's context, in which fleets, a guru is forced to walk on the wrong path.
The play was launched jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Vice President of the Cantonment Council Shipra Rastogi, King Kansal and Shakti Singh in the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College.
In the play, Dronacharya of Dwapar era and currently a professor was shown the similarity of Arvind's circumstances.
In the drama directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bachan, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. gave a great presentation while doing full justice with the characters.
In the drama, the light was designed by young dancer Jitendra C. Raj and set by Hemant Kumar.
After this, various awards were given to the literary, cultural contributors from Apta in the ceremony.
In this, Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, President of Urdu Department of Charan Singh University, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and Rangkar Jitendra C. Raj were given.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc. were involved in making the event successful.
Bombardier's profits fall in the form of delivery of aircraft, fall in orders
Canada's airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, in the third quarter of its train unit and less aircraft orders on contract issues and pressure by delivery.
Montriel-based Bombardier also did not present an update on issues that will be able to release any flight test data for its brand new Xeriees aircraft or fulfill its ambitious program to go to commercial service from next September.
About half a month ago, after the first flight of the test plane, it's just been flown three times, the question is whether the test phase is on the track or not.
The result fell below the forecast and the share has been sent to Toronto Stock Exchange for more than 8 percent sliding.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst stock with the National Bank Financial, reduced its rating to "the field performance" on Thursday, the stock is limited to the next one or two quarters.
"The weak aircraft delivery was mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transport, "Dorssen said in a client note."
We will receive a new order for the Bombardier Cess as the progress of the flight test program.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, there is doubt that the market program will be embarrassed.
Bombardier hopes the airline can now cut it off at the low end of the Boing and Airbus dominated market.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and was flown for the first time in September after the month of delay.
Potential buyers wait for the result of flight testing to accept the company's claims about new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings, but as the firm order for DSERs is between 177.

Officials assured the analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was running according to schedule.
"The test aircraft was on the ground for a long time as compared to the forecast, Bodoin said in a conference call, adding it was also fixed during the intermission of land testing and software updates aircraft.
Every producer makes a separate schedule.
We decided to take a first flight and take an up-to-date period and say what we did.
That'll be all through the flight program.
The second part of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks with the following shortly, said the company.
Still, analysts believe the customers are suspicious that after their first flight in the first 12 months, they can start a DSERYES aircraft operation.
Bombardier has said that this Admission Service (IS) schedule was evaluated and will provide an update in the next few months.
This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with the internal schedule of the Bombardier - confirms our idea that the service in the entry will be pushed into H15 , Dorsen said .

The pure order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
Backwalk in Aerospace Division was $32.9 billion on September 30, no change since December 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the consumption of the following order and the overall market position was a disappointment," said Bodoin.
Aerospace revenue declined by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier said that revenue in the world's largest train maker, division increased by about 11 percent for $2.1 billion.
Orders were backing in the transport unit, about 32.6 billion, about 30 September, from a modest 31 December.
Some of the major contracts in the margins of the Transport Division were also affected by the issues of execution.
The executive officials said that the new guidelines will be provided in the fourth quarter.
In Bombardier's shares, in which the chief financial officer of Google Inc announced the involvement of the Patrick Pitchet Board, in the middle of the afternoon business on Thursday, was 8.5 percent below $ 4.83.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft maker and the nearest rival of Bombardier, reported a decline of 10 percent in the quarter profit on Thursday.
New research has shown that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning.
Do not lie to anyone and do not think of stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our mind changes and we start walking against the rule by keeping the ideal one side.
Researchers have given many interesting facts in this research of Harvard University and Uto's David Arts School of Business.
According to the researchers, due to lack of work in the morning, we prefer ethical values, but due to fatigue or more pressure in the evening, honesty decreases.
Researchers did two experiments for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For instance, people had to tell that the point is more on the left or on the right side.
The participants were told that if they give wrong answers instead of the right answer, they will be given money.
It was seen in this experiment that those who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the right answer.
At the same time, between 12 noon and 6 pm, while using people, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their principles in mind.
With this, the researchers managed to prove that the greed of money does not make any difference to our honesty in the morning, but in the evening, we stop paying attention to ethics.
This research has been published in the latest issue of psychological science.

Mr . Big to be imprisoned by cocaine ' s lawyer who gave secret information about police investigation .
42-year-old Bashart Datta used to inform the infamous criminal Neel Scarboro
The advocate felt that people might know about his secret drug addiction .
He was sentenced to three years in jail by the Liverpool Crown Court
The top lawyer of the defendant, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid, people will know about his secret drug addiction, three years of imprisonment.
After compromising on the addiction of his cocaine, 42-year-old Barashat Datta provided sensitive confidential information to the infamous criminal Neel Skarboro about the investigation of his drug trafficking activities.
This advocate, who was given the name of "Bash" and whose criminals were praised as "top brief”, was arrested from his house in 2011 after the police surveillance operation in Scarboro, which he represented in the previous Narcotics Trial. .
Officials had seen 32-year-old Skarboro keeping three cocaine bags in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he went out with his colleagues for a law society dinner.
After getting cocaine particles in Datta's hair, its wallet, and its credit card, the investigation revealed that the DATA was a "regulated user of drug drugs."
During the eight-month period from January to August 2011, he sought illegal information on the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarboro and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time as part of the main investigation of heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Mercasside, Burkeshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other persons, who were sent to jail after the seizure of 1.5 million pounds of heroin and cocaine, and more than 200,000 pounds of cash during several raids by the police.
The 42-year-old Deta used to inform the criminals, because he feared that people could not know about his cocaine addiction.
Datta, working in the law firm Forbes Solicitors, in Blackborne, was found guilty in two cases of obstructing the path of justice after three weeks of trial in the Liverpool Crown Court. Was facing failure in the Liverpool Crown Court.
He had accepted about keeping cocaine in the earlier hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer started at the time when the police came to know that he was in regular contact with Deta from February 2011, while investigating Scarboro.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him coming to Deta's house and keeping more than 60 percent of the purity drug under the lawyer's bin in the Black Golf Glover.
After the drug was kept, Scarboro was in regular contact with DETta, who went out for dinner at Blackrn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
When the lawyer reached home, it was found that there was a drug intoxication and there was a dialogue between them nine times.
It was heard in the court that after getting the clue of A category drug on Deta's hair, wallet and credit cards, he was found to be a 'regulated user of cocaine' in the trial.
Datta was arrested later, but refused to use cocaine and said that he was talking to the suspect dealer, because he was his client and said that his discussion was "the subject of legal privilege".
During his arrest, Deta tried to remove many credit cards by removing his wallet, but he was seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run the office from his home along with his workplace, and his clients used to call his house for legal matters.
After being told by the arrested key persons that the detectives knew about them, it was said in the court hearing that Deta used to call the key people of the drug supply chain, some of which he had earlier presented the case.
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said, "The criminal advocate should know the best about not breaking the law."
Mr. Deta is accused of misusing his position as a criminal advocate, joining his specific client.
We are not talking about the relation of the general drug dealer, but not about the dealer who is providing drug to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly have been legal without any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond the limits of the lawyer- client relationship.
He interrupted the police investigation as much as possible so that he could continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Deta was not honoring his profession but insulting.
He made a lot of close proximity to certain clients, especially from Scarboro, and he allowed the agreement with his independence.
Datta denied any wrongdoing and claimed that: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarboro, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
But after the hearing, the Superintendent of the Lancashire Police Li Halsted said that: "At the time Mr. Deta started receiving drugs from organized criminals, he converted himself from a criminal advocate to a criminal.
Due to the addiction of his cocaine, he made a great deal of compromise and became very weak towards the objectives of leading members of the organized crime groups, who used it to obtain important information related to police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standards of integrity, and should instill confidence and confidence in people.
Shri Dita has cheated with this belief and has tried to avoid being under the guise of his profession.
The serious and organized crime unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Dattu, who was also found guilty of three incidents of coke keeping and now disrupting the path of justice, which reflects our commitment towards bringing the criminals to the court.
This matter should work as a warning to the criminals that no person is far from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present it before the court.
Scarboro was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members involved in the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Datta gave a question and answer session about himself, in which he said that his phantasy job would be to become a lawyer for the death penalty client in the US, his dinner guest and inequality to be an inspiration for his work.
Kenya's press resentment on disputed media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional and said, "This is a frightening place, and it is legal to ask: What is the Parliament to prevent the independence of the judiciary from coming tomorrow?"
Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group - which is Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM, said, "This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it."

The issue of Mozambique ' s security concern is that powerful figures grow into conflict .
Thousands of people gathered in the central map with a statue of President Samora, the founder of Mozambique, who was staring down at him, for a slogan of peace in a rare public demonstration.

The conflict between government forces and Ray Namo for two weeks has been reported almost every day, more than 20 years before a peace agreement.
Ray Namo was, in the beginning, a notorious rebel of the white-ruled Rhodesia and the apartheid government in South Africa, as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the peace agreement of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe there is no possibility of returning to the country's fully developed conflict, but recent incidents have discouraged foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, some of the companies, including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, Ni, could bring in more than $50bn investment next year to explore the vast offshore gas reserves and coal reserves of the north-west.
The ruling Relimo Party, the major political power since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for stress.
Ray Namo says that the government started the latest struggle on October 17 by attacking its members in Sofa La province, a traditional Ray Namo Garh.
The attack on the former rebels and then the government forces attacked the Rainmo bases and told the Financial Times that Afsso Dacca Ma, the leader of the group, Fernando Mazang, Ray Namo's spokesman tried to kill.

Mr Mazang was quoted as saying Re Namo had cancelled the 1992 Peace Accord , but later became a matter of concern .
They told the ET means that that the agreement is not being honored by the Free Limo
Our vision is to come back to the negotiation, but seriously, Mr. Mazangne said.
The last talks between the two sides did nothing special to reduce the tension of a series of this year's struggle.
"It's about two big men fighting together (Jibuzhan and Dhaka), a lecturer at Yusuf Han London Open University and a Mozambique expert said."
Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are necessary to prepare the types of concessions.
Ray Namo has been pushing for election reforms, had already said about the boycott of municipal elections to be held in November.
The Presidential and Parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as an attempt to win concessions from the government and economic loot as a sick movement.
Ray Namo's share in the poll has been declining since 1992, while a new party was formed by a former Ray Namo member, in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Majang Mr. Jebuzhanko says - who is leaving office at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want to leave the presidency because he does not want peace, he does not want a transparent election, Mr."
What kind of capacity is not clear of Ray Namo, but he has made visits to the interrupting hit and run on police stations and vehicles on a major North South Highway.
Most of the clashes are in La Province, several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo, hosting Bira Port, relying on mining, coal exports including Rio Tinto and Valley.
After threatening to attack the Ray Namo Line, Rio suspended its experiment for nearly a week in June.
Mr. Mazangvineet was almost asked whether or not you will be able to repeat this danger.
Ray Namo Cheese were not going well in Mozambique who wanted to warn the international community, Mr. Mazang said.
The government of instability further enhanced the frustrations, saying Fernandes Lima, Media Cope, who is the head of an independent media company, many people are also concerned about the recent floods of corruption, slow pace of development and abductions.
"People are the government and president responsible for the country's future, and think they should be one to find solutions to problems," they say.
Omar Sultanate, an audience, people still need stability.

Children should be taught myths and legends as a model for the author of "Life".
The stories of Thor can show that there is no match for all the subtle moves in the cruel power, while the meaning of a dream in the economic legends is known.
In order to teach many of the myths, "an exception far away forest and in some cases it will not be appropriate to teach in porn and in schools," Cross Lee Holland advocated "careful selection" from one of the appropriate tasks of age.
"It seems amazing to me, in the United States, myths and folk songs are already a part of education, he said.
I'm advocating it as a plan for twenty years.
He called the authors and the teachers as the more enlightened " and this is a "new turn" for children, together with the messages being presented in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who translated the Biwolf from Anglo-Saxon, wrote the Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, he said, "Your intentions may be many but it would be better to keep it out."
Probably an adult writer for a child and an adult writer writing a big difference between an adult needs some meaning of hope.

And that should be submitted, rather revealed through a story than it has been said.

Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of the New York comedy festival: The New Yorker
People can argue that New York City is the birthplace of the stand-up comedy in the United States: About 100 years ago, humor dramatis Frank Fee, who worked as the master of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to recite jokes directly to the crowd in the manner of conversation.
Fe's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently at the New York comedy festival.
Produced and operated by Carolina Hirsch, founder of the Standup Institute, Carrolines, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than 60 shows in small clubs and big theaters.
Hirsh says, "Most of these headlines appeared in Carolina, and became very big success, at such levels where they became very big to be played in the club."
We created this festival as a way of continuing to work with them.
This year's event included the presence of Vanda Syx, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mehr, as well as the annual music and comedy benefit for military retired personnel in the Madison Square Garden, stand-up for Heroes, including Bruce Springstein, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Kosby among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many of the comedians participating in this years festival have come from non-traditional mediums such as comedy centres, f.x. and small networks such as spikes.
Nick Croll, who was the Chief Guest at the Deep-Cable Sitcom (F.X.) with the Ranchi Fantasy-Football theme "The League", and is now his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Sattarday Night Live" and "Parks and Requirement", although she is well known for her viral video series "Marsal the Shell With Shoes On".
The other young comedians with different voices, including Crolls and slates (Antheni Jesselnik with a very disappointed voice, satirical, ethnically focused W. Kamau Bell), are the products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the most prominent attractions of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David:
Steinberg started working as a stand-up comedian, but he has become a well-known television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called "Sit Down comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
This meeting will be held in the town hall, at the center of Manhattan.
Steinberg said, "The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all Larry's works."
They were telling me that when he is here, sometimes he goes to the street between two buildings and used to think in himself that if I ever lose my full money then I will be here.
Oil / 96 per barrel continues to fall
The oil price continues to decline , as on Friday , there is a report of concern for high supplies , where the energy hungry manufacturing sector in China is getting stronger .
For December delivery, the benchmark was down 14 cents in the electronic trading on the American raw New York Mercantile Exchange in Europe till late morning at 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell to 5.8 percent for the month of October, 39 cent fell on Thursday.
Adequate supply of crude oil is weighing price in recent weeks.
The energy department said on Wednesday that US supply has increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
More than five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 2.5 million barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand increased activity has shown that two reports on Chinese manufacturing have come Friday.
This is known that development can continue to strengthen China 's economic reform after being less committed in the last quarter of 7 . percent to the third quarter of a decade .

The court has blocked the action of the New York Police Department on the break and play policy .
On Thursday, a federal appeals court required a judge's order for the break and play program of the New York Police Department, blocked the changes and removed the judge from the case.
US Circuit Court 2 and Judge Shira Shindeler has said that the judge will file the verdict on the result of an appeal by the city.
In the Judge Nagar, it was ruled in August in violation of the Constitution in the way of preventing people and taking them out of their program of inquiry.
The city's police department has also appealed to its conclusion and its remedial order, including the decision to allocate a monitoring to help change its policy and training program associated with it.
The appeals court heard arguments on Tuesday on the request migration.
The Appellate Court has said that because it compromised the need for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in part of a series of media interviews and because the public did wrong things to be different from the code of conduct for the US judges by the public, the case of the judge should be removed, public accountability should be made to criticize the court of statements.
The judge had ruled that the police officers incorrectly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its break and play program.
He has appointed an external monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and he is the most closed, where in some premises a pilot program has been ordered to test the body's worn cameras.
In August, New York City agreed to abolish the practice of collecting names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police ban.
An oral argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.
Stop and Sports Devices have been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The break-up and sports policy has been in some form over decades, but most of the black and Hispanic men have been recorded to prevent dramatic increase under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg to raise all the time from 684330 to 2011.
A lawsuit was filed by four men by all minorities in 2004 and became a case of class action.
The supporters of the NP's break and change in the sports program have said that unfair behavior will end, a more reliable and effective police force will have to be moulded and other police departments can influence the use of the policy.
Opponents say the change will reduce the morale of the police, but crime, money will be wasted and not during the last decade, after the contraction by thousands of officers, a comprehensive problem of a police force will be solved.
The judge has noted that the break and play did not end, which is constitutional, but improved the implementation of the NP's stop.
Participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts attended a large number of training.

All the participants are spreading the spirit of unity by joining the religious prayer.
Camp Chief Vipin Kumar State Training Commissioner is giving his special support.
Callson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Colson, former editor of the News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, monitoring and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about his love relationship while Charles Clark's Home Secretary. .
Prosecutor Andrew Aids Q.C. told Old Bailey that the News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was meeting his "attractive special advisor Hannah Palbi".
It was said in the court that the newspaper appointed private investigator Glen Miller to hack the polbi's voicemail and keep that male watch, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Addis said, "The prosecution suggests that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside the people's house and keep an eye on them, rather they keep an article before the people, see what people react to it. "
He said that NOTW used three ways to check the cases: phone hacking, monitoring and face-to-face.
In the third one, the editor himself was involved.
It is obvious that he knew about other ways ie surveillance, he definitely knew.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
He says, no, we say, "Yes, he knew it at all.
Rumors about Clark's love affair were presented by the feature desk of A.O.T.W. for the first time when a source interested in Ms. Palby said: "Do not waste your time, she is with Charles. "
In August 2006, at least three times the voicemail tape was seized from the home of Ms.
Investigators also found such entries in the computer of the private investigator, on which Ms. Palbi and her sister were named "Project".
During the period during which they were being examined, an anonymous phone call was made to Ms.
Former Chief Reporter, Neville Turlbek and former Reporter, James Weatherup, also witnessed the visit of Ms.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told him through a voicemail: "I have got a story, which we are planning to run tomorrow, about which I would definitely like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Addis said that the inclusion of Colson in this case is in the other important person pattern, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The Bench heard on Thursday that Colson talked to Mr. Blanket about the love affair with a married woman, while at that time he was looking at the case of co-responsive Rebekha Brooks, who was married at that time.
Colson and Brooks refused to misconstrue with others to hack the phone between October 3, 200. and August 9, 2006.
Lander, Thullbek and Weatherup have accepted phone hacking.
Encourage corporate fear by NSA disclosures about state surveillance .
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter scorched the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Office (B) to protect the Constitution, Germany's domestic intelligence agency had a mission to take a picture of the roof of the US post, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundisbank.
The German media asked the DB to express hope for identifying the presence of Lissening antenna and indicated an exchange action between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clipper, director of the American National Intelligence, emphasized that the US has its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies and to increase American companies their international competitiveness or to increase the line below them. Do not use in September. "
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has made Whistleblower, began to tell the American surveillance, the European governments and the leaders of the business world are no longer sure that the director does not follow his promise.
The U . S . National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers including Google and Yahoo expressed fear about state surveillance .
The last thing came when it came to know that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, probably a decade ago.
If the most powerful people in Europe can be targeted, then surely the leaders of the business world are also making possible goals.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between American intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible to use these data for mutual benefit .
"Germany should be awake, the President of Oliver Grun, BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published by the consultancy of German companies in July, the US has almost become a big risk now, like China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
In all documentation leaked by Mr. Snowden, however, there is no evidence that the United States has known the business mysteries of foreign companies for its companies.
Leaders have expressed concern over the lack of EU internet capabilities and should try to reduce their dependence on the United States.
The leaders of the business world are suspecting this.
Someone in the German parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Haso Platner, chairman of the German business software company SAP, said, "This is not a way."
If a strong European IT industry wanted it, then it was not allowed to die 20 years ago.
Everything is concessional in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The disclosures by Snowden on American technical refinement and espionage access have proved to be a shock to some companies that previously believed that China was the biggest surveillance threat .
A major change is taking place in the Cloud Computing area where European officials are more aware that the data stored in the United States is under that jurisdiction and therefore has become potentially sensitive .
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a business entity, some 10 percent non-US members canceled the plan to use an American-based cloud provider after the disclosure of the data prism mining program.
We saw a new question which did not come to the customers a year ago - where is my data stored? And can you guarantee that it will be physically in that jurisdiction?
Many German officials argue that the latest report is just confirming whether they already knew: that the powerful state wants to steal their most precious mysteries and data and therefore they should be guarded at all costs.
It is not a surprise that there is economic espionage.
It has always happened.
"This is a topic for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing changed is called the current book, the chief executive of the chemical manufacturer BASE."
At the commercial and industrial level , the Americans spy on us and we , too , because it is in national interest to defend our business .
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in defense systems and it is an advantage for the attacker.
For big companies, the message is being recorded for a long time, even if it is unwise to leave one in the business from home, with a lub stick, or to leave a laptop in a hotel room, at least to say.
Lich accenberg, members of the board of car maker Audi, say that this is a year-old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they can not be used as remote listening devices
Germany's B Executive, while smart phones are compromising on foreign visits due to the risk, suggests to consider using simple prepaid mobile.
Prepaid mobile phones were thrown later.
However, small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring, it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, many of these companies are the top in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium size companies often warn in a report to protect corporate secrets effectively against lack of experience, personnel and financial resources unauthorized access."
The US has warned about the economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
According to the France The Washington Post, in February, the name of American national intelligence was named in Russia and Israel in a second tier of criminals involved in hacking for economic intelligence behind China.
According to the board member of a German Blue Chip Company, when the matter comes to economic espionage, the French are the worst
In the interview, the former head of the Bernard Surcini French Internal Intelligence Agency, URI, points out: "The services know well that even if all the countries cooperate in non-terrorist warfare, they spy on their colleagues.
At the commercial and industrial level , the Americans spy on us and we , too , because it is in national interest to defend our business .
Nobody made fools.
"The parents of Georgian teenager killed in an accident believe that their son was murdered"
A Georgian teenager whose dead body was found wrapped in a restaurant mat in his high school gym believes that his son was murdered, the family's advocate said on Thursday.
Candric Johnson, G.A.K. Valdosta, was found trapped in the straight mat behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
The investigators of Landes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson was dead in a "unknown accident", but the 17-year-old boy's family denied it.
Benjamin Nrup, who presented Kenneth and Jackson, told Fox News.com that "they fully believe that their son has been murdered."
He does not have any faith in the manner in which Sheriff has told him.
The sequence said that "his belief is that this thing is beyond the logic of physical rule and general intelligence."
They think that this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of the person or the people responsible for the death of his son.
He said, "He sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned in a body bag"
U.S. Advocate General Michael Mulray said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal inquiry into Johnson's death, considering that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he murdered because of some crime?
More said these things in a press conference in the afternoon on Thursday.
I will comply with the facts, wherever they take us.
My purpose is to bring the truth to the fore.
He said that "I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation."
More told the reporter that the initial body test indicates that Johnson's death was due to stasis.
According to Mure, there was a different cause of death in a second body test.
He said that "There are many such questions which should be answered or confirmed."
More also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to summon a criminal or to investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to do it.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative for comment from the office of Landage County Sheriff was not available immediately.
On Wednesday, the South Georgian judge ordered the authorities to issue all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say that he hopes that the video footage will give some indications of how he died.
C.D.C. released allergic guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the disease control and prevention center issued guidelines to control the food allergies of children in the school.
For the first time, such guidelines have been issued by the US government as the number of school going children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one in every 20 children in the US has food allergies.
CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, there has been an increase of 18 percent in cases of food allergies in children.
In this guidelines, schools have been informed about how to inform teachers and staff about the food allergies of children, and how to handle them in case there is any allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to keep the stock of epinephrine in order to deal with potentially fatal acute anophelesis - which is the auto-engineer of the epipen brand, which is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, so that the schools can easily keep Epinephrine stock in large quantities.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms to be transmitted by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It seems that something is pricking in my tongue, "It seems that there is a hair on my tongue, or "my tongue is drenching."
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose their children's sex undefined
Germany has become the first country in the European Union, which has recognized the third gender for children born with obscure genitalia.
Now new-born children will not be specified in a rigid manner.
According to the new law, parents do not need to declare sex for such children, this law allows them to declare gender "undefined" or "undefined" on the child's birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce the pressure on parents who can take decisions related to gender-specific surgery for newborn children in a hurry and fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex person had said years later, "I am a man, not a woman."
I will continue to be a wounded, stained trap created by doctors.
According to estimates, one child out of 2,000 children is such that there is neither a boy nor a girl every year.
They are intersexs, part of a group of about 60 situations that come under investigation of sexual development disorders, a collective word that is used for abnormal chromosomes, genitalia (or testis) or abnormally developed gender.
Wells symposia may have been intersexs.
Gender identity is still not properly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when sex can not be determined, it is better to use the best information available to specify sex and to conduct surgery, if such a thing comes, inspect the psychological and physical development of the child.
Dr. Jack Dresser, a psychologist of New York City, who is a specialist in gender-identification, said that Germany's new law seems to be "good".
Intersex children create moral confusion.
He said, "Some people are in a state of life-crisis for which surgery is needed, but this does not happen with most children."
You can specify gender without surgery, and after that see how identity develops.
The science of knowing how a gender will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No person can give a proper answer about why this happens.
This is a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
In the report filed before the European Commission in 2011, the Intersex people have been described differently from the transgender people, because their position is not related to gender but is related to its biological composition, which is not clearly male or female, or both of them are jointly defined or not clearly defined.
These features can display themselves in secondary sexual traits such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia or chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination in the field of jobs faced by intersex and transgender persons, as well as atrocities, violence and discriminatory crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-align gender.
Australia and Nepal have already given permission to adults to mark male, female or third gender on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Nory Me-Velbi became the world's first recognized sexless person after winning a legal appeal to keep "undefined gender" status.
According to the internal ministry, in addition to M or F in the German passport, there will also be third Specification in the form of X for intersex individuals.
According to the news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French law makers from this strictly Catholic country have signed a petition to withdraw gender principles from school books.
The US website Catholic Online has also opposed Germany's law by saying, "While the world is going to a state where gender is the option to be selected, but not sexual activity, we have two more civilization pillars Are going in the opposite direction. "
In Maryland, the mother of the newborn also told the baby zone that she would like to see children being referred to sex at birth.
He said on the website about upbringing, "The upbringing is very stressful without additional limitations, especially if you do not even know what is the gender of your child."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both the male and the female genitals were called hermaphrodites (obliging), in the name of the beautiful Greek god, Dwilingi.
And less than a decade ago, the medical fraternity had considered gender as slates that could be eradicated and rewritten.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they understand that gender identification is a complex task, and sometimes there can be a mistake even from the doctors, who do not know what their gender Specification will be felt when children grow up.
Dreyser says, "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called "psychic emergency".
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you used to call the surgeon.
The current theory on the treatment of children with obscure genitalia was presented by Dr. John Mani of John Hapkins University, who considered gender to be golden.
He composed the term gender identification and argued that social and environmental indicators - how parents raise the child - by interaction with the child's genes and hormones, determine whether he is recognized as a man or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, which is known as "Janjoan", their principles became disputed.
He advised the parents of a child whose penis had accidentally gone to the penis during sarcomasion to remove the testicles from the child and raise it like a girl.
The dresser said, "Mani presented that case as a successful case of transfer, but it did not happen."
At the age of 15, the child turned herself back as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
The dresser said that some doctors are still following "the model".
But with the arrival of the Internet in the years after the year 1990, the people passing through these sex surgeries started to appear "not happy with the result."
The same case was with 36-year-old Montana writer Jim Bruce, who was born with XY male chromosome, but his genitalia was unclear.
The doctors did not clearly understand that his gender was small, or his saffron was big, but he was certain that he could never live "satisfaction" as a man.
Therefore, in the year 1976, shortly after her birth, the outer organs and testicles of the Bruce were removed by surgery and her upbringing was done as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
She told ABNews.com, "I knew I'm not a girl.
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, he was supposed to be with vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and disturbed, he demanded medical records.
This showed him the horrific truth.
I was bound at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with the DSD, who prevented his body from producing enough tosterone, due to which his genitalia could not be properly developed.
After knowing the truth, he became a man, he took the dose of Testosterone and removed his breast.
Due to surgery, he became barren.
Today, he explains people about interfaces in an organization called interface project to normalize their perception.
However, Annie Tamer-Matis, the executive director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Information Choice, expressed concern that Germany's law "Chipi and stigma".
She says, "A lot of activists think that Germany's law will motivate parents to make quick decisions and to specify the child "undefined".
We fear that this will encourage intervention.
We feel that instead of waiting, specifying male or female sex is a better process.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Matis said that his organization supports the Australian law because "It allows adults to be identified in the third gender."
He said, "The adults should be able to make their own decision about legal sex."
The law of Germany relates to specifying it at birth.
This is not a war fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can take decisions related to their body themselves.
But Pittsburgh's breast radiologist Dr. Erlin Bartz, whose daughter has sexual development disorder, and hundreds of other people in the support group, said that Germany's law will provide "power" to both parents and children.
Baratji's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but she was a D.S.D. called full endogen insensitive conservation.
Since there was a defect in his nitrogen grahi, women's characteristics were developed in the cat.
There is a vagina in his body but there is no uterus or ovary.
Now the 29-year-old Katie is married and is a resident of the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or guest house surrogacy.
Bartz said, "This law facilitates parents to not take any decision on their own in haste."
It gives them time and time to understand them properly by some tests before writing men or women.
In this way, you're fine- raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely kid and enjoy her.
We do not need to get such a surgery done in haste which can not be returned.
He said, "It brings children in the decision-making process and frees parents from the misery that inspires them because they do not believe that they are recovering."
Ultimately, the child will determine which gender he is more comfortable - and this will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
On behalf of Tehsil Legal Services Committee Ramnagar, a legal awareness camp was organized in the middle school of Ramnagar under the chairmanship of the committee chairman and all judge of Ramnagar Sandeep Kaur.
In which students and others were given information about the right to education and the law for economically backward people.
Advocate ML Gupta, Rohini Bharadwaj, and Sarpanch in the camp, made people aware about the above topic.
A large number of villagers were present in the program.
Report: Consider the Biden dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times , close advisors to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton as vice - president for the ticket 2012 . < s > Mr . Pipes is director of the Middle East Forum and Taube distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University .
The most notable explosion in the revelation is that the 2012 expedition to Tom, "Doub Down: Game Change 2012 by Mark Halperin and John Helen.
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and said on Thursday evening that Dumping Biden can help in the hope of the re-election of Obama to know the President's top advisors "wide group sessions and polling in late 2011."
According to the Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book explains the full information. Attempted in the campaign of the chief officials and put the main bill of the former White House staff for the name of the White House, to know how the former state secretary Clinton's vice president changes the poll. Does it.
Possible switch was a very safe secret inside the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office .
The changes of former Obama campaign chief Jim Massina, and former White House senior advisors David Oxford and David Palouffe - including only half a dozen close advisors - Dale, were under consideration.
“Doubt down claims that Delle tried to change Biden . ” Despite his personal coordination , when he finally made a decision , Clinton ' s ticking did not improve Obama ' s situation . < s > Related Topics : Muslims in the United States receive the latest by email : subscribe to daniel pipes ' free mailing list This text may be reposted or forwarded so long as it is presented as an integral whole with complete and accurate information provided about its author , date , place of publication , and original URL . < s > Comment on this item
In an interview with Martin, Dale confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I said keeping the whole scene in view, and one of them, this was Dale told the newspaper."
You remember that at that time the presidential post was in danger, so we were in such a situation, "The holy Christ, what else will we do?"
While Dale told Research as a precaution, Martin had told UNN's Anderson Cooper that the election campaign again made important investments to find out how much dividend will be given to the pole.
* The campaign does not spend on voting and focused groups like money, unless they are seriously considering something, Martin said on AC360.
It is unclear, however, did Obama know that his team is looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked the cast, did his boss know about possible reshuffle?
While Dale said he didn ' t think the president knew about the possible change , the former Chief of Staff admitted that “it is possible that Obama knew it . ”

Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama was not aware of Biden dumping ticket research.
"Probably, Martin said.
Glo-in-the-Dark Ice cream like?
A British entrepreneur made the world's first glo-in-the-Dark Ice cream - using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of the sea animal to develop the best breakfast.
This idea came after reading a research paper on gelifish, and China's convinced scientists used chemical shine to re-slow the protein.
Ice cream will increase the pH level of the protein and the ice cream will shine by reacting to the fooder's tongue.
Chris says that the ice cream burns with reaction from the heat of the mouth, i.e. winning will be more intense, the more it will burn.
Charlie, founder of Lik MIM Delicious Icecream company, said, "This is incredible but the initial production of May 200 will get about 500 grams of goods."
The proteins we're using in ice cream will react with the neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is hot, the protein will increase the pH level and the ice cream will shine.
We ' ve been testing for the past few months and it looks absolutely right to share on Heloven because it gives amazing luminous effects
It ' s probably the most expensive ice - cream I ' ve built because gelifish ' s brightness is four times more expensive than gold .
So the cost of each scooter comes to me around 140 pounds .
However, the taste of Viska is very good.
Apple is famous for unusual tastes, including a experimental company based in Charlie's Bristol, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaves.
But his next composition is going to prove to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is naturally impossible due to the ice crystal which makes the refraction over the ice cream, but I think we will get a way to do it.
Ice cream is the usefulness of the immune property of a gelifish, which is synthesized by Chinese scientists
In the Rani Bagh market, the entire market was stuck with the customers.
It was a matter of fact that people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.
The same thing happened in the Central Market located in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and Prashant Vihar.
Something similar was seen in the Sarrafa shops of Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
Here also people bought gold and silver jewelery and coins.
Due to this, there was a jam in other markets, including the outer ring road.
However, people who came out of the house from the office had to spend hours in the jam to reach home.
Hellowin 2013: By Numbers
When I was young, Hellowin was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay silent and play dress up for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I've become more than a greedy one!
I did not even sign in to give candy out of my apartment for the last two years and maybe not this year.
But the statistics tell me , I ' m a black sheep when Halovane comes .
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating $158 million this time, spending 6.9 billion candy and costumes and decorations.
One thing I've always seen is Har-Hellowin's attitude.
According to NCR, the total expenditure of 6.9 billion out of the cost of dress is estimated to be 1.2 billion
This year, sex is all angry with lifeless things.
Women do not have to go for specialization because they are sex food such as pizza, humburgers and carrots.
I hope for Mardo this year that our Instagram feeds will be made for space men, thanks to the dead.
According to Google, the most searched dress will be jambs, buttons, robbers and witches.
I guess there is no harm in being traditional.
Last year, we dressed dogs and were not alone with astonishment.
According to the NCR, the American people will really spend $330 million for pet clothes.
It's ironic that there's a lot of hotdog dogs.
When it comes to candy, we do not see around.
According to Nilesen Company, Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year.
Hailing bars, lollipops, milk dudes, twizzlers and clerk bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the US Department of Commerce, it is a good news that 41 million trucks and trucks are going to participate in our neighborhood.
But in fact, we and those who are joking will buy 90 million pounds during Chocolate Hellowin.
According to the Configurationers Association, we will not use one thing during Hellowin, candycorn, but they will also sell around 35 million pounds.
That's about Mecca's personal knot 9 billion.
It's a secret to solve so far.
Nothing is more than the meteorite Hellowin Bhuta Gharo.
They're the best name, "Fair behind the wall" (which, in fact, is a prison), "Ch-o-chick" and "house of shock."
In fact, according to American authority, there is a 1200 officially sanctioned ghost house in the United States, which produces 500 million revenue, and that horrible good picture that your friend puts on Facebook and the man who likes and makes comments on you.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-Lalten carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - something that we've done since we were little.
Fortunately for us, "Baby in a pumpkin trend" started last year, thanks to the Pinterrest, so most of us grew up by carving these guards and not staying with them.
According to the American Census Bureau this year, Americans will spend around $ 106 million on pumpkin.
Jack-o- Slowly lantern lantern on his front porch probably from Illinois, which grew by 542 million pounds this year.
If you are looking for additional loans, try to get their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin cut in the phone time and sauce masas measurements, Kalif., and above.

Fireworks brought down the front portion of the rock from the rope to protect the dog from the mouth of death
After being trapped in the mouth of a troubled mountain by some way of 50 feet above the ground, by calling fire brigade personnel, he got a lucky life.

Peri said that he had dinner with senior rocker, and "When I was 18 years old, they attacked me."
He said, "This thing has become old, and he behaves well with me."
The representative of the 70-year-old Jaeger said in a statement on Thursday that he clearly denies the attack on "kati-pari".
The representative also said: "Probably the paragraph is saying about some other person's misunderstanding.
Parry was one of the singers coming as a guest on the tour of Rolling Stone this year.
His new album "Prize" reached the top position this week.
George Carrevan : Euro - disintegration gave the option to Scotts
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join Europe as an independent travel zone as a condition of EU membership.
Passport control on Barvik and the boundary of barbed wire on the walls of the Hadrian indicate stories.
It is true that Strathclyde Paper describes the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although it has not been predicted in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that the EU members spend most of their time in changing their formal rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer the Shangen region, Brussels will be a cheaper rebate for a sustained non-compliance Brussels in return for what it really wants from Scotland.
So, then, a-kahani.
And the thing that has been stuck for such a long time has got settled. First of all, "independence" means passport control baseless news was heard about 40 years ago.
Still lost interesting point in re-telling this interesting old story.
Anyway, why should you expect independent Scotland to bid Europe?
Why buy and sell London's Yok for Brussels, especially now?
There is real European news: The great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Dedicated teams are being strengthened to oppose the EU or to close the Euro in the form of equal currency across the EU.
Even in Germany, the Eurospital Alternative for Germany Party - which has been formed this year - suddenly came out of the Bundestag in the federal elections of September, and thus effectively excluded the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dams).
The plan to build federal Europe has always been domestic opposition.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be a radical transformation.
Due to the stringent rules imposed by Berlin and European Central Bank, restrictions imposed on national economies through compliance of the same currency, many people have to think that project Europe has gone a long way.
The EU crisis did not play a major role in the high budget deficits of the national governments - it was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the Euro system stabilized the currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency depreciation, South Europe finds itself in a state of inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public expenditure - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Deep European productivity disease is far ahead of current budget and currency problems.
As a result of the "Green Energy Policies" imposed by Brussels to provide exemption to French and German energy firms on consumer expenditure - the European industry doubled the power to the United Nations and four times the payment for gas.
This is a paralyzed cost loss, which we have already seen in Gangemath.
Even the freeze of all salaries in the world cannot save the European petrochemicals industry from being affected by cheap US shell gas.
As a result, the spirit of revolt is unfolding among people, especially in France, which was once a leading admirer of the EU.
After the war, the top French politicians saw the EU as a means to control Germany, and Paris as a means to provide equal billing for Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, due to which the French economy is faltering.
Result: The right wing of Marine Lee Pen, the anti-EU National Front, won the victory by pushing the ruling Socialists to the third position in the recent bye-election.
At present, the front in France is the most popular party with 24 percent votes - it is a timely warning to the British labour that they can not assume that disintegration for the left will automatically benefit for the right.
What is Lee Pen doing with French whites, with his new fame in the middle of the working class?
This party wants to use the EU elections next year to form an anti-EU, anti-monetary, anti-monetary faction in the European Parliament.
If, as is possible, the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, such a group can affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is: Soon the confluence of anti-EU and anti-national sentiment in Europe will end the Euro.
The euro will not be completely finished, but it will return to the retail (UPA) nations in some form like Europe, which will be supported by General de Gaull.
Germany and some of its subsidiaries may retain the Euro, but France and South Europe will restart their currencies.
I hope that the UK will keep itself away from this project in the hope of getting closer to the US.
However, the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all this?
We can choose to remain a part of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to be separated at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in the loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easy for non-federate nations to work together with other similar thinking countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider maintaining our economic independence while walking on the path of Norway.
In Scotland, the S.N.P. Government has been notablely the most successful anti-economic political campaign in Europe, which won a wonderful majority in 2011 on the basis of the Tory-Lib Dam alliance and then the proposed (proceeding) deductions proposed by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling.
It will be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that situation it will have to accept the rules of economy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
premature puberty: growing up early
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get puberty at a young age compared to white girls of their age.
Physical changes do not mean that youth is near .
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed .
Experts believe that obesity outbreaks can be a cause of youth at a young age
The case of puberty before time is not as effective in boys .
Pat Etheriz, a former CNN correspondent, is an expert journalist in the health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be worried, if her daughter starts developing breasts at the age of 7 or 8 years and the hair of the genitals starts coming out?
This week, at the annual conference of the American Children's Medical Academy in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Caplovitz, paediatric endocrinologist, clarified that these initial physical changes are common among American girls, they show a new trend.
Capitalists say, "I spend a lot of time giving parents this assurance - that generally it does not show rapid progress towards full youth."
The direct symptoms of development such as the germination of the breasts, the hair of the genitals and the ear and the physical smell are visible before time in the girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a slight change in the age of Rojodarshan (first menstruation).
In United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
When the breasts begin to develop then in the first menopause it takes at least two to three years , capsicum explains , who is the author of ' premature puberty in girls: the necessary guide to deal with this common problem .
The most accurate test time for the development of youth is time.
There is a debate about what is the beginning of puberty, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8, it is called "child- adult".
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - whose child doctor can closely inspect.
In a situation of faster progress, an endocrineologist may need to check the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay pre-term menstruation and other consequences: premature aging of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and intensification of drama in the form of adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age of the child, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovits are aware of medicines but acknowledge, "Handing the youth can increase the practical issues, and girls can start feeling different from their colleagues."
The second major problem can be understood: Parents do not just want their younger daughter to be menstrual.
Caplovites said, "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain cleanliness."
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, remembers, "This was a shock."
Although there were symptoms of this and we talked about menstruation, but it was not emotionally prepared.
He was scared of his school and returned to trouble that in his friends, he first started menstruation.
There are many well-known principles about the reasons for untimely youth.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other food items, chemicals in the environment or sexually-oriented messages in the media can be charged.
Boys are also getting premature youth like girls.
The capsulevites determine the rule that the main reason for this is the outbreak of obesity.
In 2001, she helped conduct studies on girls between the age of 6 to 9 years, which connects body fat with puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to get puberty before their age girls.
There are many explanations of this.
At the global level, the pre-mortgage pattern seems to be affected by all things, from economic situations to weather and genes.
Other puzzles: Although the boys are getting the hair of face and genitalia at an early age, but the trend of full youth is not as clear as the girls in them.
Other physicians who attended the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see the hair of pimples and genitals.
"We need to be careful about how we recognize the real beginning of youth," says Dr. Loren's Silverman, child doctor Endocrineologist at Goreb Children's Hospital in Mauritiustown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child doctor to take an opinion about how to talk to their children.
Caplovits advised, "This can mean talking before the required time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually answer properly.
It is necessary for pre-development girls to be assured that even if it is happening before time, it is a part of normal life.
On Thursday, the temperature was recorded at 3.1 degree Celsius.
Rain and cold winds that took place on Wednesday night made people feel very cold.
On Thursday, people wear sweaters and go towards markets and their destination.
People have also taken out the quilt when the first winter rains.
In the morning people were also seen enjoying sunlight.
There will be great relief from the disease as soon as the weather changes, but after that there will be a continuation of sunshine due to cloudy weather throughout the day.
The children also wear sweaters and reach their school.
At the same time, according to the Air Force Meteorological Department, the maximum temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius on Thursday.
While 7.8 mm of rain was recorded.
According to the Meteorological Department, there will be clouds on the sky even further.
Big orders of jet manufacturers at stake in dispute for seat width .
A competition has been set up for the fight for this month's Dubai arches, between the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long distance flights.
The dispute is focused on the width of the economy class seat in long-flying aircraft, not always like being given by airlines, but whose allotted place efficiency has been claimed by the latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company.
Airbus has given a detailed seat of at least 18 inches (cm) in the economy cabin this week, there is hope of such industry standard but it should be fixed by the airlines, its main rival Boing says .
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when after the incident of 17-21, there was a competition to sell the large version of the long-range aircraft aircraft aircraft aircraft's twin engine.
How has the previous department of the aircraft been created - in particular, whether the seating capacity is equal to 9 or 10, the design of mini Jumbo jets is being prepared keeping in mind the claims of excess capacity.
Boing says that it has been made ' 777 ' which will keep 406 people 17 inches wide and in one line 10 people in the unanimous department .
Airbus says that while competing with A350, it will take 350 people to 18-inch 9 equal seats.
Aircraft giants often strike on technical matters through advertising in the business press .
Now, with Airbus 77/7/C, Dubai is expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Arsh, so it is appealing to the public further.
Recently it is being seen that whatever the beginning of the Vigiyapan war has been, will you accept it together in a restaurant by showing this to Finsero?
Airbus Sales Chief John Lehi is also presenting a long distance flight from "Boing Regional Turbo" in hybrids.
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way to sit is not changed.
According to the U.S. Health Department data, between the 1970s, when Boeing 747 Jumbo-one was defined as a modern long journey, and the 40-49-year-old American male weight of the century grew by 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American man's waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says the opponent is clinging to a seat concept of 1950 when the new name was the average periphery of the set , narrow .
Airbus says that he has set up a research commission, which suggests improvement in the quality of sleep of an additional inch 53 percent in the width of the seat.
Boeing disputed the Airbus seat measurement data , and said it is not dependent on the decision of manufacturers how airlines balance between fares and facilities . . .
It also says that research shows that the width of one seat depends on the experience of the cabin more than the width.
Boeing cabin specialist Kent Crocker said . In reality this tells the airlines to provide flexibility and on things that they believe in what they need to do to succeed .
* They do not want to tell us who they benefit from.
They know better about their business than anyone else.
This is about the elbow room for the flyers, but for the suppliers it is a fast issue that it can affect the income.
Behind this dispute, the trade of at least $ 700 billion is estimated to be enough in the coming decades to tip the scale of US and European exports.
Reuters report said for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually the issue of fighting between new jet planes.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that 20 percent per seat has been done in their new twin engine design, in comparison to the leader of that section, 365-seater Boeing 777-300 acres.
The claim of Boing ' s performance depends on the comparison with the 10 - 777 X - 1 original 9 with the 777 design .
With profit in unit cost, 10 equals now the comparison is used.
Head of Airbus Passenger Facilitation, Kevin Kenston, Europe says, "This is Boeing's aircraft to capture more seats to make our products more competitive.
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seater-per-line cabin is suggested for the current 777 SC that many passengers are in favor of the Danish layout, which can go along with cheap rent.
Cabin internal expert Mary Karbi, founder and editor's runway girl network said that the eighteen-inch seat will be very good for wide passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is operated by the threat of proposal 777
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but provide a list for airlines to choose from suppliers.
Jet sellers from all over the world will also be careful to check the layouts competition.
While much comforting, all the builders are also offering low-cost airlines of jetties and high-densed layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10 equal A350 but it says it is not sold yet.
But recently, as long as Airbus stressed on some of its jet planes on the broad cabin seats in order to need more cabin facilities.
Without the support of other manufacturers of modern jet aircraft, there is no possibility of flying on a new industry standard, but it can disturb 777 % of the sales wave.
New anti-nicotin vaccine can end the enjoyment of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate the fun from smoking.
The same dose of vaccine was able to keep mice safe from nicotine addiction for the whole life.
There is a need for further testing before human trials, which may take several years, but in New York, Professor Ronald Crystal of the Well Cornell Medical College said that the initial signals are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We hope that this type of vaccine strategy can eventually help millions of smokers, who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods present in the market in today's time, but they found that their addiction of nicotine is more powerful than these existing methods. "
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, which has been prepared to provide genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus selects the liver cells, which then begin to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and prevents them from getting nicotine in the smoker by neutralizing them before reaching the brain.
In the trial, the vaccines given to the mice that were later given nicotine, they continued to do their normal work.
Researchers say that but the rat which was not given the vaccine was "good", it was an indication that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in a magazine called Science Translational Medicine.
The vaccine of the previous tobacco had failed because they had antibodies.
There was a regular interval of feeding, so that the level of antibodies remained, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is expected to be very high, because the liver cell will make the antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe then it can be given to children before the greed to try cigarettes, so that they can be saved from nicotine addiction.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
He said, "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not get any pleasure from smoking due to nicotine vaccine, which can help in reducing their habit."
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned of the need to do too much research.
Even after the post-mortem, due to the real reason of the death of the tigress, the curtain could not be raised.
The forest department is responding to the death of the first tiger by giving a round-the-clock answer.
On Thursday night, forest workers of Ramnagar forest division found the body of a tigress near the Pawalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi drain.
With all the parts of the body of the tiger being safe, there were no marks of injury or injury on it.
On Friday, the post-mortem of the body of the tigress was done by CTR's veterinary doctor Bharat and animal doctor of Kotabagh Hema Rathore in the presence of forest guard Vivek Pandey, CTR Deputy Director Saket Badola, DFO Kakha Nasim, SDO GS Karki.
According to sources, during the post-mortem, the internal body of the tigress is being said to be bad.
This did not detect the reasons for the real death of the tigress.
On the death of the tigress, the departmental officer kept answering the call.
Still, the internal organs of the tigers have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for the topsiological investigation to confirm the poison.
Forest Guard Western Circle Vivek Pandey said that the death of the tiger can be said to be natural.
There are no symptoms of poison etc. from the body of the tigress.
Yet, for this, the surrounding area is being searched and sent to Bisra for confirmation of poison.
We refuse to be affected by tripodi obide.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripathi will be examined by State Corruption Watchdog.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripathi has refused to refute the policy of pirates on the request of his political guru Eddie Obide, the patron of former New South Wales, who had hidden interest in the three government-controlled lands.
Against Corruption, the Independent Commission (ICA) detailed investigation on Friday, whether Mr. Obide has asked several State Ministers to violate the circular of lobbying lease policy where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obide, without tender were renewed after the expiry of their time in August 2005.
After the evidence given by former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, Lin Ashpole, did Mr. Tripathi know the hidden interest of Mr. Obide of the charge? is now under investigation.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressurized the public tender for leases.
The lessees were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, circular enterprises for leases, from which Obide earned $ 2.5 million annually, were renewed without lease tender.
Shri Tripathi, who was the Minister of Dargah from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favor of the public tender.
But he refused to change at Mr . Obei ' s request , Mr . Tripathi urged for a change in the Government Lease Policy .
Copies submitted in a phone call in ICAO in August and September 2007, Mr. Obide and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dan, a senior official who came to the Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Ports after working in the Ministry of Fisheries.
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Haley asked Mr. Tripathi. " Was the development of commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the matter?"
"No, Mr. Tripoli replied.
I can't remember what the discussion was, but it was definitely not.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obide.
Officials say that Israeli fighters attacked Syria .
Israeli fighters targeted Syria's port city of Latvia on Thursday night, a senior administrative officer confirmed Fox News.
The officer did not tell what the motive was, but there was at least one motive there.
The report of the Associated Press shows that the target Russian missiles were SA-125.
Israel has made an air attack on missiles inside Syria at least twice in this year.
Foreign workers on 457 visas can undergo "certification test"
The government is considering a "certification test" for foreign employees on 457 visas, because its purpose is to expand a strict action.
The trial, if adopted, will be carried out through a standard set of measures aimed at filling up unskilled posts in Australia, or to prevent 457 experiments to be conducted in a secret manner to the family and friends.
A government discussion paper was issued today, condemning the government's demagogy about foreign workers, former Labor MP Maxine McCoy said today that it could provoke neighboring countries of Australia.
He told the US India Institute today that "foreign people are reaching the end of the queue and "the strong rhetoric about the job of the Australian people is a very unpleasant repeat at a time, while the unions demanded a safe labor market. . "
Historically, it meant that white workers should have been provided security and I would not be surprised if some people in the area have seen the echo of that historic evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures which were earlier considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
immigration minister Brendan Oakoner, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about the smugglers, has implemented five recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "certification criterion" is adopted, then the visa applicant can be examined about whether the nomination is true in such circumstances, in which the nominated person, the owner of the visa sponsoring person or the relevant person is related or personal partner.
Businesses may need to calculate the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessman who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, the 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee seeker died of suspected heart attack after a refugee boat arrived in Christmas Island this week.
The troubled nine-year-old son of that person had come to Australia on a trip with him, and after the death of his father on Wednesday, an adult cousin has tied up, who was on the same vessel.
Australian officials rushed the person to Christmas Iceland Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of Scotland from the US2 Rail Project.
Work by CS2 indicates high speed services in Scotland and northern part of England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Cremer said that this project will make "UK" one.
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he is very excited by working with the UK government on this project.
The first phase will include a new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
Once the second phase is over, the lines will reach Manchester and Leaders.
In June, the government revised the cost of construction of high speed link between London and North England from "32.7 billion to "42.6 billion".
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland Transport, directed US2 Limited to consider the possibility of further improving rail capacity and travel time for northern England and Scotland.
It includes the possibility of reducing the possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours or less.
According to Baronace Cremer: Our goal for US2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.
We are moving forward with the US2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities in Britain, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be added well due to the US2.
According to Scottish Secretary Elister Carmikal: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown appealed Mr. Carmichael to "clear withdrawal of Scotland" in the US2 Network.
Mr. Brown said: "Scotland is likely to get huge economic benefits from high speed rail, but this will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the entire high speed rail case across the UK.
We are therefore excited to work in the partnership of the British Government to explore options to bring high speed railways to Scotland, create profits for all and to meet the Glasgow-Adinburg Line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the inquiry report with the ministers of the British Government next year and taking a decision together on further action.
Aircraft electrical equipment rules will remain effective in Australia now .
Despite the steps to be softened in equipment-related regulations in the US, Australian aircraft passengers will continue to close their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing the aircraft.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the option open to American aviation service companies to change their procedures, so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their equipment during the important stages of the flight, provided they remain in the 'Air' mode.
Passengers can do this only during many flights, but many people do not like to be unable to fly and reach their e-books etc. while landing the aircraft.
Australian aviation service companies are considering this decision, according to which US aviation service companies will have to do a lot of work to fulfill this requirement, but they have indicated that they do not have any immediate plans to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Security Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but emphasized that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment in important stages of flight are still effective in Australia.
"At present, the CASA has no specific regulation to control the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft, the Authority said, "This issue comes under regulations, according to which the airline operating companies have to ensure that the security system is always fully maintained, and the passengers have to comply with the safety instructions given by the crew members. "
Virginia, who is already negotiating with HASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but she has taken further action on the instructions of the regulator Asked to do
The spokesman said that "we will welcome the review by the VASA in the matter of allowing the use of electrical equipment, because we actually feel that it will provide better experience to the customers because now we have (virus-in-flight entertainment) in our planes. . "
Quantas said that it will now follow the current rules.
It said that "According to our current policy, electrical equipment can not be used during flying and landing, and we have no immediate plan to change it."
FAA decisions apply to American airlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit the passengers and we will definitely consider the decision of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different on each US aviation service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
The airlines will need to certify that their aircrafts can tolerate radio distribution from mobile devices, as well as modify their manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and brief details to the passengers.
FAA said that "After verification of their aircraft's tolerance by airlines, it will allow passengers to use light weight electrical equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones on all heights."
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will direct the passengers to close their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment safely under the seat or in the upper compartment while flying and landing the aircraft.
Ponbrookers silver due to the middle class feeling of difficulty in Singapore
Janani Amirthlinga is taking cash by paying her daughter's school fees to pay her daughter's school fees in a pandemire shopping center in Singapore.
Mrs. Amirthlinga said, "My husband and I have bought the house recently, so all our money is trapped in it."
She says, although she earns $ 3,000 Singapore (US 2,400) as an administrator, and her husband also employs, but the family's monthly income is insufficient.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of South-East Asia - where domestic credit is increasing - Valumax where they are carrying out their transactions, this week Singapore became the third panship to be listed on the stock exchange.
Pledge pledge is not the only way to get cash - Ms. Amirthinglalala is as cheap as 1,300 Singapore Dollars, but almost as unsecured bank loan.
Generally, in Singapore, Ponborkar takes interest of 17 per cent per year, which is slightly higher than the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local lender whose branch is in the same shopping center.
However, the POs have the advantage of not requiring credit check or proof of pay, and they can provide credit faster than the bank.
Millions of people in the region are facing difficulties due to rising cost of living by families and increase in domestic and consumer credit.
After five years of strong growth after the global financial crisis, and after cheap credit due to the easy monetary policy in the developed economies, the low and middle income families are turning to pan-hops to meet their needs due to the slowdown in their economy.
This week, rating agencies, standardized agents, Poor's, described the rising domestic gains, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditability.
It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic credit in the ratio of GDP in Asia.
Malaysia ranks at the top with 80 percent of GDP as against 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer credit in Thailand, which has emerged light from the tech slowdown this week.
On Thursday, the data has shown a steady export slowdown and a decrease in consumer demand.
Song Seng Wu, economist at the Malaysian Bank, CIMB, said, "The decisive point is that with rising prices, people coming from the middle to the lower class will try to increase their income in every possible way. "
In the last two years, historically high values of gold have inspired people to pledge personal property as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the value of their family jewellery.
70 percent of the items pledged in the city-state 200 pounds outlet in Singapore are gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of gold is good, let's pledge grandmother's gold chain, and take it back next month."
EIMini, Thailand's largest posh operator, has seen a 20 increase in the number of customers using their outlets in recent months.
There is so much increase in the business of pledgeing that the operator of the outlet in Bendimmer, Valumax and 15 others like it in Singapore are not only planning to expand in their neighborhood, Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia. , Yah Lee Ching, executive director of Valumax, says.
The company will finance it by using 60 per cent of Singapore Dollar 66 million listed on Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount creditors have been criticized due to higher interest rates, Ms. Yahoo says that pledge does not get cheap rates as compared to other lenders, but does not directly increase the loan.
She says, customers pledge things that they already have, and capitalizing on personal assets does not increase domestic credit.
Social acceptance of Ponbrooking is increasing to get short-term and safe financial assistance.
It is not that Ponbrookers use only financially vulnerable people.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use Valuemax outlet, they pledge gold bars or Rolex watches, which can get cash payment up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers of all sections of society.
Ms. Yah says, "These include rich people who need credit for a short period of time for business undertakings or investments, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow needs.
Sometimes they need money in a very short time.
Mukesh Ambani, India's largest businessman, is celebrating his 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Nita is celebrating her birthday in Mumbai but not in Jodhpur.
He organized a big party on this occasion.
Many big Bollywood stars arrived in Jodhpur to attend the party and on the evening of October 31, many big stars were seen catching Jodhpur flight at the Mumbai airport.
These stars include charisma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife poetry Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose etc.
Clearly, when such a big name is included in the party, you can guess how big this water will be.
$ 325 million rescue package for Tazi ' s health
The Union Government has stressed that stringent conditions are also associated with the $ 325 million rescue package for Tasmania's sick health system, which will ensure that the state government can not ruin the fund.
Union Health Minister Tanya Plybersek has announced that "the Commonwealth is taking immediate action to resolve the current crisis due to the growing population of the island state, high rate of chronic diseases, and the boundaries of the system."
The funding for the period of four years was decided after consultation with the government of Tasmania's independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
Ms. Plybersek today said, "The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the special challenges being faced by the state."
The 325 million package includes an alternative surgery plan of USD 31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgeries, will help in resolving the past accumulated cases.
It also includes funds for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Lostation, better hospital care, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of personal electronic health records system in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the best practices I have been told by leading physicians to improve the health system of Tasmania.
The Minister stressed that the Government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will have to maintain the current funding level to get Commonwealth funds, and report every month where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure effective and efficient service delivery by the State.
Mr. Wilkie said that the meaning of $ 325 million will not be very high till "real improvements are made to reach Tasmania's public health system to a more vascular level."
However, he praised the government for reacting to their request for immediate assistance, which they had first brought to the Prime Minister in early May.
Mr. Wilkie said, "I hope the federal support package will be very helpful in separating the state's public health system from the crisis list."
According to the state government, these additional alternative processes will mainly repeat the recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Tandon believes that today's announcement is "band-ed solution".
He told ABCTV, "We are here for this reason because the Labor State Government has taken $ 430 million in its health system."
You cannot consider the state government taking about half a billion dollars and giving 300 million dollars to the Commonwealth as a good news day.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plybersek be given a guarantee that not a single dollar from the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.

The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its ability to make chemical weapons
On Thursday, the monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed important equipment to make chemical weapons and poisonous gas war materials, while a fierce conflict emerged in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the place where toxic agents are kept.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian movement group has said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of Syria's civil war that started almost three years ago.
This announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made a day before the last date of November 1 .
Which the Hague-based organization had set up Damascus to destroy all chemical weapon production units and chemicals in toxic gases and to destroy the machinery used to fill in war materials or to make "ineffectual".
Completion of the initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in this ambitious event, which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by the middle of the year 2014.
Destroying equipment means that Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the existing weapons and collections.
It is believed that Syria currently has 1000 metric tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including Master Gas and Nerve Agent Sarin.
UK situation Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that this announcement took place when the conflict in Safira city increased on Thursday, about which experts believe that it is a collection center along with the chemical weapon production unit.
The movement group, which has details of the number of dead through the network of movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He has said that out of this, 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children, are included.
On behalf of the government, it has been said that 29,954 President Bashar Assad is a member of the military army, 18,678 are fighters fighting in favor of the government and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah are militants.
It also said that there are 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters in the dead, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people died in the March 2011 conflict.
It has not updated the data since then.
Due to this struggle, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad's military team continued to fight the rebels for several weeks in Safira, many of whom were related to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the observer said that people were casualties from both sides, but clearly did not say anything.
This war reflects the threat posed by the inspectors of chemical weapons, who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war, in a very short span of time.
In a statement to the OPCW, who worked closely with the United Nations, it said that its team "is satisfied and has confirmed it - and has seen all the important production and blending equipment of Syria - in destruction. . "
It also said, "No inspection activity is being planned next."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said that they had completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 centres out of the 23 centres declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were not able to go to two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, OPCCW said that according to Syria, these two centers have been given sacrifice and ... the chemical weapons products kept there were delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the unit at Safira was one of the two centres where the Inspectors of OPCW were not able to visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
In a comment issued by OPCW, the Director General of the Monitoring Group, Amat Uzumku said, "I salute the determination and courage displayed by you in fulfilling the most challenging mission done by this organization so far.
The three-year civil war is mainly a conflict between the Assad government and its security forces, including the Shiites who came out of Islam, and the rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, Observatory chief Rami Abdurrahman said that there was a strong explosion in the Air Defense Center in the Syrian coastal region of Latvia on Wednesday.
He said that the reason for this explosion is not known yet.
Police have recovered photocopies of counterfeit registry, counterfeit seals, laptops and counterfeit registry from the possession of the accused.
Moti Nagar police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accused include Rajiv Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohara and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar's Office (East) has escaped from the spot.
According to the police, the accused registrar, along with the clerk and recordkeeper Balbir Singh of the office, used to get papers from the records of empty and old land and after that he used to buy new stamp papers and prepare a fake registry on them.
Not only that, after making the real registry disappear, the fake registry was recorded in the record.
After this the accused used to sell the land for crores of rupees on counterfeit papers.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these counterfeit papers.
After this, the real owner of the land remained the police and administration's push account.
The accused, who prepared the counterfeit registry, kept a special eye on the NRI's land.
Because there is no one to look after NRI's land.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell the counterfeit registry of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill told that the accused told in the interrogation that they have prepared fake registrations near 150 so far.
According to the police, cases of fraud and theft have already been registered against the gang's gangster Rajiv.
Indignation over the conviction of the plot to plot a bomb blast in Bali
The relatives and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the bomb blast in 2002, expressed their resentment over the punishment given to the plot of the bomb blast and said that Omar Patek should face the firing team.
Patek, who ran as one of the most wanted persons in South-East Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building the explosive device used in the bomb blast.
When parole is given, it can be released in 15 years.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two night clubs in the famous tourist area of Kota, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and a lot of people were injured.
He was also found guilty in many other allegations related to terrorism, including a series of bomb blasts in the church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, although they could also demand that the person who was called the infamous "destructive person" in the form of a master who made the bomb should be the death penalty.
This decision revived the painful memories of the woman June Cortin, who had lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and her co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his tears, he said that Patek should have been given death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Courtine told AAP, "He should be put in front of the firing team."
I have to live every day without my grandson and my daughters.
Just after 11 o'clock on October 12, 2002, after the explosion of a bomb loaded in a parked van outside the entire club, the name of this club was erased.
Peter Hughes was in the Padies bar just 20 seconds before the explosion of the bagpack filled with explosive material by suicide bombers.
As a result of the incident of this bomb blast, he went to Coma for a month and died three times while living on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Hughes says that the same sentence should have been awarded to Patek, who was awarded the death penalty four years ago to three other members of the Jemmah Islamia terrorist group - Amroji, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the massacre.
In fact, this person should be sentenced to death before someone else.
To keep her alive, see, there is no reason to keep her alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding innumerable people, 20 years of punishment is not enough.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of Bali bomb explosives.
He survived arrest for nearly a decade, but eventually, in January 2011, he was arrested in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the US Army had killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent presented the evidence that the report revealed that in an effort to re-establish contact between the South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda, Pact was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden.
Ms. Courtine says, "He did not surrender.
Even today, it is not really sad to bring mental pain to so many people.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Courtine said, "This year there will be a lot of tears.
Still, Patek can appeal against his penalty.
FAA: Airplane passengers can now use the gadgets in the aircraft (but can not call the cell phone)
Airplane passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play, movie, listen to music from entering the gate to landing from the gate - but will not be able to talk to their cell phone - as per the highly predicted new guidelines issued by the federal aviation administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, FAA administrator Michael Hoerta said how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
The airlines will have to show how their aircrafts fulfill the new guidelines, and how they are updating the training manuals and rules for collection of devices of their crew members, to show the guidelines.
FAA has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetW are among those airlines who have already presented plans.
FAA said in a statement, "On the basis of the plan situation, we can accept the expanded use of electronic devices very soon.
At present, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft is closed.
They are expected to reach the height of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and do not turn them on until the Captain is allowed by them.
Passengers are required to shut down the device again while landing the aircraft, and do not turn it on until the aircraft is fully landed.
FAA said, Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic disruption, can allow their passengers to fly by air, use the device while landing and taxiing.
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at a higher altitude are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work together with airlines to do so - it will be a win for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we are bored with feeling like "Hall Monitors".
The agency said, however, it is still prohibited to connect and surf Internet at a height of less than 10,000 feet, exchange email, send or receive messages, or download data.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airline mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, an online scrabble-like game, the famous incident related to it is that when actor Alex Baldwin was playing on his smartphone during the plane park at the door in 2011, and when he refused to shut down the device by the American Airlines had removed him from the plane.
And heavy equipment such as laptops, etc., will still have to be collected because their bounce will cause the other person to be injured in the cabin.
Cellphone calls will continue to be restricted during the flight.
The Federal Communications Commission has regulatory rights related to phone calls, not with FAA.
During the flight and landing of the aircraft, FAA can lift the ban on some electronic devices.
Last month, Mark Rosen of the National Transport Security Board, who is a national transport security expert of CBS News, said that the cell phone is still considered a risk.
Rosenkar said, "The cell phones are really a serious issue, not because they can potentially interfere in navigation-related devices, but also because they are in the air, the cell phone towers can create disruption. "
In order to examine the issue, the Industry Advisory Committee constituted by FAA last month has recommended that the Government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has been increasing in recent years to reduce the restrictions using them.
Critics such as Clere McCaccilk, D-Mo have said that there is no valid security reason for prohibition.
It is becoming more difficult to enforce these restrictions because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also indicate that nearly three-thirds of the passengers forget or ignore the instructions to close their device.
FAA started banning the use of electronic devices by passengers in the year 1996 when passengers received reports of disruption in navigation and communication equipment due to FM radio and high-tech gadgets at that time.
New airlines companies are more dependent on electrical system than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by FAA to resist electronic interference.
The airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at the cruise height from the passengers for many years.
The revised aircraft for the Wi-Fi system is also more resistant to disruption.
HURTA said that most airlines companies should meet eligibility criteria for more use of electronic devices under new guidelines.
Todays electronic devices emit very less power of radio transmission than the last generation electronic devices.
For example, e-readers, during page replacement, there is a nominal transmission.
But transmission is dominant when downloading or sending data by the device.
Amazon.com has also been among those who favor the reduction of restrictions on the use of devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their full kindle e-readers in the airlines and flew them to test the problems but there was no such problem.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks associated with the use of the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Aviation Passenger Association said that he believes that the disruption from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that in support of the disruption by the device in the aircraft system, there are only reports described by the pilot, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the committee recommended that the FAA pilot be allowed to shut down the device when the aircraft was launched in less visibility.
The travel industry group has welcomed the changes and described them as common knowledge facilities for people traveling in the latest phase of technology.
CEO, US Travel Association, Roger Do said, We are happy that FAA has recognized that passengers traveling with pleasure are not incompatible with safety and security.

The bird was released back in the forest by air transport to protect from the North Sea rig
Birds found on the North Sea Oil Rig have been released from the coast by air transport in the forest.
This bird called Water Rail was sent by the helicopter to Abardin before the Scottish SPA recovered her back to the rescue center at Aloa.

Before leaving, the water rail had become healthy and healthy.
Is the upper class of Europe ready to do business with the UK?
The Business for UK was launched in April and pledged to bring business together and determine what changes we want to see with the UK's employment and prosperity maker EU.
For that, we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they had about Britain's business with the EU.
U-Gov took the views of 1000 business leaders who represent UKs business size, regions and locations.
The findings of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We found that a large part of the business community now wants to export outside Europe, and focus on those countries which are becoming modern and growing, while the EU members are becoming motionless.
He wanted the Government to accord priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, and not engage in the long-term and difficult process of reforming the mysterious institutions of the EU.
When asked about his views about specific policy areas such as monopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive abilities should come back to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of regulation of Brussels is more than the benefits of becoming a part of Europe's business sector - even the vast businessman who traditionally favored European companies, 40 percent agreed on this.
Finally and most importantly, our survey of business leaders found that a large part clearly wants the UK to move on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
This conclusion, which was seen at the levels of leading business groups, showed that businessmen are driving a " positive change" which will give the UK back its lost power.
It has a very high price - the treaty change for the UK and the issue of obtaining a better deal - changed the vote of 16 in favour of staying in the EU in the referendum.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: The survey indicates that UK professionals support their plan to negotiate the terms of UKs membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect a meaningful change in favor of the UK in order to balance the current power.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming increasingly mandatory because Eurozone is moving forward towards the bounded economy and the fiscal union.
Priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey findings indicate, for businesses, it means a new focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulation methodology of Brussels.

Prior to allegations against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission heard the allegations of sexual crimes against two employees of YMCA
Before being charged against Keringbah Child Care employee Jonathan Lord in 2011, two employees of YMCAA NSW have been charged with child sexual abuse.
But in his statement before the commission, he said that "there was no case of child sexual abuse within his organization, the commission was told this."
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which an employee of YMCA was accused of child pornography crimes, and another case in which Y.M.CA. Caringbah Jim Instructor was accused of child sexual abuse against children who were under her care in the year 1991.
Mr. Hare said to the advocate Gail Furnace, who assisted the commission, he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also acknowledged that the YMCA statement before the Commission that the YMCA has been examined in an external manner and has also found YMCA at the forefront in the field of child safety.
There is evidence before the Commission that YMCA was notified, and it obtained the second lowest rating in four possible ratings for Education and Community Department uality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that due to the appointment of Lord, "The management itself, including me, has failed, and failed to ensure that the employees are clearly aware of their responsibilities related to the information of child safety policy violations. "
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted for sexual crimes with 12 children during a two-year tenure at YMCA.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that YMCA had a cultural problem, due to which the employees did not report the child safety violation by the Lord.
What the employees saw about the violation, given the evidence in which Lord spent time alone with the children, getting them to be babysitting them privately, to say to them that he loves them and to play them on their mobile phones. Is included.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the supervision of Lord, and had said for child safety training because he was worried about his behavior, testified that Y.M.C.A. Caringbah, who supervised the Lord, was "very threatening" and it was difficult to meet for most of the time.
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable in giving information above his manager.
He said that, but his friendship with Lord misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his perspective to the YMCA NASW Mandal that, "Jonathan was about not giving "information" to the organization from the Lord incident.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement by the employees immediately after the charges came out was made by YMCA's child service manager Lium Whiteley.
He said that its purpose was to avoid the combination of evidence, but it was not "very encouraging and executed properly".
Stephen Smallbonne, Special Professor of Child Sexual Abuse of Griffith University, said that YMCA NSW was not a safe organization while working on Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011.
He said that there were "serious problems" in the appointment, supervision, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been adjourned till December 20.

I did this mainly because I had greed for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.

US-Mexco drug tunnel found its own railway
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between USA and Mexico has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The US authorities have described the tunnel of 4 feet 3 feet, as one of the most complex tunnels ever discovered.
The tunnel is roughly equal to the zig-zag length of six footballers, which connects Tijuana, the warehouse near Mexico and San Diego, USA.
This area is full of similar warehouses, which makes it easier to hide the truck being filled with drugs.
Officials said that it was closed before any drug passed through the tunnel.
According to the records of the court, the authorities seized 8.5 tonnes of Marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
Three people, about whom officials told that they were working as drivers, were accused of being kept Marjuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing them.
If convicted, they can be punished from 10 years of imprisonment to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona smugglers take advantage of huge underground drainage canals.
This tunnel is the eighth major route that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
In October, some of the largest tunnels in the aftermath of Central Mexico's Marijuana crop have been discovered, which pose a challenge for the drug mafia groups to speed up the delivery of the product to the consumers.
In the year 2010, the officials found a route of about 700 yards equipped with the railway track, which was spread from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to San Diego godowns.

British police sent extradition notice to Assange
The British Police sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julien Assange, who has taken shelter in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and has requested for shelter.
Scotland Yard said that he has sent a "surrender notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he will have to appear in the police station, and also said that if he fails to do so, he will be responsible for being arrested himself.
Assange is facing extradition in Sweden due to sexual crimes allegations, and his options under British law ended at that time, while the Supreme Court had rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm will hand them over to the US, fearing that he had requested the South American country for political shelter, on June 19 in the Embassy of Ecuador in London.
A spokesman said that Scotland Yard has sent a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange, for which he needed to be present in the police station on the date and time chosen by us.
He is in violation of his bail conditions.
The embassy refused to comment on the police notice being given.
Assange fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 US political cables on the anti-piracy website called WikiLeaks, the United States will be extradited from Sweden to face possible espionage charges.

Tax on foreign property owners will end the artificial situation in London
The Department of Finance has calculated the CGST measures as per provision but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osborne who introduced Stamp Duty at the rate of 7 for houses costing more than 2 million in the Budget of 2012, and those who prefer to keep a house in a company rather than a separate person.
In 2012-13, the stamp duty received from residential property in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chellasa was 708 million pounds, which is already more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook said: "After the increase in stamp duty of high value houses and the introduction of Associated Anti-Avoidens legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property has the least tax, which has nothing to do with the effect of the old council tax system.
He added that “But this step may make some foreign investors silent in buying property in London and reluctant to sell to existing owners . ”
The top 5 to 10 percent of the housing market as per the value in primary property, rich south-west London, extending from Phulham to Vimbaldan, has registered a record increase of 11.8 percent last year.
According to Seoul's research, the central London prices continued to grow at 5.6 percent every year, but the rising "home market" seemed to be slightly lower than because the city's south-west, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent) Is seen.
Scientists have further highlighted on this subject that there is a relation between the movements of the dog's tail and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs shake their tail more towards the right (in terms of dog), while restless dogs shake their tail mainly on the left side.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can recognize this subtle difference of tail and express their reaction to it.
This study has been published in Journal Current Biology.
Professor Georgia Velloretigra from the University of Toronto said: "In humans, all of them know well that the left and right part of the brain is involved in different ways in that excitement which produces positive or negative feelings.
Here we have tried to see it in other species too.
He said that in dogs like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the movements of the left hand and the opposite order, and two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
In order to know more about how dogs react to shaking of one-sided tail by other dogs, researchers observed the animals watching films of other dogs.
He analyzed the heartbeat of the pet dogs and their behavior.
We probably will not take much time to understand why their tail sometimes shakes on one side and sometimes on the other side.
Prof. Vellartigra said: "We introduced dogs with dogs films - in the realistic edition or in the shadow picture to deal with other issues that get confused, and we could see the movement of the tail and present the tail more left or right. . "
When the animals saw an impetuous dog moving his tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), they were completely comfortable.
But when he saw the tail turning the direction mainly to the left (from the point of view of the dog), his heart beat increased and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, they do not think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience that they should be worried about what act and not on whom.
He said: "If you have met many times from other dogs, and if they shake their tail continuously, then it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right part offers less friendly behavior, you respond on the basis of the same experience. "
Researchers say that these findings can provide better information about animal feelings to owners, animal practitioners and trainers.
Guest Fellow of the School of Veterinary Sciences of the University of Bristol, John Bradshaw, expert in dog behavior, said that this is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for dogs or not.
Last year, the University of Lincoln's team found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their head towards the left and turn their head towards the right when looking at a happy dog.
In other research of the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Contrary to the Italian study - when the robot dog's tail was shaken to the left rather than the right, the dogs were more likely to reach near him instead of being restless.
He said that this difference was because in different studies, dogs did not understand animals or robots dogs completely in dogs films.
He clarified that in this, the study of how dogs react to real dogs can help.
"While there is a lot of evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still available - and in this case dogs are not exceptions, they said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we probably will not take much time to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other side.
Arctic Monkeys suspended Glasgow Gigg due to Alex Turner's disease
The rock bank named Arctic Mankij has postponed the gig in Glasgow after being victimized by the throatshoth of its main singer.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first Cardinal in February
Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardin of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cartinels, the Catholic Church has top class pastors, their posts are below the Pope only, and these are the people who select the Pope, so Frances will elect the first group of individuals who will eventually help them choose their successors.
There are a total of 201 carnivals right now.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, Cardinal is not allowed to participate in the election of the Pope - it comes in the group of 120 "Cardinal Voters".
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lambadi said that before the promotion of new cardiacs, a meeting of all existing cardiacs will be organized, which is called the Pope-Sabha.
Lambadi said, "Pop Francis has decided to tell his decision to organize the Pope Council of February in advance, so that it becomes easier to plan other meetings with the participation of Cardinals from different countries of the world."
Jack Vallero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardiac voters was likely to decrease.
He said that the Pope in general, as less than 120 of the Cardinals, declare the names of the Corinels over 80 years of age, as much as they wish.
Vallero said that the next year's Pope will be important, because this will be the first Pope's meeting after France's election in March this year.
At present, there is a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
He said, "It would be interesting to see if new pops are nominated from the rest of the world to restore the balance.
In South America, there are forty percent Roman Catholics, but their number in the cardiac is very low.
The Cartinels Council by Francis - a group of eight Cardinals from all over the world, whose work is to find ways to reform the church, will also be the first to be selected after the formation.
Prior to this, the Pope used to decide all things on its own.
Valero said, "Now Frances has selected these eight cordins to help him."
He said that it is possible that Francis should seek advice from the Cardinals.
But we have not been in this situation before - it is absolutely new.
Valero said that usually the Pope gives the bishops of big places the post of Cardinal, but Francis was completely surprised - so we do not know whose name they will declare.

In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sera Pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, GM's share in New York Stock Exchange jumped 1.4 percent.
Obama's screams of disappointment of voters
I voted Obama twice than I expected change .
They say that due to the policy of GOP block, Obama's great efforts have been interrupted
Block policy can not excuse Obamacare website's troubles, drone attacks
Obama ' s memoir of the 2008 campaign reminds us of what could have happened .
Nathaniel P. Maurice is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books nowadays.
This is a book about which I think this second year will encourage me during the depression of the medical school and will awaken the ray of hope in me.
Its name is "the courage to win", and it is a souvenir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I get rid of the prescriptions of my patients at night and go to bed, this book takes me in a time in which politics inspired millions of people and the speeches could stop your breath.
Elections proved to be one-sided, and news speakers paused to showcase the historical significance of that time.
There were tears of joy in the eyes of my classmates, and my parents saved everyone's newspaper.
A team of young telescopes was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
During Obama's presidency in 2008, he had 82 percent approval rating.
And then I stopped the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, such as coming back from the world of dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad remembrance of lost opportunities.
After I went to the polls for the first time, there was a real change.
Simplely, I could not imagine any of this.
I give credit to Obama for many achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the return of our army from Iraq, "Do not ask" till Osama bin Laden is killed.
In addition, I believe that the policy of biased opposition has prevented many efforts to advance our country, including immigration reforms, public options for health care, closure of the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But innumerable times in which I took the side of the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues - the answer is over, which I can give them.
I've reached the point of political despair.
Republican opposition policy is not the answer to the espionage of foreign leaders, nor is there an answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It can not answer the National Security Agency to collect data about the personal life of ordinary American citizens, nor can it answer the prosecution of people who highlight the wrong actions of the government.
It can not tell the reason for the murder of Anwar L. Awlaki, a US citizen without any trial, nor the public funds and expenditure boundaries reduced during the President's Campan.
It can not answer the findings of the report, which says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website even after three years of being signed under the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know if I had hoped it.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the governance system could refute the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is obvious that the elected office is not a pre-requisite for the anti-political parties and random incidents such as the Newton massacre would shape our public discourse.
However, the examples I have given above seem to be largely chosen by the administration itself.
This thing bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidature.
Mr. Romney presented an confusing and an uncertain option, which did not seem to be like determining his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which will be free from the pressure of future elections, will fulfill those expectations about which we have been hearing for a long time.
However, while Obama's approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, returning through that book has become very difficult in 2008.
Seeing him, I miss his disappeared promises.
A part of the book was reading this week, in which it was described how Clinton was a major loss due to Obama in Pennsylvania primary.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinate staff that they need to return back to the track and there is a need to remain faithful to their objectives.
He said, "I want to get my socks back."
We should remember who we are.
Today, after five years, Mr. President, I cannot agree with you more.
The views expressed in this comment belong to Nathaniel Moris.
Clive Palmer claimed that the interest of P.M. Tony Abbott is in the matter of ancestral leave plan .
billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the ancestral leave scheme as his daughters can be pregnant, and can take advantage of it.
The Maharathi of the mining sector, who is in dispute about the payment of a $ 6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed, while he has tried to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control the Senate up to four votes, which can be important in determining the reduction of carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only the interests of ministers can be fought, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can take personal advantage of policies.
Mr. Palmer said, "In the case of paid parental leave, he can have an important interest, because if any of his daughters is pregnant, then he will have a direct interest whether he gets a holiday or not."
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer as the winner with 53 votes of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Mr. Palmer demanded restoration of election counting to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughter Franceses and Bridget.
Should the result of the election come two months after we voted?
He said, "We should have a better system.
Why cant we have a system in which we fill our details on the computer, vote immediately and at 6:30 in the evening we have a result.
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencil for marking ballots.
That's because if a person does not like him, then he can erase it?
It seems absolutely absurd to use pencil in today's era.
Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint discussion paper with New ealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his policies include the construction of an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he will take his new work "very seriously".
Public post is for public service.
He said that "We do not want any other award except for the award of history that we can serve the community at this important time."
The litigants had to face problems.
Addressing the gathering on this occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed strong resentment over the deteriorating law and order in the state.
He said that the fast growing attacks on advocates and their families prove that the criminals have become unconscious.
There is no fear of police and administrative system on them.
Referring to such incidents in different places recently, he said that when the advocate society is not safe then the security of the common man can be easily estimated.
RBS suspends two Forex Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from the Department of Foreign Exchange, two persons from the case have received information, another indication that the global investigation by the regulators is progressing at a rapid pace in the dubious manipulation of the currency market.
Some of the world's largest banks, including BS Barclage, Deutsche Bank and RBI, have confirmed that they are collaborating with regulators in the investigation of the world's largest financial market in which 5.3 trillion is exchanged every day.
These two traders will be the first employees of the RBI, who have been suspended with further investigation of the case which appears to be a recurrence of the Liber Bank loan manipulation case.
The bank has refused to comment on the suspension and confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from the regulators this month.
Two weeks ago the bank had said, "In this case our investigation is going on, and we are fully cooperating with the UAE and other regulators."
Last month, the case was reported by the well-known that the RRBs have sent the emails received from the former traders and the records of instant messages to the K Regulatory, Financial Ethics Authority.
This trader, Richard Eusher, left the RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been discharged from the current post of European Chief of Forex Spot Trading at JP Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading in the city, went on leave last week, while former senior Currency Traders in Barclage and CBSE were suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Scholars from the case told that Mr. Usher's Quick Message Group includes Bankers of Barclage and Citizengroup.
The BSF said that after being told by the Swiss regulator, Finama that he is investigating the suspicious manipulation of the foreign currency market in many Swiss banks, this week he has taken action against some of his employees.
At least six authorities at the global level - the European Commission, Finama, Switzerland's Competitive Authority, VCO, the Department of Justice in the USA, and the Hague Paper Monetary Authority - The bankers are investigating allegations of being misconstrued for their favorable fluctuations in the currency market.
The people familiar with the case said that the SSB, the city group, JP Morgan and Credit Suice have also examined the internal investigation, or have received a request for information on behalf of the regulators.
The banks are closely scrutinizing the quick message and email equivalent to many years in search of clues for any wrongdoing.
News on investigation has created a panic among the traders in the sector, who have been one of the most profitable in the trading unit of Investment Banks for the past several years, but are facing the challenge this year as the chances for bookmakers have come down due to low currency fluctuations.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the huge and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that it is not necessary that this is true.
Senior trader said that despite the huge quantity of foreign exchange purchases, fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and increasing use of their own platform by banks means that "you can start affecting the market at a small ticket price."
This news came on the same day when Credit Suisse announced his departure from the Exchange Traded Fund Desk in London this week, which had lost about 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
Credit Suice said, "We believe that the trader had worked alone, and it has been controlled."

On Dhanteras, people have made a lot of purchases of gold and silver from the utensils in the capital.
Such purchases have increased 20 to 30 percent more than the previous year.
In Shimla, jewelery shops were roaming in the shops.
There was also a lot of crowd in the shops of utensils decorated from Lower Market to Malrod.

On Friday, the auspicious seal for shopping was from 7:52 to 10:12 in the morning and from 1:56 to 3:37 and from 6:17 to 8:12.
At the time of the three Muhurtas, more crowds of people in the suburbs including Shimla came up for more shopping.
In Shimla Lower Market, people did not get a place to walk.
The crowd in every small shop was also engaged in the same way.
In such a situation, when the purchase of Dhanteras, which is celebrated as the Triodshi Dhantriyadashi of the Krishna Party of Kartik month, is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
The Supreme Court supported the Obama health service law .
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the US Supreme Court today declared the Health Services Act as constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
By 5-4 votes, the judges decided in favour of a separate order of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - under which citizens need to buy or punish health insurance before 2014 - it was constitutional under the power of the government to impose tax.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other moderate members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thos, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court has also supported the remaining sections of the 2700-page law, and said that the condition of the health care law is that the state should increase the medical eligibility or they would lose all federal medical funding is not unconstitutional.
This petition was brought by 26 states, and the National Independent Business Federation to prevent this law.
During the initial session of 2012, this law was opposed by all the prominent Republican Presidential candidates, including the project nominee nominated person, Mr. Rumni.
It is true that our work can not be done without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for living, but it is not in our interest to accept everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras to Krishna Triodashi of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshiped by the god of wealth Kuber and death god Yamraj.
Money is an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good.
Good is our sense of money.
There can not be any more valuable thing than the money that came in the welfare of humanity, but the money that became the cause of ego has no meaning.
We earn money for the holy purpose and spend it only for the holy purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the family's maintenance.
There should also be a sense of spending on the society, but the tendency to earn unaccounted collection or Yen-Ken-Yakran-prakriti destroys our conscience, personality.
The spirit of donation should always be in mind.
A part of the money given by you can also become the basis of someone's life.
Many people in the society are living in a terrible absence, for them all should think.
In fact, the meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in life.
All people wish for wealth and fame and according to their wishes, they also get wealth and fame.
The same wealth is sustainable with which respect is connected.
No matter how rich a criminal is, he can neither eat it properly nor can anyone work for another.
If someone else has money then do not envy him.
The true rich is the same who makes the way to flow in innumerable hands of money.
There can be no more utilization of money than the creation of employment for others.
One more thing, money is not just in the form of money.
It would also be in the form of your health, character, love for others.
Try that you become the owner of this money.

The states where kerosene sales are to be closed include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, some states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the Northeast are also preparing to stop the sale of kerosene.

Surrounded by the opposition's questions at the Rail Gate, Pawan Bansal put the opposition in one place by saying that he did not look at anyone's woman in 15 years.
After this, all were surprised that after all the talk of the woman came from where.
Perhaps Bansal's gesture was towards the domestic relations of a senior BJP leader and a councilor.
After this, turning the case on the other side, Bansal told reporters that during the last parliamentary elections, the BJP had conspired to put a woman behind him and made a complaint which could not be successful.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said that the CBI has questioned him in the Rail Bribery.
If he was made a witness in the case, would he have been made only after complete investigation?
Bansal said that he had written a letter to only one needy person in the booth scam that he is talking about.
If this is their crime then they will always do such a crime.
He said that although there was no constitutional right to raise this issue in the Corporation House, he himself asked the opposition to speak.
He said that as far as the development work is concerned, the opposition will be given a list of development works for 15 years.
The way Chandigarh is being developed or is going to happen, these people can not even think there.
There was an exchange of greetings between the two in the Cabinet meeting.
When the meeting ended, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for counter-attack on Narendra Modi in the Chintan camp.
He also said about his speech that there is no other sense in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
The new challenges should be fought firmly.
There was also the same feeling on the face of the Chief Minister that he took Singh's speech positively.
It is known that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the workers in the Chintan camp and save them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
However, he had also said that he was ready to sack from the Cabinet to keep his point.
By the way, after the opinion emerged in the Chintan camp, there is a possibility of a fresh idea in the matter of setting up workers in government posts.
In the camp, State JD (U) President Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the announcement of nomination of workers in the 20-point committees will be announced soon.
His signal was also that the list is almost ready.
The news is that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself will inspect the list from his own level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of MLAs and MPs has been taken to make the list or not.
If needed, a large number of changes will be made in the list to give place to old and committed workers.
The common allegation of MLAs and MPs is that the opinion of those people was not taken in the list of nomination.
The names of the people who came after many other parties have been recorded in the list, whereas many important activists active since Samata Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal by their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such person also comes to the name of late Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, who was posted as a teacher in a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat, was born on December 28, 1932.
Dhirubhai was third in the five siblings.
Five children of the family include Ramniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to leave studies only after high school.
Dhirubhai started financially helping the house in childhood.
At this time, he used to set up a Bhajiya shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, at the age of 17 in 1949, he reached the city of Aden in Yemen with a ship called Kabota.
Here his elder brother Maniklal had made all the arrangements for him, so he did not have any problem in getting a job abroad.
But there was something else going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954, they returned to the country.
In 1955, after placing 500 rupees in pocket, he reached Mumbai to try luck.
And his business journey started from here.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back.
His name is famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At this time he was the owner of Rs 62,000 crore.
At present, his son Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handling their Sultanate.
Like father, today the name of these two brothers is also one of the international level businessmen.
Who does not know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

Jagaran bureau, Srinagar: The police has allegedly removed the security of former minister Ghulam Hassan Khan, who joined the Congress from the People's Democratic Party.
Khan blamed the state government for this and said that his security has been removed for political reasons.
It is known that Ghulam Hassan Khan Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, who won the election in 2002 on the PDP ticket from Shopian, was included in his cabinet while being the Chief Minister.
Ghulam Hassan Khan said that I have got security cover since 1996.
I live in Shopian, who is called the fortress of the terrorists.
A security team of CRPF was stationed under the leadership of Sub Inspector at my house.
There are also bodyguards with me, but on Thursday all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security team was going from my house, I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said that he will investigate this matter.
Of course, in this context, when Kashmiri IGP Abdul Ghani Mir was contacted, he denied the information about the matter and said that it is a sensitive matter.
I myself will examine how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been removed.
State Congress chief Prof. Saifuddin Soz said that there is nothing like this in my information.
If Hassan Khan's security has been compromised, then this is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu, I am coming to Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to this report, during the last four years, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Rather, unlike Modi's claims, during the NDA rule (between 1999 and 2004), during the tenure of Atal Bihari Bajpai's PM, a period came when no advertisement was issued by the government on Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002). .
Keeping the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182-meter high 'Statue of Unity' statue in Kevadia in Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "There was no advertisement before on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
While DAVP records show that the UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When asked about Modi's claims from Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari, he said that BJP's PM Candidate does not talk on the basis of facts.
The UPA could not bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
About which Tiwari said that this was due to the economic slowdown that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on Nehru-Gandhi family members' birth anniversary and death anniversary every year.
DAVP spent 33 crores for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and death anniversary, 21 crores for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crores for Indira Gandhi and 9.38 crores for Jawaharlal Nehru on print advertisements.
When Manish Tewari asked about this difference, he said, "It should not be seen from the perspective of expenditure on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, which include things like advertising size or advertising rate for that year etc.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, the people who oppose it are trying to handle the legacy of a great leader without knowing it.
Today, he will meet the families of those killed in Patna rally last Sunday.

Moving forward through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Well, is delivering free health care in the rural areas of Cameron.
Well and their team watch hundreds of patients every weekend .
There are not many doctors in West African countries , there is only one doctor for 5000 people .
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or for someone in the top 10 to make C.N. year hero.
The winner will receive $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father come to the hospital and fainting, which was not properly facilitated to help him.
Jameel Well, in the year 1981, a car accident near Cameron's capital Yonde was injured.
In the beginning, he had only lost his hand, but an infection spread to his brain, and he produced anemia, which affected the rest of his life.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgeon in the Cameron.
If we had money then we would take our father out of the camera.
Instead, Well continued to revolve around the crowded clinic and hospitals with his father and continued to get whatever treatment he could get.
Well said, "It's not easy.
You leave the house at 5 in the morning with the hope that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but it does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can wait in the mouth of death while waiting.
Since the death of Well's father in 2002, the situation did not change much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5000 people in the camera.
If you compare, there is a doctor for every 413 persons in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many residents of the camera can not afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in health care in the country is from the private sector.
Well says, "His only problem is poverty.
And being poor, they cant enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Vel took a firm resolve to resolve it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgery last year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon in Yonde's Central Hospital.
And he started the NGO Escovim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped around 32,000 people.
On almost every Friday they and around 30 people sit in the van, tie medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes luck is not with them too.
They have to push the vehicle more than once by pushing the rivers and the soil.
But when they arrive, they actually receive the honor of heroes: the best home to be presented by feasts, singing and dance, and by the community.
Free medical services in these villages are actually a reason to celebrate, and well - with their big smile and endless energy - it includes joy and happiness.
The next morning his team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We are meeting 500 people in each trip."
They come from the village about 60 km away, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - this document is required in school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team carries out simple surgery with local estimation.
The operations are usually carried out at the school building, town hall or home. After the process, the patient walks to the recovery site, and creates a place for the next person.
The group's generator publishes operating room and sanitizing equipment, and wells and their volunteers work on Sunday morning and morning.
This is the speed of the movement, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
Well said, "They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work."
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - including cameraman physicians and foreign medical students - has conducted 700 free surgery last year, and they know that their help can change the world of people they help.
One person said that due to the free hernia surgery, he will be able to go to work again.
The person said, "This will change the future of me and my family."
Apart from running the weekend clinic and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Well also works in the private medical clinic around Yonde at night.
He said that this is his second job which finances 60 of his non-profit work, the rest is completed by private donation.
Katie O'Melli, a second year medical student of Draxel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Well's Group, said, "I do not know when they sleep.
They are always in the hospital, or they are trying to earn money for their organization so that they keep running these campaigns.
Medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join the Well's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity for them, which they can never get in their country.
O'Melli said, "In the surgery we help in catching tools for Dr. Well or cleaning blood stains, we have been able to get experimental experience."
As a second year medical student in the US, you will never get the opportunity to do this.
Voluntary students usually spend on their own to reach the camera, and they often come with medical supplies of donations.
But after reaching Yonde, they come to live, and take the cost of instructions.
O'Mally says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameron is never going to end.
For the welfare of the people, the burden of almost the same work, is not a problem.
Helping others live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are things that make them very happy.
Well says, "I'm very happy to do this work.
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to laugh people, reduce their pain.

In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said that the US spy 'has gone a long way inappropriately!
By accepting this unexpected form, John Kerry has indicated that the security attitude of the US on his surveillance program has softened, that sometimes its espionage goes "inappropriately farther".
The Minister of State has also acknowledged that he is also guilty with Barack Obama in the matter of being on "Autonomous Pilot" as a rebel disclosure towards informant Edward Snowden about the NSA's espionage activities.
This revelation has brought the U.S. government diplomatic relations with its allies.
Speaking through video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said, "There is no question that the President, me and others in the government really knew about some things happening with the automatic pilot, because if you look back, it had the potential of World War II, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, in 9/11.
He has become the first high-class member of the US government, who has acknowledged that US espionage has crossed its limits, but has insisted that no one's rights have been misused.
He said that: "In some cases, it has gone beyond inappropriately."
And the President is determined to make it clear to the people and is just making a thorough review so that there is no sense of abuse in any person.
I assure you that nothing is wrong with innocent people in this process.
Shri Kerry emphasized that however, the NSA was striving for a good purpose, and its monitoring work has saved lives of many people.
He further said that: "We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves."
There is radical insurgency in the world, which is committed to killing people and blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what is the problem if you are able to stop it before it occurs?
We have actually saved the aircraft from falling, building collapse, and killing people because we have been able to know about others' plans in advance.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said that the US lawmakers will go to Europe to help in resolving concerns abroad about the so-called US espionage, and will try to convince European countries about the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the US.
Connector Senator Chris Murphy said that he has spoken to the members of the European Parliament and others this week and they are worried about the threats of preventing their involvement in anti-terrorism organizations due to frustration over monitoring by the National Security Agency.
For the first time, the Democratic Party was elected and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee of European Affairs, in an interview with Washington, said, "It is really important for the US national security interests that in the context of our anti-terrorism efforts, European countries should be with us. "
To make it clear to the European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be influenced by their anger about the NSA program.
News of NSA recording millions of phone calls in Europe has brought bitterness in relation to some of the US allies, although the agency chief said that these reports are not completely correct, and reflects the misunderstanding of the metadata shared with the United Nations, which is being shared by NATO allies.
Other disclosures in the documents leaked by Snowden show that the NSA has monitored the cell phones of 34 other top leaders of the world, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clipper, while defending the incident of spying on allies, said it was necessary and said that it is common for both sides to do so.
Between the ruckus, Murphy said that his office is arranging a visit to the Congress which is likely to happen this year, and he hoped that the delegation will include members of both parties and both the chambers.
The names of other participating law makers will be released in the coming days.
He said that the travel program is still being worked on.
While Murphi said that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations, he said that some "practical relations have to be abandoned."
He said that European leaders will have to be honest with their people, their espionage programs used for years.
Murphy said, "Even though we can modify our monitoring program to better protect the rights of European people, but they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying.
During this weekend, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to visit the Middle East and Poland, where he will resolve his animosity towards the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
New politics has begun to change the board in municipalities.
Recently, due to the change of party councilors of Congress leadership board councilors in Saithia municipality of Virbhum district, the Trinamool has changed to the board.
This change happened due to the involvement of most of the Congress councilors in the Trinamool, including the chairman of the municipality.

Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Roy considers it an auspicious sign for the party.
He says that 10 Congress councilors, including Saithia Municipal Corporation Chairman Virendra Parekh and Congress leader Vipalav Dutta, joined the Trinamool.
Some councilors of the Left Front, including the CPI (M), have also taken the flag of Trinamool.
All have written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the Trinamool and according to the number force, the Saithia Municipal Board has also come under the control of the Trinamool.
Mr. Rai also claims that all agree with the blueprint for the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties, including Congress, CPI (M), CPI and Forward Bloc, are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
The eligible leaders of any party are welcomed in the Trinamool.
Before the elections of five municipalities to be held on November 22, due to the change of party councilors in the Saithia municipality, the capture of Trinamool on the municipality board is being considered as important in political circles.
Earlier, in the Left Front ruled Haldia and Nadia, there is an example of Trinamool's occupation of the Congress-ruled municipality board.
When the Trinamool is occupied due to the change of party on the municipal board in the districts, those who join the party are welcomed in the Trinamool Bhawan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited about the leaders joining the Trinamool by breaking down from other parties.
They say that those who break down from any party are welcome in Trinamool.

However, the main opposition party CPI (M) says that the lower level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People are joining the Trinamool Congress fear of terror.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is considered as a shock to the CPI (M) democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its base, but it is imperative to question the justification for making a change in the matter of power.

Tux told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family is "very worried" about the care of his daughter and they want to call him back to Australia.
Tunx said, "Certainly this has been a worrisome time for us, but we hope that he will be back home as soon as possible."
Bamfod has appealed against the order of the sentence, and has got bail on 50,000 excuses.
