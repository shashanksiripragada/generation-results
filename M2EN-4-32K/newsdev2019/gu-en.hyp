When will you open the doors of the temple for the woman in Paradise
My younger brother, Sakhi, told me about two weeks ago that he was preparing for the third fast.
Thirdly, there is a festival celebrated in North India, which is celebrated with the prayers of married life.
For the third time, the married women continue to fast all day and pray at every step of the night.
While talking to me, my friend's voice was very enthusiastic and happy.
Sakhi took a new sari to wear on the third day and henna was put in both hands.
I was also glad to see it, but its periods began on the third morning.
After that, both his mother and mother-in-law had forbidden him to pray and worship.
The other women of the house also advised me to stay away from the worship room and also not to waste the worship materials on the wrong side.
My friend was also told to stay away from the other women who were crying for the third time.
Entry into Periods and Temples
After that incident, when Sakhi talked to me again crying and crying, I felt as if somebody had left a smile on my face.
I came to know about his enthusiasm and preparations for the third edition.
Henna, which was found on the vaatas, once again watched the photographs of the hands and my eyes drenched suddenly.
I had told him in anger that along with the third one, we had to leave a religion which decided to enter the temple due to love of Tara Heart and Periyads instead of Snake.
I was reminded of my friend and third episode of Bhopal when the news of Supreme Court's order that ban on women's entry in Sabarimala temple was flashing on Friday morning on several TV screens.
What was the dispute of Sabarimala temple
Entry of 10 to 50 year old women was prohibited in Sabarimala temple in Kerala.
One of the main shrines of Hindus, this temple has been prohibited for hundreds of years.
Behind this discrimination, the logic of the temple administration was that Lord Ayyappa, who is sitting inside the temple, is getting Brahmachari all his life.
Therefore, women who are at the age of menstruation will not be able to go there and worship.
The Indian Young Lawyers Association in 2006 filed a public interest petition in the Supreme Court challenging the temple restriction.
After hearing the hearings of both the parties for 12 years and for 28 hours, the Honble Presidents Bench of the five Members of the Supreme Court had passed away on the 28th of September, 2018.
What did the Supreme Court say
Chief Justice of India Justice Deepak Mishra, Justice R.K.
Nariman, Justice A.M.
The prohibition of entry of women in the temple, which was passed on to the Constituent Assembly of Justice Chandrachud was a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution.
The Bench said, "Anyone should get permission to worship the temple without discrimination.
The fifth and only woman judge in the Bench of the Constitution, Justice Indu Malhotra, passed the judgment of the remaining four and gave the above judgements more than 4-17.
The irrational dust of superstition
While reading about the court proceedings, my brother's face was visible in my mind.
Two years ago, the period of periods had started for that young boy.
She told me one day in a frightening voice that when she was in Period, she had refused to go to Bhagwanji's room.
In addition to this, restrictions on movement of kitchens and touching of handlooms have also been removed.
Bhatriji told me that on that day Mummy had made me a fate.
I was very hungry so I did not remember that my periods were moving.
So I went to the kitchen in which I was running to get rid of the problem.
She asked me why she was so angry with her mother. She asked me why she was so angry.
I had no answer to that question.
My far-flung brothers and sisters, the youngsters from hundreds of homes, are seeking answers from us.
The question is, the Supreme Court has lifted the ban on women's admission in Sabarimala. But when will we remove the irrational dust of our superstitions?
When will we open our homes, our kitchens and the doors of our hearts for the women passing through the period
Periods or menstrual hygiene is a common biological process related to reproduction in the body of women.
How can the process which is responsible for the creation of the world and the existence of human beings be impenetrable
And if a woman falls ill for those five days in a month then we must abolish such a criterion of purity.
The Supreme Court can stand before us by holding a hand in front of the whole world. But the question is, when will we stand against the other half of our population as a society

Rehabilitation with Alster Lambretta Club .
Lambratas was an essential aid in the 1960s model scene.
The spirit of that era is being kept alive by a group of enthusiasts of the motor scooter of Italy.
About 100 scooters from the entire UK and Ireland travelled to the core of the forum 70 years after the formation of the first Alster Lambretta Club this week.
Chris Wills, one of the two members of the original club, purchased his first Lambrita in 1966 in 40.
The scooter was not only a form of transport for me but also an option for other things to use it.
It was a little sports-activity.
I had never come to sight late and now I am too old for that, he said.
Originally, it was cheap, reliable, and it was available at reasonable prices. And once you have it, you can do other things while riding on only A to B space.
He used to race Lambrita to Time Trial near T.T. Circuit on Oil of Man.
The first Ulster Lambretta Club was collated in the early 1990s but it was modified 12 years ago.
He died around 1991, interest in scooters, other transport forms and difficulties in general did not help the club, so I thought, 'Na, Bus, End', said Chris.
And then some time ago, people's interest in it seemed to be more and more developed.
Philip Steel is the Member Secretary of the Alster Lambretta Club and currently has members.
Each has shown its own contribution.
In view, it will be full-fledged people, and from there it started to become very real.
Others are present in racing scenes, in cash, there is a blend of people of every kind.
Some people are just about Vintage.
Many scooters were customized and no two of these scooters were equal.
You can keep it somewhere in the original form or at 35 or 40 mph, which was originally built for going to the small lanes of Italy, but some people have done it.
Some of the highly tunified bikes here may also go up to 100 mph.
At the end of the week, there used to be some disablement and push.
And when the climate in northern Ireland is not as pleasant as the Italian house in Lamberta, then the sun was shining because the scooters were traveling around the County farm.
Ruth Davidson orders the Tory breakage to silence.
Ruth Davids has been given a silent mandate among his orthodox colleagues to ensure that the Chief Minister gets the break-out deals over the limits.
Mr Scott Morrison, President of the European Union (EU) said that the two years after the European Union (EU) vote had enough time to discuss.
Her comments follow the description of the scheme of the Czechs of Boris Johnson as colourless and totally unverified.
She told the BBC's Sand Politics Scotland that it is time to go behind the Prime Minister.
Since the Tory workers gathered at Birmingham for a party conference, she said: It has been time for the past two years for the church.
Former Foreign Secretary was one of the State's great offices, while most of the plans were being planned and appreciated by him in the beginning of November last year.
Now is the time to leave the conservatives behind the Prime Minister, to give them an opportunity to deal with the transactions and to support the service of the nation.
With regard to the silent period, I would like to warmly welcome him.
Boris Johnson, former Secretary of State for External Affairs after a strong intervention in the break-out discussion.
Later, Theresa May told the BBCs Andrew Mar program that the Czech scheme has the ability to offer a true free trade deal with the European Union, thus emphasizing that she believes in the breakage.
She also told him that the Second Scottish Freedom Struggle in the next election with the commitment of the Declaration to obstruct popular opinion as they promised to the people of Scotland in 2014 that it would be only one generation event.
When asked about any other mandate on the subject, she said: In the context of our history in Scotland, I repeat this fact that if you are a nationalist, you cannot revive the public opinion because you have not achieved the desired results.
I would have been very surprised if I had said that you could revive this brakes because the result for which I had filed the commission was not there.

This explains the statement of the attack by Christine Blasie Ford's friend Bret Cawenou.
Dr. Christine Blasyford's high school friend, Land Kizar, who was both teenagers, had filed a letter explaining to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not remember the house party where the alleged abuse was done but was responsible for the Ford.
Kizer had earlier issued a statement by his attorney stating that he does not remember the question party, and he does not even remember to have met Caeveno.

President Trump suggested that the FBI should conduct an investigation on Friday within a week after a full-week delay in the entire set vote on Kevin's confirmation of the time being given by the senators from Republic of San Jeff Blake and other intermediaries.
On Saturday, Kisser in a letter to the committee, through his counsel, said that he was ready to extend full cooperation with the F.B.I.
However, my client, as already clarified, does not know his wife Geevno and never remembers who she was in the party or who she was without or without a doctor, Ford or where she was.
He also said that the Kisser does not pay the dues to Dr. Ford, and has already told the press that he believes in the responsibility of Dr.
It is a simple and irreversible fact that he is unable to support it as he has no memory of the incident.
Marquez, a friend of Kevinau, who was so-called during the attack, also said that he would cooperate in the FBI investigation.

He has his own gang.
So who will believe in us
Becker said.
The Joshuha Taffar of the University of Chicago, is said to be a response when no one was present.
They took it forward because they saw these people as dispossessessessing themselves and did not care about them because they are unclean people in the housing project, who were found guilty of any kind of bitterness in their minds, said Teferre.
Sergeant Watts went to jail in 2013 and spent 22 months in jail for trying to steal from the FBI.
Due to vots - Martis wiss also went to jail.

A few years ago, I and some other senior officials were just eager to know what was going on here, especially for bitcoine, she said.
We started it together so that we could say that we have started to understand it.
This curiosity started digging up betacon at one place in New Hampshire, while the cost of cripples was around 180 dollars.
In December last year, when the bitcoin had almost increased to 20,000 dollars, Jones had said, "The price of olives has increased and suddenly we are earning money that never existed."

We have tried to implement Blackchain in some ways, where we learnt a lot, but technology is not enough to solve these problems.
As of now, the group is focusing more on some of the constraints, she said.
They are looking at how to tap the physical objects, for example, a piece of art, or how to use the Blockchain in the supply chain space.
He is at Abhai, but we think he will come back after all, Cheze said.
When fitness starts, it will be well equipped.
She used the example of the Pebble clock that failed with retail standards, but something that paid for fitness.
Her group created an app for smart phones, which was shut down by mobilizing lakhs of funds through a crowd fund cluster campaign.
Feedback was also made when Appel Watch came to the market.
He used an app developed for Pelle for fast-moving life on the new product of the app.
We do not put a condition that the Pableach is the next big thing but if we have people wearing these on our wrists then we should also be there, he said.
He taught us when the smart watch came into the collective market, and we were able to stay there.

The incident took place on Saturday, the 28-year-old man who was arrested for three attacks, including the attack.
According to the court documents, when the dispute began, he was asked to ask him to get the truck and his father refused.
The first-degree theft of the track panel, the fourth-degree assault and the fourth-generation criminal actions were arrested, and the files of the court show that his father was injured on his face and head.
The document says, Trek Pali called the officers on the farmers' scene and asked them to leave their weapons while trying to talk to them.

The documents show that Trek Pali had also told the police that he had consumed some beer in the past.
It was arrested in early 2016 and in an attack on domestic violence with a woman, allegations of domestic violence were made in the form of rape and intoxication.
My son is going through the shadows, he is going back to the shelter. I can connect with other families who feel the impact after PTSD and our soldiers who return with the wound, said the former Republican Vice President's candidate and the governor of Alaska.
And, moreover, I have always understood from it that for the best of America, there will never be a situation like this that we have the chief commander who will respect him and respect him.
Elizabeth Warren says she will think of the presidency after the midterm session.
The Democratic Senator told the Town Hall Tolain in the Holoc of messengers that "It is time for the women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and a woman at the top."
Therefore, I promise to you: After 6th November, I will concentrate on running for the presidency.
Warren, who was fighting to save his meeting this year against the challenge of Republican State Rep. Jeff Dahal, had reduced the expectation of a run saying that he had focused on his work in the Senate earlier.
During the National Press Club speech in August, she told the media that it is important that we focus on the mid-term elections and the only important glittering thing in the continent is 2020.
The crucial battle that is taking place at that time is the election of the middle class and it is true in the magazines. This is true in the whole country.
Warren is considered the Democratic President's nomination for a long-standing 2020 presidency to replace President Donald Trump.
However, he will have to face a highly competitive primary competition, as some other high-profile Democrats are paying for the highest office, including former Vice President John Biden, California Senator Kamla Harris and New York Senator Kyrgyzstan Gilbrand.

The Appellate Court upheld the 2016 order that the group did not copy the Spirit band.
Spirit Gitarwadkar's Songs Trustee, Michael Schidmor made a comeback in 2015.
The song runs a little - and it seems that the story of Lady Eppler's Stereway to Hevan will become another long player.
The band is facing a new experiment on claims that they have stolen guitar for the 1971 folk song.
The U.S. Appellate Tribunal has denied the order of 2016 that the group has not copied the beginning of their hit from the music of the Spirit Band.
It was said that the judge of the trial had made a mistake about the Copyright Act, including the old members who had wandered through the wrong path.

She was found guilty in a hospital on Friday where she was firing a bullet on officers with the police SUV while trying to get on a busy highway.
Nolin is charged with five major crimes including murder intent attack and escape from police.
BComing Police Captain James Magfi said, "It is not a rule to inquire into the hospital, but it is not that she has heard."
He is getting the necessary treatment, but we also need to turn the wheels of justice.
It will facilitate the judiciary to make it happen repeatedly, the Prime Minister said.
Nollin's girlfriends body was found on Thursday morning at the Crusade Estate Mobile Home.
The same bullet from the mother of two children was killed and the police immediately named Nollin as a suspect.
The police then issued a warning in the public about the detection of Nolene, and gave a detailed physical description of it and its 16th black doz pick-up truck.
It was seen in its truck and as the police tried to pull it out, Noli had jumped on US 131.
Noli broke his truck on a concrete medium and then came out and started running on the highway.
When he was running, the police opened fire on the officers following him.
Take a copy of the police SUV and run from the back to the noline.
An overview of the incident took the video of the incident.
He was taken to the hospital where he was in critical but stable condition and will remain in quarantine until he is shifted to the County Jail.
The willpower of our police officers in Western Michigan shows that they will also harm themselves to the security of the community, the Prime Minister said.
They took him to the right time and in the right place and we are proud of him, the Prime Minister said.
In short, Nollin is a charge of twice the execution of the attack with the intention of killing, fleeing from the police, holding hidden weapons and using guns.
As the investigation continues, a charge for the death of its girlfriends will also be placed on it.
Mangfi said, "Certainly, the investigation of human deaths under it continues and we are close to wrapping it and presenting it to the County Counsel at the right time."

The judiciary has admired the bravery of our brave men who struggled, who tried to steal their home, the Prime Minister said.
Even though a criminal had a wooden plate on it, 63-year-old David Oldham was not silent.
Instead, the university's estate manager fought the battle, both the criminals were beaten and teethed by one person.
The perpetrators were taken to death, but Mr. Oldham had been released with blood marks, one of them was identified and arrested after four months.
Wrong the Ford, who lost a punching tooth outside his 400,000 home in Armskirk, Lancashire, Mr. Oldham, said: Mr. Oldham gave you more than necessary because when the crowd gathered outside his house with that date, the mouth was hidden and only the eyes and nose were visible, he hit it.
And she did not just hit him, but when the star partner, the ladder that was above, landed down from the roof and killed him too.
I hope that you have learnt two lessons on Friday, while holding the Ford in jail for three years and four months.
You will not get crowded with David Oldham, and two, you will not get crowded with the police.
In response to these crimes, the star for pain has now fallen below one tooth and is killed by a dog.
At least you are eligible.
Replying to Tara Karmas to Mr. Oldham, he added: I have full marks for responding.
The public prosecutor, Derek Jones, said that during the theft, the Ford was awarded a three-year sentence awarded in 2016, including a thief.
Liverpul Crown Court heard that Mr. Oldham had done this by listening to voices outside his home on 5 April 2019.
Mr Jones said: Mr. Oldham, the sportsman bravely walked towards the house and faced the counter.
Fearing for her safety, she hit her face once, wiping it over the floor and extracting the teeth.
Then the other intruder, Mr. Oldham, came down from the roof, hit it with ease.
Mr. Jones said the companion took a wooden band and roused it in front of Mr. Oldham, and Ford said: 'You kill him, he brushed my teeth.
The friend said to Mr. Oldham, 'If you let us go, we will just leave it, and that and the Ford have fled from there.
On 2nd August, the police arrested the force after printing a house in the ward.
Ford beat a police dog and then killed him on his shoulders.
The second thief is still considered to be very large.
The 25-year-old man has no definite title, he was found guilty of stealing, assault and illegal driving and driving without license.
In the conference hall, the Tory workers attacked them for Boris.
Boris Johnson had to bear the block because he was hit by a sharp attack on him as an 'unusual and aggressive' by the Tory workers.
Despite strong attitude towards Mr. Johnson, the brutal assessment by former Prime Minister Digby Jones had worked well with the members of the conference in Birmingham this afternoon.
Meanwhile, David Davis attacked that Mr. Johannesson focused on 'Headline' instead of intensive policies.
And, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi added to the online saying, "It was so much happening because she did not have the data for the all-out leadership bid.
This negative response came after former Foreign Secretary branding the brakes as 'colored' and 'non-responsive' and launching another vicious attack on the Prime Minister's check-up plan.
Mr. Johannes had pointed out that he was a reminder of public opinion two years ago while he was convinced of the project.
And urged the government to support ambitious projects such as building bridges between North Ireland and Scotland.
But a rebel, Mrs Mei, responded by saying that her interpreters were playing 'politics' and they did not speak out loud about running tough deals with the EU.
Speaking during a visit to the BBCs Andrew Marshow on winning the Tory Conference, Smt. May said, We believe in breakage.
Lord Jones, former Labour Minister, who is now a freedom fighter, praises the opportunities of breakage and makes people happy.
However, he appreciated Shri Johannesson for his alleged remarks while replying to questions on the issues raised by him.
Without naming Shri Johannesson, Lord Jones had set his goal, he is actually an incongruous person.
It is equally important that when I heard former Foreign Secretary slandering him, he described him as an incomparable and preposterous person, he said.
I take a big exception for this.
Lord Jones also welcomed Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, who witnessed the speech of the leaders of the EU on the Czechs scheme at the Solberg Summit from the Hall.
Earlier, Mr. Roth Davids, leader of Scottish Tory, also targeted Mr. Johansan, and demonstrated that he had been a senior member of the Government during the UK talks.
Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Union Minister for Women and Child Development, in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today, informed Ms.
It is not harmful to have such stories in todays papers, he added.
He is making a lot of noise but Boris does not have a number of MPs and he knows that this is the issue.
There is a huge contradiction between the Honorable MUDRA taken by David Davis, the commission of his case and the manner in which Boris has continued his personal ambitions.
Business Secretary Greg Clark rebuked Mr. Johnson for attacking business to be suspicious about the breakage.
Speaking on the topic of Birminghams Tory Conference, Mr. Clark said that Mr. Johnson's ignorance was wrong.
I was surprised that one could even think of it.
There is no successful economy anywhere in the world that does not have a successful and prosperous business.
In a meeting with the Ridge of Sky News on Sunday, Mr. Davis admitted that the next few months would be really frightening as the EU had tried to impose a bigger rebate from the UK.
But he said that the government has to be patient of the need to place emphasis on the Canada-style agreement with the Czechs.
When asked about the attractions of Mr. Johnson as Tory leader, he also showed a poignant figure.
uoting from the proposal of Mr. Johnson of the bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said, "There is one strong idea in the damage to British politics.
We are special friends, but most of their ideas are not good leaders but good policies, he added.

The Middle Ages for Cracra in Pernic, West Bulgaria and the Roman Fort of Trinovi Vata near Itimen have provoked a fierce anger of the Defenders after the reconstruction of the Polymer Concrete, which is often used to build pavements.
According to a report, the telegraph report said that both the EU and the government have privately accepted that the lesson should be learnt after the release.
Asu is good, Anchuthengu is a good fort. A protectionism architect Stella Dulwaya said about Trinovi Vrata.
It has been saved for 16 centuries and now it has been ruined.
It was a negative reaction to the restoration of the Cracra Fort in Pernic that the local authorities had said that they would dissipate the additions in 2019.
The building of the Parnik Fort has been called the Cardboard Fort due to the middlemen.
The Yelata Byzantine fort, which has been restored to the white Lisa Block, is known as the Church's fort, coated with its climate-response.
The curious fact is that the European Union faces a fresh scrutiny of how its development fund is being utilised.

Just four days ago, these two lions had killed a crocodile near the sub station of the Barman village and considered it as Mizo.
The increased deer was moved to safer places, not by forest department but by local people.

But for the last 48 hours, a lion has not been seen in the joint of these lions.
Then the people of this region are overwhelmed.
The forest department is doing survey while sitting in the office even after informing the forest department.
While one of the lions is likely to get loose motions instead of being fat, the local farmers are discussing it.
More than 15 lions in the region need to be sent for sample collection to forensic lab.
Otherwise, in the Dalkhania range, the forgiveness of the lions' dogs is being given to the death, and if this incident is repeated here then is it not surprising?
It is necessary to send sample laboratories.

On Antonin Scalia Cavenou, we will not be surprised by the 'anti-Made Libs', the son said.
On Sunday, the son of the late Associate Judge Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court, told Fox News that thanks to his vast power of the Supreme Court in modern life, his father, J. Brate, would not have been hurt by the opposition to the nomination of Kevin.
At the general level, it will not be surprised at the intensity of the Supreme Court's nomination, as at least one of them falls on the Rowives - at least the right way that it is presented by Christopher Skelia, referring to the Landmark Case of 1993, she said that women have constitutional right to abort within a certain quarter.
In one stroke, Roy prevented States from taking their decisions on how to effectively control abortions, and many States took steps to curb miscarriages immediately in response.
My father, along with Ro-Wade, repeatedly said that in other cases too, the court was trying to find a solution to the real internal and cultural issues that were being resolved in elections and in legal processes. He added during his visit to Fox and Friends.
By trying to sort out the process, the Supreme Court caused further damage and consequently the Supreme Court's nomination and confirmation battles became more hot because Justice took the role which falls in the legislature.
The same issue was raised during the hearing of Cavenau's confirmation earlier this month, when he reiterated that the Congress often represents most of the unbiased executive bodies of the agencies and consequently, in order to effectively determine the irresistible bureaucratic uncertainties that are left to the Supreme Court, which provides for a complementary legislation to the arbitrariness by the senators.
Hundreds of opponents were arrested and arrested by the Captain Hill Police for their wrongdoings in this confirmation action.
It was asked that Kevinu had an opportunity to avoid such negative reactions which are mainly focused on unsupported allegations, which were involved in sexual abuse a decade ago. Scalia said that there is no possibility of avoiding such disturbances.
Responding to the claims made by the senators on Thursday about the critical allegations against them and, at times, in response to claims of being serving the Supreme Court due to reckless behaviour, Scano suggested that the judge does not always have a calm mood.
In the context of hot-spot cases, Scalia said that getting angry for the justice is not so rare.
It is true that J. K. Davenou was perhaps more aggressive, but that was because the circumstances were very different.
He used to protect his good name from unsupported allegations.
Kevnou got the approval of the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday to move to the entire set-flower vote through the party-line 11-10 vote.
In the dramatic moments, Sen. Jeff Blake, R. Aris, said that it would only give a decisive Swinging vote on the Kevino's side if a week's time is given to the FBI to investigate the claims of the current and credible irrevergence against Kevinau.
The investigation is underway and President Trump has said that the agency has extensive power to interview whatever he wants.

The powerful connections of the joints - pictures
Born in Detroit, London-based photographer Peter Zelavsky started his career in street photography four years ago, focusing on Zodia.
As a portrait photographer and a human being, I have always been attracted by the collaborations that have been listening to the wonderful bond.
It was never intended as a complete project, but when I took the porterate of the first set of Jodiyas, it became a major occupation and there was no way of returning from there.
The next book of Jelvaski, Twice, presents 44 sets of images and stories of similar collaborations.
This project is essentially of an insight, he says: It is not a document or a scientific project. My main objective was to create a strong and emotional connect for the people.
Nurses pass the Confidence vote in the Union on Pe-Del Handling
Members of the Royal College of Nursing, who have been angry with the behavioral changes in the NHS pay deal, have voted to pass the speed of any distrust in the organisation, to misrepresent the expected salary increase.
Former General Secretary Janet Dave acknowledged that he had come up with a long-term story within the RCN as he misquoted members for an immediate 3 increase in wages this year after the end of the 1 salary cap.
Many members were disappointed with not receiving the expected increase in wages, which resulted in lowering the pressure of the Davids members, resulting in the vote of confidence in the College Council at a general meeting in Birmingham on Friday.
The authentic and open discussion of Birmingham cleared the air and consequently the college would emerge stronger, said Mr. Mariya Trevarn, Chairman of the RCN.
This vote is clear and a message has been sent to the Council and Management of the RCN.
In the recent weeks, the Council has already initiated and carried out transformational changes in the institution to listen to members more closely and to include them well.
A meeting will be held next week and it is expected that the members of the RCN Council will return.
Based on the Nursing Trust, an NHS nurse told the Guardian.
The action taken by the RCC has destroyed our faith and they have to go.
I hope that they will take honourable steps and follow the request.
I look forward to seeing if the members of other organizations are looking for similar solutions.
On the ground and below, NHS personnel have opened their salaries and understood that they did not get as much salary as they thought.
And they are angry.
Prior to the extraordinary meeting, the RCN had acknowledged that it had made significant mistakes in 2018's wage deal and its communication process.
However, it is stated that the scale of the RCLs scheme, which mandated the Government to eliminate the salary cap, is to be introduced in three years with only 6.5 increase in wages.
The vote came after an independent report that the representation of the RCL's transaction was in favour of its approval, while no restriction was imposed on the transaction of the Davids.
It is claimed that the RCN presented a factually incorrect information which means that the members were not able to give information on the transaction, whereas the alternative options were not checked.
R.C.N. has published contradictory information as to why there would be a 3 increase for all members.
In a separate summary before the Congress of the RCN, the representatives were incorrectly stated that there would be 3 increase and growth would increase.
In fact, the increase in wages is 3 and in any case, only a few of the top employees in the pay band will immediately raise it.
The report, which was launched by the spokesperson of the Electronic Reform Service, said that the information provided to the members about the implementation of the deal after the Congress (which is probably the outcome of an effort to simplify the message).
The ERS believe that failure to inform decision makers in comparison to the present decision, which was clearly comparable to the proposed transaction, hinders the right decision as it fails to provide a clear reference to the 6.5 and 2 percent of the data used during the campaign.
Conditions of Vote of Confidence were passed with 89 of 3.49 of RCN members electorate.
Lindsay Lohan disturbs Instagram Live viewers as she tries to transgress family children in her street.
After posting live videos on Instagram, Lindsay is criticizing Lohan for attempting to isolate poor street children from his parents.
Probably live videos shot in Moscow (on the basis of earlier Instagram story updates) offer an actor's roof over a family head at night, but the situation is over soon.
Hello friends, I just want to tell you a family I met, she told the audience, A Syrian refugee family I am really worried about.
They really need help.
Do you want to come with me
Come with me, I will take care of you. Before moving towards a child, they tell the family: Do you want to stay in the hotel tonight
Do you want to watch films?
Watching movies on TV or computers will be a great pleasure.
When the parents refuse, the iron gets sharpened.
She says that you should not keep your sons on the ground, you should work hard and do whatever you can for your children so that they can live a better life.
If someone gives them a house and a bed then give whatever I do to them.
They will come back to you.
I will not go there until I take you away.
Now I know who it is.
Do not shit with me
When the family tries to escape from Lohan, they go behind it and still broadcast on Instagram.
What is happening is the movement of children you are spoiling Arabic culture by doing this.
You are taking these children, they want to go.
Children, I am with you, do not worry, the whole world is watching this.
At the end of the video, the situation comes to a standstill as the mother appears to be crowded with iron.
The clips of the videos have spread over social media indicating that they are attempting to do so.
The Independent has contacted Lohan's representative for the comment.
The people of the third part of Britain believe that they will never pay their debts.
About one-third of the British believe that they will never be able to fulfil their duties in their lifetime. And more than 10 say that they will not be able to reduce their debt levels.
In research conducted by Equifax and Gorkana, especially by The Independent, it shows that people in the age group of 18-24 years, especially those in the age group of 18-24 years, feel that they deal with life-long debt. Only half of people say that they can sometimes return in black.
According to a report issued last year by an Institute of Physical Studies, students are graduating with an average of 46,000, and the poorest of the poor is graduating with more than 5,000 degrees.
In fact, most of the graduates-81 will never pay their debts completely, which means they will spend the first 30 years of their life hanging on them.
The level of overall debt in the society is rising National Statistics Office statistics show that the domestic credit in the UK is high, while the UK spends more than 900 on earnings every year.
But how should we worry about this panic of depression-induced data
Has life-long connect with credit become a new normal- not just for the small educated but for the entire population
For example - many times we buy the biggest after home (which is fortunate).
This week, Auto Traders have predicted that all new cars will be purchased in a decade, just as we expect to pay for our motoring changes.
The director of the equity investors and the chartered Financial Planner, G.D. Bioil, certainly believes that the expectation has changed.
Devotion is now more common - Credit cards are more prevalent, and similarly zero percent balance transfers, student loans and daily wages are also known as lenders.
It was a shame for our grandfather's generation to be a god.
In recent times, students are generally indebted for loans at home.
Moira O'Neal, head of the personal finance at the interactive investor, says that the results can be worrisome.
If you want to buy a property worth 4-5 times the cost of your income, if a big amount is created then adding a little more to it is not an important thing.
And people will face difficulties in this place.
The interest rates have been very low for many years and people with big motor or other debtor should take care of them when the rate is rising.
Probably it is understood that the critics of the finance industry seem to be credible.
The Chief Executive Brian Brody of the loan agency Freedom Finance says: "God is not a bad word.
In order to buy a house or a new car, taking a loan is no longer seen as a last resort.
At low interest rates, many people have been encouraged to lock down their savings into fixed-term accounts, which offer higher returns, but reduce savings.
As a result, the middle class is getting more credit.
In the last six months, half of our new line of credit was taken by customers with highest credit rating.
This expectation of lifelong loans for Richard Haymes, the head of the financial difficulties of the equity company TDS group, is a clear concern.
It says: The FURTI opened up to a six-month high of (2.7) in August, 2020. Due to the recent increase in interest rates and a limited wage increase, it is a matter of concern that a large number of people take loans without the actual expectation of being able to actually pay back.
According to our analysis, this year, personal liability will increase by 1 and the principal contributory factor is the record level of consumer credit.
When people work and earn, God can be controlled, but what can be the meaning of life-long wellness for the old age.
The research carried out by the Centre for Economic and Business Research (CEER) with Equity Release Expert Mor 2 Life indicates that the unprotected population in the age group of 55 to 4 years is more than the third in the last four years, which is faster than the national average.
And the most commonly used credit card for this age group costs 30 more than the monthly payment.
We are seeing more and more people using the freedom of pension to repay the loans at the age of 55 years, which affects their well-being in the retirement.
It is often the only saving that has forced us to do it effectively.
People also think that they will use equity to pay back to their property - but this is a problem because it is not necessary to always get the required funds.
Future reduction in the property process will give a boost to this.

A lot of love for this and for what you have done by dedicating yourself.
Thank you, Serina one person has written.

I have lived up to the age of 20 years for breast cancer and even though the mammography has not shown anything, I have found a tumor on self-examination.
Testing is of utmost importance.
Thank you for taking you out of the facility area - You are a goddess
As part of the I-Teach Mysself project, Berley also releases a new Snackskin print, bra, inspired by the star The Crisis.
100 of brand profit will be donated by BCN.
While doing so, it is important for you to know the essentials and symptoms.
Along with the clotting, other signs of breast cancer include the size or shape of the breast, pimples or skin boils, the secretion of the breast dens, the skin cracks, continual pain or changes in the structure of the skin.
Similarly, swelling can occur around the armpits or collar bone, such as in case of increased veins or vomiting.
Women are advised to test their breasts every month.
If you look at any of the symptoms of breast cancer, NHS suggests that you should meet your GP as soon as possible.
After testing, if they feel that your symptoms need to be further evaluated, your GP will advise you to go to a specialist breast cancer clinic.
In this SNL skating the aad - driver is so good that cast is not able to keep a direct face .
The Adam Driver was the guest of the Night Live this week, and he actually performed 110 percent.
The exciting sketch of the show is always such that it is not in an existing event, and that is the same in the new skit career day.
At the American High School, Tamara focuses on bringing her father to work on that day, where Kishore Mortdecai (Pit Davidson) reluctantly agreed to talk to her old oil father, Ibrahim H. Parnas (Adm Driver).
Laying with a stick, Parnas is likely: Daniel Day-Leviser will be driven by self-power inspired by Daniel Plane, who is not eligible for blood, to carry forward the responsibilities of the sovereignty of the oil industry.
Parnasse told the students, "My birth took place very soon, in seven months.
The incubation technology was just the beginning, so he put me in a cast iron pot inside the pizza oven until I had enough maturity to walk.
My bones have never been strong, but my soul has become.
Be strong and tear your enemies apart
The school teacher who plays the role of an A.D. Bryant, a fellow S.N.L., struggles to keep the face straight and the driver is not visible at all.

I got married to my wife. That's what happens.
He has filled his belly with my sharp seeds and raised the star boys. That's my last change, HR.
Within five minutes, Parnass became as exciting as the driver's character, as Kilo Rene did in two feature films.
He is a curse, HR

Three people lost their lives after the dissolution of the Northern June Lutia Bay.
A search was carried out on Saturday after three people lost their lives after the helicopter crash in Junau, Alaska.
One person was rescued after the crash on Friday, but three others still have no cards.
Helicopter Crash occurred in the north west of June near Lutyia Bay.
Helicopter on a long distance journey from the Texas Grand Priory was named Airbus H125.
A plane, which was about 100 feet away from the coast on Friday, was intercepted at the exit.
According to the report of the Associated Press, one person rescued was known as 14 years.
The survivors were found to be hypothermia, but the rest was fine.
When the helicopter landed, it included two aged people and two teenagers.
The missing persons were identified as David King, 53 years old Josh Paper, 42 years old and Andrew Paper, 11 years old.
The big paper was designated as the head of the construction company Devis Manufacturers and Engineers, Alaska.
It is not clear what happened due to the class.
The National Transportation Safety Board has stated that investigation is underway.
As per the statement of KTV, Coast Guard officers said that two adults and two young children were on the crashed helicopter, which was said to be totally new to the factory.

'I am a victim of sexual exploitation'
On Sunday morning, Advisor to President Kellyn Conway said that he was a victim of a sexual assault.
Conveyor responded sharply to the last week's visit to the Supreme Courts Nominy, Judge Brett Covenau and Arope, Christine Blasie Ford.
In response, Convey emotionally declared that he himself had been victim of sexual assault in the past and saved Kevino to host a jack tape, saying that he believed that he was the victim of sexual assault on it.
My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones due to tribal attacks and atrocities.
I am a victim of sexual assault, Conway said on Sunday at CNN's State of the Union program.
I suffer from sexual assault, I am not expected to be responsible for either the jack tape or the Jeff Flake or any other person.
You will be responsible for your conduct.
Conway termed the network as a call to compare the charges against Kevinu, which was directed by Bill Cosby, who was sentenced to three to ten years in prison in Pennsylvania last week.
Conway opposed the inability of the Senate Judiciary Committee to exclude former President Bill Clinton from office even after having oral sex at the Oval Office and speaking a lie about the direct attitude of the American people.
Kevinu and Ford's Jubby have divided America, show the vote.
In the United States, there is a difference of opinion on the attitude of Bret Kevon and its complaint Aropy Christine Blasyford, in which Ford claims that Nominy of the Supreme Court had a sexual assault on him, while he was both young.
And the number of people who believed that the Ford Caeveno group spoke was equal, with 38 per cent of them said that they believed that Kevino was probably or certainly wrong during his era, while 30 per cent said the same about the Ford.
The Senate Judiciary Committee heard from both sides the letter giving details of the actions taken by Fourde Senator Diane Feinstein to the judge.
When the letter was issued, Ford and Kevinou said that they would be ready to call the committee.
During her youth, Ford said that it was 100 per cent certain that Keenuah was the person who tried to attack him in a domestic party early in the 1980s and that could be a case of misidentification.
In an emotional opening statement, 51 years ago, she felt that it was her civil duty to come forward.
I'm scared, she said.
I am here because I believe that when I was in the high school then it is my citizen's duty to tell you what happened to me.
Kevnou, who condemned the atrocities committed by the Ford and two other women accused him of sexually assaulting her, said, "I have never carried out a sexual assault on anyone - not in high school, not in college or never."
He said certain things - irrespective of the distance from which it is brought, or whether it is unpleasant, would disrupt the opinion of my nomination.
These are the words of the last moment, pure and easy.
Unsurprisingly, the U.Gov.Poll results, which were divided into party lines on September 2-28, which surveyed 2,600 people, included Democrats considering Ford (3 per cent) and Republican Cavenou (4 per cent) more votes than Democrats believed in Kevinau (14 per cent to 11 per cent).

He told me: Angeli, I am entitled to keep me cool for a year - 25 Celsius, but after that time I really have to put my hand on me because otherwise I will die.
So, I have one year for mourning and I have to do it.
Subsequently, in an ideal way, its trademark Fedora will be wearing hats, adding to the exhibition at the London pavilion. At that time, other shawls will be in cold and tar mud, such as horse riding or leaf playing.
When the British television witnessed a live demonstration in public for the first time in 10 years, Van Hagens gained popularity in the UK.
Since 1995, 4 million people from around the world have visited the Bodo editions.
Peterc, The Guardian, founder of Bodo Worlds London said that the 28,000 square feet exhibition space is based on 100 percent donation from people who have agreed to help and educate people on what is wrong.
We see and read many terrible things that scare us from death.
All of us are going to go there, that is what is common in us, we are all going to die. And I think the world shows us that you dont need to be afraid, said the tabernacle.

Myoga told Der Spiegel that it does not appear to be tied to the agreement that she was suffering from nightfall nine years ago.
She told Der Spiegel, "I have had such a serious breach before.
And again, the crime of rape.
And I blame it, and I blame it for signing it.
Freedom by continuous writer business
Are you ready for Self-Publicing 3.0
In a new white paper published today on self-pub3.0, the Alliance of Independent Authorities for the first time have pointed out how writers can join other creative entrepreneurs to increase their independence and create a sustainable writer business.
One of the 100 influential people in public publishing and the founder of Orna Rose, Alliance of Independent Authorities is to explain why and how authors should adopt self-publicizing 3.0 in 2018.
Consumer behaviours such as personal branding, careful use of mobile phones, upgradation of reading, are aligned with the digital publishing technology to create more favourable conditions for the writer-persons than before.
But only those writers who have developed independent, creative and empowered thinking can benefit from these opportunities and understand the value of their intellectual property.
Selfpub 3.0 encourages writers that we have the diversity of income generation through our own websites, which can become the center of our successful publication and media ventures.
The flow of income could include direct sale, subscription models, cross-border support, large distribution models, online education and other income streams.
Selfpub3.0 also means using retailers and other services to distribute our books as widely as possible in such formats.
Mostly, self-pub3.0 is a change in the mindset required to control your writer's business, whether it is a business or a self-declaration service, rather than handing over your most valuable creative wealth to the business of another person.
These are measures that enhance the income, influence and print for writers and make every writer and publisher interested in the digital era, he said, adding that for real freedom writers or anyone, it should be in original vocation as well as in creative freedom.
This is the future.
And for those independent writers, there has never been so much better.
Self-publicing 1.0 desktop publishing and print on demand.
Self-publication 2.0 was to sell e-books for e-voters and phone users through online booklets.
Now we are entering the era of Self-Publicing 3.0: Self-Employers create efficient and sustainable writer ventures.
The Alliance of Independent Authorities is the only global, non-profit organisation for self-declaration writers.
The objective of ALIMCO is to promote excellence and ethics in self-declaration, to provide writers support in making and selling books and to advocate writer independence through the creation of sustainable digital businesses.
The President of Italy, the Central Bank, warned the Government of the matter on the deficit scheme.
The President of Italy and the Governor of its central bank on Saturday warned that the country's god will be consistent with the democratic government's plans to significantly increase the cost of food next year.
At the end of Thursday, the 5-Start-ups against the Act and the 2019 Governance Sides formed by the Right wing League had proposed a deficit of 2.4 per cent of the total domestic production (GDP), three times the target of the previous administration.
The announcement took place on Friday in the markets where there was a disruption in the Bonds' sale-off and banking shares.
It also stood firm with the European Commission, which oversees and implements the EU financial regulations.
President Sirisena addressed the Presidential Palace Group, which marked the 70th anniversary of the Constitution, noted that the founding law of the State needed a balanced budget and continuity of debt.

Thereafter, the Parliament can re-pass it in a irreversible manner and it needs to be incorporated in the Act.
Tsunami sensors in Indonesia have left huge waves: official officials
Indonesia's Geophysics Agency warned Tsunami after 34 minutes that hundreds of people lost their lives after the Great Earthquake in the north-eastern coast of Sulawesi Island and more than thousands of homeless.
The ruins of the car that took place in Tsunami in Palu, Indonesia on September 27, 2018.
Earthquakes and tsunamis of 7.5 killed 384 people in Pulu town and coastal areas, 1,500 kilometers (40 miles) from Jakarta.
Officials said that the death toll is likely to increase.
On Friday, thousands of people gathered at Palu for the festival at the beach, while the high waves of 6 metres (18 feet), which resulted in many deaths.
The Geophysics Agency (BMKG) had to face criticism on social media, in which many people had raised questions about the tsunami warning very soon.
The agency said that they followed the Standard Operating Procedure and called for an end to the alert based on the data available with the nearest Tidel sensor, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Pollu.
In Pulu, we have no observation data.
That is why we used the data available to us and made a call on the basis of it. In the BMK, the Chief of Earthquakes and Tsunami Centre, Mr. Trione, said.
He said that the nearest recruitment gauge that brings change in the sea level was recorded at a speed of 6-centimeters (2.5 inches) and was not responsible for the nearest movement.
We would certainly have done it if there were tide gauge or proper data in Paulu.
This is something that we need to evaluate for the future, said Trino.
Tsunami, the officials who told that the height of hundreds of kilometers per hour in Pali and nearby areas was not clear whether it was before or after that.
On September 2, 2018, after attending the Tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, residents inspect the bodies of their families.
On the basis of video broadcast on social media, we estimate that the warning was heard officially before the expiry of the warning., Trione said.
The worst hit was on Boxing Day in 2004, while the 7.5 earthquake hit the heavy tsunami that killed 1,26,000 people, including 1,26,000 people in Indonesia, along the Indian Ocean.
The charming town of Pulu is situated at the mouth of the narrow bay in the north-eastern Sulawesi and is home to about 380,000 people.
It was administered by Tsunami in 1992 and 1968, according to Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB).
Baptiste Gomert, a geotologist from Oxford University, said that the creation of the tsunami caused by the earthquake was astonishing.
The earthquake on Friday was recorded as a strike-slip event where neighboring tectonic plates cling to each other, which usually produces tsunami.
He said that there is a hindrance in the landslides under the sea that caused a lot of water to migrate to the coast and caused a tsunami. He added that the narrow Gulf could be the focus of the storm on the coast.
Sutopo Purva Nugroo, a disaster agency spokesman, told the journalists that their team is preparing to send alerts when the tsunami warning has suddenly ended.
Ministry of Communications Text message has been sent to the residents repeatedly but Nagroho has said that the earthquake had disrupted power and communication lines and there was no siren on the seashore.
To warn the tsunami and failure to publish information in a timely manner, the Indonesians took the people to the social media.
How ill...the warning had been raised... if so, the hearing came... a Twitter user janogancy told BMKG in a direct message.

Francesco Molineer and Tommy Flytwood won their forum on Saturday to become the first European couple and on the last day of the radar cup, Europe has moved from 10-6 to one more history.
After chasing Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeu from 5 and 4, he became the first European to win all his four matches.
In 1997, only Larry Nelson and Lenin vaccine were won for the first time for Americans.
Majors of mighty victory - 3 1, 5 4, 4 3 and 5 4 - Only half of the story is said to be.
His dust was on the right side and the 14-year-old chief winner had to lose three times, in which the Patrick Reid had to sit on the other side twice.

Fleatwood has claimed the highest number of points in a radar cup by European Rocky.
Through the newly acquired army of fans, Mollywood, in the first glance, seemed likely to be leading the European charge in the joint.
There is no expectation of such an exhibition from a first-time rider like Floyd when either of the six matches that Mollyna had failed to win, and the four had lost.
However, the more positive view was that Flightwood was at European No. 1 last year, knowing French Open Win in 2019 about the Lee Golf National course, and this year's U.S.
Mollyna is a fresher British open champion and is widely regarded as the most relevant ball striker at European tour - a symptom that has paid heavy dividends on the narrow path of finding rafts, as most Americans do, is a source of disaster.
The genealogy, known as a great on-course chemistry, proved to be indispensable.
We feel a little emotional and we are only on Saturdays, said the famous Flutewood, who has shown the entire second game with a large smile on his face.
We were really performing well this afternoon, really dense and well played.
Its very special to have a history together.
I am just happy that we have done our work for the team.
Molini was as happy as well.
Playing with Tommy was amazing, he said.
But we had done one thing not to enter the record book, but to fight hard for those 4-1/2 points which will be essential for our tomorrow's victory, it will not be easy.

Francesco Molina made her proud because Europe had a Kamback in the influential style at the radar camp on Sunday, which defeated Italian Phil Michaelson after taking the necessary points to reach the magic telegraph 14.5.
Michaelson was the first European to win all five matches in a week, not one of the six in the past, with the burner on the green colour, and the water took the hole after firing its T shot.
As Italian, when Henic Stansen and Sergei Guercia were asleep and guaranteed at least half of their play, Europe was already assured of victory in the first place in which Europe needed one at that point.
They needed to secure four and a half points out of the 12 points available to win back the trophy and the thrust on the home land from the date of 1973 onwards.

The German Copes used the name Neo-Nazi as the codeword while protecting Erdogan on a trip to Berlin - RT World News
A pair of police officers from East Germany, said the local media that used the name of a notorious militant Neo-Nazi to work during the operation to protect Turkish President Erdogan, who was on a visit to Berlin this week.
Criminal Police elite Anti-Terrorism Unit in the Eastern German state sex is interrogating two members of the SEK, according to the regional internal ministry.
During his expected visit to Germany, the men were kept in custody for the protection of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Since the officers were required to work under-covers, protocols were required to be followed.
He was selected as one of the well-known members of the National Socialist Underground (NSU), a Neo-Nazi extremist group who killed eight Turkish immigrants, one Greek and German police officer in the decade of 2000.
The strange code came out when both of them signed for access to the internal documents issued in the local media report.
The in-charge officers responded quickly, and the police officers were immediately called.
Sex criminal Patrick Clin, head of police, was the first to respond to the news.
He said that the use of the name of Bohnhardt was, in a sense of humor, and added that the neglect of the victims and their relatives was a grave matter of concern.
Mr. Roland Waller, the interior minister of sex, responded by saying these words were hateful, horrible and totally unacceptable.
There has been considerable controversy in Germany during the visit of Erdogan to Berlin on Friday.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has criticized the change of hosting a leader who has become more authoritarian.
Merkel said that the visit is very important because individual meetings are essential to address distances.
For the first time in 2011, the NSU was brought out, while the dead bodies of Bohnhardt and its associate Uwee Mandlos were found inside the mortal remains of East Germany.
A failed bank in this city is believed to have lost its life after the robbery.
The third and the last Northern member of the Neo-Nazi Group, Beat Escape, was detained shortly after.
In July this year, the German Court convicted him of 10 murders and sentenced him to death.
She refused to be a part of the killing, but her lawyer said that she was ethically guilty of failing to stop her murder.
The conspiracy around the NSU has led to widespread criticism of German security agencies.
Lawyers, workers and relatives of the victims believe that there were many more partners in the group.
It has also come out that Germany's local intelligence agency BMV had placed innumerable information providers in the NSU and formally made a check-up, mining effort, and team looters ineffective and impossible.
A resignation from the post of Chairman, Textiles Authority will pay a fine of 20 million on settlement with the SEC.
The Alon mask has been resolved with US Securities and Exchange Commission, which has claimed to be penalized on the tweets of privatization of Textiles.
The mask will have to be resigned as chairman, but will continue to be in the position of CEO.
As per the settlement filing, the mask has 45 days to be reduced from the post of Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Textiles and is prohibited from holding the post for a period of three years.
It will also have to pay a fine of 20 million.

Textiles have to pay more than 20 million more to resolve the claims that have failed to provide the initial Twitter handle for the mask.
On SECs complaint, investors were misconstrued by the tweet August 2020, stating that they had created a fund to take Textiles to 420 per piece which increased the companys share by more than 10.
Maske immediately refutes the fact that he would keep Tessla private and highlighted the fury of the investors.
The SEC condemned the initial words of the mask, saying it was wrong and unfair because there was no basis for it.
Musk himself claims that he was an honest mistake, writing in a blog post that he was under the impression that he had secured money in a meeting with the Saudi Arabian Supreme Wealth Fund representative.
Mask and SEC found to be close to the grip of lesser punishment, which had banned the formation of a chairman for two years on masks and would not have to accept any crime, but Musca withdrew support on Thursday.
Thereafter, on Friday, Tessla was divided, re-looked into her mind and accepted tough conditions.
However, like the old deal, there is no need to accept the crimes committed by the investors who are misappropriation of new ones.

Alexander Van der Bellen, Federal President of the Republic of Austria.The leaders of Alexandria are one of the most prestigious footprints in Orthodoxy.
I have come here to tell you: Stay with conviction and a clinical church, said Patrick Theodore II in his address.

The two sides also asked the Ukrainian Church not to dispute on the issue of giving autonomy.
Theodore-II promised that we will always be with those who love the orthodox unity.
The Orthodox Church was recently confronted with a major crisis in the wake of the Konstantinopal Petrochemicals recognition of the independence of the Ukrainian Roudhat Church.
The latter is a constitutional part of the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow Pretect.
Konstantinol has decided to send its extracts to the Kiwi which effectively violates the rule of law, in which an orthodox church is prohibited from interfering in the internal affairs of the other church.
Exercise Vada has special representations, which are technically superior in the Church hierarchy, compared to Metropolitan onfray, which is the current head of the Ukrainian Rudhichust Church of Moscow Patriarch.
Moscow responded by reacting to the act of Precipitate Konstantinol, which was led or co-chaired by the representatives of the Konstantinol and co-chaired the joint work of Church Services and Membership in each structure.
However, the decision was called as a warning to the more counter measures for the Konstinol and does not completely stop the inter-disciplinary relationship.

Key points of U.N. speech of Mr.
At the UN, the Russian Foreign Prime Minister Sergey Laurove attacked the political blackmail and the armed forces of West, saying that the diplomacy should not lead to Presidents and unilateral restrictions.
The foreign Prime Minister told the UN General Assembly on Friday that as global leaders, efforts are being made to maintain a self-sufficiency, some of the western powers have no hesitation in putting pressure on others.
He did not name the countries, but said that he used political blackmail, economic pressure and force.
The world will have to pay a higher price for these Swarna ambitions by the small groups of countries.
Lavrov, who was Russia's Ambassador to the UN for a decade, told the meeting that the political culture and dialogue have been replaced by radicalization and one-party approvals without UN approval.
Stating that such restrictions, which extend beyond dozens of countries, are illegal or non-functional, the Minister referred to the decades-old disruption of the US-led Cuba.
Lavave said, But history does not teach us anything, and added that based on some of the most possible things, it is enough to blame anyone in the West.
We remember that these unjust claims were used to support infiltration and to stimulate wars, such as the 19th Yugoslavia bomb blast, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 outbreak in Libya.
The list of attacks under the leadership of the West was not widespread in view of the fact that the seven-year-old Syrian war is one of the recent examples.
In Damascus, a failed attempt to eliminate governance, which was carried out in collaboration with the insurgents, would have devastated the country and paved the way for terrorism.
Lavrov appreciated Astanas joint launch by Russia, Turkey and Iran which helped prevent Islamic states (IS, pre-ISIS) and other groups from claiming to Syria.
Now reconstruction of war-torn country and helping the refugees return to their homes in a safe manner is a major priority.
Returning to the Great Power Competition, Lavave said that the UN actually came out of the lessons learned from the World War.
The Russian Foreign Minister noted that in 2018, 1938 marks the 80th anniversary of the signing of the Shame-Municipal Agreement, where France and Britain agreed to allow the Nazi merger of Czechoslovakia's German component in the race to make Hitler happy.
However, British Chief Minister Naval Chamberlain had claimed that the meaning of the Munich Agreement was "peace for our time". A year later, the war started.
Lavave, President of the United States of America, said, "Music conviction shows how far away national pride and the neglect of international law can go.
Colonial-age dictatorship and force must be thrown down or thrown into the dustbin of history.
As per the level playing field, Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can address any challenges arising on global issues.
If you have any questions or claims, then sit and talk, tell the facts, listen to the parties in front of you, try to balance your interests.
Eyes dust?
What we know about Israel's vague nucleus is according to Bibi's Iran direction - RT World News.
During the UN General Assembly (UNGA) speech, the head of Israel was determined that Tehran holds secret nuclear sites.
Just as Israel plays the game of dosharan, let's see why they have their own radioactivity in Paikana.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brought out a new publication, depicting the aerial photographs of Iran's sites, including the so-called nuclear material.
It did not take time to respond to Tehran and said that it was better to pay attention to its own non-existent nuclear weapons program.
When Israel has never accepted - in particular, it is not denied to have military nuclear equipment, the intent of the RT thinks that it is not really the right country to sew its fingers on others.

While resigning from the SNP, Mr. Salmond, the court is taking action against the Scottish Government for processing the complaint against him.
The Scottish Government emphasized that no complaints were filed before January, claiming that the complaints were first examined in 2013.
The Scottish Government had received two complaints in January regarding the Alex Salmond.
It cannot be neglected or invisible under the carpet.

We will talk to the court.
Our aim is to establish that the Scottish Government's grievance redressal process is illegal.
Glasgow 2-13 Dragons: Li Jones is double for Warriors.
With the victory of Bonus Point in front of the dragons on Glasgow Scottston, Ginis returned on the path of victory in 1947, because coach Dave Rennie expressed satisfaction, but he felt that his party could be more clinical.
After a surprising blow from the Southern Kings of Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Reni had ordered a response to a number of changing teams, and when maximum points were properly taken to the top of the conference A, it was far from the effect that it was an impossibility to participate in the heavy wind and rainfall activity.
I thought our rescue was excellent today night, we played from the right edges of the field and our setup was great, said Rani.
We would have seen some more clinically, there were more opportunities to be there.
He used to be a parasitic.
We are happy that we have created many opportunities.
We want to be more clinical but by saying that if we had placed 40 or 50 points on the board tonight, it would not be good for us.
We had to work on it.
Win from Bonus Point but we need to perform better in the coming weeks on zebra, on the side-lines of Agra and on the good governance in Europe.
In a windy condition, Glasgow initially showed scaring but the TMO took an instant note-on from Hugh Jones because he collected the inner side of Niko Matwal and moved to the right corner.
The desperation did not last long because the 4th minute looped prop came down from the Oli cable and the Adam Hastings painted for a smooth transition.
Drag was reduced to lead with the panel of aeroplane robotics and made a stand-off mark after a 20-minute mark to bring Welsh inside a point.
Before South Africa's Referee Start-Berry gave a panel to Welsh on 22nd floor for Offside Tails at Home Stand-Own Hastings, the Glasgow Forwards continuously established the Dragons Line and before that there was a very easy opening gap around the Half-Ober Mark.
The warriors selected the sequences, but they handed over most of the liquid routes to the front, while the right wing Matwal was unable to control the words after a few five-attacks, and the Swiping Passing Passing Out was dropped.
When the Hastings blocked the Dragons Line, the second tri-color came two minutes after the interval and then it sent Lee Jones with a clever pass, leading to its speed.
Hastings showed its Kamback against the post to make its conversion 12-6 at the time of half-time.
Glasgow also showed the best possible start in the first minute of the second half, as Leon Jones easily grabbed the occupant of Alex Dnbar by adding the Hastings Extra.
However, after a gap of 4 minutes, when the Warriors were taken over in the Midfield, the dragons center were followed by the Adm Waren by the flight heck, who used to go to the post to score under the post, Josh Lewis, who had earlier replaced the brakes with Robson.
The Warriors were quick to conquer power and the Bonus Point Fourth attempt in 54 minutes was made because Hugh Jones had landed on the right side, and the Hastings had been shortened for conversion the third time out of four attempts.
The Glasgow remained comfortable and the fifth attempt was made in a few minutes as the Dunbar Sub Screw, George Horne were going to cover the cross and the wrestling boots were completed.
The cable was given the Man of the Match, but Rennie appreciated the hostings.
The coach said that he did not want to let us play and we were flying in the middle.
He probably needed to keep a few meters deep, but he was very sliding and was able to find some space behind it.
It has a good combination of form and self-confidence in the veins.

Morton was elevated to the level of the first attempt of 35 minutes, while Charlie Taylor grabbed Robby Croweford from his box and sent it to the rear of Air Caper Rose Doon and to the sharpest corner.
While Gary Oliver was pushed to Duhan, Grenoc Side provided a great opportunity to take a 4-minute lead in a 4-minute lead in the second half, but the panel of Michael Tideser was torn to pieces and it was easily picked up by a paper.
The air had moved forward the second time in 4 minutes, when the cross of Substitute Craig Mackafe was lifted up in the air and when he fell on the ground, he studied the house.
Within a minute, Mr. Moore returned the speech for Shankland and the strikers turned his 19 mouth for the season.
As the tourists started running, More left the box to fourth place and McDed pulled it home to complete the snoring.
