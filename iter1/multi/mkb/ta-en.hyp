Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
In particular, it is not that only some Indian community participate in it
Now, many state governments and citizens and social movements are celebrating Deepawali with full zeal and enthusiasm.
It can also be said that India is creating a country in a way.
Friends, Festival tourism in the world becomes an attraction.
There is a lot of potential for festive tourism.
Whatever our efforts should be, whatever the festival of Holi, Deepawali, Om, Pongal, Pihu, we should devote them.
There are various kinds of organisations in every state and every part of our country, in which people from other countries take more country.
Therefore, the participation of Indians living abroad is very important in enhancing the festive tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided in the voice of previous Mann Ki Baat that we will do something different on this Deepavali.
On this Deepawali, we all had to celebrate the women's strength and achievements of India, that is, we have also said that we will respect the Indian mothers and sisters.
In a few days, stories of innumerable inspiring social media have started swinginging.
In a letter called Namo Af, a millionaire Ramesh ji said that his mother is his power.
In the year 1990, my father accepted the gold that my mother had maintained five children.
Today we are sitting in good work for five brothers.
Ramesh ji, my best wishes to your mother.
After that, Keetika Swamy, who is very angry at the Twitzer, has said that she is the maternal uncle of India.
As far as Kavita Tiwari is concerned, if the Mrs of India are his daughter, he gives him power.
The mother is very proud that her daughter is very close to the painting.
He has received good values in the legal entrance election of CLAT.
People are sharing similar information.
In this context, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Indian maternal grandsons for this occasion.
We find that he had built the foundation stone of it in the 17th century.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November this year, the 550th birthday of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated across the globe.
The impact of Guru Nanak Dev ji is spread not only in India but in the whole world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters are living in many countries of the world, who are completely dedicated to their higher objectives.
I have never forgotten that I went to Venkuwar and Gurudwaras in Tehran.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji has to share a lot of things about them, but many parts of Mann Ki Baat will be fully required.
Nanak Dev ji considered the service as one of the most.
Guru Nanak Dev ji believed that self-reliance and service is invaluable.
He strongly voiced and acted against social evils such as Dindama.
The news of Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji spread all over the world.
One of those who traveled a lot during his time.
Whenever he goes to several places, he will win the hearts of everyone through his simplicity and work.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had visited several important occasions, which are known as Udasi.
He took the message of goodwill and equality from north to south, from east to west, from all directions, from all over the country, from the people of all walks of life, from the sovereignty to the pious.
It is believed that Shankar Dev, a well-known pilgrim from Assam, had also been inspired by him.
He made a pilgrimage to the land of Harithwar.
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji had stayed in Gurudwara, a pilgrimage of Kashi.
He has also visited pilgrimages like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has travelled to Sri Lanka in the south.
Guru Nanak Dev ji solved the water constraints accumulated there while traveling to Peter in Karnataka.
It reminds us that there is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bihar, which was dedicated to him.
During a period, Guru Nanak ji visited the north, Kashmir and its neighbouring areas.
This led to a strong link between the Sikhs and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev ji went to Tibet and the people from there accepted him as a Guru.
He is also bowing down in the country of Uzbekistan.
As part of his pilgrimage, he has gone to a large number of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He took place in the minds of millions of people, who followed his teachings with full swing and followed him even today.
Just a few days back, the government ambassadors from around 85 countries went to the state of Amritsar from Delhi.
There they visited the Golden Temple and all this happened on the 550th birthday of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
This is the day Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji, the iron man of the country, was born, he was the gurudhari who connected the country to the rest of the country.
Sardar Patel had a wonderful talent to coordinate the people, while he had the power to make compliance with those who had differences.
He's really supposed to see Man of Detyl, hungry.
Besides, he is also expert in organisational activities.
The art of creating projects and designing methods was his handled.
When we learn about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's work, we know how strong his plan was.
Thousands of delegates from across the country were coming to attend the Congress conference in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the arrangements of the conference were imposed on Sardar Vallabhbhai.
He used this opportunity to improve the water network of the city.
He asserted that nobody should get water constraints.
He interacted with the farmers and requested them to make kidnappers.
At the same time, a substantial increase in cash sales was also confirmed.
Our country will be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constitution.
He worked immensely to determine basic rights, due to which there is no place for any upheaval on the basis of caste and time.
Friends, as the first interior minister of the country, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji succeeded in incorporating the synthesis of the synthesis of the synthesis of the synthesis of the synthesis of the synthesis.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, we only talk about his contribution to some specific parts of the country's integration.
As Sardar Patel received the news, he did not delay a minute, but immediately took a serious action.
As soon as he was ordered to flutter and see, it was soiled in the evil intention of the enemy to seize the Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked brothers and sisters to ensure that all the assistance required for the development of Lakshadweep is provided.
Today, Lakshadweep is playing an important role in the progress of India.
This is an attractive picnic spot .
I am confident that you all will visit its beautiful islands and seashores.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, the statue of unity was dedicated to the nation and to the world in the memory of Sardar Saheb.
This is the world's largest image.
This is a two-page statue that is higher than the statue of freedom goddess in the US.
Every Indian is proud of the world's tallest statue.
Every Indian's head is proud.
I am happy that in the same year, more than 26 lakh tourists have come to see the statue of unity.
Thus, 8500 people have visited the glory of unity every day.
It is known that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji has faith and dedication in the hearts of these people.
Now there are several attractive centres like Sapadikkal Gardens, Bamboo Gardens, Forests, Child Nutrition Parks, Unity Nurseries, which have resulted in the development of the economy of the region and provide new opportunities for employment to the people.
Friends, This unity statue can be an exploration for all the states and tourism sectors for the country.
Within a year, we all are witnesses to how a place can become a world famous tourist destination.
There are people from our country and from abroad.
Many such organizations are developing one after another, transport, automobiles, guides and environment friendly organizations.
I also request you to leave your priceless time and visit the unity statue.
But at the same time, I reiterate my request to every Indian travelling to visit at least 15 places in India.
Friends, you know that since 2014, we are celebrating the 31st October of the country's unity day.
On this day, we have the message of saving the country's unity, integrity and security.
On 31st October, like every year, a course of unity is being organized.
In this, all sections of the society and all sections of the society will get their seats.
Similarly, this movement is being implemented not only for the sake of physical, but for the inner and friends, for the unity of India and for touching new peaks.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel had linked the country with the help of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a magnificence in our lives, in a diverse country like India, we should continue to contribute to this mantra of unity at every stage, every stage and every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very positive and waking up to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we surround us, many examples of those engaged in sustainable work to promote mutual goodwill will be seen.
But sometimes, the effort of the society, its contribution, disappears rapidly from the memorial.
Friends, I am happy to note that in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court has given its verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi.
But after the decision on Ramzanam Bhumi, the then government, political parties, social organisations, society, representatives of all times, the sovereigns and priests expressed very quiet and medieval views.
This is an attempt to reduce the pressure in the environment.
Those days, those moments remind us of our gratitude.
This is an example of solidarity and solidarity.
125 crore Indians are also gods who experience the benefits.
But a pleasant experience is also an interesting experience.
I heard why I thought I shouldn't share with you.
Just imagine... the world's tallest battlefield, where the temperature is 50-60 degrees below the prize.
Life in the air is only in some name.
In such a opposite situation, living among such challenges is not less than any enormous act.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders, but also conducting a clean Siachen movement.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for this marvellous obligation of the Indian Army.
It is difficult to die anything in the extreme winter there.
In such a situation, it is a very important task to share the pockets and organize them.
There is such an environment here that it lives in the life of rare animals like ice and rare animals like iPex and brown bears here.
My dear countrymen, there is no time to create a new awareness in the lives of all of us.
Moreover, on Deepawali, something new is happening in every family, especially in buying something new from the market.
I had once said that we should try to buy only local items.
What is the need to go regionally if we get the necessary thing in our village
What is the need to go to the district level if one thing is available in regional terms
Whatever we are trying to buy locally, Gandhi will automatically grow into a great opportunity.
I reiterate my request to buy something or the other in the clothes weared by the hands of our neighbours and the producers of our carriage.
Deepawali congratulates us and urges us to become people who want to buy more local goods.
Through this, we should show how importantly we can contribute towards fulfilling the dreams of Gandhiji.
Once again, I express my heartfelt gratitude to you for this Deepavali Trinity.
On the day of Deepavali, we burn many types of buffaloes.
But sometimes it burns because of our deficit.
It's getting wounded.
Therefore, I urge you to save yourselves while celebrating the festivals.
My best wishes to Deepawali.
Thank you very much.
Our soldiers are always ready to express their happiness and express their support.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated the valour of Parakarm Parv.
We remembered the precise attack in 2016, and our soldiers reacted strongly to the hijacking war against our country.
In order to inform the citizens of the country, especially the youth of the country, our soldiers had organized museums at different places in the country.
See how talented and how our soldiers defend our country by paying their lives.
One day like Parakram Parva reminds the youth of the rich heritage of our soldiers.
And inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jeothpur, Rajasthan, Veer Bhumi.
Now it has been decided that our soldiers will respond strongly to those who are trying to contribute towards the peace and development environment of our country.
India has always given its commitment to establish peace and dedication.
In both the world wars of the 20th century, more than one lakh soldiers sacrificed their great sacrifice for peace and even in those wars we have no connection.
This is also a magnificent act that our soldiers have understood in the direction of peace.
Our brave soldiers have been wearing blue helmets for years and have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world.
My dear countrymen, the things of heaven will always be different.
In this way, it is not surprising that Indian Air Force has expressed their power in heaven and attracted the attention of every Indian.
They have given us a security feeling.
On the occasion of the Independence Day, one of the people's expectations is Air Saaks, with great aspirations and aspirations of the rally, in which our Air Force will showcase their energy along with the encouraging activities.
We celebrate the Air Force Day on 8th October.
In the year 1932, our Air Force, which started a small start with 6 aircrafts and 19 aircrafts, today has been ranked among the most powerful aircrafts of the 21st century.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the Air Force personnel and their families who provide their services to the nation.
In 1947, when Pakistanis attacked in an unprotected manner, our air force decided to save Sri City from the attackers and landed the arms and war grounds of Indian soldiers at the right time.
The Air Force responded strongly to the opponents in 1965.
Who will be unaware of the 1971 Bangladesh Freedom Struggle
In the Tiger Hill area, the opponents brightened all the places where they brightened overnight and scorched them soil.
The country is thankful to the Air Force for the responsibilities and rescue operations, the arrangements for disasters and the messenger activities of our Air Force.
Their feelings are amazing to tackle all the disasters from the storm, heat, flood to the jungles and help the people of the country.
The Air Force has taken a pledge to create a gender equality in the country and has opened the doors of every department for women.
Now I have made an announcement from the Red Fort on 15th August this year that women will be able to join the air force and get a sustainable work with short-term work.
Great Bong can tell us that not only the male power, but also the participation of the women's power is growing in the same manner.
Women are powerful, but now they are becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, in the past, one of our navy officials faced the struggle called Abhilash Tommy and Life Sava.
The whole country was concerned about how to save Tommy.
You know that Abilash Tommy is a very brave officer.
As an individual, he is the first Indian to travel through a small boat without any modern technology help.
For the past 80 days, he was moving forward in the southern part of the Indian Ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race, without decreasing his speed in the sea.
He was a marvellous example of Sahasam, Emotionality and Excellency. Just a few days back, when Abilass was brought out of the sea, I spoke to him by telephone.
I've already met Tommy.
I pray for the special health of Abhilas Tommy, his passion, his valour, his morale, his fighting power, will surely inspire our youth.
My dear countrymen, every child of the country knows what is important for our country on 2nd October.
There is another significance on 2nd October this year.
After this, we have been organising several events across the globe on the 150th birthday of Gandhi Ji for the next year.
Gandhiji's remarks have inspired the whole world.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk to you about a more important act of humility.
In 1941, Gandhians started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
He then prepared a collective copy of those ideas when the freedom struggle was intensified in 1945.
The countrymen expressed their views on many issues such as defence, cleanliness, spread of education, and the rights of farmers, villages and workers.
This is also called Gandhi Charter.
Everyone has experienced it in his characteristic form.
He expressed his feeling that everybody is very important and unnecessary for the country.
His biggest contribution to the freedom struggle is the transformation of this into a mass struggle.
In the freedom struggle, all the sections of the society and all sections of the society moved forward and moved ahead.
If the brothers say, 'I give you a safeguard, whenever you feel obvious, whenever you are in yourselves, keep yourselves up with this scale - look at the person who is more poor and weak, remember his face, listen to your heart, listen to what you are going to do, then listen to your mind that what will benefit the man.
This will brighten his life and future
My dear countrymen, this safeguard of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the growing middle class people in the country, their growing economic power, their purchasing power...
If we go to buy something then can we remember one hour's uncle
Can you remember that husband's salvation
Whose face is joyful
If you buy it, it will be good for someone directly or indirectly
If this benefits the poor of the poor then my happiness is doubled.
Keep in mind this mantra of Gandhi Ji, when we all buy something, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of Gandhiji, when we buy every thing, it should be good for our countrymen, especially those who have thought of their sweat to create it, those who have invested their money, those who have sown their capabilities and those who have sown their capabilities.
He might have been unaware of how to do this, but this happened, India got freedom.
Similarly, today, we can see how this small task can contribute to the economic development and economic power of my country and how the poor can get the power to fight against poverty.
But today, I believe that this is the true patriot, this will be the guarantee we can give to the brothers.
He said that all these doors are greasy and every one of them should be used.
And it came to pass, that, behold, there was a snare in the land, and a small idol in the midst of every navel of the household.
We are going to celebrate Shastri Ji's birthday with a humble brother.
His anger is the symbol of his close personality, Jai Jawan Jai Kisan.
As a result of his selfless commitment to the country, he was able to give the mantra to achieve success for the soldiers and farmers of the country in a short span of about one and a half years.
Millions of people joined the movement and I got an opportunity to serve with the children of Ambethkar School, Delhi.
He founded the foundation stone for that school, is the precious Baba Saheb.
All kinds of people from all over the country participated in this service on 15th.
The organisations also played their role with great enthusiasm.
School children, college students, national students, national workers, national health workers, youth organizations, media groups and corporates, all of whom have served in a large numbers.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all those people who want to be clean for their contribution.
Come on, let's hear a phone call.
But if you didn't tell me how it was an enrichment after the defecations, you might have been able to get the attention of the people associated with this movement.
I express my gratitude to you in a special way.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful story not only in our country but in the world.
This time India is organising the world's largest cleaning venue in an unprecedented manner.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention), Health Ministers and experts from all over the world together share their experiences and experiences on cleanliness.
The concluding ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Cleanliness Celebrations will be held on 2nd October this year at the inauguration of the 150th Birth Anniversary.
In the Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar, there are several indicators to defend the basic rights of the poor.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on 12th October, 1993, with inspiration from the perspective.
The Commission is scheduled to be completed within 25 years.
The Commission is not only protecting human rights, but also enhancing human dignity.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the closest leader to our hearts, said that human rights are not a unique principle for us.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, the principle that has come from the legend has been engraved, 'Sarve Bavat Sukin:'
The Commission has created widespread awareness on human rights and has also played a pivotal role in preventing its misuse.
This 25-year journey has created a hopeful and reliable environment for the people of the country.
This provides a healthy society with a reliable activity for special democratic values.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions are operating along with the work of human rights at the national level.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and follow it in practice.
My dear countrymen, in the month of October, Jai Prakash Narayan ji and Rajmata Vijayraje Scindia ji are beginning the centenary of their birth.
All these dignitaries have been inspired by us and we will remember them.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar ji, I will speak in detail in the voice of the next Mann Ki Baat, but why do I want to mention him today, for a few years, Sardar ji's birthday on 31st October is being organised in every small town, region and villages of India.
This year we have to make efforts to organize this course of unity in our villages, regions, cities and cities.
It is the course of unity that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is the best way to think about them because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge all of you to strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society and every member of the country through a wave of unity on 31st October. This will be the best for him.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, Raksha Bandhan is celebrating the festival across the country.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this sacred day.
Rakshabandhan is pursuing love and belief among brothers and brothers.
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries.
Several special stories connected to the history of the country, including the Raksha Gire, which are associated with the belief of the people of two different parts or periods.
After a few days, Janmashtami is going to come.
Elephants, horses, palanquins, Jai Kanhaiyalal Gi and Govinda-Kovinda are all over the scene.
The joy of Sri Krishna's devotion is different.
In many parts of the country, especially in the state of Maharashtra, our youth will continue to prepare for the Teh-Handi.
Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami are grateful to all the people of the country.
Brother Chinmai thank you for presenting a special thing.
Friends, Apart from Rakshabandhan, we celebrate the Sanskrit Day on the day of Siravana Purnima.
I extend my best wishes to all those who dedicate themselves to the people of Meruguti and others in bringing this great fame to the common people.
There is a significance for every language.
India has the pride of being the most ancient language in the world.
Similarly, since the legend, till date, Indians are proud of the fact that the cultural language has played a very important role in spreading knowledge.
In every field of life, the genius of wisdom lies in the cultural language and its literature.
Be it science, technology, agriculture, well-being, skies, architecture, mathematics, management, economic or environment.
You all will be happy to note that the people of Matur village of Shimoga district of Karnataka are still using the language of prosecution.
There are possibilities of creating innumerable words of the sufficient and society, including the compositions of 20000 earlier, i.e. Prefix, 22 initiatives.
Therefore, any smooth feeling or thing can be described in accurate manner.
We always remember Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.
We celebrate his birthday as a teacher day all over the country.
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the coming Teachers Day.
At the same time, I congratulate the spirit of dedication to the teachers in science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, this season has brought our farmers to the expectations of hard work.
In some places, there has been more rains than other places.
We all saw how bad people suffered due to Kerala's terrible floods.
Though we cannot fulfil their sadness, it is my belief that 125 crore Indians are standing shoulder to shoulder with you in this hour of sorrow.
My prayer is that those injured in this natural calamity should get quick relief.
Everyone decides how to reduce the numbers of people in Kerala and how to share their grief.
We know that the soldiers were the heroes of the rescue work in Kerala.
They have left no attempt to save the sick people in the flood.
Air Force, Navy, Air Force, Border Security Force, Central Industries, Defence Force and Expedition, all have played a major role in the movement.
In particular, during this period, I want to mention the hard work of the National Disaster Management Force (NDRF).
Yesterday the Om Festival was celebrated, we all want to give strength to the country, especially to Kerala, and to come up with the impact of this disaster, and to make the development journey of Kerala faster.
Once again, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and all those affected by disasters across the country that it is your neighbourhood when the whole country is complicated.
My dear countrymen
This time I was watching the suggestions made for the voice of mind.
I had to see what the people of the country have written more about. It is the beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Kaziaabad's Kirti, Switzer Vatsa from Soniba, Kerala's brother Praveen, Dr.
MyGov has also been in the process of talking about the diversity of Atal ji's life, the Prime Minister said that Swapna Banerjee and Akhilesh Pandey from Bihar's Kadihar.
On August 16, the country and the world were saddened by Atal ji's timely news.
14 years ago, he broke the post of Prime Minister.
In a way, he has been away from acute politics for the past decade.
He didn't get the news, but he ran away from public life.
The country and the world saw that there was no gap in the minds of the common Indians after the 16th August, even though the new year was a great gap.
Atal enhanced the love, grief and sorrow for them in the country, which demonstrates their immense personality.
Over the past few days, Atal jis most important dimensions have emerged in front of the nation.
People recall him as the best parliamentarian, understanding writer, best speaker and people remember him as the Prime Minister of the heart.
Atal will always be grateful to him for bringing good governance to the mainstream.
But today I want to tell you about a more dimension of Atal ji's broad governance, to touch it, and the political culture that Atal ji has given to India, the efforts to transform it and the drive to formally build it will be very beneficial for India.
It's sure.
India will always be grateful for the 91st Constitution in 2003.
This transformation led to two important changes in the politics of India.
First, the number of state ministers should be only 15 percent of the total number of members of the Legislative Assembly.
Secondly, according to the law against the party, he increased the amount of one third of the previous members and made two-thirds of the members.
At the same time, clear regulations have been made to ensure the membership of the party.
For decades, the political culture of building large-scale cabinets in India has come up and these big ministries have been designed to maintain political leaders, not to share their work.
Atal ji changed this situation.
Because of his activity, money and expenditure were saved.
There was also improvement in performance.
This is possible only by a prophet like Atal ji, and the healthy heritage in our political culture began to survive.
Atal ji is a real patriot.
During his post, the finance statement was changed while surrendering.
Earlier, according to the British method, the financial statement was submitted at 5:00 in the evening.
In 2001, Atal ji turned the time to submit the financial statement from 5 am to 11:00 in the morning.
Similarly, today, you are witnessing discussions about the conduct of elections at the same time for the central government and the state governments in the country.
When we commit ourselves to fulfill his dream of a sufficient and developing India, I dedicate to Atal to him the Shirtanjalis on behalf of all of us.
When the talk of the parliament arises, it is spoken about suppression, shouting and absurdity, but if something is good, it doesn't speak much.
Just a few days back, the Parliament's Rainfall session was over.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 percent and the productivity of the states was 74 percent.
All the parliamentarians tried to make the monsoon session more profitable, resulting in the passage of 21 bills in the Lok Sabha and 14 bills in the Rajya Sabha.
This rainy season of both the Houses will always be remembered for social justice and youth welfare.
Several important laws have been passed in this session for the youth and the backward classes.
This move will help in achieving the purpose of social justice.
The Amendment Bill was also passed to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will further defend the interests of the underprivileged and tribal communities.
Moreover, there is hope in the hearts of the humiliated, which prevents the iniquities of the guilty.
No civil society can bear the injustice to women's power.
The country is not ready to bear the sinners engaged in sexual abuse
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and has been promptly punished.
A court in Mandsore, Madhya Pradesh, you might have read a few days ago, after hearing the case and punishing two accused who have been imprisoned for sexually assaulting the girl.
Earlier, a court in Katney, Madhya Pradesh, completed the investigation in just five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have quickly delivered the rulings in such cases.
The Act will enhance the prevention of crimes committed against women and girls.
We can transform the lives of the poor, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the underprivileged and the underprivileged when we proceed towards nationhood.
This time, in the Rainfall session, they jointly created a special initiative.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
Today, the attention of hundreds of millions of people is also coming from the Asian Games in Jordan.
Every day, it is the first time in public news papers, televisions, news and social networks that any Indian soldier has won the tension.
Asian Sports Competitions are going on now.
I would like to congratulate all the sportspersons who have won medals for the country.
I extend my best wishes to the sportspersons who are participating in the competition.
India's sportspersons, especially in the shooting competition and the fighting competition, have achieved great achievements, but our sportspersons are receiving medals even in the unprecedented sectors such as Wushu competition and boat competition.
These are not mere meditations - proofs of the hopes and dreams of Indian sports and sportspersons...
Our women are also among the growing numbers of tensions for the country, which is a very positive sign.
Anyway, the young sportspersons won the medals will include our youth under the age group of 15-16.
My best wishes to all on National Sports Day.
We all have seen buildings and houses with bricks, but about 1200 years ago, you can imagine that a large hill, a large hill, a large rocked single hill, has been decorated in a very excellent, broad and magnificent temple.
India has been a land engineering testing ground.
Many engineers have emerged in India, they have achieved unimaginable things and have given miracles in the engineering world.
Today lakhs of farmers and the common people are benefiting from the Krishnaraj Sagar Dam built on the banks of the river Kaveri.
He has been bowing down in these parts of the country and the country also gives him respect in deliberate manner.
In his memory, we are following the Engineers Day on September 15.
The engineers of our country have put a different seal on the path shown by him.
When we talk about the miracles of the engineering world, a tragedy reminds us of the occurrence of a terrible earthquake in Katch in Gujarat in 2001.
When I was working as a selfish friend, I got the opportunity to go to a village and I had to meet a grandmother who had a hundred years old.
He was calling me, looking at my house and calling it a park in Katch.
He added, 'This house has seen 3 earthquakes.
I have met three earthquakes.
I understand them at the same house.
But there is no harm anywhere.
Several centuries ago, how the engineers of that period constructed buildings according to regional environments, so that the people could live safely.
Today, when we follow the engineers day, we have to think for the future.
The world is suffering from natural calamities.
We will meet in the voice of the heart, we will speak openly, we will move the country through our hearts, we will be united.
With this feeling, my best wishes to all of you.
Thank you.
We'll meet again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
My dear countrymen, greetings.
Despite the vastness and diversity of India, sometimes the rains also show their sympathy.
But why should we reduce the rain
As a result, sometimes nature expresses its anger.
Therefore, we have to be nature-loving, protecting nature and protecting nature should be our responsibility, only then will it become a deterioration in the corpses of nature.
A few days ago, the natural calamity that took place attracted the attention of the entire world and swollen human society.
It takes usually a few hours to enter the cave and come out.
But on that day the game of law was different.
After they went far inside the cave, the water was stagnant in the entrance of the cave because of the sudden malfunction.
They closed the way out.
And they stayed on a small rock within the cave, not two days, but for 18 days.
Just imagine how the youngsters have to spend every moment when they die in front of the eyes
On the one hand, they were immersed in large numbers, on the other hand, the entire humanity was gathering and expressing the humanity of God.
People from all over the world were praying to bring these children out safely.
The parents will not feel sorry or the tears will not grow in their eyes.
With such a difficult situation, it was surprising all over the globe to see that the children were not suppressing their faith while expressing so much courage and heart in a blind cave full of water.
This incident reflects that when human society stands together, there are miracles.
But we need to keep the target as peaceful and stable and work indifferent for it.
Just a few days ago, our country's beloved poet Neeraj ji had left us all.
He has a special significance - trust, self-confidence and regret.
July-August is the most important month for farmers and all youngsters.
Because these months they are at the peak season of colleges.
Thousands of young people like Sathyam come out of school and join colleges.
In the month of February-March, the examinations, the newspapers and the answer papers are impatient in the month of April-May, and decides which work should be done to determine the direction for the results to travel in life.
In July, the youth's cavity goes away from questions and goes to cut-off prices, which is the most important period.
Students' attention goes away from home and goes to school.
Students get away from their parents and join them under the hunting of professors.
I am confident that my young friends will be very excited about starting college life.
For the first time, when you leave the house and leave the village, get out of a safe environment and start moving yourself.
These youngsters have left their homes for the first time and have come out to set a new direction for their lives.
Many students will join their colleges and some will be connected.
Please keep yourself calm, experience your inner feelings in life, there is no doubt that it is necessary to read books, but it is important to keep yourself in search of new things.
There is a special value for old friends.
The young friends are very valuable, while selecting new friends, reading and maintaining friendship is a very intelligent step.
Some new things, some new skills, new languages...
My best wishes to all the youngsters who have started a new lamp.
While talking about college climate, it was reported that Ashram Saudri, a student of a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh, has achieved success by crossing the difficult challenges of life.
He has been elected as the first attempt in the Medical Council of Jodpur AIIMS (AIIMS) hospital.
His father is working as a sanitation worker and maintaining his family.
I extend my best wishes to him for his victory.
Students from any of these poor families have achieved their indecent efforts and endeavours to deal with the worst conditions.
Their achievements give us sympathy that Kushi's father is a driver in the school restaurant, his father is a guardian of Karthik from Haryana, Ramesh Sahu's grandfather of Jharkhand is working in brick swine, the student Rameshe is also selling sports goods in the festival.
Similarly, Anushka Banda, a disabled woman from Kutka, is suffering from a penal muscular atrophy since birth...
These are the achievements that have come back to see the world by following the spirit of regret, who have lost their obstacles in their hearts.
If we look around us, we know many such examples.
Any good thing that takes place in any corner of the country fills the power in my heart and gives inspiration
When I talk about such youths, I am taking care of them, this is the meaning of life.
The poems of Jewellery, and the poems of Jewellery, see, I want to hear the songs of the earth. I want to call them the light and remove the evil of the water from the flowers.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes went on a news and two youngsters realized Modi's dream.
Today, when we read it in detail, it is understanding how our youngsters are trying to transform the lives of the common people by using technology intellectually and constructively.
Once in the city of San Jose, known as the technology centre, I was interacting with Indian youth.
I requested them to take time to think of how they can use their skills for India.
I urge the country to expel knowledge and talent from abroad and how to use it for the country.
Two IT experts from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji accepted my challenge and tried a new initiative.
Using their skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji jointly created the Smart Gaon App and intelligent villages.
This scheme connects the rural people with the world and provides ways to get any information and information in their mobile phones.
Referendum's ancestors, the leader of the Panchayat, the district judge and the district ruler, all were aware of the use of this act.
If you look at this event, we should remember that these youngsters are living in the United States and living there between lifestyle and thoughts, even if they leave India several years ago, they have slightly understood their village, understand challenges and have been emotionally connected with their village.
Because of this, we have been able to understand the requirements of the village well and work accordingly.
The thirst to achieve something for their motherland is natural in every Indian with their village and roots.
But sometimes this feeling is slightly deteriorated because of the compulsions, televisions and climates of the time, in which some slight defamation is dragging them towards the days that have passed.
Bandarpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days before the audience, Varkari i.e. pilgrims are walking along with their teeth for a sacred journey to Bandarpur.
This journey is called Vari, in which lakhs of devotees participate.
Gyaneshwar Swamis and Dukkaram Swamis are walking towards Bandarpur, singing the songs of the greats, singing, singing, singing and music.
Tirthankaras come there to visit Vitoba or Pandurangan.
Vallabh Bhagwan defends the interests of the poor, the deniers and the victims.
The devotees from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are filled with satisfaction and devotion.
Going to VITOPA temple in Bandarpur, its glory, beauty and spiritual joy are all a unique experience.
I would like to appeal to the leaders of Mann Ki Baat that once you get the opportunity, you can enjoy the Bandarpur Vari.
Gyaneshwar Swamis, Namdev, Eknath, Ramadoss Swamis and Tukaram Swamis are still guiding the common people of Maharashtra.
The tradition of these greats is encouraging every corner of India.
We have great messages about the importance of poetry, harmony, compassion and brotherhood.
In our country, the great tradition of the great saints who sacrificed their lives in the feet of God, as well as the great men who dedicated themselves to the feet of Mother India, they visited her.
Such a great man is Lokmanya Tilak, who has put an end to the hearts of many Indians.
While we celebrate Tilak's birthday on 23rd July, we celebrate his memorial on August 1.
The LOC is full of compassion and self-confidence.
The power and intellectuality of the British rulers were filled with the direct impression of the mistakes.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was very attracted by Lohmanya Tilak.
When Lakmanya Tilak disappeared on August 1, 1920, Patel made sure that he had a memorial.
When Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected the Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, he immediately chose Victoria Garden, known as the British ueen, to mark the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak.
At the same time, the British saw the act, so the ruler refused to allow it.
The most interesting thing is that while addressing the inaugural function, Gandhians said that after the post of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got a good man, but also a blind man, due to which the statue of Tilak has been installed.
My dear countrymen, the significance of this marvellous statue is that this marvellous statue is one of the most unparalleled, in which he is seen sitting in the chair, which is engraved in it as my birthplace.
I am shared with you only about the years of the British.
Because of the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak, there is a tradition of celebrating the Ganesh festival of socialism.
Our ancient heritage and our brave heroes of history can be understood from this even today.
Today, we can see the bands that worship the goddess in almost all streets of many cities.
I would like to make a detailed campaign for the environmental dear Ganesha Festival in every city and to be honoured with special competitions, including MyGov and MyGov and the Narendra Modi App.
I will definitely take your comments to the people.
Every Indian has to go to good governance and good governance.
This will create a New India.
On the same day, that is, on 23rd July, the second son of Mother India was born.
He dedicated his life to the people of the country to breathe free air.
I am telling you about Chandrasekhar Azad Ji.
Any youngster of India will be inspired by these words: "The revolt thirst lies in our hearts, we will see the power of the opponents, and these poems are conceptual to many young people like Ashfakullah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azad's drama, freedom struggle and his morale encouraged many youths.
Azad ji paid his life, but he did not bow down to the other regime.
I had a great deal to visit Chandrasekhar Azad's village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I extend my heartfelt condolences to these two great sons of Mother India-Lokmanya Tilak and Chandrashekhar Azad.
A few days back, Hima Das, India's Veerangan and the farmer's daughter, won the gold medal at the 400-meter drive in the World Travel Championships held in Finland.
Ekta Bayan, another woman in the country, has written my letter through email from Indonesia, now she is ready for Asian Games.
"I am very proud that once a very important moment in the life of the hero, it is to hold the flag on the world stage, I have done it," he added.
Ekta, we're all proud of you.
You are proud of the nation.
Ektan Gold and Bronze medals won the World Class Grand Prix 2018 for Tunisia.
His achievement is that he has transformed the word 'Development' into a means of success.
Because of the road accident in 2003, Ekta Bayan's under-scale organs were unskilled, but he did not lose his chest, strengthened himself and took a number of targets.
And a transformative competitor, Yogesh Kadunia, won the gold medal in Grand Fire and Gold medal in Berlin, and also won the gold medal in the swinging competition with Sunder Singh Kurjar.
I salute Ekta Bayan ji, Yogesh Kadunia ji and Sunder Singh ji for their self-confidence and inadequate thirst.
You have to move ahead, and play, enjoy.
My dear countrymen, in August, there are several incidents and trends of history, but due to the climate, sometimes the diseases also fall in their homes.
My best wishes to all of you for your special health and for this month of August, and for many celebrations that have been guided for centuries.
Once again, we must meet Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days back, a historic cricket match took place in Bangalore.
You all know that I am referring to the test competition between India and Afghanistan.
It is a matter of great pride for every Indian that this is the first international test match to participate in Afghanistan and the historic test match of Afghanistan has taken place with India.
The President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, also described me as a tag and said that the people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to our Indian friends for creating a base that our sportspersons have demonstrated their capabilities.
Rashid is a representative of the important aspects of Afghanistan.
This lamp will be unforgettable for all.
That is the first lamb, though it is memorable, for another reason, I consider it as a special one.
The Indian team has demonstrated an exhibit all over the world.
We can understand the character of sportspersons from this event.
This shows that sports is an excellent way to connect the world and bring out the skills and capabilities of our youth.
My best wishes to both the Indian-Afghan teams.
In the future, I am confident that we will play with each other in a similar manner and we will be able to grow.
My dear countrymen, when we celebrate the fourth International Yoga Day on 21st June, the entire world was associated with it.
I am told that for the first time in Saudi Arabia, the historic event of Yoga was held in which women performed a large number of seats.
In the highest peaks of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China participated together in Yoga.
Some soldiers also learned yoga in the watershed ship
Similarly, some soldiers were studying yoga at the snow-laden peaks of Siachen.
Our soldiers of the Air Force, in the midst of which they made yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the Earth, cast everyone into confusion.
It is worth mentioning that they didn't do it as they sat on the plane and did it as they floated in the sky.
Yoga has been trained everywhere in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and sports grounds.
A scene of Ahmedabad touched the heart.
At the same time, about 750 handicapped brothers and sisters gathered together and joined hands with Yoga and became worldwide.
We have been living for centuries with the feeling that the wealthy family and the world have lived for centuries.
Moreover, people will make it a part of their lives.
We recall the doctors when they are suffering
But on this day when we celebrate the services, dedication and achievements of doctors, I congratulate them.
Our doctors have put their stamps on the whole world because of their capabilities.
While doctors are skilled and hardworking in the medical industry, our doctors are well-known in addressing complex medical problems.
India is an enriched historical country that is not a day or month without a historical event.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Makhar on 28th.
You know why Kabir Dasar went to Makhar.
Prince Kabir Dasar stressed on social unity, peace and brotherhood through his poems called Chakis and Dohas.
This was his goal.
This goal is to be seen in his works and it is equally conceptual in today's world.
Besides, listen to one of his dohas - Kabir Soi Peer Hai, Jo Jane Peer, Jo Bharat Peer Na Janahee, Soca Peerman Peer.
Kabirdasar gave special stress on social well-being.
What he says in another Doha
And there is sin where there is greed and pride.
He added that the people of the country are Bhucho Sadhu Gi and Bhuch Leejee Gyan.
Do not ask the saints what their caste is, and seek wisdom from them.
He has requested the people to accept and respect people with their wisdom and respect for the time being.
His comments have been culminating in many centuries, even today.
Guru Nanak Dev ji says that the service made to the poor and needy is the vigour of God.
Wherever he goes, there are many throats for social well-being.
All castes, all sections and all the ways can come and eat, Guru Nanak Dev ji introducing the cooking system of Lungar.
Guru Nanak Dev jis 550th birth anniversary will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to participate in it with enthusiasm and zeal.
The Indian Freedom War was very long, widened, deep and many sacrifices.
There is another history associated with Punjab.
The Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 2019 will take over 100 years, which is likely to embarrass human society.
My dear countrymen, Raman Kumar ji from Rohini, Delhi and Dr.
Raman ji, first I express my gratitude to you.
I am glad to see the interests of you in India.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji is a timely day i. e.
In 1937, Dr.
It is also known that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji had spoken in Bengal in the graveyard of the University of Calcutta in the name of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji's invitation.
It is notable that this was the first time the British had spoken in Bengal during the swearing-in ceremony at Kolkata University.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji was the first industrial minister of India and even more than that he laid the foundation stone for Indias industrial development and founded a strong foundation stone was not surprising.
His views and perspectives were displayed in the first industrial policy of independent India, which was released in 1948.
Dr..
Mukherjees dream is to make India self-sufficient and self-reliant in every sector.
While enhancing Indias big business, he wanted to pay full attention to mid-term and small industries, handicrafts, trade and cattle industries.
During the period from 1948 to 1950, he constructed all the Indian handicrafts officers, all India Artisans, Artisans and Rural Industries Boards to provide financial and organised base for the overall development of small and medium enterprises.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee is his contribution.
He was desperate about the development of West Bengal.
As a result of his understanding, intellectuality and creative activism, a large part of Bengal was saved and part of India.
In the last few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government initiatives.
There was an opportunity to learn from them directly about the changes in life, beyond the anger.
When an ordinary man knew... his simple words, his experience, his event, his mind, showed up.
Women from remote villages are providing services from pension to passport to senior citizens living in villages through Public Health Centre.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister is collecting the seetha palm and selling the ice cream.
Like Arjun Prakash from Jharkhand, millions of young people of the country are walking on medicines and going to the villages nearby and providing affordable medicines.
Children from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa have been working on important issues such as waste management at the Tingring Lab in their youth.
Throughout this programme, I heard more about the success of the common people than the success of the government, the power of the country, the power of dreams of a New India and the power of a New India.
On the contrary, there are some individuals in the society - unless they speak of despair, unknowingly, unless they inspire unconfidence, unless they seek the path of integrity, they are silent.
While talking about the events that took place in their lives with simple people, new expectations and new enthusiasm in this environment, I did not consider it as a success for the government.
The story of a small girl from a remote village becomes inspired by 125 crore people.
I am grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people connected this video bridge through the programme and you have done the job of providing me a new energy.
Once again I would like to thank you all.
If we have seen around us, then I always know that something good will definitely be seen in our eyes.
There are people who understand good.
We can smell the smell of good.
In the past, one thing has attracted my attention, which is a very terrible link.
On the one hand, there are industrialists and engineers, while on the other hand, there are agricultural brothers and sisters associated with agriculture.
Farmers linked themselves with it, implemented schemes and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Through this survey, experts and engineers trained the farmers to learn new methods of agriculture and how to do natural farming, how to plant one thousand other crops in the fields.
Today they are not only doing vegetables, but also selling vegetables through this grains and selling them at a good price.
I am glad that in another way, these youths associated with the world of industrialists, engineers and technicians have left their circles and have connected them with the farmers and have made their way to work together with the fields and crops.
Friends
Your young man is actually conceptualizing any young man.
The other youths of the country will definitely go to their Internet and take care of their work and they will also be inspired about how to work in different fields of the society.
It is a dream for all the people of the country that a country is one tax.
If anyone has to appreciate the implementation of the same tax revision system, then I would like to congratulate the states only as I am.
So far, 27 GST meetings have been held, a number of political considerations are sitting in it, participants from different states and participants with different priorities
Before the implementation, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country, but now this system is changed to only one tax.
The success of the GST currency is a series of currency operations.
After coming, the checkpoints have come to an end, the freight traffic is going on at a fast pace, so that the time is reduced and there is considerable profit in the goods service sector.
The world's largest tax reform.
Generally, such a big reform, such a big country, when such a large population, it takes 5 to 7 years to complete it.
This is the greatest victory and 125 crore people have won this victory.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Come on.
With the voice of Mann Ki Baat, you have got the opportunity to meet you once again.
I am confident that a team of 6 female commanders from the Indian ship has taken a sea journey for several months.
They traveled in different oceans and many seas and crossed a distance of about 22,000 marines.
This journey has taken place for the first time in the world.
Last Wednesday, the girl got the opportunity to meet the gems and ask them about their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate them for their special activity of enhancing the pride and pride of the navy and the importance of the country, especially the women of India who have not killed anyone in the world.
Nobody knows the spirit of adventure.
For centuries, the Everest Summit has been a challenge to human society, and the rebels have also faced this challenge.
On May 16, a group of 5 tribal students from a Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, including Manisha Duruve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Kathmode and Vikas Soyam, have climbed the world's highest peak.
These students of Ashram School started their training in August 2017 and trained at Warta, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Le and Ladakh.
These youths were elected as the training programme of the Shurya movement
In accordance with the name, they established the country's pride in the Everest Summit.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Chandrapur School and my young friends.
Accordingly, the 16-year-old Shiwangi Pathak, the youngest Indian woman from Nepal to the Everest Summit.
Many congratulations to Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj ji and his daughter Diya will be the first father and daughter of India to touch the Everest Summit.
There is no youth who climbs the Everest summit.
On May 19, more than 50 years of age, Sangeetha Fahl ji climbed the Everest Summit.
Some of the climbers on the Everest Summit show that they have ability and feelings.
In the past, the Swachh Ganga Abhiyan, according to the Swachh Ganga Mission, a group of Border Police personnel climbed the Everest Summit, but when they were descending, they brought together the unified petals.
This is a matter of appreciation, while this work showcases their efforts towards the environment for cleanliness.
For years, people have climbed the Everest Summit, many of whom have won.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all these courageous soldiers, especially women.
My dear countrymen, especially my younger brothers and sisters, when I spoke about Fit India two months ago, I did not even think that there would be such a response.
It was not even seen that all sections of the population would support it.
When I talk about Fit India, I acknowledge that as much as we are engaged in sports, the country will also be involved in sports.
In the social media, people are sharing the findings related to fitness challenges, each of them tackle and challenge each other.
Everyone is coming together today with this movement called Fit India.
Be it a film industry or a sportsperson, be it a common man of the country, be it a soldier or a school teacher, if we are fit in all directions then India will be determined anywhere.
I believe that the challenges like this help us keep ourselves fit and encourage others to make fitness.
Savi Yadav ji, thank you for your phone call.
It is true that the games played on the streets are part of every child's life, which are coming closer today.
In particular, these sports can be said to be a special part of summer holidays.
During the graduation, after dinner, without worrying about anything, for hours children will play.
In some of these games, the entire family was playing and participating.
Several games like Kittip Bull, Pambaram, Goli, Ice Boy, Tridan Police, Kannamozhi, Ko-Ko, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Katch to Kamrupam were part of this game.
Yes, they might have been called by different names at different places.
For example, in a part of 7 stons, this game is known as Lahori, Pittu, Sadolia, Dikori, Saddiya.
We can see unity in these games after the diversity of our country.
One sports is known in different places, in different names.
I am from Gujarat and I am aware of a game called Somal-Isdo.
It is played in a 8  8 square square plate with a limestone or a donkey.
This was played in almost all the states.
It is called Saukapara in Karnataka and Attu in Madhya Pradesh, which is called Bagigali in Kerala, Sambal in Maharashtra, Yam in Tamil Nadu, Sangam in Rajasthan.
I don't know how to speak in every state language, but after playing it, I realized that we have played it too.
Are there any of us who don't play kitchens, don't we
It is known by different names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra, it is called Kotibilla or Karrabilla, it is Kuliphadi in Odisha and it is called Vithitalu in Maharashtra.
When everybody winds up, when everybody plays, we can express the unique characteristics of ours.
You can see that many children are dumb, but when they play, they become very active.
They reveal themselves, they appear deep, and the children that are hidden within them are displayed.
How to achieve the goal, how to create the spirit of the committee, how to create a mutually beneficial partnership.
In the training programmes related to trade management, I can see that the entire governance is developing and developing mutual skills and now we are using our traditional sports.
From the children to the elderly, when everyone plays together, the gap is called generations, it disappears.
At the same time, we can understand our culture and heritage.
Many sports create awareness about social and environment.
Animation films can be produced, played on streets and throats, they will also see, play and develop these games that are adverse to our newcomers.
My dear countrymen, on June 5, India has officially organised World Environment Day celebrations.
This time it is a belief that Beat Plastic Polluting has been done.
I appeal to all of you that by understanding the significance of this fact, we will take a decision to prevent the use of Polythene and low-quality plastic, and to reduce the negative impact on plastic waste on nature and on wildlife and our health.
Enter the World Environment Day Internet Wed-India 2018, in which many suggestions have been given in a very interesting manner - see, learn and try to adopt them in your daily life.
When there is heavy heat, when there is flood, when there is no rain, when there is unbearable cold, everybody becomes experts and talks about world warming and environmental change.
Over the past few weeks, we have seen storms and strong winds in many parts of the country, as well as bitter fruits, this is not a natural season.
This has also resulted in death.
All this is the result of the change in the climate change
Our culture and our heritage have not taught us to fight with nature.
We have to live in music with nature and be associated with nature.
Gandhiji used to proceed with this thing throughout his life and at every step.
We will organize a way of maintaining the tree not only in the middle of the tree but also as it grows and grows.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
This is the message of Yoga for unity and a well-being society that the world has experienced for the past few years.
The psychology is produced by Yoga, which always defends us like a father.
As the feelings are born, it is like their mothers in children, mental peace becomes our lasting friend.
Burthuhari said that through continuous Yoga, the mouth becomes our children, our brothers and our brothers, and the earth is our bed and wisdom is our hungry.
If such qualities are one's companions, then the yogi wins on all kinds of fears.
Once again I call upon all the people of the country to go ahead with the tradition of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and well-being country.
Today, 27th May is the memorial of the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
I express my gratitude to Panditji.
He is the Veer Savarkar who is associated with another one in May this year.
Our countrymen expressed their strength against the British during the same May, 1857.
Our soldiers and farmers in many parts of the country have mobilized against injustice and expressed their deeds.
It is tragic that they had long been saying that what happened in 1857 was a riot or a syphilis riot.
Indeed, this is not just an assessment of the event but an attempt to abrogate our self-reliance and self-sacrifice.
Veer Savarkar, who wrote in 1857, was not merely a mess, but without fear of the First Freedom War.
Several freedom fighters in collaboration with Savarkar celebrated their 50th anniversary in India House in London.
An expert in managing both arms and weapons.
We generally congratulate Veer Savarkar for his bravery and his struggle against British imperialism
Besides all this, he has always strengthened the poet, social reformist, goodwill and solidarity with words.
I remember that Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, who is our beloved respect for Savarkar ji.
Besides being a poet of understanding, he was a brave revolutionary.
I express my heartfelt gratitude for the bright future of these women, who have hopes and expectations.
If you are determined to achieve something, then you can win all the moments.
Thinking of the dreams of others, the story of some who dedicate themselves to fulfilling them is the story of the people living in the city of Orissa.
Prakash Rao is theirs.
Today, you will be surprised to know that a simple person selling tea is bringing about educational iniquity in the lives of more than 70 children.
He provides education, health and food to all children coming to school.
I express my heartfelt congratulations to Prakash Rao for his indecent hard work, his endeavour and shining in the lives of poor children and giving them a new direction.
He has removed the darkness in his life.
Nobody knows the scripture of Thomaso Ma Jyotirgamya
But if someone has done it, he will have a D.
His life is an idea of all of us, society and all over the country.
There may be such inspirational events around you.
In a few days, you will also be waiting for his arrival.
I am confident that everybody will celebrate this grand day with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
71 countries of the world including India participated in this.
You can imagine what is the situation when thousands of sportspersons are participating from all over the world.
If there is any such situation, when there is an influx of enthusiasm, expectations, incentives, desires, aspirations and aspirations - can anyone be affected
..India has achieved unprecedented achievements.
Even if it is a matter of pride for the soldiers to slay medals, it is a matter of pride for all the people of the country and the people of the country.
Encouraging and encouraging.
We all meet with one feeling.
I have no words to express this feeling.
But I want to share with you what these sportspersons have told me.
If I am particular, many things have been done for the first time.
This time, all the death fighters participating in the Commonwealth Games have won medals.
Manika Bhadra has put medals in all her sports.
He is the first Indian woman to win a gold medal in the table tennis singer contest.
India got a higher gold shooting competition.
The only Para Power Lifter in India won the medal at Sachin's Saudri Commonwealth.
Moreover, if this time the competitions were special, the majority of the winners were women.
The women played their talents by playing the square, the sword, the sword, the sword, the sword, the sword and the sword.
The final contest of the Bhubaneswar is China Nehwal, two of India's virgins.
V.
It took place between Sindh.
I was asking you to join Fit India and come to the leadership.
I am happy that people have been associated with it with great enthusiasm.
Several people have written letters to give their support for this, distributing important issues related to their sex in the social media and Fit India information.
A person named Sasikanth Bonsle shared the film that he took in the swimming pond and wrote that my body is my weapon, water, my individual, my world is swimming.
Do you know what Ruma Devnath has written
As far as I was concerned, the smile was smiled, and when we were happy, he wrote that the smile should be laughed.
After seeing all this, it is good for many popular people to inspire our youth in a very interesting way for Fit India.
Akshay Kumar has displayed a cinematography at Twitzer.
His other vision has also become more popular, in which he can be seen playing with the people.
Many youngsters are sharing their experiences with the efforts of Fit India.
Not alone, your city, your village, your part, your school, your college, all ages, men and women, make efforts to connect with Yoga.
You are deep in the thought of how to experience the holidays and where to go.
I call you a new work today
I can see many youngsters spend their time to learn something new.
The significance of summer training is increasing and youngsters are also engaged in search of this, and training is a new experience.
Outside the four walls, there is a feeling of living in a new dimension with writings and computations.
My young friends, I urge you to do a special exercise.
Three Ministries of the Government of India - Sports Department or Human Resource Development Department - these three Ministries of the Government have jointly organised Swachh Bharat Summer Exercise 2018.
You can go to MyGov Internet and register yourself for the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I am confident that our youngsters will further take this movement for cleanliness.
Definitely send your information from you, send your photographs and display your sights.
Come on
We will create a chance to learn in this holiday.
Just a few days back, the young people from Delhi were showing one thing about some people in Good News, who are doing the job of teaching poor children.
These youngsters have stepped up a massive campaign to teach the street children of Delhi and the children living in their homes.
They began this innovative act because they were taking pitch on the streets or the condition of children engaged in slight jobs.
The movement, which started with 15 children in the dwelling area near Gita Colony of Delhi, is connecting 2000 children in 12 places in the capital today.
With this movement, youngsters, teachers and workers who are connected with them are spending 2 hours in their daily chart and trying to transform society.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers from the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have become encouraging instruments for farmers across the country.
Because of their integrated efforts, they have not only boosted their position but also the future of their region.
In Pargeshwar, Uttarakhand, especially small grams, palms, maize and parli are being produced.
Being a hilly area, farmers did not get the right price for this
They built a collaborative organisation in Munnar village where they constructed a factory to prepare piscots.
Given the mindset of the farmers, the administration has also linked it with the National Rural Livelihood Movement.
These biscuits are being added not only to about 50 Anganwadi centres of Bhageshwar district but also to Almora and Gausani.
Due to the hard work of the farmers, the income of the organisation has increased by 10 to 15 lakh rupees annually, not only has it provided employment to more than 900 families, but people have also been prevented from coming out of the district.
Everyone talks about it, but we have no obligations
Have we not seen that water conservation is the responsibility of society
This should be the responsibility of every individual.
How can we save every drop of water during the rainy season
Our forefathers have been doing this for centuries.
They have given every drop to the importance of water.
They have discovered new methods and have been aware of how to save every drop of water.
If anyone of you had the opportunity to go to Tamilnadu, you might have noticed that there are large inscriptions related to water conservation, dry season arrangements in some temples there.
There are large inscriptions in Mannarkovi, Cheranma Devi, Mandirpatti and Pududutha.
Even today, various educational wells are known as tourist destinations and we should not forget that these are the examples of our ancestors living in the water conservation movement.
Atal ji in Gujarat and Rani Kyi Waw in Patan have been declared the World Heritage Site of the UN Education, Science and Cultural Organisation.
In the months of April, May, June and July, they get the most important opportunity to save rain water, and the more we are ready for the past, the more benefits are available.
The budget of Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme is spent only for water conservation and water management.
In the last three years, everybody has been making proper efforts for water conservation and water management.
Every year, an average of 32,000 crore has been spent for water conservation and water management for Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Project.
If we talk about 2017-18, about Rs 64,000 crore has been spent, about 55 percent of the total live storage available in these reservoirs, namely, about 35,000 crore rupees have been spent in water conservation and water management.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted through such water conservation and water management.
7000 people working under this scheme have lived hard in the seventeenth day and revived the Kuttamperur river of Kerala.
The Ganges and the Yamuna were flooded with water, but in some parts of Uttar Pradesh, for example, two rivers namely Sasur and Katherie were dried up in Fatepur district.
The district administration has witnessed a large number of land and water conservation activities under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme.
With the help of about 40-45 rural people, the dried Sasur and Katheri rivers were revived.
Wildlife Sanctuary, birds, farmers, peasants, villages, have you seen how many great blessings have been successful
Once again, I urge you all to take some responsibility for the coming months of May, June and July, water conservation and water management.
My dear countrymen, news has come from all around me before the voice of my heart, letters are shouting and calls are coming.
Iron Kumar Banerjee ji, from Devedola village of North 24 Barganas district of West Bengal, has recorded his views on MyGov, though we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year, many have not known the philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore, who has won the Nobel Prize every year.
Please talk about this in Mann Ki Baat programme, so that people can get an opportunity to know about it.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore was a complete form of wisdom and wisdom, and his writings replaced an inaccessible seal in the minds of all the readers.
Rabindranath - Knowledgeable and diverse but we can realize that there was a teacher every moment in him.
He writes in his Keitanjali, "He who has the knowledge of the people has the responsibility to impart it to the students".
I was not aware of the language of Bengal but I had a habit of waking up early in my childhood and radio broadcasting in Eastern India will start fast and start late in western India.
Anandloke, Agunner and Porroshmoney. When there is an opportunity to listen to these poems, there will be great enthusiasm in the mind.
Rabindra Sangeet will also reflect his poems.
My dear countrymen, Ramlan will start in a few days.
Throughout the world, Ramlan is celebrated with full fervor and respect.
The social aspect of Non-Pen is that when a man falls on his bed, he feels the hungry of others, when he is thirsty, he feels the feeling of others' thirst.
This is an opportunity to remember the message of sovereign Mohammed Nabis and the teachings.
It is a lesson that we can learn from his life to travel on the path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a man asked the sovereign, it was very important to know what was done in Israel.
The sovereigns said, "It is good for the poor and needy to eat, we know, even if we don't know them, but it is good for everyone."
Sovereign Mohammed Nabis believed in wisdom and pride.
Sovereign Mohammad Nabi has said that if you have something more than your requirement, give it to the needy person, therefore it has been given more importance to the boil in Ramlan month.
People give donations to the poor in this sacred month.
And sovereign Mohammed Nabis say that no man is rich because of his clean soul, not because of his wealth.
Lord Buddha inspires equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Baba Saheb gave power to millions of people living in the ruins, believing and oppressed by the Constitution.
There is no better example than this.
In the satisfaction of the people, the myth was one of the greatest characteristics of Buddhist Buddhism.
In many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, the tradition of Buddha is mixed with their roots.
This is the reason why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which connects important places of Southeast Asian countries with Indias greatest boost.
Today, there are conflicts and people's distresses in everywhere in the world, the teachings of Buddhist Buddhists pushing the path to abrogate with hatred.
I express my heartfelt congratulations to the Buddhists who have been devoted to the Buddhists across the globe and those who believe in theory and others.
I salute the blessings of the entire world from the Buddhists, through which we can fulfill our responsibility to create a peaceful and proud world based on his teachings.
Some people know that while you have heard about the statues of Laughing Buddha, this laughing Buddha will achieve the privilege, but the smiling Buddha is associated with an important event in India's security balance.
Well, you can think of what is the connection between Buddha and the Indian soldiers.
A new self-confidence has been created by the Indian diaspora across the globe.
That day is a Buddha Purnima.
On May 11, 1998, India conducted nuclear tests in Bokaran, Rajasthan on its west border.
In a way, in the field of science and technology, India has demonstrated its power.
On that day, in the history of India, the essence of the forces of our nation was engraved in gold.
Lord Buddha showed that the power of Andrathma is essential for peace.
Similarly, if we are strong as a country today, we can be peaceful with all of us.
We ridiculed the world that under the strong leadership of the great scientists of India, India is able to achieve new goals and summits every day.
We can see the journey that Atal ji has started and the new joy and new happiness that will move ahead.
My dear countrymen, we can talk about many more things when we can again enter the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is Ram Navami's birthday.
On this sacred day, my best wishes to all the people of the country.
We found every moment of his life how much the power of 'Ram' was in the life of a humble brother.
In the past, on 26th January, when all the leaders of the ASEAN organisation came here, they brought the Kalasarak group along with them
The most important thing is that most of the countries have given the Ramayana before all of us.
That is, Ramayana and Ramayana are still affecting the same inspiration and affection not only in India but in Asian countries in this region of the world.
Once again, I congratulate Ramnavami for his good wishes.
My dear countrymen, this time, like every time, all your letters, emails, telephones and comments have been received in large numbers.
You have heard of the start of the Sanskrit Studies in MyGov-Online.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see their attraction towards culture as well as from the Department of Posts.
I have been telling you about the efforts made by the concerned sector.
I appeal to all those who listen to the voices of the mind and those who are engaged in cultural activities, to suggest how to implement Gomal ji's idea.
Kanshyam Kumar ji from Baragar village of Bihar, Nalanda district (B) had read his writings in the Prime Minister's Office.
You are worried about the fall in the level of ground water, it is certainly an important matter.
You are asking for drinking water for animals and birds in summer.
Shakal ji, I bring your sentiments to all the leaders.
Do you know what Yogesh Bhadresha has said
Our youth are physically weak compared to Asian countries, he added.
Yogesh ji, this time I have thought of detailed discussions with everyone about the health - I talk about the Healthy India (Fit India).
Young people, you can collaborate and implement a healthy India movement.
In the past, the French President had visited Kashi when he had visited our country, and the scenes of the journey were all fascinating and could not create an impact.
Now, let me ask you to link them, re-develop and bring them to your friends.
Anga, Jaisesh and many other children from Chennai have sent me the ideas that appeared in their minds on the gratitude cards found in my book 'Exam Warrior'.
I want to tell Anaka, Jaisesh and all the children that all my fatigue of that day disappeared as the snow that saw everyone after seeing your letters.
If I can read such letters, such phone calls and comments, many things that I can hear are in touch with my heart.
If only I want to tell about them, I'll have to say for months.
This time most of the letters have been written by the children, they have written about the selections.
They are sharing their holiday programs.
They have expressed concern over the water for animals and birds in summer.
The letters have been received from the farmer brothers and sisters regarding the functions of farmers across the country.
Some citizens have got positive suggestions about water conservation.
During the festivals, our festivals, our culture and our traditions are facing things.
That is, the things of mind are changing according to the climate and the truth is that the voice of our minds has changed the climate of life.
Why shouldn't you change
In these matters, in your experiences, in these examples, your thirst reflects that this sympathy, this power, this compassion, that whatever good for the country should be done.
This includes the power to transform the entire country's environment.
When I get the opportunity to read your letters, I know how Ahmed Ali, a Rickshaw driver from the Karimganj district of Assam, has created 9 schools to study poor children with his deep desire.
13 years ago, due to lack of proper treatment, Calcutta's taxi driver Saidul Laskar's sister dies.
He reiterated his commitment to constructing a hospital to ensure that no poor person die due to lack of treatment.
Saidul sold his household jewels to achieve this goal and collected money.
Many travellers who traveled on his taxi paid their money with their hearts.
He gave his first month's salary as an engineer's sister.
In this way, after collecting money and spending 12 years, finally Sayedul Laskar's favorite attempts made profits
Today, due to his hard work, a hospital with 30 beds has been constructed in Puneri village near Kolkata.
Such enormous sympathetic instruments are introducing and identifying my country.
Today, when we raise the name of India with great respect, the unparalleled acts of this immense wealth of Mother India follows.
Today, this belief is born in the minds of everybody in the entire country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class people.
We can move ahead and we can see progress from our country.
There is a self-confidence, positive atmosphere with desires and aspirations.
This self-confidence, this positive feeling, will reflect our dream of a New India and reflect our commitment.
My dear countrymen, it will be very important for the farmers brothers and sisters for months.
That's why many letters have come about agriculture.
This time, when I look at the discussions with farmers on the Kisan Channel for the farmers of Dordarshan, I feel that every farmer should connect himself with the DD Kisan Channel of Dordarshan, see and uses shown there in their fields.
Be it Gandhiji, Lal Bahadur Sastri ji, be it Lohia ji, be it Saudri Saran Singh or be it Saudri Devi Lal, everyone has considered agriculture, agriculture as an important part of the country's economy and the lives of the people.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Sastri ji has also spoken frequently about the importance of trees, plants, vegetation and special agricultural system.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia has said that a large number of people should create awareness amongst our farmers for ensuring greater income, special irrigation facilities and food and milk production.
In his speech in 1979, Chaudhary Saran Singh ji called upon farmers to use new technology and create innovations and strengthen its need.
In the past, I had visited the Festival of Agricultural Development in Delhi.
While addressing the farmers brothers and scientists, I was happy to learn, understand, understand and know about the innovations related to agriculture.
But what has been more influencing in me is Meghalaya and the hard work of the farmers there.
This region, which has less land, has done a great job.
Our farmers from Meghalaya have achieved success in the year 2015-16 compared to the last 5 years.
If the goal is decided, if the motivation is filled with motivation, if the motivation is deep then it can be achieved and achieved.
Today, technology is also handing over to the farmers' hard work, which has resulted in a lot of strength for the farmers.
Brothers and sisters, in this financial year's budget, a big decision has been taken to make farmers cost effective.
Besides, work on agricultural marketing reforms in the country has been going on in order to get the right price for the farmers' produce.
Efforts are being made to connect the rural regional markets, the entire markets and the world market.
The APMC and the e-NAM base will be coordinated while creating a necessary framework for 22,000 rural markets across the country, unnecessary farewell to sell their produce.
In a way, such an organisation is being created to connect with any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year the beginning of the 150th birthday celebrations of the Gandhians.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our commitment, besides this, how can 125 crore countrymen be seen shoulder to shoulder and shoulder to see our best wishes to the Gandhians
Can we organize new programs
Can we create new ways
I appeal to all of you to share your views on this through MyGov.
What could be the sign of 'Kandhi 150'
What can be the anger
Let me write your comments about this.
Today, the health sector has crossed a common approach across the country.
All the works related to health in the country were earlier as the responsibility of the Health Ministry, but now all departments and ministries - whether it is the Ministry of Cleanliness, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs or the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the States - are working together for a healthy India, preventive health and low cost health.
Disease prevention health is very low cost and is also very easy.
Whatever we are aware of immunity health, it will be beneficial for individuals, family and society.
The first need for life to be healthy is cleanliness.
We all have been pledged to be a nation, resulting in double health care in the last four years, almost 80 percent.
Besides, work is being done in detail in the direction of creating health centres throughout the country.
As a disease prevention health care, Yoga has identified itself with a new power throughout the world.
Yoga guarantees both physical and physical.
This is the result of all of us at the end of our end. Today Yoga has become a mass movement and has been divided into every household.
There are more than 100 days left on June 21, the coming International Day of Yoga.
In the last 3 international Yoga Days, people participated in the country and all over the world with great enthusiasm.
This time we will also ensure that we are inspiring everyone like Yoga, family and friends.
It has to be made more popular to all the elderly and senior citizens, who have given up new interesting methods, children, youth and senior citizens.
Moreover, television and electronics from across the country are giving various programmes related to Yoga throughout the year.
But from now to the day of Yoga - can we create awareness about Yoga as a movement
My dear countrymen, I am not a yogist.
But some people have turned me into a Yoga professor through their instruments, and I have created three-wheelers like Yoga.
Widespread efforts are being made to ensure that healthcare is accessible to all, to be cheap and easier for the goods.
Today more than 3000 public health centres have been opened across the country and more than 800 medicines are available at affordable prices.
Moreover, new centres are being opened.
I would like to appeal to the people of Mann Ki Baat - that you should bring information about these people's medicine centres to the needy.
This will be the biggest service you will do to them.
The rate of heart stent for heart patients has been reduced to 85 percent.
The cost of sterilisation has also been reduced to 50 to 70 percent.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Suktaar Yojana, about 10 crore families, that is, about 50 crore citizens are being treated and 5 lakh rupees will be spent for the family in a year.
The number of medical facilities in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
New AIIMS hospitals are being opened in many states to provide special treatment and healthcare to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened between every three districts.
By 2025, the target of securing the country from tuberculosis has been decided.
Today, the campaign for Make in India is being successfully implemented in the country.
On that day, Dr. Ambedkar ji dreamed of India as an industrialist and his perspective inspires us all today.
Today, India is emerging as a bright hub in the world economy and the highest FDI in the world is coming to India.
India is moving around the world as a centre for investment, innovation and development.
Baba Saheb had a firm faith in self-reliance.
He doesn't want any man to spend his time in poverty.
And he doesn't think that if something is shared with the poor, their poorness will be averted.
Today, Mudra Yojana, Start-Up India, Stand-Up India Territories, innovators, entrepreneurs and youth from our younger societies have been created.
Today, historic efforts are being made on the waterways and ports of the country.
New ports are being built on different coasts of India and infrastructure is being strengthened in the old ports.
Most of the 40 discussions were surrounding the 2nd World War, the emerging ice war and the partition of the country.
During that period, Dr. Ambedkar laid the foundation stone of Team India on one side.
He spoke of the importance of the federalism and strengthened the central and state governments to work together for the progress of the country.
Today, we have accepted the mantra of Competitive Federalism - Competitive Federalism - Competitive Federalism in all aspects of governance.
The most important thing is that Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is an ideal for millions of people like me from the backward classes.
He has shown us that there is no need to be born in a big family or a Simon family to move forward, and the dreams born in poor families in India can be seen, the dreams can be fulfilled and the success can be achieved.
But the painting of New India is completely different.
I'm asking you that you have to participate in this movement with enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, many festivals are going to be held in the next few days, like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Anuman Jayanti, Easter and Pisachi.
It is a day to remember Lord Mahavir's Jayanti, his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavir, which we have called Ahimsa, will give us sympathy.
My best wishes to all the people of the country.
Esther's instructions will always be reminiscent of his inspiring instructions when he talks about Esther, and the message of humanity is that of peace, well-being, justice, compassion and curse.
Baisakhi Festival is celebrated in Punjab and West India in April
On the same day, Jude Sheetal (Sathuwain) in Bihar is celebrated with joy and joy in the festival of Satvain, Phihu in Assam and Pizza in West Bengal.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you for the coming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat Feb 2018
From today's beginning, I start calling Mann Ki Baat with a phone call.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions about science, some have written letters.
Though the color of the sea is blue, we all know that there is no color for water due to our daily experience.
Have we ever wondered why you look like a river, a sea
The same question was raised in the mind of a young man in 1920s.
This question created a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about modern science, Bharat Ratna Sar C.
The name of Satyendranath Bose was given to the famous microscopes, which is known as Boson.
A few days back, the event was attended by the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Mumbai.
It is very interesting to know about the miracles in the science sector.
This artificial intelligence provides for creation of ropeways, pa (B) bands and specific action machines.
Today, the machines are doing their sensitivity through the instruments.
This technology can make the lives of the poor and the poor more special.
In this programme on Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientists to think about how this artificial intelligence can be helpful to make the lives of the disabled brothers and sisters easier.
Can you know more about the occurrence of natural disasters through artificial intelligence
Can we help in the field of farmers
Can this artificial intelligence facilitate access to health care and help in detection of diseases through modern methods
Just a few days back, I had accompanied the Prime Minister of Israel to inaugurate the I Create Project in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There was a young, digital device manufactured
If those who are unable to speak through this instrument, then the instrument turns it into a monkey, and does it as one interacts with each other.
I believe that in such a way we can use artificial intelligence.
Science and Technology are a medium value.
There is no self-respect for this.
Any machine will work as we like.
Thomas Alva Edison, who had discovered Light Bulback, had failed in many of his tests.
Once asked about this, he said, "I have discovered ten thousand methods of how to create a lead bulb."
That is, Edison has turned his defeat into his power.
Today, I am in Auroville, the birthplace of Mauritius Aravind, not only an accident but also a great deal to me.
As a revolutionary, he became a challenge to British imperialism, fought against them, raised many questions against the regime.
As a great Rishi, he questioned every aspect of life.
He also discovered their answers and guided the human society.
Knowing the truth, the feeling of raising questions again and again is important.
This is also the true concept behind the search of scientists.
Why don't you want to live until you know how to answer questions.
I congratulate all our scientists and scientists on the National Science Day.
RabindraModi App has written about Occupational Safety i. e.
Defence standards in our country are not equally important in industrial and construction workplaces.
Since the National Security Day on the 4th of March, the Prime Minister has to talk about security in his mind so that people are aware of security.
While we talk about the safety of the people, two things are very important - one to be cautious and the other to be ready.
Defence is of two types, one is important during disasters and the other is important in daily life.
If we are not aware of the safety in our daily life, if we are not safe then it is difficult to achieve this situation in times of disaster.
These words don't usually benefit in our lives.
In the wake of natural disasters, most of the places are consequently due to some of our wrongdoings.
If we wake up, if we follow the necessary rules, we can save our lives and save our society from bigger places.
Sometimes we might have seen that several words have been written on security in our workplaces, but we have seen that they are not followed.
I urge all the municipalities and municipalities to train them once a week or once a month in schools.
There are several natural disasters in this country and the disasters created by the human beings related to chemical and factory that we have experienced.
Today, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) is heading the country's Disaster Management.
Voluntary Volunteers have been trained in flood-productive and wound-prone districts and are also given the name of dangerous.
Till 2-3 years ago, thousands of people were succumbing to the heat wave.
Subsequently, the National Disaster Management Agency organised a campaign to protect people from the heat wave and to create awareness among the people.
Everyone's contribution had a good effect.
The number of deaths occurring due to heat wave attacks decreased by nearly 220 in 2017 as compared to expected.
This indicates that if we give preference to security, we can be safe.
We have to turn into a social warner against the danger.
We have carried out several flights and provide security related references at the beginning of the Air Services Travel.
Well, was there a way to give the information
Similarly, we have experience in every field of life.
My dear countrymen, in this financial statement this time, under the Swachh Bharat scheme, wealth from waste to energy generation has been emphasized in villages through natural gas.
The initiatives taken for this have been named as GOBAR-Dhan-Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources i. e.
The programme aims at cleaning the villages, cattle cattle cattle, cultivation of fields, cultivation of slums and natural gas, and creating wealth and energy.
Some European countries and China use cattle food and livestock for energy generation
But India is not fully functioning in this sector.
Under the rural scheme of Swachh Bharat Mission, we are now progressing in this direction.
It has been decided to promote natural energy generation through cattle cattle, peasants and cooking cattle.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, brothers and sisters in rural India should be encouraged and they should see food and waste as a wealthy instrument.
There will be opportunities for new jobs such as waste collection, transport and natural gas sales.
An online business base will be set up to improve the implementation of the Cobber-Dhan scheme, which will connect farmers with the buyers and create the right price for the farmers' cropping.
My dear countrymen, till date we have heard about some kind of festivals such as music festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
But a unique attempt was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, where the first Kuppa Festival of the state was organized.
Raipur was encouraged and other districts also celebrated Kuppa Festivals for their participation.
Everyone shared innovative ideas related to cleanliness in their respective ways, discussed and organized poets.
There was a climate like a festival, focusing on cleanliness.
Especially schoolchildren participated in this with great enthusiasm, which is a marvellous thing.
I extend my best wishes to the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the government administration for the commemoration of the Festival in a very nutritious manner of waste management and the importance of cleanliness.
Every year we celebrate International Womens Day on 8th March.
Several events are being organised in our country and all over the world.
In the past, women who have performed models in different fields will be honored with the Nari Shakti Award this day.
Today, the country is moving towards womens progress towards women-led progress.
In this context, I remember Swami Vivekananda's sworn words.
Today, it is our responsibility to ensure that womens participation in every sector of social and economic situation is equal.
Today, our women are showing strength and self-confidence in their actions.
Where women are powerful and partners in all the developments of the country, it is our dream of a New India.
In just 20 days since 26th January this year, these women have constructed one lakh and seventy thousand toilets and have made an advance, including about one lakh women groups.
In the lives of the common people, women from Jharkhand have shown that they have the power to transform it into the nature of the people by strengthening the cleanliness movement and the culture.
Brothers and sisters, I was watching the news two days ago, when I was watching the news about how much satisfaction they were about when we got electricity after 70 years of our independence in three villages of Elephanta Islands.
I am surprising that despite being such a special tourist destination, it has not been able to get electricity there for so many years since its independence even near Mumbai.
For 70 years, three villages of Elphenda Island - Rajpandar, Morbandar and Senthbandar - had left darkness from the lives of those who were blind in the dark.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
Tell me, the lives of the people of the country will be illuminated, the happiness in their lives will grow, and there will be other times to give happiness and happiness.
Brothers and sisters, Just a few days back, we celebrated Shivaratri Festival.
It is in March that the green-green fields, the beauty of the stagnant crops and the charming magnets of the heart - are the special features that spark themselves this month.
At the same time, this month's Holip Place is close to our hearts.
On 2nd March, the Holi festival will be celebrated with great enthusiasm throughout the country.
Whatever significance is there in the Holi Festival, Holika has the same significance as it is this day that we drown all the evils in the neighbourhood.
This Holi Festival is a great occasion to forget all the differences of opinion and participate in each others happiness and to promote unity and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, Prakash Tripadhi ji has written a long letter in the Narendra Modi App and I am very urging you to talk about all the things that exist in it.
On the 1st of February, Kalpana Chawla ji visited the space.
Although they are not with us today due to the danger of the Colombia Space Department, they have been inspiring the youth around the world.
In this way, I express my gratitude to Prakash for his introduction of his letter to Kalpana Chawla Ji on his cease-fire.
It is a matter of great grief for all of us that Kalpana Chawla has lost her in such a small age, but she has left the message that there is no limit for women power in the whole world, especially for thousands of women of India.
It is heartening to note that today women in India are proceeding very fast in every sector and the country's pride is being maintained.
Since ancient times, the respect for women in our country, the contribution of women in the society and their contributions have been stunned by the whole world.
This speaks in detail about the importance of women in our society.
This has given the status of power to women in our society
It has always inspired us to know that the wisdom, devotion, devotion, the ruling system of Ahilyabai Holkar, the valour of ueen Laxmibai, the pride of the country has been enjoyed.
Prakash Tripathi ji has given several more examples.
Our Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has conveyed his views that the warrior Sukoi had flew to the sky in 30, and that a group of women from the Indian Navy headed by Vartika Joshi has travelled around the world at the INSV TARINI Gall.
Povana Ghat, Mohan Singh and Avani Chaturvedi, three protracted women have become warriors and are conducting the training of Sukoi 30.
You're absolutely right to say.
Today, women are moving forward in all sectors and not only are they headed by leadership.
Today, for the first time in many sectors, women and women achieved achieving a milestone.
In the past, the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, held a new summit.
Our President met a group of unparalleled women who had achieved the first in their respective fields.
These women recorders of the country, the first female captain of the ships, the first female driver of the passenger train, the first female bus driver, the first female bus driver, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to touch Everest summit, have achieved extraordinary achievements in every sector.
With the help of hard work, endeavor and responsibilities, they have proved that they can cross all barriers and places and create a new path.
On this path, they are not only in their times but also inspiring generations.
They have filled a new enthusiasm and a new inspiration.
A book has also been written about the women who have come to the forefront of these women and women who have come to the forefront of inspiration through their lives.
This book is now available in the Narendra Modi App in the form of e-book.
Today, in the positive changes in the country and society, the importance of women's power is playing an important role.
Today, when we are talking about women's empowerment, I want to mention a railway station.
You can imagine what can be the connection between a railway station and women's empowerment.
Women are all working at Madunga Railway Station in Mumbai.
This time, after watching the Republic Festival, many people in Divers and other social networks are particularly important about the bag-drive section of the Border Police Force and all the women involved in the group are women.
They understood the positive acts, and the exhibition surprised the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today, our women-power is heading.
Self-sacrifice shape.
I am aware that the surprising work done by our tribal women of Chhattisgarh has been done by them and they have given a new example.
While talking about tribal women, there is a decisive vision in everyones minds and there are forests, pathways, including women who lose their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have created a new sight in front of our country.
The Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh is a part of the Maoist extremists.
The Maoists have created a horrific atmosphere here as violence, repression, bombing, guns and gardens.
In such a horrific situation, tribal women are becoming self-sufficient and self-sufficient by running the batteries.
Besides, environmental protection is also strengthened.
I congratulate the government administration here and they have played a very important role in the success of these women until they have been trained.
Abstain from necessity, changes in the requirements.
For centuries, continuous efforts have been made individually and socially against social destructions and destructions in the country.
A few days ago, an interesting process was carried out in Bihar.
A human chain of more than 13,000 kilometres away from the state of Bihar was organised in Saik, rooting social destructions.
Through this movement, waking up against evils such as child marriage and dowry abuse was provoked.
All the people of the state decided to fight against dowry and child marriage.
Children, elderly, enthusiasm and provocative youth, mothers and brothers, all of them joined themselves in this movement.
From the historical Gandhi Maidan of Patna to the border of the state, this man chain is very long.
If the benefits of the true progress of the people of all the sections of the society are to be achieved then our society should be freed from these evils.
All of us together will take the oath that we will not see these misconducts from the society
Let us create a New India, a powerful and powerful India.
People have been writing and telling me about this thing for some time now.
I have also seen many videos and social media related to the beneficiaries of this scheme.
I would like to say that they got the darshan and the idea of getting others was raised in their hearts.
The objective behind this scheme is to improve healthcare and to enhance the ease of living.
Public drugs are cheaper by 50 to 90 percent than commercially distributed drugs.
It provides economic benefits to the senior citizens, especially those who use the simple people, especially those who take daily life.
The generic medicines that are being purchased here are similar to the standards of the World Health Organisation.
Because of this, good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today, the central government has established more than 3000 public medicines across the country.
Through this, medicines are available at cheaper prices and entrepreneurs have created new opportunities for employment to individuals.
Affordable medicines, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and Amrut Bazars are available.
The only objective behind this is to provide quality and proper healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country, which can create a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Mangesh ji from Maharashtra has been distributing a photo at the NarendraModi Mobile App.
The picture attracted me very much.
One of them was associated with his grandfather and participated in the movement called 'Swachh Morna Nadi'.
The citizens of Akola have worked towards cleaning the Mornah river on this Swachh Bharat Mission.
Though the Morna river has been a river that flows in 12 months, it has now become seasonal.
Another sad thing here is that wild animals and waterfalls are full of rivers.
I am told that the Swachh Survekshan was launched on 20th January, 2018 and this movement will continue on every Saturday until the Morna river is completely cleaned.
It shows that if a person takes a decision to try, it is not possible that he cannot achieve it.
There can also be great changes through the mass movement.
I extend my best wishes to the people of Akola, its district and municipal administration and all the citizens participating in the movement of the people and your efforts will be sympathetic to other citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, there is an exchange of views on the Padma Awards given by the President on Tuesday.
Newspapers and televisions are attracted to this.
But when you look at it, it is proud of you, it is very glorious to be amongst us, and to get the awards and recognitions without any recommendation.
Now it is not necessary for a person to be well-known, but his actions are marked.
He has been manufacturing sports equipment from Kuppa for 40 years, so that he acts as a scientific enthusiast for children.
He has been trying to look after the scientific tests by using unprofitable materials.
For this, he went to 3,000 schools across the country and encouraged films made in 18 languages.
See what a wonderful life, a great dedication
Siddhava Jayanti in Karnataka is like this.
There is no point in calling him 'Girls dominated goddess.'
He has played a very important role in transforming lives of countless women for the last 30 years in Belgaum.
From the age of seven, he dedicated himself to God, and served his entire life for the welfare of the gods.
Not only this, he has worked unprecedentedly for the welfare of women who have been humiliated.
You might have heard about Bhajju Shyam from Madhya Pradesh, who was born in a very poor tribal family.
Although he had done simple work for his life, he had an indomitable country on the traditional tribal paintings.
Because of this greed, today he has a value not only in India but in the whole world.
His paintings have been depicted in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
Bhajju Shyam, who has given the name of India overseas, has shown his talent and has been given the Padma Shri Award.
The life of Lakshmikutty, a tribal woman from Kerala, can be a surprise to you.
Laxmikutty is also working as a teacher in the Kalaar area, who still lives in a dense forest area and a humid dwelling place between tribal dwellers.
He has chosen to prepare the medicines used after the snake was shot.
Laxmi ji is constantly serving society through her her herbal medicine.
He has been awarded the Padma Shri award for his contribution to the society.
Today I feel like telling one another, 75-year-old Subhashini Mistry of West Bengal has been selected for the award.
Subashini Mistry ji washed the utensils in many houses to build a hospital and sold vegetables.
Today, the hospital constructed by his hard work is providing free medical treatment to thousands of poor.
Sometimes, in schools and colleges, they have to take such people and share their experiences.
And the society must make some efforts to take all the awards.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January, we celebrate the day of migrant Indians.
On the same day, Bapu returned to India from South Africa.
Today, we celebrate undivided ties between Indians and Indians across the globe.
This year, we have organized a programme for migrant Indians, in which Parliamentarians and mayors from across the globe were invited from India to migrate.
In many countries such as Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and the United States, where immigrant Indians are mayors and parliamentarians.
Some of them have put their stamps on cybersecurity, Ayurveda, music, poems, climate change and Indian literature in many fields, and have been making a mark for themselves.
Some people have built Gurudwaras from tractors, some have built mosques, that is, somehow we are, somehow have spoiled all those countries.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the people of the European Union for their recognition of the special tasks of overseas Indians and for their remarkable work to reach these two wars across the globe.
Even today, we are witnessing the fact that how true the teachings of brothers are.
If we decide to go on the basis of brothers and sisters, what more than that can we pay for him
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you for the year 2018.
Throughout the year, we have shared many things.
The exchange of your letters, thoughts and ideas for the voice of mind has always been giving me a new power.
After a few more hours, the year will change, but our shares are continuing as usual.
In the coming year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
Best wishes to all of you for the year 2018.
Just a few days back, on December 25, people from all over the world celebrated Christmas Festival in Kolagal.
We can also see the essence of service integrity in Bible.
This shows us what is the importance of service integrity.
In our country, we are talking about the negative act, that is, there is no expectation of reflection in such a process.
Service is the best quality of service.
My dear countrymen, Guru Gobind Singh was born this year in the 350th year.
The extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji's courage and sacrifice is inspiring for us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji gave the message of great life and values and lived his entire life on the basis of those values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji as a poet, a philosopher of philosophy, a great warrior, worked to inspire the people through all these contributions.
He fought against repression and injustice.
In this struggle, he had to lose many things in his personal life.
But he didn't have any place in his mind for indifference.
Every moment of life gave the message of love, sacrifice and peace
Have you seen such a great characteristic
At the beginning of this year, I got the opportunity to attend Guru Gobind Singh's 350th birthday in Patna Sahib.
Come, let us all learn from Guru Gobind Singh's great teachings and his conceptual life and to promote our lives.
Those who are born in the year 2000 or after that, that is, in the 21st century, they will start becoming voters who are eligible for voting in 2018.
In the democratic system of India, I welcome the electors of the 21st century and the electors of the New India.
I congratulate my young friends and I would like to appeal to all of you to go and register you as voters.
All over India, as a voter of the 21st century, is going on for you.
The positive transformation in the lives of millions of people, the vote is a major instrument.
You can't be just empowered to vote.
Today, in my heart, I want to talk about our glorious younger society, which is 18-25 years old, is energetic and energetic.
I consider them young people of New India Youth or New India, if young people of New India are young, young, enthusiasm and energy.
I am confident that our dream of a New India will be achieved with the talent and strength of these powerful youths.
When we talk about a New India, we should be freed from the fragrance of New India, caste, religion, radicalism and corruption.
It should be free from dirt and poverty.
Everyone should get equal opportunities in a New India and everybodys desires and expectations should be fulfilled.
In a New India, peace, unity and harmony should be our guiding powers.
Come forward, my youngsters of this New India, let us analyze how to create a New India.
Young people from 18 to 25 years of age can sit together to exchange views on New India, find ways and plans
You can imagine how to complete our resolutions before 2022
Can we advise the dreams of our freedom fighters to build India
Gandhiji turned the freedom struggle into a mass destruction.
My young friends, we need to create a people's destination to create a greater supreme India of the 21st century, which is a people's destination for progress.
How to achieve success through stress
Today there have been many new opportunities before the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and seeing success.
My dear countrymen, I had spoken about the importance of positive and constructive thinking in the voice of the previous mind.
There is also a case in English- Passimism Leads to Weekness, Optimism to Power.
Share the positive accounts of 2017, and we welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am glad that a large number of people have given positive answers to the social bases, MyGov Internet and the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's Secretariat and are sharing them.
There have been lakhs of dwellings in POSTION India Hashtag, which has reached more than 150 crore people.
In a way, this spread of negativeness has spread throughout the world from India.
The introductions and responses are indeed sympathetic.
It was a pleasant experience for me.
Some of the people of the country have pointed out some incidents that have had a positive impact on their minds this year.
Some are sharing their personal achievements.
My name is Meenu Patia.
I live in Backet One, Face On, from Mayurvihar, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
I wanted to read.
For this, I needed a loan, which I got very easily and my daughter was able to continue studying.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vade.
I dwell in the bottom.
My husband had done the risk of paying one rupee per month.
He had to die unfortunately in the accident.
We only know about the bad situation that we have.
We got a lot of benefit due to the help of the government, and we were able to get rid of it.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
The National Highway was constructed in 2017 through our Background village.
Because of this, our roads have become very excellent and our business has started increasing.
My name is Deepansu Ahuja, in Saadatganj district of Shaharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish.
Since there has been water constraints in our area, we have been dependent on the military's water pipeline for the last 40 years.
Now ourselves alone have built a pipeline...
This is our biggest achievement in 2017.
There has been a positive change in the lives of many people due to the multiple activity of their own.
In fact, this is a New India, which we are building together.
Come, let us start Bhukuwam in Buddha with these tiny pleasures and move forward from positive India to positive India to positive India.
When we all talk about positive thoughts, I feel like sharing a thing.
I heard about the stories that would inspire the chosen Arjuna and Pasheer Khan Building in the state government tests.
He has emerged from the bondage of radicalism and desperation and is the head of the state of Kashmir's government election.
You will be distressed to know that in the 1990s, the terrorists have burnt his ancient house.
At the time of terrorism and violence, his family was forced to throw out their ancestors soil.
He never abandoned faith.
He set a path for himself - a path to serve the people.
He came out with adverse conditions, and he finished his victory.
Today, he is not only in Jammu Kashmir but also inspirational for all India.
Whatever the environment is bad, Anjah has also proved that through constructive actions, the deceptive clouds can be dissolved and dissolved.
Last week, there was an opportunity to meet some women from Jammu Kashmir.
These are the strengths of the country, these are my youngest wealth, these are the future of my country.
Thousands of devotees come every year to seek the blessings of Ayyappan, this world famous temple.
But the Sabarimala temple is an example of how to transform cleanliness into culture, how to find a way to solve the problem and how to transform peoples participation into power.
B.
The police officer, Vijayan, inaugurated a program called Punayam Garden, under which Swachh Survekshan was launched.
This pilgrimage has grown so much in Sabarimala which has become a part of the Garden movement and every journey of every traveller.
There, along with hardships, a determined decision regarding cleanliness is also connected.
My dear countrymen, on October 2, 2014, on the birth anniversary of Gandhi Jayanti, we have made a resolution that is, the work that is not fulfilled, the Swachh Bharat, the free India from the month.
He has been successful for this work throughout his life and tried.
On the 150th birthday of his brother, we decided that we will dedicate the Swachh Bharat to him, and contribute to that direction.
Efforts are being made in detail across the country towards cleanliness.
There has been a vast change in rural and urban areas due to public participation.
The worlds largest study called Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be undertaken from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 in the coming year to calculate the quality of cleanliness achieved in urban areas.
This study will include about 40 crore people in more than 4,000 cities.
The survey will enable peoples participation in open defecation, collection of dumps, transportation of dumps, scientific tubes, transformation efforts, capacity building, innovative initiatives for cleaning, etc.
According to this survey, different groups will go to cities and conduct surveys.
Talking to the citizens, they will get answers from them.
They will examine the use of Swachh Abhiyan and the development of various types of service centres.
It will also be considered whether all the organisations have been constructed in the city in the nature of the people and the nature of the city.
It is not just the government to implement cleanliness.
Every citizen and citizen organisation has a major role in this.
On the basis of this survey, if the standards of cities are set up, if the population in your city is more than one lakh, the country-class standards and less than one lakh population will be provided, the part-class standards will also be provided.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, through this program, I want to share one thing with you.
I am aware that if a Muslim woman wants to take a Haj pilgrimage, she cannot go without 'Mahram' or her male defender.
When I heard about this for the first time, how can it be
What was the reason for this mischief
Over the years, Islamic women have been injustice, but there is no discussion about this.
Such a rule does not exist in many Islamic countries.
But this right has been denied to the Islamic women of India.
I am happy that our government has taken care of it.
Our Minority Affairs has taken necessary steps and ended the tradition that has been consistent for 70 years and removed this control.
Today, I am glad that even without a men constable named 'Mahram', 1300 Islamic women have applied for a Haj pilgrimage without men and women have been enthusiastic for Haj pilgrimage from Kerala to North India and from different parts of the country.
The Ministry of Minority Affairs has been advised to ensure that all women who have applied for such a separate journey allow Haj pilgrimage.
I am confident that the development journey of India is progressing with the strength of our women and their intellectuals, and progress is going to be achieved.
Our sustained efforts should be made to ensure that the rights, opportunities and women are supplied to men, and they will also see the progress of men equally on the path of development.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, we all have a historic day.
But it will be remembered in a special way on 26th January, 2018.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, will visit India as the chief guests of 10 countries in the ASEAN organisation this year.
The President, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, will attend the event.
This has never happened in the history of India.
In 2017, the ASEAN system was special for India and India.
The ASEAN organisation completed its 50-year period and in 2017, India's joint 25 years with the ASEAN organisation took place.
It is a matter of great pride for us that on 26th January, these great leaders from 10 countries of the world will participate here.
It's very inappropriate that there will be no plaintiffs on a day.
Now we have celebrated the Christmas Festival.
Let the coming New Year satisfy everybody with great happiness, happiness and fulfillment.
We all move forward with a new temperament, a new enthusiasm, a new motivation, a new resolution and a nation.
During the Sun's death in January, Makar Sankranti will be celebrated this month.
This is a time associated with nature.
In fact, every festival of ours is somehow associated with nature, but in our diverse culture, this marvellous event of nature is a habit of celebrating in different ways.
If the enjoyment of Lohri increases in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, Kitchdi and Dil Sankranti are expected in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
Sankranth in Rajasthan, Mag-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu, all of which have a special significance for their own.
All these festivals are celebrated between 13th and 17th January.
Although it is different in the name, the principle of their basement is the linkage with nature and agriculture.
Congratulations to all the people of the country for this festival.
Once again, I congratulate you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, dear countrymen.
We will meet again in 2018.
Mann Ki Baat September, 2019
There is no doubt that there will be any Indian citizen who doesn't respect him.
He is more senior than all of us at the age of his testimony in different stages and different periods of the country.
Not only our new generation, but we all have a great learning experience, you are a great enlightenment for us, but you have always come to the forefront of your parents' development and work.
This feeling will be very nice to me.
Nizama, I don't want to give you any trouble.
Why, I know how much you are doing, how much work you have to do, and I see everything.
Moti ji: Yeah.
Modi ji: Your love is because we are very happy.
Modi ji: I have been grateful to you for your continuity on me.
Once again, I congratulate you my beloved birthday.
Modi ji: When I came to Mumbai this time, I thought I would talk to you.
We will celebrate innumerable festivals like Navaratri Mahotsav, Karba, Durga Pooja, Dussehra, Deepavali, Baiya Dhuj and Satpura.
In many cities, several government organisations and youth start-ups are working in this work.
They coordinate all the clothes, sweets and food items in the houses of the people, search for the needy and bring them to them without any advertisement.
This time, in this season of Festivals, shall we break the darkness of the light with full awareness and deliberation
And the laughter that grows in the faces of many poor families doubles your joy in the days of the feast, and your face is shining, and your lightning is even more illuminating.
My dear brothers and sisters, Mrs.
We welcome Mrs.
Will we welcome Mrs.
In our culture, we salute women as a sage because the woman is considered to be a goodwill provider and fulfilment.
Can we organize programmes in our society, in our villages, cities and women to respect this time
Even if they work hard and endeavor, many women who have achieved their achievements will be amongst us, in our families, in society and in the country.
Whether we can organise programmes to provide honour and pride to these people of India during this Deepavali
Women who have done many extraordinary jobs may have been amongst us.
Somebody might have tried to create awareness about cleanliness and health, some may have been working as a doctor, engineer and a social service to teach poor children.
As a lawyer, he might have been trying to fight for justification.
Our society should identify such women and respect them.
Just as we all have jointly launched a Celebrity movement with Mother, we will drive Bharat Ki Laxmi across the globe.
Encouraging the Indian diaspora is to ensure a lot of life for the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I have already spoken of the voice of Mann Ki Baat, which gives me the opportunity to interact with those who do not know the greatest benefit.
In the past, Alina Thaiang, a student in remote Arunachal Pradesh, had written an interesting letter to me.
I am from Roying area of Arunachal Pradesh.
When my choices came this time, some asked me whether you were reading the book of exams.
I said I didn't read that book.
But after returning home, I read this book and I read it twice or three times again.
After this my experience was very sweet.
My breastfeeding wealth, thank you for writing the letter.
Thank you very much for telling me about the problems faced in it while studying.
I'll follow your order.
What is your experience in your daily life
Once again I express my gratitude to my young friend Alina Thaiang, a student of Arunachal.
My hearts and my dear countrymen, you will be aware of the continuous programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through TV and discuss the absence of retirement.
This time, however spoke of victory in the US Opinion race, Medveda's second speech in the final race was somewhat spoken.
I also heard a more spoken speech on social networks and then I saw the lamp.
Medveda's simplicity and his commitment to the 23-year-old Dan.
If there were others, he would have been distressed and disappointed, but he had no argument on his face, but he laughed at everyone's thinking and pain through his words.
All the audience from there welcomed his speech.
In one lake, the zeal of the creator and the wonder of the winner was charming.
If you say you haven't yet heard the message of Matweden, I ask the youth, please, please listen.
There are many things to learn from all stakeholders and all age groups.
These accounts are facing victory and there is no significance of success.
Life succeeds, and our resources are particularly telling us this thing.
The thoughts of our forefathers are really astonishing.
Mani Kanjana Samyog: The joy of Janayathi Localshan: If a person has the ability and work, he cannot win his heart
In fact, this young sportsperson has won all the hearts of the world.
My hearts and my dear countrymen, especially my young friends, I want to tell you what I am going to tell you for your direct good.
But in the beginning, if we have awakened and prevented them, it can be very safe.
I want to tell this feeling, especially to the younger community.
It is difficult for you all to know that the drug addiction of tobacco is very bad for health, it is very difficult to eliminate that habit.
Those who use tobacco are more likely to suffer from diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure.
It affects the growth of brain because of its habit in young age .
But today, I have come to share a new thing with you.
You know, the e-cigarette has been banned in India now.
The e-cigarette, which is different from ordinary cigarettes, is a type of electronic apparatus.
A kind of chemical smoke is produced when the e-cigarette swollen substance of nicote is swollen.
We all know well about the dangers of ordinary cigarettes, but the misrepresentation of e-cigarettes has been widespread.
That is, it doesn't have any danger from this E-cigarette.
Like other cigarettes, there is no smelling smell in it, which contains a smelling cereal.
If a father in a house continues to smoke, we might have seen that the others in that house will not be smoked, and he would like to not allow his children to smoke like himself.
His efforts will be that no one in the family should smoke.
Because he knows how much smoke and smoke will be used for the body.
The beggar smokes, and the person who is aware of it.
But this is not the case with E. Sigrade.
There is no awareness about E-cigarettes.
They don't know the danger, because of which sometimes the e-cigarette is dumbly entering the house.
In fact, the E-cigarette has many supplementary substances, which have adverse effects on health.
If anyone smokes in the neighborhood, then the filth thereof will betray us.
The dreams of every family should not be swollen by putting them in their feet.
Remove the habit of smoking and do not take any wrong ideas related to e-cigarettes.
Come, let us together create a healthy India.
Yes, don't you remember Fit India
Fit India doesn't mean that if one goes to the gym for two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening.
It is important to stay away from these.
I believe that you don't feel sorry to say that it will definitely happen to you.
They have dedicated themselves to others, not to live for themselves.
One such honorarium will be honoured in the Vedican town on October 13.
Sister Year Treasury is an example of the work done for the benefit of human society throughout the world in its 50-year-old life.
He had great influence in the social service and education sector.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of great pride not only for India but for the entire world today, when we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi Ji, 130 crore people have been determined to get rid of poverty by using it once.
In the direction of environmental protection, India has been leading the world in a way and today the eyesight of all the countries are on India.
I am confident that all of you will participate in the movement to get rid of the catastrophe once in the month of October 2.
In many places, people are playing a unique role in this movement in their own ways.
But one of the youngsters of our country has led a very vibrant movement.
When the milk of his work went to my notice, I tried to phone him and get to know about his new test.
For the first time when I heard the word "Plogging", it was new to me.
Perhaps this word could have been used in foreign countries.
Hello Ributhman ji, greetings, I speak to Narendra Modi.
My heartfelt greetings to you.
If 130 crore countrymen have taken a step in this direction, then India will move 130 crore feet towards the direction of getting rid of the negative substances used only once.
Ributhman ji, once again, thank you my best.
And many times thanks to you, and to your team, and to a new imagination like this.
Tengu.
My dear countrymen, the country and the world are working on the 2nd of October, but we want to travel on the path of Gandhiji's 150 duties.
We want to transform our lives into a country's culture.
I want to remind you of something beforehand.
Although I will speak in detail about it in the voice of the next mind, why do I speak it just before today, don't you even have a chance to prepare for it
You all remember that on 31st October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel jis birthday.
Everyone, everybody, everybody, everybody, every school, every college, every thousands of people, everywhere in thousands of villages of India, every day we have to walk for unity.
My dear countrymen, all of you might remember that I had spoken from the Red Fort on 15th August, asking you to visit any 15 places in India by 2022.
There should be at least 15 places, where one or another or the other will remain there.
Whenever there are holidays on the occasion of Deepawali, people are going to roam around, so I once again request you, please visit some 15 places in India.
And all this has been done only because of your cooperation, especially because we understand the importance of tourism.
My dear countrymen, once again, in a diverse India, many festive festive festive festive festivities have been greeted.
A few days ago, there was a possibility of a far-reaching relationship with young friends from Karnataka.
The Times Committee's 'Vijay Karnataka' newspaper published a journal on the children, in which they asked the Prime Minister of the country to write a letter.
They published some selected letters in the magazine.
When I read those letters, they were good to me.
While applauding Girti Hekte, Northern Karnataka, Digital India and Smart City programme, he said that the need to transform our educational system is not a country for children on classroom studies and they are keen to understand the nature.
If we give information about nature to children, they are likely to be harmful in the future.
Reta Nataf, a child from Laxmeshwara, writes that he is the daughter of a military hero and gives her pride.
If you are the daughter of a soldier, there is no surprise in you that you will be proud, what Irfana Begum has written from Kalpurki is 5 kilometres from his school and his village.
Friends, I am happy that a newspaper has taken such a pledge and I have got the opportunity to read these letters.
It was an experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today 2611.
Our Constitution Day is 26th November.
Today, in 1949, the Constitution of India was accepted in the Constituent Assembly.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is the day of recalling the members of the Constitutional Assembly.
They worked hard for 3 years to enforce the Constitution of India.
Those who read these discussions, they know well how their dedication to the nation was in those discussions.
Do you know how hard they will work without a constitution for our country with diversity
And when the country was liberated from the slaves, with understanding and vision, they did this.
It is the responsibility of all of us to create a New India in the minds of the obvious thoughts of those who have given the Constitution to the light of this Constitution.
Our Constitution is very wide.
There is no part of life that cannot be seen and there is no matter of nature.
It is our obligation to follow without a single upheaval of the Constitution.
Be it citizens or rulers, we should understand the feelings of constitutionalism and move forward.
The objective of the Constitution is to ensure that there is no part of anybody.
It is natural to remember Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on the Constitution Day.
17 different groups were formed on the important issues of the Constitution.
One of the most important groups of these is the Framework Group.
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Constituent Assembly.
He was enjoying an important role.
Today, we are experiencing the pride of providing the Constitution of India, which has been demonstrated by Babasaheb Ambedkar jis effective leadership.
He assured all sections of the society of benefits.
On the 6th December, on his disappearance day, we will always remember and pay tributes to him as usual.
And it is reminded of the participants of Babasaheb in making the land self-reliant and mighty.
On the 15th of December, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji was a birthday.
Sardar Patel ji transformed the iron man from the farmer's son to an extraordinary act of living the country in the same way.
Sardar ji was also a member of the Constitution.
He was a member of the Council of Infrastructure, Minorities and Tribals.
Although 2611 is our Constitution Day, how can this country forget 2611, which took place 9 years ago
The country recalls and pays tributes to the brave civilians, police, security forces and all those who are alive.
This country never forgets their sacrifice.
Today, terrorism is one of the worlds widespread events, which is happening every day in a terrible form.
We have been suffering from extremism for the last 40 years.
Our father-in-law has killed thousands of people.
But a few years ago, when India spoke of terrorism at the world stage, it was not taken seriously by many people in the world, but today the world governments see radicalism as a testimony to their patriotism.
This is aimed at destroying humanitarian forces.
Therefore, not only India but all the humanitarian powers of the world should unite and defeat terrorism.
This soil, born by Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Gandhi Ji, has given this soil to the world aim and love.
Terrorism and Terrorism are weakening our social system and making it a terrible attempt.
Therefore, humanitarian powers need to be very well aware.
My dear countrymen, on December 4, we all are celebrating the navy day.
The Indian Navy protects our coastal areas.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You all know that our culture was born on the banks of the river.
Be it the Indus river, the Ganges, the Yamuna, the Saraswati, our rivers, the sea, the economy and the warrior are important in both ways.
This is our entrance to the entire world.
In the expansion of the Chola Empire, their navy played a major role in making it a economic gain.
Several examples of the naval invasions of the Cholas and the study visits are still found in Sanskrit literature.
Most of the world's navy had spent a long time allowing women to work in war.
But about 800-900 years ago, a large number of women have played an important role in the Navy of Cholas.
Women were also involved in war.
The Chole ruler had a sympathetic technology for construction of ships.
When we talk about the navy, cannot President Shivaji Maharaj speak about the opening of his navy
Sivaji Maharaj was dominated by the immovable Konkan coasts.
Several forts related to the empire of Shivaji Maharaj, Sind Durg, Murud Janjeera, Golden Durg etc. were surrounded by the beaches or the sea.
The responsibility for the protection of these forts is Maratha's army.
The Marathi Navy also included major ships and small ships.
His navy was capable of attacking or defending any enemy.
Can't you talk about Kanoji Angre while talking about the Martian Navy
He carried the Maratian Navy to a new summit, setting up Maratian naval bases in many places.
Sumitra immediately engaged in rescue operations and saved many fishermen from drowning and surrendered to Bangladesh.
During the floods in Sri Lanka in May this year, three ships of our ships immediately reached there and succumbed to the government and people of that country.
In June, when the Papua New Guinea government sent us information seeking immediate help, our navy helped save fishermen from fishing boats.
Our navy has always been proud of bringing humanitarian assistance to FIGI nations, and to get rid of it immediately and to bring humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring countries.
We have always brought respect and honour to the Indians on our defence forces. They are the courage, courage, courage, valour, sacrifice and sacrifice of our soldiers as the landlord, our navy and our navy.
125 crore Indians living in desirable lives due to the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for their youth.
Every year on 7th December, we hold the Army Day.
Throughout this week, they will hoist the flag on everyone that is small and big.
The movement will be directed to respect the soldiers in the country.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flags of our military forces.
This fund is spent for the welfare and rehabilitation of the martyrs and the families of the martyrs in the war through the benefits of the soldiers.
You can learn about various ways of economic partnership.
Let us use this opportunity to work towards enhancing the morale of our soldiers.
We will also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, on December 5, the World Soil Wealth Day.
I want to tell my farmer brothers and sisters some things.
All the food we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the entire food chain is related to the soil.
Just imagine what if this rich soil that is required to be produced is not available in this world.
The trees do not grow, how can human life be possible
How are the microbes
The farmers of this country are giving great importance to their lives for two things that have been devoted to the soil and respected it in a scientific manner.
While the farmers of our country are associated with the traditions, it is privileged for us that they are in a country on modern science, they are trying to be depressed.
I heard about the farmers there when I went to the Boranj area of Dohu village of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Here farmers have already used chemical fertilizers, which has affected soil.
Massage was decreasing and earnings were decreasing and gradually the production capacity of soil was decreasing.
In 2016-17, the cultivation of cold crops increased by 3 to 4 times per acre, from 4 to 6 thousand rupees per acre.
Moreover, there was a growth in the soil level.
Due to lack of use of fertilizer, economic savings also occurred.
This has given me great pleasure, my farmer brothers and my farmer brothers have come forward to enforce the suggestions that have been given to them in the soil resource card and their enthusiasm increases when they see the results.
If you want to take care of the masses, first take care of the ground, and if we take care of the land, then this land has started to realize that we should take care of all of us.
Our farmers across the country have more than 10 crore soil storage cards, so that they can understand their land well, so that they can do so.
We bow down to the earth, but have we ever seen how much damage she gets due to putting urea like fertilizers on her
It has been proven in all kinds of scientific methods that there is a serious impact on urea pouring more and more on earth.
When the farmer is the land of the land, how can he bear the burden of being sick of the earth
This mother-father relationship has to be made aware once again.
Can our farmers, our landlords, our soil mines, be able to ensure that if they are 75 years old when they are free in 2022, they will reduce the urea they use
We all began to experience global warming and environmental change.
There was a time when the cold wave started before Deepavali.
But in such a situation, some examples inspire Saddam's awakening people to find out how they are.
Tushar, an 8-year-old man from Madhya Pradesh, has tried to save his villagers from open defecation.
The 8-year-old man couldn't speak, but he had his weapon to imagine
And he arose at 5 o'clock in the morning, and went to the house of his village, and smote them, and raised them, and made them by the signs that they should not go out in the open field.
This young man who went to 30-40 houses every day and taught about cleanliness was freed from the habit of open defecation in the village of Kumhari.
In order to promote cleanliness, this young man is engaged in the task of encouraging Tushar.
This shows that there is no age for cleanliness.
It is important for everyone to play something or the other role in keeping cleanliness.
You might also remember that our talented sportspersons have won 4 medals in Rio Olympics, and have become a part of the D-20 World Cricket competition for the blind.
Several competitions are going on throughout the country.
In the past, 17th National Conference was held in Udaipur.
Our young brothers and sisters from different parts of the country have participated in it and expressed their capabilities.
One of them is the 19-year-old Gegger Ducker from Gujarat, whose body does not have 80 percent muscles, but look at his courage, mind and hard work.
As a result of this capability, he will be trained by the Indian Sports Commission of India as one of the 32 Para swimmers selected for 20-20 Paralympics at the Centre of Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the young jigar ducker and congratulate my best wishes.
Today, special attention is being given to the authenticity and opportunities for the handicapped.
A few days later, Id-e-Milat-Un-Nabi will be celebrated on Sunday.
This is the day when sovereign master Hasrad Mohammad Sahib was born.
(Tolebase Call) Prime Minister Ji, I speak from Kanpur to Jalja Singh.
I appeal to you that you will share ten best things with us from the voices of your mind this year.
Whether there are elders in our villages, they shall never forget the sorrow, nor forget the grief.
We look at the passages in the year-numbers, the conceptions and the results and the plans for the next year.
We are trying to recall the interesting events of the past year in the media.
This includes a constructive thing, including negative things.
But when we take time in 2018, we cannot remember only good things, do we not remember good things
I tell you an idea - if you share 5-10 positive things you have heard, seen and experienced, then you will not feel better.
Can you get the contribution in this
Can we share 5 positive experiences in our lives this time
Whether it is a photograph or a story or a sight-wheeler, through which we invite all of you to welcome the year 2018 in a clean environment and welcome you with good memories.
We will recall the events that inspire others.
Remembering good things, we will create a better environment.
Good things give the power to do good things.
We will connect the strength and impact of this joint drive.
In my next heart, I will definitely try to bring the things that you have come to this positive India to the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, next month, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I will come back to you.
There will be opportunities for many things to be transformed.
The sacred day of sacred worship celebrated after 6 days after the end of Deepawali is one of the festivals celebrated with several appointments and rules.
Traditional appointments are followed every aspect of what to eat and what to eat.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also linked to this festival.
The entire house is cleaned before Satpuja, along with rivers, lakes, waterfalls, pilgrimages and pilgrimages.
The Festival of Sun worship or Sat-Puja is a celebration of environmental protection, disease relief and regulation.
The sense of destruction is that it is behind this tradition that pursues privacy and this evil culture can be a major obstacle on the path of progress.
It is natural that this great heritage of India is all proud.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat is appreciated and criticised.
We have to take the example of masks and artisans.
It's a joy and pleasure that only one shop has sold so much.
About 680 per cent growth has been registered in Kadhi Sanitation Sales for Deepawali.
The total sale of ears and handicrafts has increased by about 90 percent.
This shows that today young people, elderly and women, all age groups, want to wear garments and handicrafts.
I can imagine how many neighbourhoods, poor families and the families of those who work in handicrafts will benefit.
NarenderModiApple Rajan Bhatt has written that you should tell them how to share my spiritual experience among the defence forces and how they celebrate the Deepawali.
You must have celebrated Deepavali with great enthusiasm.
For me, Deepawali also brought a special experience this time.
Once again, our unemployed security forces across the border got the opportunity to celebrate Deepawali.
This time, it was an unforgettable experience to convey Diwali to the security forces in the Kurej area of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our defence forces are defending the country, I bow down to all our defence forces from all the countrymen from the sides of this struggle, dedication and sacrifice, facing the extremely difficult and difficult situations across the border.
Whenever we have the opportunity, we should learn the experiences of our security forces and listen to their adventurous activities.
Many of us do not know that our security forces are working not only in our border areas but also in many important tasks to maintain peace across the globe.
As a Non-Peace Keeper, they are proud of India all over the world.
For us, we are the path of the theory of 'Washtava Kutumbakam', that is, a family all over the world.
India has always been pressurizing women equality.
It can be seen as a small transformation in the supremacy of India, but it reflects a humble idea.
In terms of various works, it is the biggest contribution of India.
India has always played a positive role in the United Nations peacekeeping activities.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served around 50 activities in 71 peacekeeping activities across the globe.
These operations have taken place in all parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kango, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Kango and South Sudan, the Indian Army has treated more than 20,000 patients through medical services.
Many people know that India is the first country to send the first female guardian to the United Nations peacekeeping movement in Liberia.
This activity of India is a vision for all the world.
After this, all the countries started sending their women guards.
It is a matter of great pride that Indias contribution is not only with the peacekeeping activity, but it is also a matter of great pride for everyone that India is engaged in providing training to those engaged in the peacekeeping work of nearly 85 countries.
Our satisfactory peacekeepers from this land, lived by Gandhiji and Gaudhampur, have brought the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peacekeeping is not a simple act.
Our security forces have to go to difficult places.
There is a need to live among different people.
There is a need to understand various climate and different cultures.
They have to change themselves in accordance with regional proposals and environment.
When we remember him, the hearts of all the people of the country glimpse of him and Paramveer Chakra awarded the same I.
In 1989, the 72-year-old man was appointed as a Force Commander in Namibia, who dedicated his services to ensure the freedom of Namibia.
India has always been giving messages of peace, unity and goodwill to the world as an angel of peace.
He was born as a Margaret Elizabeth Disease in Ireland, but Swami Vivekanander called him 'Nivedita.'
It means that Nivadita is completely devoted.
During the following period, he dedicated himself to his name.
Yesterday is the 150th birthday of brother Niketita.
He was very attracted by Swami Vivekananda, cutting his comfortable life and dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor.
Brother Nivedita suffered mentally from the injustice in the British regime.
The British did not only slaughter our country, but they tried to keep us mentally slaves.
Noting that our culture was devastated, the work of embarrassing our hearts continued.
Brother Nivedita re-established the glory of Indian culture.
He raised the awareness of the country and worked to unite the people.
He went to different countries of the world and voiced Omgi against false propagandas of peace and philosophy.
The famous nationalist and Tamil poet, Subramaniam Bharati, has described the revolution as an innovator, in the poem, about the newcomer and their synchronous balance.
It is said that he got the instruction of this kind from the brother-in-law.
Brother Nivadita has helped the great scientist Jagdishchandra dress.
Through his articles and congresses, he has enhanced cooperation in publishing and extending the research of Bose.
To fulfil one spiritual and science is one of the most beautiful features of India.
Brother Nivedita and scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose are the best examples of this.
In 1899, there was a severe Black Disease in Kolkata, in which thousands of people died.
Brother Nivedita launched the task of cleaning the canals and streets.
He may have lived a good life, but he was involved in the service of the poor.
He was inspired by his sacrifice and began to work towards the service of the people.
He taught the lessons of the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
Thank you for calling your phone.
It is very surprising to know that children are also suffering from diabetes.
Such diseases are called psychological disorders in the early stages, such diseases are only those who are rich and those who live in happiness.
Young people saw such diseases rough.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today we know that these diseases are a lifestyle problem.
One of the main reasons for suffering from such diseases in young age is the reduction in physical activity in our lifestyle and changes in food habits.
Social and family are also very important to take care of them.
If you consider it, you will feel that there is no need to do something extraordinary.
We have to change our old habits and make small things properly and make it ourselves natural.
Children should play in the open fields and the family should try their best with waking up.
If possible, the elderly in the family can join these children in sports.
Instead of using children's lift, they can have the habit of climbing stairs.
After dinner, everyone in the family can walk with children.
Yoga is particularly beneficial in creating a healthy lifestyle and avoiding lifestyle disturbances.
Before starting the school, you will see how much benefit you will get from the first 30 minutes of Yoga.
If I say that it is easier, it can be easily learned and why it is very easy, it can be done anywhere.
There is no need for specific equipment or field.
Yoga is very beneficial in controlling diabetes, many researches have been conducted.
The study is underway at AIIMS (AIIMS) hospital, which is very incentive to the decisions that have been made so far.
We will not only see Ayurveda and Yoga as treatments but also make them part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, many good news has come in the past few days in the sports sector.
Since our soldiers played a very great role, we have succeeded in achieving Asian catastrophe after 10 years.
Earlier, India had won Asian Cooperation in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to the entire team, the helpers and the people of my class and the country.
After Hockey, India has got good jobs for Petminton's game too.
Petminton star Kitambi Srikanth has won the Denmark Opin and honoured India.
After Indonesia Opin and Australia Opin, this is the third Super Series Primary.
I extend my best wishes to our young sportspersons and their achievements for enhancing Indias pride.
Friends, this month FIFA has started World Cup competitions for 17-year-old people.
The teams from all over the world came to India and all showcased their capabilities in the football field.
I had the opportunity to see a lamp.
Sportspersons and observers were encouraging everyone.
The whole world is looking at the great event called the World Cup.
This great lamp, the power, enthusiasm and thirst of all the youngsters, was overwhelmed when they were thirsty.
The world began successfully and all the teams expressed their efficiency.
Although India could not have succeeded, the young sportspersons of India won the hearts of everyone.
All the world nations, including India, witnessed this great event, attracted and cited all-round football fans.
The symptoms have started to show that the future of the football is very bright.
Once again, I congratulate all the sportspersons, those who helped them and all the sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, when I look at the number of writers about the Swachh Bharat, I have to pay my attention to their sentiments, then I will have to dedicate every persons voice to cleanliness.
Some send photographs on the efforts of small bridges, some sending information about the efforts of the youth group.
In some places, some innovation related to cleanliness is being created or somebody gets information about the changes made by an officer's efforts.
I was given a detailed statement in the past about a revival story in the Chandrapur Fort of Maharashtra.
There the government organisation, called Ecological Protection Organization, was engaged in cleaning the Chandrapur Fort through its entire team.
In this movement that took place for 200 days, they engaged in the task of cleaning the fort without restlessness and without sleeping.
Regularly 200 days.
As soon as you see this, your disappointment will turn into trust.
It is an excellent example of this pursuit of cleanliness, beauty, social activity and intermittent efforts.
Fort is a symbol of our heritage.
We all have the responsibility of protecting and cleaning the legacy of history.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Chandrapur and the entire team of the Ecological Protection Organization.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jis birthday.
Guru Nanak Dev ji became the first Guru of the Sikhs and became the Guru of the world.
He thought of the welfare of the human society, and saved all castes equally.
He stressed on women's empowerment and respect for women.
He gave a message to establish equality in society, not only to stop his message with words but also to his work.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has given three messages to live the beneficial life - to raise the name of God, to help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had written a sacred book called Guru Granth.
We are going to celebrate the year 2019 as the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Let us try to move ahead on the path shown by his teachings and messages.
My dear countrymen, the birthday of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be celebrated on 31st October after 2 days.
The speciality of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel is that he is not only a manifester of the idea of change, but also erupted into a very difficult problem, but is able to solve the practice.
He was an expert in implementing the idea.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji accepted the great responsibility of connecting India with the same fate.
He initially ensured that millions of people should be brought under the guise of the same nation as the Constitution.
His ability to make a decision has given him the power to cross all the barriers.
This puppet of Sardar ji is still a vision of our New India, and is even more relevant today.
That is why we follow his birthday as National Integration Day.
His contribution in giving an integrated shape to the nation is incomparable.
On 31st October, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, many people are going to participate in the programme called 'One Outlook' across the country, including children, youth, women and all age groups from across the country.
I urge you people to join this run for unity and enter into a mutually beneficial movement.
My dear countrymen, after the Deepawali holiday, you all have started living again in your daily life with a new commitment and a new determination.
My best wishes to all of you for your dreams.
With the voice of mind in Akashvani, it has been completed for three years.
Today, 36th.
In a way, the creative power of India and the feelings, desires and expectations that are filled with all the corners of the country are blamed somewhere, but I have given my heart a wonderful opportunity to interact with the feelings of the people.
You might have noticed that I never said it was my voice.
Be it email or telephone, be it mygov or Narendra ModiApp, all these are available to me.
Sometimes individual-related disorders and sometimes social problems are attracting attention.
I take about half an hour of yours once a month, but people keep sending information to me about the voice of mind for 30 days a month.
I am grateful to the countrymen for getting the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common people of the country in such a short span of time.
In my heart, I have always reminded you of the words of Adarsh Vinoba Bhave.
After this, I had received a lot of letters from everywhere in the country and many social institutions and many youths were working in the work that is not being eaten.
While watching, not only in India, but also from all over the world, Calfy was transformed into a big movement.
This is not the problem of social media.
Every woman has become a new self-confidence and a new honourable event.
Every mother had to take a cell phone with her parents.
Every woman has the feeling that she has its own importance.
In the past, I attended a meeting of the tourism sector of the Government of India.
Wherever you visit, I asked the travelers to send me pictures of Incredible India.
Millions of films have come from across the corner of India, in a way it has become a huge wealth for the workers in the tourism sector.
The country is starting to travel on the right track every moment.
Every citizen of the country tries to do something positive for the benefit of others, for the betterment of society and for the betterment of the country.
In this three-year movement of Mann Ki Baat, I learned from the people of the country.
This is the greatest capital and the greatest power of any country.
The sale of doors has increased, which has resulted in employment in poor households.
Since 2nd October, the entrance has been discontinued, which is substantially discontinued.
I once again ask you to take forward the movement on the doorsteps and strengthen it.
When we buy the doors, we have to keep in mind the feeling that the fire brigades will be lighted in the poor houses.
We should do this for this thing that the poor people of our country have the power.
Due to the increased interest in the doorsteps, there has been an inspiration and encouragement for working in the doorsteps, the doorsteps related to the Government of India, and innovative thinking.
The idea of how to explore new technology, how to increase manufacturing capabilities and how to introduce solar equipment.
They have begun to imagine how to revive the family that had disappeared from the law for 20-30 years.
In Uttar Pradesh, the Sevapuri Kadhi Ashram in Varanasi has been closed for 26 years, which has started functioning with new Tempa.
That is, on the 2nd of October, 15 days before the birth anniversary of Gandhi Ji, we had decided that we will take part in the Swachh Sandhan across the country.
We will unite people's mind through cleanliness.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated this work and the nation was united in it.
Today, the elderly, the children, the men and women, the city-village are connecting themselves as part of this cleanliness drive.
We had promised to succeed and this cleanliness movement has been moving towards achieving success with the help of our commitment and is spreading in front of our eyes.
Everyone makes it suitable for them, provides help and gives a golden contribution to achieve this.
Sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, students, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, policemen and soldiers are connecting themselves with this movement.
If the public places are polluted then people ask for a stance and there is a pressure on the worker to keep it clean and I feel that it is good.
This time I had to pay attention to another thing - cleanliness is one thing, we are not aware of the cleanliness.
At the same time, cleanliness is our nature and it is important to implement an ideal movement.
This time several competitions related to cleanliness have been held.
More than 2,12 crore children participated in the Estimates.
Thousands of children brought their imagination and paintings.
When we talk about cleanliness, I don't forget to express my gratitude to the media.
They have taken this movement with a very clean spirit.
They have contributed greatly to the creative environment by connecting them with each other in a proper manner.
We look at how much service is being provided to the Swachh Swachh Survekshan, the elementary media and newspapers of our country.
A few days back, a young 18-year-old girl from Srinagar told me about Pilal Dar.
The largest lake in Asia is close to Sri Nagar, where he used to remove plastic, polythene, utilized bottles and pulses.
From this, he also earned income.
As his father died of cancer, he added to his lifelong cleaning.
Pilal Dar, a young man, is an inspiring and inspiring factor for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
This October marks a month to remember many of our dignitaries.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, Lal Bahadur Shastri, the birth anniversary of 11th October, the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Teshmukh, on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Din Dayal Upadhyay ji.
This year has been centuries for Nanaji and Deen Dayal.
When Nanaji Teshmukh ji broke his political life and joined him with the rural movement and celebrated his centenary, it is important to be respected by his work on rural development.
When the former President of India, Abdul Kalam ji speaks to the youth, Nanaji Teshmukh will always present the message of his rural progress.
He also went to the villages to see Nanaji's work with great respect.
Like Gandhi Ji, Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji will also speak in detail about the man in the society's market.
Deen Dayal will recall how to transform the lives of the poor, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the underprivileged and the underprivileged.
If we look at all these mahaministers, they don't have the equipment that we can do, why do we think of these mahaministers, then the path to go ahead is guided.
In every city of the country, this kind of iron is required to be used in large numbers and the winds are also comfortable.
Sardar ji unified the country
We also have to take part in this movement for unity and take forward the mantra of unity.
We are very natural to say that unity in diversity is the achievement of India.
While we are proud of diversity, did you try to realize this diversity
I want to tell the people of the country, especially the young generation, that we are alive.
Enjoy the diversity of our country and feel it and smell its smell.
You can see that this diversity of our country will be a school for the development of personality within you.
During the holidays and Diwali, there has been a mood to go somewhere everywhere in our country.
Those who live in north India are unaware of what is in south India.
Those who live in the West are unaware of what is in East India.
Do you know how much diversity is in our country
If you have noticed the speeches of Gandhi Ji, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekanand Ji and our former President Abdul Kalam, then one thing will be seen well - when they looked around India, there was a new inspiration to see and understand India and to dedicate their lives.
All these dignitaries have seen India completely.
Before their work, they tried to understand and understand India.
They tried to see India living inside them.
Can not our different states, different communities, groups, their habits, their traditions, their rituals, their food habits and their beliefs be learnt, understood and lived as a student
The value of tourism is not seen and stopped, but we understand it as a student.
I have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts in India.
The dream of a united India is incomparable India.
How many types of foods are there
If you have every kind of food every day in your entire life then there will be no chance of eating the same food again.
This is the great strength of our tourism.
In these holidays, you have to leave the house and do not stop, we are going for change, but go out with the aim of knowing and stopping things.
Your life will be completed through these experiences.
Your perspective will be expanded.
Tell me who else can be the greatest Asan than your experiences
If you go this time too, you will have taken this movement forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences and share pictures.
Definitely send your photos to Incrediblindia.
If you want to meet the people there, then send their photographs.
There is a feeling in my heart that in order to encourage the tourism sector in India, what will be the seven most important tourist destinations in your state - every Indian has to go to those seven places if possible to know about those seven places of your state.
With this help, can you give any information about this
Can you express this at the NarendraModiApp
Can you know this in the Incredible India
If a number of people from a state say so, I will tell the government to explore the advertisements about which seven places have been reported in every state.
That is, how can we move to tourist destinations in a way with people's views
Similarly, you can imagine the places you have seen all over the country, where you have 7 most important places and others have to visit and visit, you can also think that you have to get information about these things and send it to myGov and the NarendraModiApp.
Come on, join me.
During this period from October to March, you can be catalyzed to the tourism sector of the country.
I'm calling you.
Our countrymen, many things touch my heart as a man.
I'm a man like you too
Maybe it has come to your attention in the past, in which the people of the country have seen the marvellous example of women's power and nationalism.
The Indian Army has got two diamonds - Lieutenant Tasty and Finance, which are extraordinary giants.
If I say that they are extraordinary, they have lost their lives in the service of Mother India.
You can imagine how their mood will be when they break the world at this young age
But Tyagai Colonel Santosh Mahadik's wife, Suwati Mahadik, faced such difficult situations and strengthened his mind, who joined the Indian Army.
He joined the army for 11 months and deployed himself to realize his husband's dream.
Likewise, Financial Tubey's husband, Mukesh Tubey, worked as Nayak in the army, survivored his mother's work and his wife's finance, joined the army.
There is no doubt that every citizen will have respect for this mother power and respect for these giants.
My dear countrymen, the Navaratri Festival and Deepawali have got a great opportunity for the younger generation of our country.
The World Cup for 17-year-old people is going to be held here.
I am confident that the football will be reflected on all four sides.
Each generation will be interested in football.
Everyone should be involved in this game that there are no youth who don't play football in the field of any school-color in India.
Come, let us make sports a part of our lives when all the world nations come to play on the soil of India.
My dear countrymen, Navaratri is going on.
This is the time to worship Mother Durga.
The environment is surprising with sacred pleasure.
There is a spiritual environment, a festival, a devotional environment all around
On this pilgrimage of Navaratri, I congratulate the people of the country, I request Mother Para Shakti to fulfill the desires and aspirations of the lives of the common people of the country and take the country to new peaks.
The country has to get the opportunity to face every challenge.
The country should move faster in 2022, when India is 75 years old, when it is 75 years old, it is an attempt to fulfill the dreams of freedom fighters, the mindset of 125 crore people, the uninterrupted labour, the uneasy power and the mindset of the 125 crore people, let us move ahead with the five-year programmes of a New India and give us the blessings of Mother Bara Shakti.
Best wishes to all of you.
Enter the movements and spread the dust.
This country is the birthplace of Lord Buddha and Gandhi, the birthplace of Sardar Patel, who has been associated with the entire nation for the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have glorified their lives for normally pursued life and for immunity and for our minds.
Ahimsa Paramodharma: We have also heard this word from our young age.
This diversity is not seen only in food habits, habitats and dressing clothes
This diversity is seen in every activity of life.
You must have seen that all our festivals have been organised in accordance with the nature schedule.
All this has a direct connection with nature.
Many of our festivals are associated with farmers and fishermen.
Today, when I talk to you about the festivals, I want to say that Michami is sad to all of you.
The Jains celebrated Samvatsariya yesterday.
Parushan Festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
Samvatsari is coming on the last day of the festival.
This is a marvellous tradition.
The day of Samvatsari is remarkable, Akimsai and Friendship.
The event is marked by the era of unity, equality and cleanliness.
Best wishes to all the people of the country for their children.
Now Om Festival is celebrated in Kerala.
Kerala's Om Festival is one of the most important festivals of India.
Now our festivals and tourism have become the cause of attraction.
I would like to tell the countrymen that this is a festival of navratri in Gujarat or a Durga Festival in Bengal, which is an event of tourism attraction in a way.
Our other festivals have also created an opportunity to attract foreign nationals.
We have to think of what else we can do in this direction.
Eid-ul-Suha is scheduled to attend the function in a few days.
At the same time, in a New India, festivals should be the factors of cleanliness.
Festivals and cleanliness are also connected in family life.
Preparation for the festival is to take care of cleanliness.
This is not a new thing for us, but it is important to change it into a social nature.
They apply colors, one puts vegetables, one puts paper pieces in it.
Every family is doing various types of applications.
In a way, the biggest training of environmental awareness has been found for the first time in this Ganesh festival.
We have started the Swachh Survekshan 3 years ago and will complete 3 years from 2nd October.
Its positive results are emerging.
The defecation coverage has increased from 39 percent to about 67 percent.
A special example of insisting on unity for cleanliness is not an example of inspiration for all, but by the people of Jammu Kashmir Ulema A Hind.
If the efforts made with dedication and dedication for cleanliness become our permanent nature then no one can achieve the peak of our country.
Whenever we get the opportunity, we will find out where we can get the opportunity.
But we all have to join it.
We consider it a kind of preparation ahead of Deepawali or preparation ahead of Navaratri or preparation ahead of Durga Puja.
We will serve physically.
We will work together on holidays or Sundays.
We will go to nearby areas and we will go to nearby villages but we can do all this as a movement.
I appeal to all government organisations, schools, colleges, socio-cultural-political leaders, government officials, district rulers and panchayat leaders - 15 days before the day of the birth of Gandhi Ji on October 2, we will create a cleaning environment, which is really an October 2 that Gandhiji dreamed of.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov
After the construction of the toilet, you can register your name and the name of those whom you have helped to set up toilets.
My socio-economic friends can expedite some constructive movements and enable you to create a vision to ensure work on the ground.
Through the commitment to purity, success in achieving cleanliness, the conceptual competitions will be held, which is organised by the Ministry of Water and Sanitation for column competition, simultaneous preparation competition, painting etc.
In this, you can write articles in many languages and there is no age.
You can make a small bag, you can prepare it on your mobile phone.
It is necessary to create a 2-3-minute short film and inspire cleaning.
I call upon all of you to join this movement related to cleanliness.
After organising this Swachh Survekshan for 15 days, when we celebrate the 2nd of October, we will see how much enjoyment will be given to the salute Gandhians.
Hundreds of thousands of letters write, reports, and many are telephoneing, which is a huge wealth treasury for me.
This is a great opportunity to understand the minds of the people of the country.
I am waiting for the news that you give me more than what you are waiting for the voice of the heart.
I am thirsty because everything of yours gives me an opportunity to learn.
Yeah, I've ever made such a mistake.
Sometimes we don't even know how much things change us naturally.
"Prime Minister, I speak from Poona to Aparna.
I want to talk to you about my friend
She's always trying to help everyone, but her action makes me confused.
Once I went to the business premises to buy things with her.
He spent 2000 rupees without any trouble buying a plant and then spent 450 rupees and bought Beetsa
But the auto driver used to come to the campus was seriously involved at a cost of Rs 5.
When he bought the vegetable on the way back, the deal spoke at every vegetable price and reduced it to Rs 4-5.
I'm very distressed.
We buy goods in big places without asking any questions and fighting with our brothers and sisters who are working hard.
After asking for this phone call, I am sure you might have been distressed, and you might have been sure that why I cannot walk like this anymore.
Have you ever seen what is going on in the mind of the poor
My young friends, on August 29, the entire country is going to celebrate all India sports day.
This is the birthday of Major Dayanchand ji, who is considered the Hockey sportsperson and Hockey sportsperson of the world.
Her contribution to Hockey was incomplete.
I recall the fact that the younger society of our country should connect themselves with sports.
Sports should be a part of our lives.
As we are the youngest country in the world, we have to reflect our youth in these sports grounds.
The sports provides physical, awakening mind and governance - what else is needed.
The sports is a way to connect the minds.
I urge the younger generations of our country to move forward in the sports world, which is more important than the sports equipment in today's calculation world.
All the FIFA calls can be played in the calculations, but I am seen playing a football in the field.
You can play cricket in the computer, but play under the sky in the field, its enjoyment is different.
At a time when all the children went out of the house and asked when the mother would return.
In today's era, how it has changed, when the children come home, they sit on a corner, start watching the cartoon film or get drowned in mobile camps.
There is no achievement in the field of sports, any child in the country, if they have the talent, they can give details of themselves or videos in this war.
The Sports Ministry will train selected and growing sportspersons and the Ministry will launch the Portal tomorrow.
In India, from 6th to 28th October, FIFA has been organised for World Call Babbal Coup for 17-year-old people.
24 teams from all over the world are coming to India.
Let us welcome young social entrepreneurs from many countries through sports and experience sports and create such an environment in the country.
While talking about sports, I want to share with you about the event that touched my heart in the last weeks.
Six such women are employed in the Navy.
Their emotions and their inspiration are inspiring to all of us.
These six women wealth and wealth are traveling to a small boat INS Tarringi and trying to cross the sea.
Navika Sagar Parikrama, i. e.
They will roam around the world and return to India after several months.
Sometimes it will spend about 40 days in water.
Sometimes it may have to be spent in water for nearly 30 days.
In the midst of the waves of the sea, our six women travel with sahas and this is the first time in the world.
I also create a way for their experiences in the NarendraModi App and organize you to study.
I am happy to share the experiences of these women wealth with you because it is a brave story, self-experiencing story.
My best wishes and good wishes to these women.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate the Teacher's Day on 5th September.
Former President of our country, Dr.
This is Radhakrishnan's birthday.
Though he was the President, he made himself a teacher throughout his life.
He always wanted to live a teacher.
He was devoted to education.
As a lawyer, as a prince, he was the President of India, but every moment he was a living teacher.
I remember him.
When we celebrate the Teacher's Day this time, can we all take a pledge together
Due to his efforts, the events that have succeeded in transforming the lives of every teacher will definitely be in the lives of every teacher.
If we make social efforts, we can transform our country into a bigger part of it.
Let us learn to see change, let us take this mantra forward.
Ananya Austi.
I live in Mumbai and work for the Indian Research Centre at Howard University.
As a inspector, I am particularly interested in financial inclusion, financial inclusion and related social projects.
I would like to ask you whether you have started your project in 2014, if India is more secure than the financially, whether the power is increasing, whether this power and facilities are expanding our women, farmers, workers, villages and slums have reached everything, tell the statistics.
My dear countrymen, the first minister Jan Dhan Yojana has been heard and financial inclusion has been a discussion not only in India but in the world of economies.
On August 28, 2014, I started this project with a dream in my mind.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) will be started tomorrow, August 28, and 3 years will be completed.
30 crore new families have been connected with it and bank accounts have been opened.
This is more than the number of people in many countries of the world.
Sometimes, if the money is in hand, whether it is in the bag or in the house, it will inspire you to spend the house.
65,000 crore rupees have been saved by our poor people through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
In a way, this collection of poor people will be their strength in the future.
Those who have opened their bank accounts through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will also get insurance benefits.
Today, a new belief has been created in the lives of those poor people by paying a very simple fee of Rs.
In many families, if the poor get a problem due to this one rupee fee, if the family member dies then the family gets Rs. 2 lakhs.
The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-Up Yojana and Stand-Up Yojana - be it beneficiaries of tribals, women, educated youth, be it youths living in their own footsteps, crores of such youths have been guided by the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, without any bondage from banks.
They are not only standing in their own feet, but also in successful efforts to provide jobs to one or two people.
During the last few days when some people from the banking sector came to meet me, they said that when they had done a survey of how people have benefitted from their schemes, insurance schemes, RUPA cards and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, they have got many inspirational things.
I will take all my efforts to bring them to your notice
The media also includes the events that can be fully used.
They can also negotiate with such persons and create a new sympathy for the new generation.
My dear countrymen, once again you all have a lot of sadness.

The rainy season takes place for people's minds.
Animals, birds, plants and nature all grow with the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when this rain is very heavy, we know how much destructive it is from the water.
Natural mother gives us life, boosts us all, but sometimes natural disasters like floods, landslides and their anger cause greater destruction.
Changing climate and environmental change have adversely affected.
For the past few days, natural disasters had to be faced in some parts of India, particularly in Assam, North East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal due to heavy rains.
Complete surveillance measures are being taken in the flood affected areas.
State governments are also making great efforts to help the people suffering from floods.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and service-winning citizens are doing their best to help the people in this situation.
Consequently, cattle wealth, infrastructure, roads, electricity and communication systems are all affected.
In particular, in order to succumb to the impact of our agricultural brothers and their crops, we have been implementing the schemes for the insurance companies, especially the crop insurance companies, to quickly meet the demand for farmers' compensation.
At the same time, 1078, a 24-hour-long aid to deal with the floods, is fully operational.
People are showing their hardships in this regard.
Prior to the start of the rainy season, the training system was conducted in the majority areas and the entire government machine was prepared.
The National Disaster Response Forces were shut down.
In many places, they were trained to create an autonomous organisation, what to do and what to do, how to determine self-sufficiently, how to create a people's organisation, how to work in such a situation.
Nowadays, the weather has already been calculated, technology has grown more and space science plays an important role in calculating it, which gives us almost the right calculation.
Gradually, according to the climate prediction, we have to transform our actions into a natural way to protect us from the impact of disasters.
Whenever I prepare myself for the sound of my heart, I can see the people of our country putting themselves in the work of preparing for it.
This time there have been several letters and phone calls on goods and services tax
Even now people have expressed their happiness and expectations about this goods and service tax.
I would like to listen to this telephone call: Greetings, Prime Ministers, I express my heartfelt condolences from Kurgaon, that is Gurugram.
Do you have the consequences when you've spent a month
I want to know your thoughts about this, thank you.
It has been nearly a month since the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax, the benefits have started to come to light.
I see how this new infrastructure has been affected in the transport and services sector.
Items are also going very fast.
Despite this facility, it has also strengthened the economic pace in particular.
Due to the earlier taxation, the majority of the resources and documents of the transport and service sector have been spent in maintaining the documents and every state had to create new rooms for their own.
This tax, which I say is good and easy tax, has actually made a very positive impact on our economy in a very short span of time.
The speed at which a transformation has taken place, the speed at which a transformation has emerged, the new records have been recorded, all these have created a new trust across the country.
In many of the world universities, it will be a model study.
Because in such a big way, this big change can be considered as a success in the country with the pride of crores of people and successful implementation of this system in such a big country.
ST
All states have shares and responsibility in implementing the Act.
All decisions have been taken in a unanimous manner by the States as the Union Government.
What was the price of something that was mentioned by the secretary before this reconstruction and how it was after the new renovation, all are available in your mobile phones.
This is a historic victory, an ancient achievement.
This is also a social reform movement.
I see my Kodanukodi countrymen and my Kodanukodi bowls that have made such a great effort very naturally successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August marks the revolution.
Obviously, we have heard about this thing from a childhood, and this is the reason why the collaboration movement started on August 1, 1920.
And then on 9th August, 1942, the white evacuation movement started, and we know that it is the August Revolution
Next August, 1947, the country was freed.
In a way, several events in August are particularly associated with the history of freedom.
This year we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Swachh Survekshan.
But he presented the slogan that it was white.
Some people know that Yusuf Mehr Ali.
Our new generations should know what happened on 9th August, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, all the historical aspects of the countrymen had to inspire us to build a glorious India, with the enthusiasm of connecting them with the freedom struggle, binding them and oppressing them.
What can be more proud than the sacrifices, penance and dedication of our freedom fighters
White itself is the most important struggle for the freedom movement of India.
This struggle made the entire country pledge to get rid of the British rule.
During that period, the British had joined hands with each other in every corner of Hindustan, villages, cities, readers, uneducated, poor and rich people, and participated in a white struggle against the British regime.
The anger of the people was at the height.
Listening to the chambers of the Gandhians, millions of people took the mantra of Karing or Chetumadi in my heart and in my heart, carrying forward the struggle.
Millions of young people of the country have sacrificed their lessons and books in the free race.
The universe of freedom was sounded and they went ahead.
The important role played by the dignitaries like Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan.
The collaborative movement of 1920 and the outcome movement of the White in 1942 shines both the different corners of the Gandhians.
The dimension of collaboration was different, and in 1942, however, the freedom struggle had increased, a mantra like Gandhians would have to be presented.
The freedom struggle, which began in 1857, continues every year in some part of the country by 1942.
This long-term period had created an independent candidate in the hearts of the people of the country.
Everyone was sure to do something.
Tensions have changed, but there is no delicateness in the mood.
People continued to come, deployed themselves, went, and the new ones came, they joined themselves, tried to encircle the British regime and count it in the country.
From 1857 to 1942, this struggle had created a new situation and brought this situation to the height of 1942.
The universe shouted that it was white and within 5 years the British had to leave the country in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, the freedom struggle reached all the people.
These five years, from 1942 to 1947, were the reasons for liberation of the country.
These 5 years are their determined years.
Now I want to link you with this account.
We were free in 1947.
Today we are in 2017.
About 70 years have passed.
The governments have come.
Organisations have grown, changed, grown and grown.
Everyone tried their own ways to solve the country from its problems.
Efforts have been made to improve employment generation, eradicate poverty and develop in the country.
Efforts were made in their own ways.
He also got successes.
We have to celebrate the 15th of August this year as a ninth day of the week and the 75th anniversary of the country's independence in 2022.
In the memory of the 125 crore people of the country on 9th August, the Revolution Day, on 15th August, everybody should be sure that as a personal person, as a immigrant, I will do this amount for the country, as a family, as a society, as a city, as a state-of-the-art department.
Hundreds of people have to be killed.
Efforts should be made to fulfil such promises.
Just as 5 years from 1942 to 1947 have been a decisive year to ensure the freedom of the country, similarly, these 5 years from 2017 to 2022 will be able to determine the future of India.
We are celebrating 5 years after 75 years of independence.
Every citizen, every social organisation, local organisations, schools, colleges and various organisations will take some pledge to build a New India.
This will ensure that our commitment succeeds in the next 5 years.
What goal should we reach as a country
What can be my contribution as an individual
You can use technology, take forward all the sights, posts, plastics, articles and new ideas.
Let us turn this movement into a mass movement.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will be contesting for young social friends to leave the white one.
An attempt is made to compete with this question, to connect young people with the glorious history of the country and to know about the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am confident that you will spread and spread this message well.
My dear countrymen, on August 15, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort as the Prime Minister of the country.
I am an instrument.
I read them and I will try to express these things on the 15th of August.
An accusation was made before me that the speeches made by me last three times on August 15 were a little longer.
I do not know whether I can do it or not.
But I have the idea of trying this time to make my speech briefly.
Whether I get success in this film or not.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to talk to you about another thing.
India's economy includes a social economy.
We should never underestimate it.
Our festivals and our festivals are not just the occasions of happiness.
Our festivals and celebrations are also a movement for social revival.
And yet, each of our pavilion has a direct connection with the economic life of the poor.
A few days later, Rakshabandhan, Krishna Jayanti, then Balya Chaturthi, then Saudhchandra, then Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja and Deepawali will come together.
These connect individuals and society.
The natural journey between the two continues.
Ah, that is, from the point of view of me, we have a chance to move forward.
As an economic situation, many families have started preparing rocks as a small dwelling industry even months before the Raksha Bandhan festival.
Several types of rocks are made from pulses to layers
But today people have started wanting more of the rocks made at home.
It has a direct connection with the poor handicrafts manufacturing tiny arsenal lights.
But today, when I talk about the festivals and the economic condition of the poor people associated with them, I want to clarify the environment.
Sometimes I see that the people of the country are more aware and positive than me.
For the last one month, awakening citizens are writing letters to me about the environment.
You have requested me to talk about the children who are fit for the environment at the earliest, and to increase the desire for the children made on the soil.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to such awakening people for the first time.
At the same time, it is our commitment to create soil-produced children in an environment-friendly manner to protect the environment.
This time I have already said
I express my heartfelt congratulations to all the people of the country for their forthcoming various festivals and festivals.
Over the past few days, our women and women have performed a magnificent activity in the Cricket World Cup.
This week they got the opportunity to meet everyone.
I am very happy to interact with them, but I realized that they were pressing the burden that they could not win the World Cup.
The pressure on their faces, the crisis shipped.
I gave a different assessment on my quality to those women.
See, today's time is the media world, the expectations are over, the extent to which success is not achieved, it turns into anger
If India's sportspersons are defeated, we have seen the anger of the country in many sportspersons.
Without this, they congratulated the women for their achievements and honoured them.
In fact, the younger generations of our country, especially women, are engaged in many matters of pride in the country.
Once again, I congratulate the young people, especially our women, my heartfelt congratulations.
We all have to take the country towards new peaks and take it.
Come, let us travel together and let us travel by doing something.
We will move ahead with the hope that the future of the country will be very important.
Thank you very much.
The weather is changing.
After the rains, the cold wind has provided some relief from the heat of summer in the past.
Whatever the people faced in life, however crisis, we feel that individual life, in public life, in the coming of rain, there is a positive change in the mood of all of us.
Bhagwan connects the poor people of the country with Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
There is a word of juggernaut in English, which means a special chariot that no one can stop.
On seeing Agarathy, the word 'Jakarnaut' is known to have produced Jagannath's chariot.
On seeing all this, we can understand how the world has accepted this glory in their own ways.
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath, I congratulate all the people of the country and my best wishes to Lord Jagannath on the thirty-thirds of his life.
Come on, let us all together inspire from this holy festival and share the treasure of happiness and take the country forward on the path of development.
In this sacred month of Ramlan, we have come to the notice of a great sympathetic event from the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
There are about 3500 Islamic brothers and sisters living with their families in this small village, a large number of brothers and sisters of Islamic families.
In this month of Ramlan, the villagers decided to build toilets together.
Therefore, they have asked you to spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for changing this holy occasion of Ramlan for social well-being.
We know that Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared free from open defecation.
This week, Uttaranchal and Aryana have been declared as unprecedented states.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the administration of these 5 states, the rulers and the people.
We know that if we want to do something better in private life or in social life, we have to work harder.
If we think that if our signature is bad, we should correct it, then we should try it with great awakening for a long time.
Only then will it become a habit physically and mentally.
Similarly, some other bad habits are natural.
We need to attract everybody's attention.
We must recall the inspirational events.
I am glad that cleanliness is not going to stand at the level of the government today.
This has been transformed into a movement of people's society.
This happened in the Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
What's its goal
In 100 hours, toilets are being constructed at 10,000 houses in 71 Gram Panchayats.
My countrymen, you will be happy to note that the public and the government have succeeded in constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
They come through letters and through Akashwani.
Prakash Tribhadhi ji recalled the urgency and said that on June 25, the history of the people is the greatest crown.
The awakening of Prakash Triple Talaq was praiseworthy to them, not just an organisation but also a culture.
At the same time, we have to take forward the good things of the democratic system.
On June 25, 1975, it is a dark night, which no one can forget easily.
No Indian can expel it.
All the leaders of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were imprisoned in prisons.
Today, the students of the media world and all those who work in the democratic system are constantly trying to remind them of the crucial period.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
As soon as the country was declared emergency, Atal ji wrote a poem, in that poem, describing the atmosphere in the country during that period.
We have to make this tradition more guaranteed.
My dear countrymen, today every Indian faces great pride.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world became Yoga.
Everyone from water to mountain welcomed by sun rays and yoga in the morning.
Today, Yoga is not a bridge connecting the world, but it is a bridge connecting the world.
Almost all the countries of the world have transformed the opportunity to provide Yoga to them.
More than 4,000 people in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, were engaged in yoga in China's magnitude and the world heritage site of Machu Bichu, at a height of 2400 metres above the sea level.
In Afghanistan's Herah, the Indian Offensive Friendship, in the Salma Dam, organized a new grammar for friendship.
Even at a smaller place like Singapore, they organized the programme for 70 places and for a week.
This time again Yoga has achieved a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have worked together and made a new world record.
I also got a chance to talk about Yoga in Lucknow.
But for the first time in the rainy season, it was also a good opportunity for Yoga.
Our soldiers were engaged in Yoga art even in Siachen, which is 20, 25 and 40 degrees.
Our army, Border Security Forces, Indian Tibetan Border Police Forces, Central Reserve Police Forces, Central Industrial Defence Forces, all of whom have committed their duties and practiced Yoga.
Since this is the 3rd International Yoga Day, I had requested the family of 3 generations to participate in the film and share with me.
Some television channels also went ahead with this.
Many of my people had sent photographs and some of them have been summed up in the selected Narendra Modi App.
Hon'ble Prime Minister, I am from Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
Anil Sonara speaks.
I recall that in the recent past, you have said in Kerala that instead of blooming at different places, you will give good books to memories.
We cannot do anything to implement this idea throughout the country.
I liked it very much.
I am reminded of a thing that escaped from my memory.
Because when I was in Gujarat, we had created a way to provide no more corners, to give books or to welcome them.
And we also provide the doorsteps because it can encourage the doorsteps.
When I was in Gujarat, it had become a habit, but since I came from there, this habit has been released.
But when I went to Kerala, I got awakened again.
But when we give books, it becomes a part of the house and becomes a member of the family.
We can welcome even if we give the card cards, do you know how many poor people are helpful
Expenditure and deficit are also useful.
These things have a historic significance.
When I went to England last year, UK ueen Elizabeth had invited me to the festival in London city.
He brightened a light in his eyes, when I was married, Gandhiji congratulated me and expressed his condolences that he had examined this handicraft.
Over the years, Elizabeth Rani had defended the handicappedness of the Gandhians.
A small love of Gandhiji has become part of his life and has become part of his history.
These habits don't turn into nights and in such a way, criticism has to be ruled.
At the same time, such interactions should be made and efforts should be made.
For this, whenever I go somewhere, if someone comes out, I will not refuse to do that.
The criticisms will only cry, we have to say again and again, there will be a change.
My countrymen, there are many privileges as the Prime Minister of the country.
I am making a habit, even if I have to be immersed in the anger, that is, by reading something in my letters, I am setting up an opportunity to connect with the common people.
There are several letters and many different people write letters to me.
I feel that it is necessary to share a letter that I read a few days ago with you.
Therefore, under the Mudra Yojana, I have started the work of getting money from the bank and buying some goods from the market.
In the meanwhile, I looked at the Government of India E-Marketplace and the Government e-Marketplace.
Those who want to give something to the government - if they think of selling anything like electric pulses, pulses, pulses, chairs and tables, they can register themselves on this platform.
It is compulsory to take care of what kind of goods he has, what he can sell at, and the government departments should go to this base and take care of who is providing affordable and quality goods.
Similarly, all the departments of the government are monitoring who are registering in the E-GEM.
Due to lack of intermediaries, goods are available at cheap prices.
This is an opportunity to encourage the entrepreneur.
There is also a lack of light, which has power and entrepreneurship.
Those who want to sell their goods to the government, I want to register themselves on this Internet in large numbers.
My dear countrymen, while we are proud of Yoga, the achievements that we have made in space science are immersed in our hearts.
The greatest speciality of India is that while our footsteps are connected with Yoga on earth, we are dreaming of touching far-flung applications.
In the past, India has achieved a great achievement in sports and science.
Today, India is not only on earth but also on applications.
Two days ago, the Indian Space Research Institute of ISRO has successfully achieved 30 satellites along with Cartosat-2 satellites.
Apart from India, these satellites include about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States.
The NANO satellite movement of India will be immensely helpful in achieving information related to agriculture and natural sediments.
1000 days passing is an important milestone in our scientific journey.
Now we can see that our youngsters are getting more progressed in the field of sports.
Besides education, they are conscious of their future in the field of sports.
The country is proud of our sportspersons, their efforts and their achievements.
Recently, India's footminton sportsperson, Kidambi Srikanth ji, won the Indonesia Opinion Festival and honoured the nation.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to him and his guests for this achievement.
T.
In the entire governance development, sports play a major role.
There is no shortage of skills in the country.
If children are engaged in sports in our family too, we should give them the opportunity.
And thou shalt not drive them out of the plain, and put them into the room, and read.
And let him read, and let him improve in that, but let him be encouraged, if he had more talent and willingness in sports, that he may be in school, college, family, and in complications.
Everyone has to dream of attending the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, it has been a time to create new experiences during the rainy season and continuous movements.
Once again, I express my best wishes to all of you and join you in the voice of the next Mann Ki Baat.
The summer temperature this year is an unforgettable experience.
At the same time we are expecting rain.
When I am talking to you today, Ramlan has started the holy month.
On this auspicious month of Ramlan, I express my heartfelt congratulations to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the people of Islamic society.
In the month of Ramlan, there is considerable importance for prayer, spirituality and devotion.
It is a matter of great pride that 125 crore people of our country have all the time in the world in India.
We should be grateful to our forefathers that our forefathers have built this great heritage.
There are those who believe in God, those who deny God in this country, those who worship God, those who worship the idol, those who oppose the worship of the idol.
The art of uniting diverse thoughts, diverse rituals and diverse traditions has been contributed with our spirit.
Be it time, methods, principles and traditions - all this is the only message that they give us - peace, solidarity and goodwill.
This sacred Ramlan month will help us move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony.
I once again congratulate all of you.
I am happy that many people have registered their backgrounds.
Everyone wants to share their experiences personally with me with enthusiasm.
"I am talking to Teksha Kad.
I've been able to read in the holidays when the habit of reading is almost freed from me.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how many sacrifices and struggles had to be implemented for freedom of India and how many fighters had experienced prisons.
The life of Bhagat Singh, which has made me the biggest achievement in the youngest age, has inspired me, therefore, I urge you to give a message to the present generation about this.
I am glad that the younger society is keen to learn about our history, about our freedom fighters, about the physical, material and spiritual sacrifices for this country.
Innumerable civilians have lost their youth in prisons.
Many youths have jumped the rocks with their faces.
We can breathe the breath of our freedom fighters today because they have experienced everything that they say.
All the dignitaries who spent their time in the freedom struggle, wrote, read, did all the great things and their writings also played a very important role in giving freedom to India.
Several years ago, I had visited the Cellular Jail in Andaman Nicobar.
Today, the birthday of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a book called Maji Janmade in jail.
He wrote poems on the prison walls.
They shut him in a small room.
Do you know what the freedom fighters have suffered
After I read the book, Maji Janmadeh, who was written by Savarkar, I was inspired to see the Cellular Jail.
They are organising a sound light scene, which is very inspiring.
The so-called Kalapani, the Andaman Nicobar individuals were from all the states who sacrificed their youth in prison, all the language speakers of India and met many miseries.
My dear countrymen, on 5th June, the first Monday of the month.
Well, what does it mean to connect with nature
As far as I am concerned, we have to join us, we have to join us.
If we create a connectivity with nature, create a special land.
Who can express it better than Gandhiji.
Gandhiji once said that one must care about a world one will not see, it is our duty to look at the unseen world that we cannot see.
You might also have experienced that Nature has the power
Perhaps you've been very tired, you can imagine what you have achieved in your face if you snatch the water on your face.
The new energy emerges when we connect our body with the five geographies.
Therefore, on 5th June, the world-class movement that connects nature should be a movement to connect with us.
Vedas have shown earth and environment on the basis of power.
The entire guidance of the environment provides to us in a way that is a thousand years old book.
: - Mother Earth: Putro Ahm Prithvia: This is a case in our country.
It is said in the scriptures that the cleanliness that we have is due to the earth.
In our country, many festivals, many pilgrimage systems - those who do not die, those who don't live, those who don't live, those who don't live, those who don't live, those who don't live, those who don't live, those who don't live, those who don't live, those who don't live, those who don't live in the village.
However, it is necessary for us to understand it in comprehensive terms, in coordination with modern ideas.
I have a lot of news from the states.
In almost all the states, a big campaign of tree plantation begins as soon as the rain comes.
Crores of trees are being planted.
We should also play a very important role in plantation work during this rainy season.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, it has become a day of well-known identity throughout the world.
Everyone in the world celebrates this as World Yoga Day.
In June 21, in the shortest phase of the world as World Yoga Day, it is spread all over the world, connecting the people of the world.
On the one hand, while the separatist powers in the world show their terrible faces, India's greatest gift to the world is Yoga.
Through Yoga, we can connect the world with one another.
Just as Yoga connects the physical, mental, intellectual and the soul, Yoga can connect the world with Yoga.
Today, due to lifestyle, due to urgency, due to rising responsibilities, life has become bigger because of stress.
We see that this situation has also happened in a young age.
During the period of taking unreasonable medicines and passing the days, Yoga will be a disaster for us to live a stress-free life.
Animal Yoga guarantees both welfare and physical activity.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible only through yoga if we want to experience such an inclusive journey, how to take a healthy journey through physical, mental thoughts and habits.
Two days ago, letters have been written to all the governments and all the leaders of the world before Yogyak.
Last year I had announced some competitions and some awards related to Yoga.
Gradually, work is going on in this direction.
I congratulate the people who have given this basic advice and have been advised.
This is a very interesting thing.
He has asked me whether the next 3rd International Yoga Day will be organised in collaboration with three generations of the family.
Three generations like grandparents, grandparents, sons and daughters can work together and welcome the film to do so.
Tomorrow, it will be a magnificent combination of Yoga as a day and will have a new dimension for Yoga.
Tomorrow, it will be a film tomorrow, which will give guarantees for a bright future.
I'm calling you all.
In the last three weeks of International Yoga Day, start the training from today.
And share your share with you about Yoga, spread and connect people.
In a way, it is a health care movement that will prevail.
I call you all the Internet in this.
From that day onwards, I have visited different parts of India.
I am very happy to note what Modi did.
An interesting telephone call came to me and I didn't think of the point of view of what was spoken in it.
But thank you for creating such a different perspective.
I believe that this phone call will happen to you as well.
"Congratulations Modi Ji, I speak from Mumbai to Naina.
I often see that Modi ji, wherever you are going, people there are more focusing on cleanliness on television and social networks.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have listened to your call and have been moving towards the movement of cleanliness as a social movement.
On the one hand, there has been awareness about cleanliness among children.
Several times I have seen that their elders are supposed to be dirty on the streets.
After inaugurating the cleanliness-related movement in the valleys of Kashi, you have been inspired by yourself and it has been devastated.
You say that it is true, wherever I am going, the government machine is doing cleanliness work, but now it is becoming a clean movement even in the society.
5 days, 7 days and 10 days before I go, a lot of cleaning work is going on.
A few days back, I had visited the Kutch region of Gujarat.
There was a massive cleanliness movement.
I didn't see it connected, but only after this phone call came to me, yes, I guessed that this thing was right.
It is a matter of great pleasure that it is possible to take all other products to welcome the Prime Minister, but it is a matter of great pleasure to give importance to cleanliness.
This is a joy to anyone who wants cleanliness. It is encouraging.
I extend my best wishes to all those who strengthen the cleanliness work.
One has given me a suggestion.
It's a humourful advice.
There is a good idea but I have to think about it.
It is very important that I will remove these tons of garbage instead of paying tributes to the goods.
With the help of the State Governments of India, the Government of India has decided to conduct a massive campaign on waste management with the help of city representatives.
On June 5, the world Environment Day is going to provide necessary material to collect solid waste and liquid waste in about 4000 cities of the country.
Two types of bubbles are to be provided, one green and the other blue.
There are two types of waste materials - one liquid waste, another dry waste.
We have to follow the order, in 4000 cities, the bags are going to be placed and the dry wastes should be put in the blue bag and the liquid wastes should be placed in the green bag.
In dinner wastes, the vegetables should be put on the green kubble thieves, the surplus food, the eggs and the leaves of the trees.
If we remember the colorful greenery of the fields, it will be reminded of what to put on the green huts.
The second type of pulp includes several items such as paper pulses, card boxes, iron stuff, glass pieces, clothing, plastic, polythene, broken pulses, rubber materials, metals, etc.
Just a few days back, a thing has come to the fore and Versova beach, considered to be a dirty beach in Mumbai, has become a clean and beautiful beach today.
For this purpose, Afroz Shah gave him the UN Environment Programme - the UNEP, the largest award.
He is the first Indian to receive the Champions of the Earth Award.
My dear countrymen, for the past 15 days, there have been articles and discussions and analysis in newspapers and TV channels and social media about the 3-year process of the current government.
Three years ago, you have given me the responsibility of the chief servant.
One survey has been conducted and a number of polls have come.
I see all this as a very healthy symptom.
The last three years have been addressed in every address.
People from all walks of life have also studied it.
This is a special performance in the democratic system.
My obvious and crucial view that the governments in the Democracy should be dedicated to the people of Makeser.
I express my gratitude to all those who have spent time deliberately analyzed our work, suggested and supported and expressed their deficiencies.
I express my gratitude to those who have given important receptions to memorable.
Whatever crimes are there, it is only when it is expressed that there is a possibility of deteriorating.
The work can be good, less benefits can be feared, worse, whatever it is, it can be improved through it.
The positive criticism strengthens the democratic system.
For the awakening country, this analysis and research is very important for a well-known nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you, everything is bad as an ordinary dweller, just like a simple dweller.
Some people have seen Mann Ki Baat in a lengthy conversation, some criticise it in political perspective, but I do not even remember that the event called Mann Ki Baat will change me as a member of every family of India, after a long experience.
In the middle of a family, I feel like sitting in the house and talking about household matters.
I am grateful to the President, the Vice President and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, all those who have been in such a high position have given their golden time and have given importance to the voice of mankind.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has created a new dimension to me.
Some of our friends spoke to me sometimes when they were working on the book Mann Ki Baat.
I'm borrowing Akbar Sahab.
My dear countrymen, the next time we meet, the rains have come everywhere in the country, the weather has changed, the results of the elections have come and the educational learning has started.
Come, let us all together move ahead in this environment and love nature.
My best wishes to all of you.
Every time such powerful instruments come in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, a detailed study is being done on the government level.
What kind of complaints is the experience of the people
We can generally see that it is human nature to give suggestions to others.
It is natural for us to suggest that if someone gets coughed when we travel by trains and buses, if someone gets afflicted with such a thing then it is natural to suggest that someone should do it immediately.
Initially, when Mann Ki Baat was consulted, it was said that it might be a habit to many, but when we tried to approach it, I actually floated in a very happy flood.
After I pointed out that in the Prime Minister Modi's Office, do you know what was the use of new methods to stop everything from the corners of the country from eating food, from the corners of the country
I don't even think that the young generations of our country have been working in this process for a long time.
We know that some social organisations are being done for years, but the youth of my country have been engaged in it.
Many people have sent me videos.
Broadcasting is being conducted in many places.
People pay their roti in the bank, they bring vegetables from their parcel, whoever they need and get them.
There is no need to think of the person who is happy and who goes to the shop.
This is an example of how to work collaboratively in society.
Today is the last day of April.
The Foundation Day of Gujarat and Maharashtra is coming in the month of May.
On this occasion, my best wishes to the people of both the states on behalf of me.
The two states have been striving to achieve new developmental peaks and have contributed to the progress of the country.
There has been a continuous emergence of great men in both the states and their lives have been inspiring us in every sector of the society.
In memory of these great men, on the day of the inauguration of the states, in 2022, when we are going to be 75 years old, we should ensure that our states, our country, our society, our city and our family will be enhanced.
We have to move forward in collaboration with all citizens to fulfill this commitment.
I once again congratulate the people of both these states.
Eco-system change was a matter of being spoken only at the level of academics and seminars, but today, in our daily life, we are feeling it and jealous.
Nature has changed the rules of its lap.
In the month of May-June, we have experienced this time in the month of March-April.
While I was reviewing the suggestions of the people for the voice of mind, there were more suggestions about what we should do in the summer.
Everything is known and not new, but it is very beneficial to re-considering them at the right time.
Prasand Kumar Mishra, T.
In Balkani, they have been told to keep water on the upper floors.
I have also seen small boys in the family doing this special thing.
If they replied that why water should be filled, they will be able to see if they have ten times a day and if they have water in the vessel.
Not only this, the birds come and drink water, but they are watching their eyes carefully.
We can see this as a sports actually, but indeed, the experience of compassion is inspiring in those backgrounds.
Music life with birds and birds and nature in our country is natural, but it is important to strengthen our nervous systems, but at the same time it is important to strengthen our efforts at the social level.
As I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I was 100 years old for Dharmaguru Saintna Saheb of Daudi Bohra society.
He lived for 103 years.
In order to celebrate his 100 years of age, the people of Bohra community conducted a massive campaign to save the grooms through the Purihani Trust.
Kinnars also got a place in the world records book.
Sometimes we are so busy, we also forget to ask if someone who comes to our hometown as a dairy, a dairy, a dairy seller or a dairy.
My young friends, I want to exchange some things with you.
Sometimes I am very worried that many of our young generations want to live in a comfortable place, in a wealthy circle.
Mothers and fathers are encouraging them safely.
There are also others, but most people are in the circle of property.
Now the results have been completed and you have laid down the projects to spend the holidays.
After the heat is over, the summer holiday will be slightly sweet.
I give you three suggestions to use the holidays properly, if you do three of them then you will be special but I am trying to do something.
Let us take a new experience and try to achieve a new capabilities and decide to go to a place where no one is unaware, unknowingly, unknowingly.
New places, new experiences and new capacities will be available.
The test should be positive, come out of your property circle.
We are from the middle class families and are happy family members.
In the evening, take your cattle or jaggery or take other sports products and go to the dwellings of the poor.
You will feel that you will be able to get the pleasure of playing with the poor kids.
Do you think that when you get the joy of playing with the children in such a poor society, how much change will happen in their lives
If you go once, your mind will be willing to go there again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Several autonomous organisations are in service.
Make yourself connected with the guru of the guys and connect you with an organisation for 15 days and 20 days.
Sometimes summer camps will be held, governance development camps will be held, several types of constructive camps will be held and connect you with them.
After you have been elected by participating in such camps, teach the poor people who have no chance of learning them as a service free and free.
You can teach them how to do it.
Although technology is considered to be far-reaching and breaking the borders, the adverse effects of this are scratching my mind.
Six people are sitting in the same room, but could not even imagine the distance between them.
Why
Everyone has been ruined because of technology.
Social nature is a good value, social nature is a energy.
The other thing I said is the skills, don't your mind want to learn something new
Sometimes there is also a fear that our younger generation has turned into robes.
Friends, The dreams that we see in our lives are good things.
But we should not keep in mind the human beings that are inside us, we should keep in mind that we don't move away from our humanity.
Can we not pay attention to skill development
A little away from technology, we are trying to spend time with us.
If you don't know swimming, you can learn swimming, you can pick up the paintings, you can't get the best fashion, but you can't get the swimming in the paper
The feelings inside you will start reflecting in it.
You will feel that all these capabilities and these actions will give you happiness, not only will the dams built on one side of yourself.
Do something different, my friends
This is your opportunity to build your lives.
After all the selections were completed, if you thought I'd imagine all this after coming to a new stage in your business then that opportunity would not have happened to you.
And that is why I want to tell you whether there is a Magic learning country or learn a piece of piece of piece.
Please do this to your friends.
If something you don't know, try to learn it, it will definitely benefit you.
Awaken the positive energy inside you, which will create an excellent base for development.
I share my experience with you, my friends, we cannot even imagine how many things we need to learn in the world.
There are many new places, new cities, new villages and new circles.
Don't think of traveling too much.
Go and spend 3-4 days there and then go to the next place and spend 3-4 days there.
This will give you a lot of things to learn.
Friends, This time the Government of India has given you a great opportunity.
The new generations have almost released a lot of transactions.
You are involved in this, but you can earn through this scheme, you know about a scheme of the Government of India
But someone else can recommend it.
You can connect others with it, if that new person does 3 transactions then you will get 10 rupees for this.
10 rupees will be added to your government level.
If you say that you have collected 20 people a day, you will be able to get 200 rupees in the evening.
Businessmen can earn through this and students also get income.
The project will be till 14th October.
Give you your contribution to creating digital India.
You are the defendants of New India.
I received a very interesting call.
"Prime Minister, I am speaking from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, Shiva Saube.
I want to talk about the bright red light.
I don't want to be stuck in the traffic crisis, nor do I have to wait for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for this decision made by you.
The government's decision to eradicate red light is an organisational step.
But this culture, which is inspired in mind, has to be rooted out.
If we all work together with awakening, we can get rid of it.
My aim was clear when I said - Avery Barson Is Important, everyone is important.
If we accept the importance of the people of 125 crore people, we understand the importance of the people of 125 crore people, then the greatest energy will be to realize the great dreams.
We all have to do this together.
This year, we all celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the great Ramanujacharya, 125 crore people of the country.
Because of some reason, we have stuck on the holes, we have been very small and we have become more likely to think about the centuries.
The centenary of other countries in the world is also considered very important.
Just imagine.
Even today, it is difficult to break out social conditions.
How could it have been a thousand years ago
Some people knew that Ramanjujar had created a big fight against the situation of caste and the feeling of the swords of the society that were upper and deep.
Whom the society considers to be unprovoked, who has been suppressed and performed through his actions.
He organised a campaign to enter his temple thousands of years ago and successfully entered the temple.
The Government of India will also release a postal head to mark the remembrance of Shri Ramanujacharya on 1st May, 2018.
I salute the Holy Ramanujacharya and showcase my devotional flowers.
My dear countrymen, there is another significance in the month of May, tomorrow.
In many parts of the world, it is adopted as a day of labour.
While talking about the day of labour, there is talk of labour and the workers, and I naturally remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today, we are thankful to Baba Saheb for the privileges and respect he has received for the workers.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the labourers is unforgettable.
Today, when we talk about Baba Saheb, we have got the opportunity to recall the great saint and social reformer Jagatguru Passweshwar, who lived in the 12th century.
There was also a chance to release the gathering of his phone calls.
In the 12th century, he published deep comments on labor and workers in Kannada.
In Kannada, he said, 'Kaya Kave Kailash' means that you can only achieve the handicraft of Lord Shiva through hard work, that is, only by doing the work, the heavens can fall.
While talking about the labourers, it is natural to remember Tatobandh Tangdi.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we have to celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha all over the world are happy to celebrate this festival.
In view of the violence, war, destruction and arms conflict that the world faces today, Lord Buddha's views are very appropriate.
Buddhism is an excellent example by breaking the life of Asoka in India.
This magnificent day of Buddha Purnima is celebrated by the United Nations Vishakhapatnam.
This year it will be held in Sri Lanka.
On this sacred day, I am glad to dedicate my tributes to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Especially for our neighbouring countries.
We believe that our neighbours should be musical and they should also move forward.
There are many potential.
India is scheduled to launch South Asian Artificial Intelligence on 5th May.
The skills and facilities of this artificial intelligence will provide substantial support to the economic and development activities in South Asia.
This is an excellent example of our endeavour towards South Asia.
On every corner of the country, many families have joined the preparations for the selection of their children.
Today, 26th March.
We are proud to be the richest of all of us, including Rabindranath Tagore and his memories.
The Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919 was slaughtered, while Rabindranath Tagore was one of the giants who made an Ongi voice against the massacre.
The murder had a deep impression on a balcony of twelve years old.
Just three days before today, on March 23, Bhagat Singh and his comrades, Sukdev and Rajguru, were pushed by the British.
On the 23rd of March, when this sad incident took place, there was no fear of death on the faces of the martyrs like Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru, who had been hurt by Mother India.
All the dreams of life were blessed for the freedom of Mother India.
These three are still encouraging us all.
We cannot describe the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru in words.
The entire British empire also looked at these three.
They were imprisoned and sentenced to death, but the British were worried about how to deal with them.
Several years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I felt a shock on that soil.
Whenever you get the opportunity, I urge the youth of the country to go to the place where the monks of Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, Rajguru, Bhagdeshwar Dutt are present.
It was a period of freedom struggle and its intensity.
On the one hand, the soldiers like Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru were encouraging the youth to take up the revolution of arms.
About 100 years ago, in April, 1917, Gandhiji had taken Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha.
The expression of Gandhijis thoughts and methods of Gandhiji's freedom struggle of India was first emerged in Champaran.
It was a turning point in the freedom struggle, especially from the perspective of the means of struggle.
Champaran Satyagraha, Cata Satyagraha and Mill labour strike in Ahmedabad, which began to deeply impact the thoughts and methods of the Gandhians.
Gandhiji returned from abroad in 1915 and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot assess Champaran Satyagraha with the thoughts of Gandhiji in our minds.
Just imagine that one who returned to India in 1915, experienced only two years...
He highlighted a wonderful power through the integration of Gandhiji through Champaran Satyagraha, the ability to understand the transformation of the society of India, the power to inspire the people who are very poor and uneducated to the British and to come to the battlefield.
We can learn from him how to start a public life, how to work and how Gandhiji worked.
The great leaders of that period, such as Rajendra Babu and Acharya Krublani, were working to go to the village of Gandhi.
He learnt how to connect with the people and how to work with the freedom struggle.
Today we are travelling in the 21st century, who doesnt want to change India in today's era, doesn't any Indian want to participate in the transformation of the country
Their efforts for transformation of this 125 crore countrymen will be a strong foundation for building a New India.
New India is not a government scheme.
New India is the challenge of 125 crore people of the country.
This is the feeling of creating a New India in collaboration with 125 crore people.
There is a desire, a desire, a mood, a thirst, a thirst in the hearts of 125 crore people of the country.
In a peaceful manner, they are doing such a thing as those who are penanced.
Many people go to the hospital every day and help patients.
As soon as asked about the need, there are many who go to Ododi and donate blood.
If anybody walks in the hut, there are many who give good food to them.
Our country is a country full of such valuable snakes.
People's service is Makeson's service. This is all in our nerves.
If we look at it in a corresponding manner, then how great power is this.
When we talk about a New India, it is natural to raise criticism of this idea, which can be accepted in a democratic manner.
But if 125 crore people have been sworn in, if they decide their path, if they start slapping one after another, then the dream of the 125 crore people of New India will start to grow when we look at it.
There is no need for all things to be held in the budget or to be a government scheme or to be spent from the government money.
That is, I would like to say that every citizen of the country should take responsibility as a citizen and recognise responsibility.
Why shouldn't we take this journey to enhance our self-reliance with a systematic and deliberate manner
I invite you to participate in this journey.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you today.
Over the past few months, a large number of people in our country participated in the Digital Movement.
After the cancellation of currency, digital payments have seen many improvements.
As we have started the BHIM Action within 2-3 months, so far, about 1. 25 billion people have done this.
My dear countrymen, we have to move forward in the war against black money and corruption.
Can 125 crore Indians fulfill their commitment to digital transactions at a level of Rs. 12 lakh crore this year
In order to implement this, we can pay the school in digital terms, we can make the travel fees for traveling in rail or air travel in digital terms, we can buy medicines in digital terms, we can take the methods of digital payment if we are doing cheap food items.
In the past, several programmes have been organised for digital conclaves for peoples awareness.
It was decided to do 100 events across the country.
80-85 events have been completed.
70,000 businessmen won their awards.
Everyone is sure to take this task forward.
There is also a big bullshit.
I am confident that we will create awareness about the BHIM Action as far as possible.
We have to contribute towards reducing the use of raw materials.
Dear countrymen, you have been giving me a number of suggestions that I would like to ask you to suggest suggestions for the event of Mann Ki Baat.
But in your suggestions, I can see that you are always putting more pressure on cleanliness.
This river is passing through Rispana bridge, it runs around my house.
We went to the part of the river against destruction and tried to create awareness amongst the people on footpaths, but it did not benefit.
I urge you to send a team from your side and create awareness about this through newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, See how much pain is felt in the mind of a girl who reads the 11th standard.
I see this as a good sign.
Awareness has emerged from the beginning of Swachhta movement.
Everyone has been constructively connected with it.
This has emerged as a mass movement.
The hatred against pollution has been increasing.
Beware and play a positive role, be it the movement, it is important for them.
Though the work is difficult, it should be done.
I am confident that this feeling, which is being created in the country's new generation, children, students and youth, is indicative of a good sign.
Today, in my heart, in the voice of my heart, whatever you are asking for the thoughts of the injured, I want to tell them all - the news that has been given to us should be the message given to all of us.
Brothers and sisters, From the beginning of the Mann Ki Baat program, many suggestions have been made for me to serve food.
We all know that when we eat in our homes and in public events, we eat more food in our layers than required.
Have we ever seen how much damage we cause from the remainders left
If we don't retain the residue, do we think it will help the poor to eat
But the injustice shown in this regard is a great treachery that is being fought against the society.
This is an injustice to the poor.
On the other hand, if the food is not wasted then the family will be benefitted economically.
This is a good thing even when it is socially thoughtful and familyally aims, it is beneficial.
I want to be more aware of this.
I know some youngsters who have been running the movement by creating a mobile app
If there is any food left, they will be informed that they will collect the remaining food and share it to the needy.
Our youngsters are working for this method of properly utilising food.
You can meet such people somewhere in every state of India.
You can see the way to see changes.
They always say that those who are aware of the health of the body, keep a little less on the leaves and fill the stomach a little less.
World Health Day on 7th April
By 2030, the United Nations has set a target of Universal Health Coverage and Health Protection for all.
A study says more than 35 crore people around the world are suffering from depression.
Friends, speak to parents, brothers and sisters, openly to the teachers and speak as much as you are inside.
Have you really seen why they are doing so
You must understand that they are in the first stage of stress.
Depression, mental and physical illness.
As diabetes provides a comfort to all kinds of diseases, stress and our compelling power, fighting against draconian climate, embracing capability and ending power suppress all our capabilities.
If you cannot speak openly to your dependents, people will work with the feelings of service at some place near you.
Appreciate the entire service, participate in their sadness and you can see your sadness melting yourself.
If you try to understand the grief of others, it will be a self-confidence amongst you if you do that with the sense of service.
You can easily dismantle the burden of your mind through the medium of providing selfless service to others through interacting with others.
Similarly, Yoga is a good way to keep your mind healthy.
You can start your efforts from now on.
Please ensure that millions of people participate in socially in Yoga.
If there is any suggestion in your mind about the 3rd International Yoga Day, then you must send your suggestions through the mobile app and guide me.
You can create songs and works related to Yoga, so that people's understanding can be increased.
Today I want to talk to mothers and sisters about one thing and today we have spoken about many things about health.
In the past, the government has taken a big decision.
It is a welcome fact that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day and their contributions are increasing.
My dear countrymen, sacred Ramanavami on 5th April, Mahavir Jayanti on 9th April, Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14th April, will be the birthday of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Let us always inspire the lives of these glorious men and give us a pledge to cook a New India.
After spring, when the crops begin to grow older and the farmers will get the benefit of their hard work.
This book is celebrated on several sides of our country.
My best wishes to all of you for my new year.
The winter is now hiding.
Spring is recording his presence in our lives.
After the leafy season, new drops of trees have started blossoming, flowers grow, jungles and gardens are blossoming green.
Not only the flowers, the mines also blossom in their chariots.
The rings of the summer season have started to appear in the spring season.
The yellow flowers of mustard turmeric in the fields give their hopes to the farmers.
On Tuesday, flowers of flowers and Holip Festivals are bound to visit.
Ameer Kusru has described these moments of climate change as very interesting.
The plains blossom everywhere, the trees blossom, the flowers blossom, the crowns blossom, the crowns blossom, the atmosphere becomes comfortable, and the man also enjoys the sweetness of this environment.
Vasanta Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holip Festival swimming joyful flowers in human life.
In the atmosphere of love, brotherhood and human love, we are ready to finish the participant month and welcome the new Chaitra month.
Spring period is a combination of two months.
When I hear your suggestions before the voice of my heart, I first express my gratitude to millions and millions of people for helping me send a lot of suggestions.
My thanks to all of you who have participated in the Prime Minister's Office, through letters in Twitzer, Peacebook.
Shoba Jallan ji in the Prime Minister's Office said that many public do not know about the achievements of the ISRO.
He further asked you to inform about 104 satellites and interruption missiles.
Shobaji, thank you for remembering the glorious example of India.
Our scientists have restricted India to the world stage.
We all know that Israel has succeeded in realizing many wonderful achievements over the past few years.
ISRO has made a new world record in the space space a few days back after it has succeeded in sending Malayalam to Tuesday's planet.
104 satellites of several countries have been successfully launched in India.
This is a great historic achievement not only for Israel but for the entire India.
ISRO's low-cost space program is one of the wonders worldwide and congratulates India scientists for their success all over the world.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 syllabus is very important - Cartosad 2D - this will be a disaster for Indias satellite, its films, mineral resources, infrastructure, developmental values and planning for urban development.
In particular, the number of bathers in the country, how to use them and how to take care of them, our new satellite cartosad-2D will be a disaster for my farmer brothers and sisters.
As soon as we reached, our satellite has sent some films.
It has started doing its job.
It is a matter of great happiness that all these activities have been under the leadership of our younger sociologists and our female scientists.
It is a matter of great pride that such a great contribution of young scientists and female scientists is a matter of great pride for Israel's success.
I express my heartfelt congratulations to all the scientists of Israel on your behalf, my countrymen.
Your aim is to keep the country's work in mind and to keep the sky scientific in mind, as it is today, you keep building many new achievements everyday.
Whatever best wishes to our scientists and their entire team, they are decreasing.
India has successfully tested a missile that hampers the destruction of the destruction of the defence sector.
This is the biggest achievement in the field of defence.
You will be more happy to note that I have this technology capacity in the world and only with the world.
Indian scientists have achieved this.
Its strength is that even though there is a missile attacking India from a distance, our missile is powerful to destroy it in applications.
When we see a new technology, when we see a new scientific achievement, our people are happy.
In Pramand, the man's mind is trying to understand the rules of the instrument.
This is why new science and new technology are born.
Every technology has created a new era as a new scientific form.
My dear youngsters, while talking about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have expressed my voice that our younger generations should be attracted towards science.
Many scientists need the country.
Today scientists are becoming a stable change factor in the life of generations emerging in the era.
No scientific scientific eruption has emerged from the sky.
Gandhiji said that all the scientific achievements are devoted to experience.
The great pride of the fact that our neo-evolent scientists should be praised for their thirst, hard work and sacrifice.
Science needs the public how to make the principles according to the practice and what kind of technology it means to manage, so that it can become an important part of the common man.
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Indian Foreign Department had organized a special competition on the 14th migrant Indians day.
In Mumbai, in 2005, the widespread rains took place, flooded and the sea was sighted with anger and there were many hurdles.
Any natural destination, it's only the doors of the poor house.
They decided to find a solution to this, they saved the house for a long time and improved a house to save the households from floods and prevent the diseases of water.
I could see many such inventions.
I would like to say that many people are contributing to this kind of contribution in the country.
Our society is also transforming into a society that is supplied with technology.
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the past, more emphasis has been given on digitisation.
Gradually, people are moving towards digital payments.
Digital Payments in India is growing rapidly.
Especially the younger communities are making money digitally on their mobile phones.
I see this as a good sign.
In the past few days, Lakki Krahak Yojana, the best consumer scheme, the Digital Business Yojana and the Digital Business Programme have been received in large numbers.
Nearly two months ago, one thousand rupees per day has been received for 15,000 people.
Through these two schemes, digital procurement in India has been transformed into a mass movement and the entire country has welcomed it.
It is a matter of fact that under the scheme of Digital India, 10 lakh people have received huge amounts, more than 50,000 businessmen have got huge amount and more than Rs.
Under this scheme, more than a hundred businessmen have received a million rupees.
More than 4000 businessmen have received Rs. 50,000 per month.
Many people like farmers, businessmen, small entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, householders and students have been associated with it with great enthusiasm.
When I looked at this, it was found that not only young people, but also old people, who were 15 years old, were senior citizens of 65-70.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has expressed his happiness from Mysore, and has said that he has received Rs. 1000 through the privileged customer scheme (Lokki Grahag Yojana).
But I want to share with you as important things in his writings.
My best wishes to all of us for your name and your work.
You are instilling a great inspiration.
Sabir, a 22-year-old car driver from Delhi, has started using digital transactions in his work after demonetisation and he has received a huge amount of Rs. 1 lakh in the government's privileged lender scheme.
Even today, he has been driving cars and has become a messenger of the scheme.
He shares information on digital payments with all travellers on his car.
He is very excited to discuss things and encourage others.
Pooja Nemade, a young friend from Maharashtra, is a learning girl who shares her experiences with her friends about how her family uses Rupee cards and e-wallets and how much happiness she gets.
Come to the leadership of this movement.
You take this forward and it has an important role in the war against corruption and black money.
In my view, everybody connecting them with this work is a new warrior against corruption.
In a way you are fighters of pride.
On 14th April, the greatest awards will be culminated.
There are still 40-45 days left.
Can you do a job to recall Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Just a few days back, Baba Saheb had passed the 125th birthday of Ambedkar.
In order to recognise his memories, you should learn to give at least 125 people the BHIM App.
This time, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will be an important feature of BHIM Action.
I also want to mention this for strengthening the foundation of Baba Saheb.
You should ensure that everybody goes home and joins the house and goes to the hands of 125 crore people.
Due to the impact of this movement in the last 2-3 months, there has been a huge increase in many cities, many villages and cities.
Brothers and sisters, Agriculture is a man of our countrys economy.
The economic strength of the villages strengthens the economic pace of the country.
Today, I want to share a pleasant message with you.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard and filled the furnace.
Due to the hard work of the farmers of our country, there has been an unprecedented consequence this year.
Our farmer brothers and sisters, all indicate that everything has broken the old records.
On seeing the masses, it has been emerged every day as if we celebrate the Festival of Fountains and Festivals today.
This year more than 2,200 million tonnes of masses have been found.
This is 8 percent more than the last achievement made by our farmers.
This is a wonderful achievement.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the farmers of the country.
There is another reason why I thank the farmers - they have produced a variety of pulses in addition to produce traditional foodgrains because there is more protein in pulses.
The sound of the poor has fallen in the ears of my country's farmers and they have produced several types of pulses in about two hundred and thirty hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but also the great service that the farmers have done for my country's poor.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the farmers brothers and sisters of the country who have achieved their pulses in Mahsul by listening to a request from me.
Dear countrymen, in our country, through the government, through society, through organizations, through movements, everybody is traveling towards cleanliness.
Everyone has been doing some kind of cleanliness awareness.
The government is in constant efforts.
In the past, under the leadership of the Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, the programme for senior officials of 23 State Governments was held in Telangana.
The seminar was not held within the closed rooms of the weekend in Telugu state, and the importance of cleaning work at the bottom was to be implemented.
In February 17-18, training was launched to liberalise toilets in Hyderabad.
Officers demonstrated that the toilets in 6 households were freed and cleaned, and the toilets with two tables could be removed and how they could be reuse.
They showed how comfortable the toilets used for this new technique, there is no problem, no problem, no psychological obstacle, no obstacles.
Just as we clean normally, we can clean the toilets too.
A family with 6 members, an average double tons of toilets will be filled in about 5 years.
After this, the wastes can be easily removed and reversed to another tub.
Whatever things are revealed in it, it will be beneficial.
Even in the state, various sectors are often organising meetings related to cleanliness for two weeks.
In the first meeting to be held in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will jointly strengthen the Swachh Survekshan.
During the second meeting of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will jointly launch the Swachh Survekshan for the last two weeks of March.
The entire country feels a new energy and inspires self-confidence, even if any citizen in our country is doing a good job.
In Rio Paralympics, we welcomed our talented sportspersons.
In the final lap of the D-20 World Cup for the disability to be organised this month, India defeated Pakistan and became the second consecutive global gathering and glorified the nation.
Once again, I congratulate all the team personnel.
The achievements of our handicapped friends in the country give us pride.
I have always been contemplating that our brothers and sisters, who are talented, who are desperate, who are with the accomplishments and minds.
Every moment we have to learn from them.
Whether it depends on the sports sector, whether it is space science or not, the women of our country are not buried.
They are moving forward equally, their achievements are brightening the country's name.
In the last few days, our women have won silver bowls in the Asian Rakbi Sevens competition.
My best wishes to all these virgins.
World Women's Day is being celebrated on 8th March.
We need to give importance to women children in India, to increase awareness and understanding in the family and society.
Today it is not just a government scheme.
It has been transformed into a social understanding movement called education for all.
In the last few years, this scheme has linked the peoples society, it has reflected this important thing in every corner of the country and has changed the thinking of people about the old habits that have been going on for decades.
He feels very happy when he hears the news that the girl is born.
In a way, the positive attitude towards women children is due to social conception.
I heard that BalyaViwaham has been stopped due to a special movement in Tamil Nadu's Cuddalore district.
So far, more than 175 dairy wives have been blocked.
Under the Sauganya Samruti Yojana, more than 55-60 thousand women have started bank accounts in the name of children.
According to the Integrated Model, the Convergence Model in the Bandwa district of Jammu and Kashmir, all sectors have been associated with the scheme to save the girl child, to teach the girl child, to gather the village councils and to ensure her education through district administration.
Under the scheme of shutting down every household door in Madhya Pradesh, a movement is being undertaken for the education of women children of every household.
In Rajasthan, the movement is going on to re-introduce our children, our school, our movement and re-introduce the women who are stopping school in half of the school.
I say that the movement of women children to save children and to teach women children is under different shapes.
This entire movement has also become a mass movement.
It is connected with innovative imaginations.
It has been changed as per regional requirements.
I consider it a good sign.
On 8th March, when we celebrate women's day, we should be unanimous with the feelings of unity. You all have the opportunity to talk about something or the other.
You have come together positively.
I have got lots of things to learn from you.
All the feelings of the world, the situation of the villages and the feelings of the poor are coming to me.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
In any situation, our forefathers have made the system of cycle, economic cycle and social life very excellent because there should never be a recession in society.
In the last few days, we celebrated several festivals.
Even after tens of thousands of years, every movement is filling up the new energy with a new spirit...
Sometimes he picked up the mountain, sometimes he worked for the removal of the food leaf, that is, we feel innovation in every aspect of his work.
Therefore, when I interact with you today, my thoughts go milk to two Mohans.
Mohan, who is suppressing Sudarshan Chakra, and Mohan is supposed to be suppressing Sarka.
And Mohen, which smote the surdarshan chakra, broke the bank of the river Yamuna, and went to the coasts of Gujarat, and dwelled in the city of Dwarkah: but Mohno, which came to the coasts of the sea, came to the yamuna, and breathed his last in Delhi.
Mohan, who surpassed the Sudarshan Chakra, used his intellectuality, his duties, his power, his ideals, even thousands of years ago, to avoid war and to live without conflict.
At the same time, Sarkat-affected Mohano gave a new shape to the struggle for freedom and to empower the basic elements of governance to secure human values and to create a new dimension of personality for the entire world, which is still individual.
What is the significance of selfless service, what is the significance of wisdom, what is the significance of moving ahead with laughing among all the deserts of life, that we can learn from the life of Lord Shri Krishna.
Today, when we are talking about the festivals, India is engaged in a massive movement
Not only India but the whole world is talking about it.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birthday of Bapu.
On October 2, 1869, in the battlefield situated on the seashore, today we have produced a war, not a single person in a small house called Kirti Mandir.
This gave a new turn to the entire human history and made a new achievement.
There was always a thing connected with Gandhi Ji, in a way it became a permanent part of his life, that is, service, service and duty towards service.
If we saw all his life, he was involved in the service of the people of the society that was suffering from diversity in South Africa, during that period, it was nothing small.
He served for the oppressed farmers in Champaran.
If anybody needs help, he will be helpful to serve at any time.
He not only strengthened the service but also strengthened the spiritual happiness associated with service.
But at the same time, the experience of a self-sustained joy and self-sufficiency is also deepened within the service.
We can clearly understand this through the life of brothers.
Gandhians, individuals, society, humans and humans are all.
Whether it is Africa's Finics Planet or Dalsty Planet, or Sabarmati Ashram or Varta, he has always been firm on social integration in a different way.
I believe that I have got the privilege of visiting many important places related to brotherhood and offering my tributes there.
When it comes to society, there is a power that should be a social expression and service in the event of Gandhi 150.
Whatever the mindset emerges - it should be a good desire, a good intention, a good intention, a good ideal, a service with full dedication and a swant: Sukai: - it should be aimed at enjoying uninterrupted happiness.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I had visited Dandi in Gujarat.
Dandi, the name of Salt Satyagraha in the freedom struggle, was a big turning point.
I inaugurated the museum dedicated to Nanal in Dandi.
I appeal to all of you to visit a place related to brothers and sisters.
Several events, competitions and exhibitions have been planned in the coming days.
But in this context, I want to share with you a very interesting thing.
This time, in Venice Biennale, many interesting sights of Gandhijis memories have been shown at the Indian Museum.
The area of Haripura is very interesting.
You might remember that when Gujarat's Haripura Congress Conference was held, Subhas Chandra Bose was elected leader in history.
A beautiful past has been decorated in this art area.
Earlier in 1937-38, Channel had invited Nandlal Bose, the then Chief Minister of the Kala Bhavan of Shantiniketan, before the Hariphura conference of Congress.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people living in India through art and exhibit this art.
This is the handicraft of Nandla Bose that is enhancing the beauty of our Constitution.
Nandlal Bose ji surrounded the villages around Haripura and paintings to showcase a lot of rural life.
There were serious discussions in Venice about these precious works.
Once again, with the good wishes of Gandhi Ji on the 150th birthday, I hope that every Indian should take a pledge.
For the country, for the society, something has to be done for a good thing.
This is the best we can do for brothers, the real activity can be blessed.
You all may remember that for the last few years, we have been organising a Swachh Hi Seva campaign for 2 weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will start on 11th September.
There is enthusiasm among all sections of the society for this movement.
My business brothers and sisters, everybody has touched a text of a text in their shops and the customers have written it that when they come out of the house, they have to come with their clothes.
This will mitigate money and our contribution in protecting the environment.
On this occasion, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of the brother on 2nd October, we will dedicate to him the free India from open defecation, while the foundation stone of a new mass movement against negative commodities will be laid throughout the country.
I urge all sections of the society, every village, every small part of the city and every citizen of the country to bow down and bow down and we must celebrate this year's Gandhi Jayanti Festival in a way to liberate our Mother India from the joyous past.
I also appeal to private corporations that you have to come out properly after the consumption of such waste materials.
They can be recycled.
These can produce fuel.
But there was a lot before.
Today, I want to touch a more important thing than a cultural text.
Even though it has been written several centuries ago, do you still know how important it is
The pearls are called stones.
In our culture, food has always been given great importance.
As far as we are concerned, we have also scientificized food information.
We all need a balanced and nutritious diet, especially for women and children, because they are the future foundations of our society.
Under the Nutrition Mission, nutritional nutrition has become a mass movement in modern ways across the country.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once a thing was brought to my attention.
There was a big movement called rice in Nashik.
Anganwadi brothers and sisters collect a handful of grains from the people in the days of their harvest.
These grains are useful for hot food prepared for children and women.
This ritual is done for the first time when the child is given a strong diet.
No liquid food, solid dinner.
This is an excellent effort, which can be implemented everywhere.
In many states, people are organising a movement called Didi Bhajan.
The family, the family, the family, the nutritious food and the tasty food, go to Anganwadi, every family, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, go to the school.
They share their happiness and when such happiness is shared, it will not be reduced.
The feelings of happiness and service are also a marvellous confluence.
Friends, Through these small things, we can emerge strong war against malnutrition in our country.
Today, due to lack of awareness, poor and deprived, both are suffering from this.
We will celebrate the month of September as a nutritional movement across the country.
You must add it to yourself, get the information and introduce new ideas in it.
If you bring one or two persons out of malnutrition, then we can bring the country out of malnutrition.
This time I was imagining for the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I had a lot of faith that one question would be asked about this thing.
And whenever I went anywhere in the last few weeks, whenever I met the people, Man Vs.
I don't even imagine that I will get such a chance in the minds of the world-class youth.
Last week I went to Bhutan.
As the Prime Minister, whenever I am supposed to go anywhere, the situation has become due to international conception, even if someone goes to the world, they start questioning me about a 5-6 minute Yoga.
So far, I have become the leader of the world who has not been conscientious about Yoga, this has been my experience all over the world.
But nowadays there is a new experience.
Whenever I meet anyone, whenever there is a chance, they talk about the things related to wildlife, they talk about the environment.
165 countries are in the process of broadcasting the Discovery programme in their language.
But one more interesting thing, some people are listening to me with a little hardship, Modiji, when you are speaking in Hindi, how could you speak so fast when Bir Grylls did not know Hindi language
Is this subsequently substituted
Look, there's no secret.
The fact is that technology was fully used to negotiate with Bear Grills.
After this event, a large number of people have started discussing with me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also visit places connected with nature and wildlife.
I have already said, I repeat it and you must go to the North-Eastern states in your life.
Your life is huge.
Your thoughts will enlarge.
I got the privilege of releasing the census of wildlife in the last few months.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
LTTEs in India are 2967.
A few years ago, half of it was their number.
The LTTE-related summit took place in Russia's St. Petersburg in 2010.
The concern was that the number of LTTE decreasing in the world was finally confirmed.
This commitment is to double the number of LTTEs worldwide by 2022.
But we have doubled the number of LTTEs in the year 2019 due to this new India, which we have achieved the targets at a fast pace.
India has not only increased the number of LTTEs, but also increased the number of protected areas and social guards.
When I published the LTTE data, I remembered the lions in the Gir forests of Gujarat.
I had been assuming charge as the chief minister, while the dwellings of lions were decreasing in the Gir forests.
Their numbers were also decreasing.
We moved one after another in the Gir forests.
In 2007, we decided to take care of women guards.
We have made developments in the framework to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about maintenance.
Therefore, it is necessary for us to create a proper environment to save our forests, plants, wildlife, especially those who live in a special way.
My dear countrymen, who can forget Vivekanandas historical address on 11th September, 1893.
This young saint of India, who raised the human society from the world's sleep, left a bright identification of India in the world.
The same world, which has seen India as a glorious vision, changed the vision of the country by listening to the words of Swami Vivekananda on 11th September, 1893.
Come on, Swami Vivekananda who has seen the shape of India, Swami Vivekananda who has seen the power of India, we will try to live it.
It is within us, everything is, we move forward with self-confidence.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate 29th August as National Sports Day.
It will be a very interesting movement for all children, elderly, youth and women, which will be yours.
But I am not going to tell you anything about their slightest things today.
I want to create awareness about physical activity in your mind, for a stable India, for our country, we will resolve some goals together.
I am confident that all of us will be able to get rid of the negligible materials, beyond homes and beyond homes, and we will smite it on social networks.
Thank you so much.
My dear countrymen, greet you all.
On 26th January, our President, we celebrated with joy and joy every corner of the country.
The Constitution of India, the obligations of the citizens, the powers and the perspective that we have on the democratic system, is in a way a cultural festival that creates awareness among generations about democratic responsibilities.
But no matter how deeply and deeply debates should be made about the duties and rights of the citizens in our country.
Tomorrow, on 30th January, our mother-in-law's brother-in-law disappeared.
On January 30, at 11 a.m., we will convey our heartfelt condolences to the martyrs who have sacrificed their lives for the country.
As a society or as a country, it should be natural for us to pay a silent tribute at 11. 00 am on 30th January.
It is only two minutes, but it has sociality and stress and our interests on the martyrs.
We have expressed our natural respect for the army and the security forces of our country.
I extend my warm greetings to the soldiers and their relatives who have been honored with various medals for the Veterans who have been awarded this Republic Day.
These tensions include Girti Chakra, Shurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
I appeal to the youth, especially to the youth, that you can do a job that you are working in the social networks.
Write two good words on the web site and share them with your friends.
When we deeply understand the messages of the courage, bravery and valour of those soldiers, we will be surprised, proud and inspired.
On the 26th of January, we have experienced great enthusiasm and great happiness, while on the other hand some of our soldiers engaged in the security of our country in Kashmir have died due to the ice slope.
I pay my respected tributes to all the martyrs of this country.
My young friends, you all know that I have constantly shouted the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
In January, February, March and April, these four months have been a quarter for every family.
Even if a child is elected to the house, the entire family is weeping in the weight of the examinations.
I have always felt that I should come out of this situation, so today I want to talk to my young friends in detail.
I would like to ask you how to make such an environment happy.
"I know that even if Christ has asked this question, this question is in your hearts.
The choices should be a pleasant opportunity.
The election season for most of them is a stressful period.
You have to decide whether you consider it as a pleasant time or whether you feel it as a stressful time.
Those who consider it to be a stressful period, they are sorry - Please for Pressure.
Therefore, I believe that the election period is a celebration and you have to take it as a festival.
Whenever it comes to festivals and festivals, the characteristics of ourselves are seen.
The entire family should work as a team and play their role in ensuring success for this event.
There will be changes when you are watching.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kachh to Kamrupam, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, this is the only option in 3-4 months.
It is our responsibility to transform everybody into a three-four-month period, according to their family environment, by adopting their traditions in their ways.
If you say that you were happy, you would feel regretted if you were with a smiling face, and in this situation many years old things would also start to break into your memories easily.
A year ago, what the teacher had spoken in the classroom will be brilliant in your sleep.
Sindhna Shakti breaks down and it starts dreaming as a burden.
We cannot even imagine how many of the most beneficial things will suddenly come in mind if there is depression, if we forget things, if we are confident.
You have no information or you have not worked hard.
But whenever there is pressure, your knowledge and your knowledge will swallow up all your information and the pressure will sail on you.
Therefore, I will say that a happy mind is the second for a good mark-sheet, a happy mind is the opening of more values.
Sometimes I feel that we don't approach the examinations in the right perspective.
This is not a speech for your life.
There is no choice for how you live your life, how you live and how you live and how you think you live.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a great example of sympathy for us.
He went to the air force and lost.
The values have become more important.
This has led to the increase in obesity and the stress in the minds of the students has increased significantly.
In this situation, I want to know your views on the temporary trend of education and its future.
If you believe in these things, the values will be tied up after you like the wind wind.
It is necessary to know where I am today, what is the status of my knowledge till yesterday.
If we talk about the sports world then I took this exhibition as it will immediately be in mind.
Most of the successes take place in their lives because the sportspersons put their own competitions.
You will take the life of Sachin Tendulkar
Twenty years, he has been punching several achievements and has achieved a new achievement in the past achieved every time.
His journey of life is very amazing because he has been following the path of making himself challenges by competing with others.
Friends, you have to write an examination in every field of life, and when you have to read two hours, can you read for 3 hours
Before you decided to get up at how much in the morning, it might have been late, but can you get up at the time you decide now
Therefore, I request you to leave the competition with others and make yourselves challenges.
It should be noted how my work was earlier, how to move ahead and how to work well.
With this perspective, you can improve the transformation in yourselves.
S.
Sundar ji, it's absolutely right to say you.
You might have noticed that even today, if those who ask me, see me as adviser, there is a greater number of women.
Because when the mothers are aware of the future of the children in the houses, they are simplifying many things.
Accomplish the guidance of yourselves with the ability of yourselves, and spend time in whatever jobs you have.
Once you are adopted, most of your problems will come to an end.
The expectations of parents and teachers are the basis of their problems.
Accepting the same is the way to solve the problems.
The expectations make the path even more difficult.
You're gonna get comforted by loading.
In a way we go to see the patient and create fear of disease.
I would like to tell my parents that sometimes we are making such a threat to our children.
Do you ever feel that you should create a happy environment during the election days
Make such a thing that you will see the environment completely changing.
I received a magnificent call.
He doesn't want to mention his name.
If you ask why he doesn't want to mention his name, then you will know.
"Prime Minister, I don't want to mention my name because I have done a job in my childhood.
Once there is a habit of saving, the thirst to learn in life will cease.
A phone call was received: "Prime Minister, my name is Monica. I want to ask you two questions about my selections as I read in class 12.
It is a common idea that if students pay attention to sports, there will be a reduction in education.
This basic idea is wrong and this is the reason for the problem.
In order to achieve sufficient growth, there is a life which is very widespread.
This is the right time to live and learn that life.
Though it's five minutes, surely rest.
You can feel that your job is uncomfortable.
I don't know whether everyone has caught it or not, but this is my experience.
In the election season, when I speak on the dais, sometimes my voice will refuse to cooperate.
Once a local singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long you're sleeping.
He has given me basic treatment so far, not even thinking of my sleep and my speech and my voice.
If we understand the importance of such basic things then we will get many benefits.
Do not do so, otherwise your family will be angry with me.
If you don't see your values on the day coming, I'll see their eyes.
Please don't do that.
It's very important to keep mind, mind and body active.
Yes, young friends, if you are engaged in the arrangements for your choices, then I am speaking something, perhaps I believe that what I have said today would be giving you comfort.
But I urge you not to seriously consider what I have said.
If possible, try it and do not do it.
Remember your decision, put your trust in you, go to the polls and greet you all.
Initiate that challenge before facing every challenge.
Then it will not be challenging.
Take this mantra in your mind and go ahead.
My dear countrymen, on February 1, 2017, 40 years of Indian Coast Guard will be completed.
On this occasion, I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Coast Guard officers and the soldiers for their dedication to the nation.
It is a matter of great pride that our coastal guards with 126 vessels and 62 aircraft are the 4th largest maritime guards in the world.
The magnificence of the coastal guard is Vayan Raksham.
Coast Guards are waking up at night in desperate conditions to defend the coastal areas and seashores of the country by pursuing this goal.
Many people don't know that not only men but women are doing their duties successfully by standing shoulder to shoulder in our country's coastal guard.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard are operating as airplanes and guardians and hover grabs.
While the coastal police is the world's biggest thing today, I congratulate the Indian Coast Guard on their 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard engaged in the coastal security of India.
The Panchami Saraswati Puja, which lives in our country, is a big festival.
This is considered an opportunity to promote education.
Not only this, it is a time to inspire the soldiers.
Mera Rang Te Basanti Sola will make me suitable for the spring season.
I extend my best wishes to my countrymen on this holy Sage Panchami Festival.
My dear countrymen, Akashwani in Mann Ki Baat has always laid the foundation stone of new colors in accordance with his creativity.
Within the last two months, they are shouting Mann Ki Baat in the state languages as soon as they are completed.
This is a very good welcome.
I have the greatest opportunity to travel with you through the voice of my heart.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, greetings and good wishes to all of you on the day of Christmas.
Today, the value to give importance to service, sacrifice and pride in our lives.
Several wealthy people came and gave unified wealth.
Finally, a poor widow came and put two supplements.
Today, on his birthday, we will pay my best wishes.
Two days ago, I got the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Malavia ji's grandfather Varanasi.
I laid the foundation stone for the greatest Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi.
This Cancer Centre, which is being set up, will be an example not only for Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for people from Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today, the birthday of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of India, is also the birthday of Bharat Ratna.
This country will not forget Atal ji's contribution.
Under his leadership, we also got the country's pride in the nuclear power sector.
As a party leader, as a Member of Parliament, through the post of Minister or Prime Minister, Atal ji's special contribution has made him an example man.
Today, on the birthday of Atal ji, I express my heartfelt congratulations to him and satisfy God for giving him better health.
As an employee, I had a great deal to work with Atal ji.
The memories of him are green and reflected in my minds.
Today, the Christmas-good day, the benefits of two schemes are available for the countrymen.
In a way, these two can be the beginning of new projects.
We can see the keenness of knowing about how to buy unprecedented trade, how to buy goods without borrowing, whether it is a village or a city or a reader or a builder or a rockless transaction.
Everyone wants to learn from each other the methods related to this.
Similarly, the Digithan Business Programme, which has been launched as a boost to the businessmen, will be awarded to 15,000 persons as Christmas Prize on December 25
This scheme is going to be completed from today to 100 days.
Every day 15,000 persons will receive a prize of a thousand rupees per day.
Digigie's business plan is particularly for businessmen.
Businesses and businesses will also have a great opportunity to stretch their merchandise.
This scheme is designed by the centre of all classes of society, especially the poor and the lower middle class.
Those who buy goods worth Rs. 50 to Rs. 3000 will get the benefit of this.
It is not for those who buy more than 3000 rupees.
Even the poorest of the market can buy goods using USSD, feature phones and simple phones, sell them, pay the money, all of them will be benefitted from this scheme.
People living in rural areas can buy or sell goods through AEPS and slaughter the prizes.
Today, there are about 30 crore RuPay cards in India, and 20 crore cards are from poor families and people who have their accounts.
30 crore people will be able to participate in this honour.
I am sure that the people of the country will take the country in this manner, and they will get the necessary information from their neighbouring youth.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to see that how to use technology in the country, how to pay the money in electronic form and how to pay the money through online.
Over the past few days, retail business has grown from 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to take this forward.
Businessmen are well aware of how big this decision is.
Income taxes have been given to such traders, who are doing digital transactions, who are paying money on an online basis instead of using the loans in their business.
I congratulate all the states and Union Territories of the country.
A team headed by Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu, was formed and they are reviewing several projects.
At the same time, the governments have also started and implemented several schemes in their respective ways.
I am told that the State Government of Assam has announced that 10 percent taxation will be provided to those who pay the property tax and business liquidation in digital terms.
If the branches of rural banks take 75 percent of their account holders and make at least two digital transactions from January to March, then 50,000 rupees will be given from the government level.
The Committee has announced that in the month of March, 2017, 100 percent of digital payments will be made available to the villages as the best payment for Digi Payments from Government level to Rs. 5 lakhs.
Several organisations are making successful efforts to advance digital payments to rural poor farmers.
The interesting thing is that compared to GNFC's fertilizer sales last year, 27 percent of the sales have increased this year.
In a place where 100 rupees are available, 80 rupees are available, 50 rupees are available and are deprived of insurance and health.
But now cash is being provided in cashless manner.
Our country is a youth-dominated country.
Technical is a art that has been given to us.
A country like India should be at the forefront of all countries in this sector.
Our youngsters have made significant progress through start-ups.
This is a golden opportunity for digital movement.
Our youngsters should incorporate new ideas and intellectual technologies and the strengthening of this sector with modern methods.
At the same time, the movement to get rid of black money and corruption should be linked with the entire power.
My dear countrymen, I would like to appeal to you before the voice of the heart every month to take your suggestions and to show your suggestions.
Accordingly, tens of thousands of letters have come into consultation with MyGov and the narendramodiop, of which 80-90 percent of suggestions are related to corruption and black money destruction and monetary withdrawal.
After seeing all this, I think it can be classified in three ways.
Some people have written in detail about the difficulties and difficulties faced by the citizens due to this monetary withdrawal.
The other types of work, such a great job, such a great job for the sake of the country, as such a sacred work is going on, they have mentioned how the youngsters are taking new paths to set up in many places where they are taking steps and uninterrupted actions.
My countrymen, I am grateful to you people for writing all these letters to me.
The path that has been brought under control has been appreciated.
It is true that all of us, citizens, are suffering from mischief, but we all are fighting for the fight against corruption, and we are happy to share our cooperation in this war.
We are fighting against corruption and black money, as the army personnel are fighting.'
Gurumani Kewal ji has written the voice of people who reflect every corner of the country.
They are the factors that transform themselves into true changes, agents of change.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who have reacted sharply not only to their misery, but also to those who have tried to put people in the wrong direction.
A large number of attempts have been made to contribute to the war against corruption and black money.
Moreover, many people burst their faces in the field, use their works and intellectuals, cut off their pieces of graves and illuminated the truth.
When 125 crore people of my country are connected to me, can there be something that is impossible
If there were the blessings of the people of Makeshan, wouldn't it be for Isan's blessings
I express my sincere gratitude to the people of the country, I extend my best wishes to them, people are participating in this mega festival against corruption and black money.
I was expecting a wide range of discussions on the ongoing war against corruption and black money in Parliament for political parties and the financial granted to political parties.
If there were meetings, there would have been discussions about this.
Those who insist that political parties have been expelled in all forms are completely false to say.
Anyone who cannot work openly in support of corruption and black money is spending their full attention and time in search of government cuts.
There is also a question that why they are constantly changing the rules.
This government is working for the people of Makeser.
The government has been trying to keep listening to the comments from the people.
When they manipulate new methods, we also have to adopt new ways to break their evil thoughts.
This war, which is taking place in the form of Vitag Continent, Kodacondan, must be a decision for corrupt corporates, poor practices and black money.
On the other hand, letters have also come from many about what kind of bad practices are being handled and what kind of new methods are being used.
I am grateful to my beloved countrymen for this time.
The government has specifically made an email address to share such information.
Besides, you can also send MYGOv internet accessory.
The government has made a strong fight against all kinds of evils that you point out.
When your cooperation is not over, it's very easy to understand the war.
The third type of the letter is also in large numbers.
"Modi ji, if you don't lazily, don't lazily, do whatever hard work you have to do, do not worry, but if you decide to travel on the path, then there is no talk of repealing the conclusion."
My dear countrymen, even though Mann Ki Baat last time I had said that even among these places, our farmers have done hard work and have done records by breaking records made in the seeds last year.
This is a clear symptom from the perspective of agriculture sector.
Be it the labourer of this country, be it the farmer, be it the boy, all these efforts are being made to make the country new.
Just a few days back, India has engraved its name in many sectors on the World Economic Forum.
India has progressed in the world class rankings through different indices, as a result of the continued efforts of our skilled nations.
The World Bank's statement on unsolicited trade has raised Indias standards.
India has risen to 32 places in the World Economic Organisation report on World Class Competitiveness.
In 2016, we have moved up 16 places in the World Banks Infrastructure Services Index, 2016, we have moved up 19 places in the Action Index.
Several other reports also point to the same assessment and India is growing rapidly.
My dear countrymen, this time the people of the country have read the anger of the people on the Parliament meeting.
There is anger over the Parliament's functions everywhere.
The President and the Vice President expressed their dissatisfaction openly.
But even in such a situation, the heart is happy when some good things are going on.
The country's attention has not been reversed even during the implementation of the Parliament.
Brothers and sisters, I am happy to note that the government's efforts have been made in mind the goal of development of handicapped persons and a law related to it has been completed now.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the members of the Lok Sabha and the States for fulfilling this. I express my sincere gratitude to the country's Kodanukodi Disabled Persons.
This government is moving towards the welfare of the handicapped.
Individually, I also tried to enhance its pace to take this goal forward.
My goal was to provide their rights and dignity to the handicapped.
Our talented brothers and sisters won 4 medals in the Paralleympics and strengthened our efforts and beliefs.
They have not only glorifyed the country through their successes, but have also made people marvellous in the sea through their talent.
Our talented brothers and sisters, like other citizens of the country, our valuable wealth and affordable resources.
After the enactment of this Act for the benefit of the handicapped, the employment of the handicapped has increased.
The definition of exclusion in government work has been increased to 4 percent.
Through this Act, excellent arrangements have been made for the education, facilities and complaints of the handicapped.
In the last two years, 4350 camps have been organised for the handicapped and 580,000 handicapped brothers and sisters have been provided at a cost of Rs 352 crore.
A new law has been enacted after the spirit of the United Nations Organization.
Earlier, the handicapped persons were classified at 7 stages, but now through the law, it is 21 types, in which 14 new positions are further added.
They have got justice for the first time and have got the opportunity to connect some of the handicapped persons.
For example, we are associated with those suffering from Thalassemia, Parkinson, and those with a crumbling shape at birth.
The Indian cricket team has swollen up to 4 in the test competition against the UK.
Some young soldiers' lamps are praiseworthy.
Our country's boy, Karun Nair, hit 3 percent.
KL Rahul took 199 runs.
Not only did Text Captain Virat Kohli be well interviewed, but he also gave a good leadership.
The Indian Cricket Team of Spinner Puducherry R.
Ashwin's name was announced by the International Cricket Committee, ICC, the Cricketer of the Year, and the Best Tess Cricketer in 2016.
My best wishes to all of them, my best wishes.
In the Hawkish sector, after 15 years, the most excellent and special news has been received.
Junior Hawky has won the World Cup.
This achievement is a clear symptom of India Hockey Annie's future.
Last month, our women houses have also performed well.
If the women of India won the Hockey Games Asian Championship, a few days back, India's Women's Hackey team won bronze medals in the Asian Games for 18-year-old people.
Like every year, this time during Deepawali, I once again visited the border areas of China by celebrating Diwali with the soldiers.
I celebrated Deepawali at the peaks of the Himalayas with ITBP and Indian Tibetan Border Soldiers and Militants.
I am going every time but the experience of this Deepawali is incomparable.
People are not only sending information but also connected with minds
One denounced poems, others even films, others produced cartoons and others produced video.
That is, every house is like the homes of soldiers.
On seeing the letters, I am telling you how imaginative and how many feelings are there in the minds of the people.
A soldier from the army had written to me - Prime Minister, all the soldiers like us, Deepawali and Holi will be on the borders.
We will spend every moment in the thoughts of the country's security.
Yes, but in the days of the festival, there is a feeling of household.
But if you want to tell the truth, this time it has not happened.
There is no doubt that we are not at home in the day of this festival.
We are also celebrating Deepawali with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, during this Deepawali Festival, the feelings of the soldiers in the hearts of our country should be hidden in a few moments.
As a society, in the form of a society, I appeal to all of you to create this feeling as our nature and to merge with our sentiments. Whether it is a festival or a happy occasion, we should remember the soldiers of our country in some way.
When the country stands shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers, the strength and strength of the army will increase by 125 crore.
Just a few days ago, all the leaders from the villages of Jammu Kashmir had come to meet me.
They are from the Panchayathu summit of Jammu Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 leaders who had come from different villages of Kashmir Valley.
I had an opportunity to interact with them for a long time.
They had come to talk about the development of their villages, some had come with some demands, but when the conversation began to grow, it was natural that the situation in the valley, the law and order situation and the future of the children were included in it.
With great love and open minds, these leaders of the village were in touch with the heart.
In the interaction, when the talk about the burning schools in Kashmir was raised, I realized the sorrow that our countrymen had suffered from this.
They believed that schools were not burnt, but the future of children was devastated.
After you returned to your cities, I would like to take care of the future of these children.
I am happy to note that all these leaders from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promise made to me very well.
They went to villages and waked up those who were far away.
A few days back, 95 percent of the children from Kashmir participated in the Various Examinations.
It indicates that such a large number of students taking part in the prestigious examinations, our children of Jammu Kashmir have expressed their commitment to achieve new summits of development through education for a prosperous future.
While conveying my best wishes to those students for their inspiration, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to their parents, relatives, their teachers and all the rural leaders.
Dear brothers and sisters, when I asked for advice from the people for the voice of Mann Ki Baat this time, the advice of everyone came to the fore.
Everyone asked me to talk about 500,000 rupees notes in detail.
In my speech to the people of the country on 8th November, I spoke of the start of a transformational disaster in the country.
I have said that this decision is not normal, it is a problematic thing.
But the more important the resolution is, the more important it is to be implemented.
I am fortunate that in our average life, many innovations have to face difficulties.
Even then, I had said that this decision is very big and it will take 50 days to recover from its impact and then it will be possible for us to step down towards normalcy.
It is not easy to get rid of the diseases that we have been suffering for 70 years.
I can understand all the problems you face.
500 and 1000 rupees notes, such a big country, so many crores of soils, several lakh crores of notes, such a decision - the entire world is taking care of it, every economist has been advising and estimating it.
India has a huge faith in 125 crore people of India and 125 crore people of the country are sure to fulfill their resolve.
All sections of Central Government, State Governments and regional local bodies across the country, one lakh 30,000 bank branches, millions of bankers, more than 1 lakh post offices, more than 1 lakh bank agents, and more than 1 lakh bank agents, participated in the work day and night with dedication.
Between different tensions, they all became very peaceful and thought that this country's work was an attempt to make a great change.
As a result, it is obvious that India will succeed in this work.
I am also witnessing that everybody works in banks and post offices in such a situation.
When it comes to human love, they are doing more and more travelling.
One told me that an old man was in a place called Khandwa.
Suddenly money was needed.
I am glad that when the banking worker was taken into consideration this thing, he went straight to the elderly and collected money and saw no problem in treatment.
Several such incidents take place every day in TV, media, newspapers and conversations.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the comrades who are working and contributing to this great valour.
But the extent to which the evil is spreading, even today, the evil practices have become a habit.
Even now, they are contemplating that this corruption money, the black money, the undeclared money, and the pinnacle money, can find some way to survive.
They are trying to save their money from the poor by embarrassing the poor, talking or embarrassing their minds, buying money on their accounts, buying some job from them.
Today, I want to tell such people that you will see what I wish to do, what to do, what to do, what to do, what to do, what to do, what to do with your will, what to do, what to do, what to do, what to do with those people.
But please don't play with the lives of the poor.
Don't do anything in the case of your sin when the name of the poor comes in the registers, and when the investigation is done, my dear poor people don't suffer.
The draconian law on Pinami property has been enacted, which is going to come into effect and will have a lot of problems.
The government wants that there should not be any problem for our countrymen.
I live in Drali village of Drali Taluka in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
You have taught a good song to those who have black money and corrupt people through 500 and 1000 rupees notes.
If this action has not been taken then it will never be a good time for every citizen of India.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for this.
Some of the things are being encouraged by the media, by the people, when they get from the government levels.
When the common man of my country knows what is a wonderful talent, there is a great joy and honour.
Even if you want to eat food, do not worry about money, do not go back from here only with hunger, you have to leave the food and whenever you have to travel on this path, definitely pay the money.
There people go, eat food, when they travel again after 2-4-6 days, they pay back the money.
This is the power of my country, including service mindset and sacrifice.
During the election, I attended the Tea Speech and this comment spread all over the world.
Many people of the world have started talking about tea.
But I didn't know that the weddings would also take place during this Tea interaction.
On November 17, a wedding took place in Surat, with a tea summit.
In Gujarat's sound, a woman drank only tea for those who came to her household marriage, no other concert, no festivities, because there was no money laundering due to money laundering.
Even the audience thought it was honourable.
Surat's Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar - they have enjoyed their role in the war against black money against corruption through their marriage.
While giving blessings to Navarinith Bharat and Daksha, I congratulate you for making marriage glory a great valour and making it a new opportunity.
When such problems arise, people settle solutions to it.
Some people have been benefitted immediately through this movement.
The country will be benefitted in the days to come, but some are benefitted immediately.
When I heard about the incident, I got some information from small towns.
But due to this decision on 8th this time, everyone came out to pay their old notes.
About 3000-3500 crore rupees have been deposited in 47 City Units during the last year.
Where is 3000-3500 crores, where is 13000 crores
Whether these municipalities have been given 4 times the money or water supply systems are being constructed for the poor, or not the Anganwadi centres are being established naturally
There are many such examples that have been directly benefited from the eye.
Brothers and sisters, our villages, our farmers, these are the strongest pillars of the economy of our country.
On the one hand, due to this new transformation of the economy, every citizen in the midst of the territories is deteriorating himself.
But today I would like to congratulate my countrymen for my best wishes.
Now I was asking about the details of the seedlings of this season.
Be it wheat or pulses or oil crops, I have accounts till November 20, the seeds have increased in comparison to the same period last year.
In the midst of hardships, farmers have found a way.
The government has also taken several important decisions which have given importance to farmers and villages.
Under Mudra Yojana, efforts were made to provide loans to them.
Several crores of rupees were provided to the common people under the Mudra Yojana because hundreds of crores of people are engaged in such small businesses and hundreds of crores of rupees provide speed to the business.
Today, whenever I want to tell my young business brothers and sisters, you can use it as an opportunity to enter the digital world.
Please also clarify the bank's app through your mobile phone.
Your contribution to the creation of a non-payment society can be immense. You can use the entire banking programme through mobile phones to enhance your business and we can do business in many ways without handling the diseases today.
There are technological routes which are safe and quick.
I would like to assure you that you will have to give your cooperation to the success of this movement, not only that, you will have to lead the transformation, I am confident that you can give such a leadership.
I am confident that you can do the entire village business with the help of technology.
I want to tell the labour brothers and sisters that you are suffering more injustice.
One of the wages fixed in the paper is the same as the amount paid in your hands.
You need to get your wages in full, nobody has to pay.
You shouldn't be tortured.
If money comes in your bank account, you can also buy goods through a small mobile phone, through which you can pay the money, and it does not require any smart phones, it does your Burss work as an e-wallet as well as your mobile phone.
Therefore, my labour brothers and sisters, I urge you to participate in this program because I have made such a big decision to provide benefits to the poor, the farmers, the oppressed, the deprived, the deprived and the deprived.
Today, I would like to interact with the youth in particular.
In India, 65 percent of the people are under 35 years of age.
I am also aware that you are making a lot of contribution to carry it forward in a constructive way.
Friends, you are my real servants, you are my real friends.
We all have a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India, which is a golden opportunity to move the country towards the economic summits.
My young social friends, can you help me
You know what the App means, you know what is online banking, that is, you know what is banking through a clothing and a cloth through a cloth.
These things are very simple to you and you also use them.
But today, the greatest thing that the country wants to do is that society without our dream of a rich rich man.
It is true that society is not possible without a hundred percent transaction.
But why shouldn't we start making India a socially useful society
Once you start this low-cost usage society, the goal of the society is not far away.
I am confident that you will never disappoint me because we all have the desire to change the lives of the poor of Hindustan.
You know how many opportunities have occurred today to create a society without a huge money transformation, to introduce digital banking service or to introduce mobile banking service.
Each bank provides online facility.
Wallet's straightforward e-purse.
There are several types of cards available.
According to Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have a RuPay card, which has been used at least after 8th, has been more useful and more than 300 percent has grown.
Like the prepaid card coming on the mobile phone, banks also get a prepaid card to spend money.
The UPI is an excellent base for business, through which you can buy goods, send money and get the money.
This work is as simple as you send the information in the WTSAP.
He has also learnt how to send information to the WTSAP today and how to forward it.
Moreover, technology is so simple that the biggest smartphone for this job is unnecessary.
Money can also be exchanged through ordinary facilities.
Whether it is salesman, vegetable seller, dairy seller, newspaper seller, tea seller and bargainer, it can be used without any hassle.
I have stressed the efforts to make this method more accessible.
All banks are engaged in it.
Now we have also repealed additional fees for online business and we have brought all such taxes related to the card to strengthen the idea of non-communicable society, which you might have seen in the newspapers in the last 2-4 days.
My young friends, despite all this, it is indecisive throughout a generation.
I am grateful that you all are associated with this great task.
I am looking at you all, the poems, the poems, the poems, the cartoons, the new imagination, the humour, the creative news of Whatsapp.
When we look at the creativity of our younger generations among the challenges, I see a fundamental infrastructure emerged amongst you today, just as the characteristics of the soil of this soil of India have emerged once in battlefield.
But, my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work.
Yes, I once again say that I need your help, you and millions of young people of this country will do this work.
Today, the first pledge is that you will be a part of the society that is not a transformation.
Please give up all the technology for online costs on your mobile phone.
You should be led by the unprecedented society, the disaster arising out of the net of the streets, the movement to release the country from corruption, the movement to free the black money, the movement to free the people from problems of the people.
Once you have learned how the benefits of the rupee card are available to the people, the poor will give you blessings.
Within a month, we can stand as a new Hindustani. You can do this work through your mobile phone.
Go to 10 houses every day and connect 10 houses every day.
I invite you, come, not just your support, but we will be the players who make this transformation and bring about the transformation.
We move forward in this war that provides freedom from black money and corruption to the nation.
This country has created a big revolution.
My heartiest youngsters, I once again ask you to take this movement forward.
I call upon all of you to participate in this work every school, college, university, national student force and national welfare programme in a social way.
We will take this task forward.
We all have an opportunity to serve the best of the country, and do not let this good thing go to the golden opportunity.
My dear brothers and sisters, today, the birth anniversary of Harivash Rai Bachchan, a great poet of the country, has given a message for the cleanliness movement today.
You might have noticed that the artists of this century, Amitabh ji, must have taken the cleanliness drive forward.
Harivash Rai ji identified himself through this tax.
I would like to see Harivansh Rai with my respect.
I express my gratitude to Amitab ji for connecting with the sound of Mann Ki Baat and for carrying out the cleaning work.
My dear countrymen, now through your thoughts, your sentiments and your letters, MyGov and narendramodiap continuously connect me with you.
Now Mann Ki Baat (Mann Ki Baat) is a sound at 11 o'clock, but in the state languages, it will start soon after completion.
Thank you very much.
Deepawali is being celebrated with fervor and fervor everywhere in India.
On 365 days, at any corner of the country, our country is going to celebrate a festival.
But all this is one of the things that we can clearly see, the entire journey of the festivals of India, its prosperity, its deepness and adaptation to the people is linked to a basic mantra - it is to move towards the individual society.
Festivals are responsible for everything like trees, trees, rivers, animals, mountains and birds.
Now we celebrate holidays on Sunday, but you must have noticed that the people of the previous generation, the working class, the fishermen, have spent their holidays on the days of full moon and amamass.
Science has proved to be the type of transformation in sea water during the days of Purnami and Amavas and the kind of impact on nature.
It also affects human mind.
That is, the tradition of celebrating holidays in our country is also accompanied by destruction and science.
Today, we celebrate the Deepawali Festival, as I have said earlier, we have to teach each of our festivals and give knowledge.
The Deepavali pavilion also gives us the message that the Deepavali pavilion should move from darkness to light.
This is not merely the darkness due to lack of light
The darkness, the darkness of illiteracy, the darkness of poverty, the darkness of social evils.
If we are able to get rid of the darkness of the individual, the darkness of the bitterness of the society by adopting the Deepawali initiation, then it can be aimed at spreading the light of Deepawali.
We all know that every corner of India, whether it is the largest wealthy house or the poorest of the poor, you can see that during the Deepavali festival, the cleanliness movement is shining in every family.
Cleanliness is seen every corner of the house.
He will also keep his soil mixed clean while the poor will have a soil stagnant but the Deepawali has come.
Canada's Prime Minister Deepavaliyya has shared his film with Twitzer.
The UK Prime Minister organised a welcome event to connect all the communities with Dipavali in London, which included himself
It can also be said that the UK is not a city without celebrating Diwali with great events.
The Prime Minister of Singapore shared a film in Instagram with great respect to the world.
Well, what do you know that film
16 female members of the Singapore Parliament are wearing a shovel of India and the film is a very popular film on the door of the Parliament.
All this was done on Deepavali.
I would like to say that Deepawali is a glittering day and it is a great day to encourage all the people of the world to move from darkness to light.
During the days of Deepawali, news about accidents, evils and periodic deaths is anxious.
One more problem is that when doctors are going to celebrate Deepawali with their families in large numbers, there is another problem.
I appeal to the parents and the defendants, particularly to keep in mind that there should be elders with them when the children burst up, and that there should be no misunderstanding.
The Deepavali Festival is celebrated for more days in our country.
This is not a day
Govardham Pooja, Pai Dhuj and Laf Panchami can be said to have longed up to the grand festival of Karthika Purnima, in a way it is a long time.
We are happy to celebrate the Deepawali Festival and prepare for Sad-Puja in Mussoorie too.
Sat-Puja Festival in the eastern part of India is a big festival.
In a way, it is celebrated as a big festival for 4 days, but it has a special significance - it provides a deep message to the society.
It is difficult to see the calculations that the Sun God gives us all, from whom we reach.
This sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers and the defence forces is emotionally awakened in my mind.
I want to share one thing from the world of these sentiments - we will dedicate this Deepavali to the defence forces.
I called upon the people of the country to participate in a movement called the message of Sandesh2Soldiers.
I would like to bow down to my head that there is no immigrant who is unprecedented in love with the soldiers of the country, the pride of the army and the pride of the security forces.
The media has also transformed this island festival into a day of thanks to the soldiers.
When we are in the mood, when we think of them then a new energy emerges even in those memories.
There is also a news that has multiplied power and the country has done it.
Some of them depicted pictures, shouted and produced cartoons.
I can imagine the amount of honour to the soldiers of my country.
These things have been identified at the Hashtag, Sandesh2soldiers.
I want to read the poems sent by Mr. Ashwini Kumar Sauhan.
Ashwini says: "I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I laugh, I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I laugh, I am laughing, all these are because of you.
I congratulate the people of the country for your livelihood.
My dear countrymen, the soldiers are filled at home and the soldiers are filled in the nearby house, a sister Shivani has sent me a phone call.
Let us ask you what the soldiers family want to say.
"Prime Minister, I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
Their families and their wives are doing great sacrifices with military officers and soldiers.
In a way, a good news has also been received for the entire military society.
My dear countrymen, Military Veeran is seen not only on the border but also at every stage of life.
You might have heard that the state of Himachal has been freed from the habit of open defecation.
Vikas is one of the names of Paradise. He belongs to the small village of Sirmaur district of Himachal.
Our soldiers from the Indian Deccan Border Army went to their village on holidays.
When he went to the village, there were discussions about the construction of toilets in the village panchayat.
It was found that some families had not been able to build toilets due to money laundering.
He immediately took his passage book and handed it over to the Panchayat head of Rs. 57,000, if there are no toilets in any 57 houses, if one family has a thousand rupees from my level, build 57 toilets and save the village from open defecation habits.
Vikas Thakur ji has shown that he has given Rs. 1000 to 57 families and has given a new power to the cleanliness movement.
This is why the state of Himachal has been freed from open defecation.
Similarly, in Kerala, I express my gratitude to the youth for this.
At the same time, the national student team's cadets came to the conclusion that the country's welfare workers and engineering students should build toilets.
These students walked on their shoulders throughout the day and went to the wilderness, all the things that were required to build toilets like bricks and cement.
They constructed toilets in the village through their labour and these youths freed from the habit of open defecation outside the small village in remote forests.
This is why Kerala is going to be an open state without excretion.
The state of Gujarat has announced that more than 150 municipalities have been freed from open defecation.
10 districts have been declared free from this habit.
But generally, these things are not taken care of.
Old schemes are being implemented, new schemes are being implemented, the next schemes are expected and this is going on.
The houses in which there is a gas layer in our country, those houses where there is electricity, they dont need soil.
But whoever is worried about the government, kerosene is being provided, gas is being provided, electricity is being provided and intermediaries are getting the opportunity to pay the money.
See how a big change will be made, the sale of waste markets will be stopped, the environment will benefit, our foreign exchange will be saved and the people will also be able to increase the facilities.
Yes, there is no doubt that there will be difficulty for middle class and non-Many.
My desperate countrymen, Gandhiji has always been a guide to us.
He decides the status quo in every case where to go and how to travel.
We need to pay attention to the aspirations of the poor people of the country.
We have to take steps one after another to liberate them from the left.
Whatever our old thoughts, the society should be liberated from the other side of men and women.
Now schools have toilets for women children and toilets for children.
This is a good time for our women children to achieve the status of an indifferent India.
Though vaccination is being done at the government level, many lakhs of children have to be freed from the vaccination and are targeted for diseases.
The Mission Indradhanush vaccination is being conducted for children who are freed from vaccination, which provides children the power to get rid of serious diseases.
We have been in the 21st century but the situation of darkness in the village is no longer continuing, a big campaign to bring electricity to the village is progressing successfully.
After so many years of the country's independence, how will she be healthy when the poor mother cooks food in the steam and steals 400 cigarettes of smoke in her body
Efforts are being made to liberate 5 crore families from smoke and we are on the path of success.
Small businessmen, small labourers, vegetable sellers, dairy sellers and discontinued shopkeepers buy loans from the neighbours.
Mudra Yojana, Stand-Up Yojana and Jan Dhan Yojana are successful movements that have been launched to get rid of the borrower of interest.
Direct payment of money to banks through Aadhaar, direct payment of money to the owners and beneficiaries.
There is a good opportunity to get rid of Dharkars in the lives of the common people.
We have to fulfil our hearts with the memories of the human beings.
But a telephone call from Punjab touched my heart with pain. "Principal, please, sir, I speak from Punjab.
Sir, on 31st October, Sardar Patel jis birthday.
Sardar Patel ji spent his entire life uniting the country and he has also achieved success in this goal.
I don't know what the country's misfortune is, and on that day, Mrs. Indira Gandhi was assassinated.
After that, we all know well how the events took place in the country.
I want to know your views on how to prevent such unfortunate events.
My beloved countrymen, this pain is not just a human being.
After Sanakya, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel has done the task of uniting the country.
Sardar Patel ji tried to unite, because of his main objective of unity, he was ruled by many, but his path of unity was not slightly smooth.
But on the birthday of the same Sardar, thousands of Sardars and thousands of Sardars were killed after the assassination of Smt. Indira Gandhi.
On the birthday of the man who spent his entire life for unanimity, the iniquity built on the serpents is painful for us on one side of history.
But even in the midst of these disturbances, we have to move ahead with the liberal mantra of unity.
Unity in variation is the greatest strength of the country.
Many languages, many castes, many clothes, several food processings, but isolation in different ways, the strength of India is the speciality of India.
Every generation has a privilege and every government is responsible for finding an opportunity for unity and promoting unity in every corner of our country.
We have also avoided separatist thoughts and dividing nature and save the country.
Sardar ji has given us a united India and it is our responsibility to make it an excellent India.
The main mantra of integration is the strong foundation of the greatest India.
Sardar ji's life journey started in the farmers' struggle.
He's a farmer's son.
Today we are questioning the name of AMUL.
Everything of Amul is well-known in India and abroad.
But many people are supposed to know that the milk manufacturers cooperative union was formed because of Sardar's perspective.
An example of how Sardar ji worked for the welfare of the farmers, the immensely immense immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immense.
I express my heartfelt congratulations to Sardar Saheb.
On 31st October, we will remember Sardar ji wherever we are, and we will fulfill our commitment to unity.
My dear countrymen, Karthika Purnima is celebrated in this Deepawali sequence.
Guru Nanak Dev ji's blessings are for the entire human society, which is not only spoken to India but also to the entire human society, it is still a guide.
This is the news of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
Peace, unity and goodwill are the key mantras.
The goal of liberating society from variety, illiteracy and indecency was that of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Your dreams, your commitments and all kinds of success.
In the past, in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir, an extremist attack took place and we lost 18 soldiers of our country.
I extend my best wishes to all the brave and brave soldiers.
This passionate event has boiled the entire nation.
The nervous system of the people of the country enhances condolences and anger
This loss is not just for the families of those soldiers who lost their children, lost their brothers and lost their husbands.
This loss is being experienced throughout the country.
Therefore, the people of the country, I still tell you that the culprits will be punished and they will not be saved from the punishment.
My dear countrymen, we have great faith in our army.
They will break every surroundings with their supremacy and 125 crore people of the country will express their supremacy in the way they live peacefully.
We are very proud of our army.
Today, I want to talk to the people of Kashmir, especially with the people of Kashmir.
The citizens of Kashmir have begun to understand the opponents of the country well.
At this time when they are beginning to understand the truth, they have removed such evil forces from them and started traveling on the path of peace.
Every mother-in-law wants to start functioning at a fast pace.
Over the past few days, business has also started doing well.
We know that peace, unity and harmony can be the solution to our problems, our progress can be the path of development.
For our future generations, we must take up new peaks of development.
I am sure we can make the future generations of Kashmir the best possible way to solve each problem by discussing peacefully.
The responsibility of the security administration of the Kashmiri citizens.
The administration has to take some steps to build law and order.
I also appeal to the defence forces of the country to ensure the peaceful life of the common people of Kashmir and to follow them well.
Sometimes those who differ from our views advance new ideas.
Shershvardhan, a young man who is studying the 11th class, has presented a different view of my attention.
'After your extremist attack, there was a lot of concern in my mind, a frustration arose in my mind, but I didn't know the way to do anything.
Harsh Vardhan, in this sensitive environment, in such a small age, you are thinking positively, it gives my heart a pleasure.
But Harsh Vardhan is one of the greatest values of anger in the minds of the people of the country.
This is the expression of the feelings of the people of the country.
Yes, you have forwarded a positive approach.
But you know that Lal Bahadur Shastri was the leader of the country during the war in 1965, this feeling was seen to be enhanced throughout the country and it was a passionate and patriotic dream.
There was a commitment to do something in every citizen's mind.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried to make these feelings of the country very excellently.
He gave a mantra called Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and encouraged the people of the country to work towards the work of the nation.
One more attempt to express the country's patriotism among the flames of bombings must be made by every citizen, which was presented by Lal Bahadur Shastri.
While Gandhians were guiding the freedom struggle, he successfully worked to encourage the creative work of the society when the movement was required for another base during the rapid dream of the freedom movement.
We and our army will shut down our duties, the people of our country and every citizen will contribute a constructive part of our country with the spirit of patriotism when the country will surely take the new peaks.
My dear countrymen, the history of our sportspersons who went to participate in the Para Olympic Games is the victory of human encouraging.
Varun Viswanathan ji has recorded that our sportspersons have done a humble job in the Prime Minister's Office and has requested you to tell it in your heart.
Not only for both of you but for every citizen of the country, there has been an integral connection with the sportspersons who participated in Para Olympics.
The Para Olympics competitions and achievements of our sportspersons have completely transformed the attitude of humanitarian perspective and the attitude of the handicapped.
I will never forget the words of our brother Deepa Malik ji after winning the medal.
This time, 19 sportspersons participated in the Para Olympics including three women of our country.
In comparison to other sports, while playing handicapped persons, their talent and their talent in sports is greater.
Mariappan Thangavelu won the gold medal in the high-level contest.
Marianappan lost his right leg at the age of just five.
Even poverty could not stop his attitude.
He is not a resident in a big city, nor a middle class family or a wealthy family.
At the age of 21, he didn't mean physical disorders, but helped only stress and stressed.
While they have raised our feelings, they have also changed the perspective of looking at the handicapped.
Can anyone imagine that the opponents can break the replies for the predatorial Olympics
This time it took place.
Abdel Latin Pabkar, a resident of Algeria, has made a record of gold mess in the Olympics contest of 1500 metres.
Once again, I congratulate our sportspersons, I would like to state that India will travel in the direction of making a positive plan for its development, for the Bara Olympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a very different experience in Gujarat's Navsari.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mega Camp for handicapped persons, in which many world records were created.
I had to meet a young girl who was not seen, and she was named Gauri Shardul - a small child who came from the long forest area of Nang district, and her mind was all over Ramagovia.
And she told me some parts thereof: and the people were astonished when I had spoken it before the congregation.
The Government of India has made a world record in the neo-synergy and I consider it one of the greatest.
The activity of 600 unskilled handicapped manufacturers was carried out within an hour.
This placed in Kinnas World Achievement Book.
It is a matter of great pride for our countrymen that the creation of 3 World Achievements by the handicapped people on the same day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on the 2nd of October, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission.
I would like to recall that cleanliness should be our nature, every citizen should be the duties and the dirt should be seen as a succour.
Today, when 2 years will be completed on 2nd October, I am sure that there has been awareness about cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore people of the country.
Similarly, everybody has tried to take one foot in accordance with the saying that we will take one foot towards cleanliness.
That is, 125 crore feet of the country have moved towards cleanliness.
If the direction to go is correct, it is guaranteed that it will be good for the bed.
Be it a common citizen, a ruler, a government office, a road, a bus or a railway station, a school or a college, a pilgrimage, a hospital, from children to adults, the poor, the farmers and women of the village have all contributed towards cleanliness.
Media friends have also done a constructive job.
This progress is not going to happen, we have to see further progress.
This is very important
So far, about 2 crore 48 lakhs, that is, about 2,12 crore toilets have been constructed, and in the coming years there is a commitment to build more than 2,12 crore toilets.
In Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala, the habit of open defecation will be resolved soon.
When I had recently visited the battlefield of Gandhijis birthplace in Gujarat, the officials had told me that the date of October 2 has come to an end to open defecation habit.
Come on, people, we will see the progress of the word garlic.
My young brothers and sisters are fully using technology today and I want to present a scheme before them.
The Government of India has arranged a telephone number of 1969 to know how the Swachh Bharat Mission is located in your city.
You can use it completely, especially the young generations.
The Government of India urges the Corporate World to share your share in the future.
Give support to the young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
We can use them as clean India partners and Swachh Bharat Fellows across the districts.
If this Swachh Bharat Mission stops with the government then it cannot be improved and it cannot be fulfilled naturally.
Wealth from waste is also important.
Therefore, along with the cleanliness drive, we have to move towards the direction from waste to ferry.
The fertilizers have been requested to buy a compost fertilizer from the waste.
The farmers who want to be involved in natural farming should see their way to get this fertilizer.
Those who are thinking of improving the wealth of their land, those who are interested in the welfare of the land, those who have suffered a lot from chemical fertilizers, they should be given this fertilizer even if they need a little.
Amitabh Bachchan has been contributing to this work as a business ambassador.
Throughout the country, Ministers, Chief Ministers, Municipal Mayors and commissioners, all are going to have a deep consultation on cleanliness.
What can be achieved by technology
What can be the financial model
I am going to discuss all things.
I see that there is a continuous innovative news about cleanliness.
On one day I read in the press that students of Gujarat University went to 107 villages and worked as awakening the construction of toilets.
The Government of India has also prepared a schedule throughout the year in its ministries.
Each sector has to put an end to cleanliness for 15 days.
In the coming October, from 1st to 15th October, three sectors like Water Supply and Health Sector, Panchayati Raj Department and Rural Development will be working together to create a clean-up program in their respective regimes.
In the last two weeks of the month of October, from 16th to 31th October, three more ministries such as agriculture and farmers' welfare, food processing industries and consumer affairs will carry out the cleaning of their respective government borders.
I appeal to the citizens that if your work is related to this sector then you should also join it.
You might have noticed that now the cleanliness-related research movement is going on.
Earlier, 73 cities were reviewed how cleanliness was achieved, which was presided over by the people of the country.
There are more than 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh, now their system, we are staying behind in every city and there is a belief that the next time we have to improve.
There is a compete environment related to cleanliness.
We have to give all the contributions that the citizens can make to this movement.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It has been 2 years since the Swachh Bharat Mission.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepawali, I have been asking you to buy some doorsteps.
Once again, I ask every family to buy a door and then light will burn in the houses of the poor.
On this 2nd October, on Sunday, as a citizen, we cannot take any action related to cleanliness.
I urge you to add yourselves to the cleanliness work for 2 hours and 4 hours and share a photo with me in the Prime Minister's Office.
If you have a video, share that video.
With the efforts of all of us, once again this movement will be strengthened across the country, a new pace will be created.
Remembering Gandhi Ji and Lal Bahadur Sastry, we will fulfill our commitment to do something for the country.
In the past, the responses made by the countrymen to my request to break the gas subsidy are one of the most inspiring responsibilities for the lives of the country.
This is a movement to collect food items and clothing for the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers landed on the streets and grabbed the old sports equipment in the family and brought them to Anganwadi in the poor people's homeland.
Thousands of workers like me, who are driven by political thoughts, are describing those political ideals.
Today, the centenary of Din Dayal Upadhyaya ji, the political ideal associated with the roots of India, the idea of commemorating the Bharat Cultural Partnership, the political philosophy and the humanitarian philosophy of that perspective begins.
Sarvejan Hittai, Sarvejan Sukkai, Sabka Saath, Sabka Saath, Sabka Saath, Sabka Sabka Saath, Sabka Sabka Saath, Sabka Sabka Saath, Sabka Sabka Sabka Saath.
Gandhiji also spoke about the benefits of the people living in the market.
How to bring the benefits of development to the poor in the market
Deendayal presented the entire economic programme in a single phrase that worked for each hand, water in every field.
The country should celebrate his birth centenary as the best of the poor.
Everyone's attention to society and the government should be inspired by how to bring the benefits of development to the poor.
I extend my best wishes to Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, who was a messenger of our thoughts.
How the common man of this country has encouraged me
What are the desires and aspirations of the common man of this country
The registration of goods recorded in my mind and thought is emerging in the voice of my mind.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Akashwani for my thoughts and making all efforts to bring it in all languages.
They summed up letters after Mann Ki Baat and gave suggestions and shouted at the doors of the government, showcasing the problems of the government, the Akashwani produced such letters and brought representatives from the state level and set up a base for solving problems.
The voice of mind does not stop with a 15-20 minute conversation, which is a new opportunity for social transformation.
What can be more happy than this
Therefore, I congratulate all those who have contributed in this victory and congratulate them.
My dear countrymen, next week, Navaratri, Durga Puja and Vijaya Dashmi will be going to organize Deepawali and a different environment will take place across the country.
The unity of society is the power of the country.
Be it Navaratria or Durga Puja, we will think of making this power a means of worship and social unity.
We will follow the sacred days of Navaratri and Durga Puja, in the minds of the thoughts of peace, unity and goodwill to move the country towards new peaks.
We will celebrate Vijayadhasamy with success.
This day is being celebrated as National Sports Day throughout the country.
He played an important role in providing gold medal to India during the Olympic Games in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
At that time it was only 10 minutes to get the end of the lamp.
Dyanchand ji put 3 bucks in that 10 minutes, and I put a bucket in response to the wound.
My countrymen, whenever there is a time for Mann Ki Baat, there are many suggestions in MyGov Internet or narendramodiap.
They are different.
But this time I had more demands to comment on Rio Olympics.
I am very impressive when I look at such an interest in Rio Olympics in public minds, such awakening, and the pressure on the Prime Minister of India to speak about it.
Even after cricket, Indians are very interested in other sports, so waking up, so many information is known.
Sachin has written that you must talk about a request, this time in the voice of Mann Ki Baat about Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmaar.
One of these women is North India, one from South India, one from East India, the other from the other from India.
It seems that the daughters of India have accepted the responsibility of collecting pride in the country.
In MyGov Internet, Shekhar Tagore has written that we could have worked even better in the Olympics.
He added, "My best wishes to you for the 2 medals we have received in Rio, honourable Modi sir.
There is a need to take a long journey in sports.
Our parents are focusing on reading today.
In society, even today, sports are seen with the perspective of time.
We have to change this idea.
There is a need to encourage the society.
Who else can give this work better than you
Likewise, Mr. Sathyaprakash Mehra also wrote in the narendramodiap - in the Mann Ki Baat programme, he called for stress on the need for extra-curricultural activities.
In a way, the same sentiment reflected in thousands of writings.
It is true that there is no alternative to our opponents that we cannot act.
We have only got two tensions in the medal.
But if you don't get medication, you can see that for the first time in many cases, the sportspersons of India have shown a considerable talent.
Our Abinav Pindra ji secured 4th position in the shooting segment and lost his tension at a very small distance.
Similarly, in the tennis competitions, it took place in connection with Sania Mirza-Rohan Bopanna.
We have worked well in the Athletics section this time.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar has been able to compete for the last trick field.
For the first time in the last 36 years, men have won the job out position in the Hackips.
Vikas Krishna Yadav came to the final stage in Baxing, but he could not get a bronze tension.
Many soldiers, for example, the activity of Ashok, Tattu Bhognal and his Das was excellent.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do more.
But if we continue to work so far, we may have to go back to despair.
I convey my decree on the formation of a committee.
The Government of India will absorb it deeply and will consider what kind of actions are there in the world.
The programme will be implemented in which sector we can work well.
We have to create our projects with a perspective of 2020, 2025 and 2028.
I would like to appeal to all Indian citizens interested in sending your suggestions to me at the narendramodiap.
Send your suggestions after the State Governments have discussed.
My dear countrymen, on September 5, the Teacher's Day.
I was able to learn a lot with these small boys.
As for me, on 5th September is not only a teacher's day but also a day of education.
But this time I had to go to the G-20 Summit, it seemed as if I couldn't express my feelings in my heart today.
The more important place for mother in life, the more important is the teacher's place.
We have seen teachers who are more interested in us than us.
They dedicate their lives to their readers and their students.
Today, I see Gobichand as a sportsperson and as an excellent teacher.
On Teacher's Day, I congratulate Bullela Gopichand for his supreme sports and his joy in the victory of the players.
The contribution of teachers is always felt in the lives of all of us.
On 5th September, the former President of India, Dr.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnans birthday
He has always tried to live as a teacher, even though he had achieved any condition in his life.
Not only that, he shall never die, but the student that is in good teacher.
In that month, there will be comments on the books read and quotes from them.
It has been observed that I've done my whole month in his sight is not correct.
Anything is going to tell me in the classroom.
Even today, he is giving me a kind of far-reaching education.
I am surprised to see his signature at the age of 90 and how he can write such a pearl in this old age.
Because my signature is so bad that if someone writes beautifully, then there is a lot of respect in my mind.
Your experience will also be like my experience.
Whatever good you have been given by your teachers in your life, if you tell it a world class then there will be a change in the attitude of teachers and a glorious gloriousness.
It is our responsibility to increase the dignity of teachers in society.
If you have been photographing with your teachers, if there is an event with your teacher, then you must share with your teacher in the narendramodiap.
It is a matter of valuable value to see the contribution of the teachers of the country in the eyes of students.
But when we talk about the democracies, it is natural to return our memories to Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
The tradition of celebrating Democratic Chaturthi is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak.
He changed the timetable through the Democracy as a day of national awareness and became a day of social culture.
Democratic square is discussing all the questions that touch social life, which created a new upheaval and a new development in society.
Not only that, the mantra that he gave is: Switzerland should be our birth centre and power should be given to the freedom struggle.
Not only in Maharashtra but in today's country, Democratic Chaturthi is not being celebrated socially.
They are discussing public matters, conducting articles and running competitions to goals.
The scenes that are present here will showcase the artistic aspects of touching society.
In a way, the movement that makes everyone aware is being done through socially democracies.
Lokmanya Tilak Swaraj has given us a mantra of our birth.
But now we are in free India.
Come on, I'm calling you.
It is true that the movements are the powers of the society.
They provide a new life to individuals and society.
Life is not possible, but it has to be changed according to the need of the hour.
I can see that this time too many have written about Democracy and Durga Pooja.
They are concerned about the environment.
Shri Shankar Narayan Prishand has called upon Moti ji, not to use the children's statues made by the Plaster of Paris.
The idols made by the Plaster of Paris are not suitable for the environment, but many others have clearly expressed their concerns.
I appeal to all of you to use the statues of the soil and the statues of Durga, to redeem our old tradition.
He's gonna get rid of Ganesha's problems.
In such a situation, we should not create a goddess statue that causes trouble.
I don't know how you will take it, but I'm not just saying it, but many say it.
An architect of Pune, Mr. Abhijit Todbale, the organisations of Kolhapur - Nisark Mitra, Vikyan Prabodini, Nisark Katta of Vidarpa, Gyan Prabodini of Pune, Kirgawasa RA Raja of Mumbai.
Several such organisations and individuals make more efforts to build the statues of Ganesh in sand and campaign for them.
A democracies that do not devastate the environment are also a social service.
There is still time for Durga Puja.
And this kind of silken idol will be employed by the family to perform idols.
We resolve that the environment will also be protected because they are made on the soil of our ponds and rivers.
It is natural for all the people of the country to be proud that Mother Teresa, who served for the poor of India, is now going to be given the title of the Holy Ghost.
We have got the blessings of every moment from the holy shrines, the sages, the priests and the great men.
We have received something from them and we are learning and understanding good things.
My dear countrymen, when progressive thirst is a movement, how big will it transform
People's power is seen as the Make in India.
In the past, the Government of India has made a successful effort to clean the Ganga with the help of 5 State Governments.
We called the leaders of the villages living on the banks of river Ganga to a meeting in Allahabad on 20th January this month.
They were men and women.
I extend my best wishes to all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India, who have completed this great task.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chief Ministers of the 5 State Governments, who have helped in connecting the power of the people with the Ganga to take a very important step.
My dear countrymen, some things, sometimes touch my heart and sometimes there is a great respect in my heart on those who create such a chance.
On 15th July, in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh, 1.
More than 25 lakh students wrote socially to their parents.
Some used to say that in English, some in Hindi and some in Chhattisgarh, their parents had to have toilets in their homes.
They had asked for setting up toilets and some children had written that even if you don't celebrate my birthday this year, it wouldn't be sure, but definitely build toilets.
Children from seven to 17 years of age performed this work.
There is a 16-year-old Mallamma in Koppal district of Karnataka, who has performed Satyagraha against her family.
And he did nothing to do with himself, or to wear good clothes, or to eat sweets
Mallamma's philosophy is for us to have a toilet in our house.
See the glory of village leader Mohammed Shahfi, who made an arrangement of Rs. 18,000 and built a toilet within a week.
But everybody has been associated with it in some way and everybody has been enjoying golden contributions.
I also appeal to the TV channels to make such films and organize competitions.
There is no need for a big studio to produce a film, no big camera
In today's era, you can produce a film using your mobile phone.
Our dignitaries, President Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated a new event called Akashwani Mythri Channel in Kolkata.
Many people can weep in the heart of the question that the President of India should launch a radio chain.
Bangladesh is our neighbour.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal have been fighting with the same cultural heritage.
Akashwani Mythri and Bangladesh Pedar radio along the borders will transform each others programmes and people speaking on both sides will be happy to hear Akashavani.
The biggest contribution of Akashwani is to connect people with the people.
The President has inaugurated this.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Bangladesh that is associated with us to fulfill this task.
I congratulate the friends of the Akashwani for their contribution in foreign policy as well.
My dear countrymen, you must have made me the Prime Minister of the country, but I am also a man like you
Therefore, sometimes my mind is touched by some emotional events.
Such an emotion provides innovative energy and a new concept that gives the people of the country an inspiration to achieve something.
A letter that came to me a few days ago touched my heart.
This is written by a mother of about 84 years old
If the retired teacher had asked him not to mention his name, I would have certainly mentioned his name.
I also broke the subsidy, and I forgot about it, as you requested to break the subsidy for gas.
I believe that the letter written by the Prime Minister of India is similar to the Padma Shri Award.
You will be aware that all those who broke the gas subsidy have written a letter from my side and some of my delegates have tried to give it to those who broke the subsidy.
It is my effort to write a letter to more than one crore people.
My dear countrymen, we have suffered due to dryness last year, but in August this year, it has caused trauma of continuous floods.
There was a flood again in some parts of the country.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the local organisations, the social organizations and the citizens have tried to afford their livelihood.
But the tragedy remains reminded of some of the events that took place between the floods.
Let us recall how the power to live together, how will it be in the month of August this year.
In August 2016, more than 90 political parties across the country, including all political parties in the Parliament, passed the law on goods service tax.
The appreciation for the completion of this will serve all political parties.
This is an excellent example of what would be beneficial if all political parties joined together in one direction.
Likewise, all the political parties of the country have joined the situation in Kashmir and discussed the Kashmir issue in a single voice.
Through this, the message was made to the world and to the separatist powers, and their understanding was expressed to the people of Kashmir.
After interacting with all political parties in Kashmir, one thing was well known, if I say that it should be suppressed in two words, they are loneliness and harmony.
Both of these words were magnificent.
Whether there is any death in Kashmir, it might be the life of a young man or the life of the security forces, the loss is ours, the loss is ours, the trust of our country, the faith of the people of 125 crore people, the faith of the people from the village head to the Prime Minister of the country.
One day, it should be retaliated to the uneasy children who have propagated small children to create unrest in Kashmir.
I am confident of 125 crore people of the country.
Yesterday morning I got the opportunity to spend a few moments with the youth of Delhi and I am confident that in the days to come, the inspiration for sports will increase the enthusiasm and jealousy of every young man across the country.
We all know that the biggest Kumbh of World Sports is going to be held in a few days.
The word Rio continues to resonate in our ears.
Yesterday, the Government of India had made an excellent arrangement to play, live and play and develop in Delhi.
Today, in any part of the country, we will work in some way to encourage our sportspersons.
I am ready to do this work from your side.
The Prime Minister of India is ready to be a postalist to bring your greetings to our sportspersons.
Come, let us all proudly make every sportsperson in the days to come, encourage their efforts.
Today, when I am talking about the Rio Olympics, I read a poem written by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a poet from Punjab Central University.
Like him, many other poets may have written more poems in this regard, some may have made them songs and songs in every language, but today I want to share my poems written by Suraj ji with you.
And thou shalt smite the gold, and the silver, and the silver and the brass.
Suraj ji, I dedicate your feelings to all these sportspersons, and I extend my best wishes to you all from my level and from the level of 125 crore countrymen and our flag in Rio.
Mr.
But whenever Abdul Kalam's name is being taken, a future picture of a skilled India like science, technology and missile showcases our eyes.
In that way, did Abdul Kalam ask what efforts are being made by your government to realize their dreams
And if we want to make our way musical, then we must do research and innovation which is the life of technology.
If the research and innovations are not built, the way the dirt starts flowing in the stagnant water, the technology will become a burden for us.
If we are not doing research and innovation, we are dependent on the old technology, then we will become Kalawati in the changing era.
Therefore, our younger generation should sow milk and technologies and the dairy attraction of research and the government is making several efforts for this.
That is why I call it Let us try to innovate and innovate.
When I call AIM, it means Atal Innovation Mission.
If we want to create the next generation innovators, then we should link our youngsters with this scheme.
Therefore, the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
Wherever such miraculous centres are set up in schools, 10 lakh rupees will be provided and more than 10 lakh rupees will be provided for maintenance in 5 years.
Similarly, the Incubation Centre is directly connected with the innovators.
If we have a powerful, sufficient incubation centre, we get an organisation necessary to build innovations, check ups for start-ups and concentrate them.
While it is necessary to establish a new building centre, it is also important to strengthen the old centres.
In our daily life there are problems in our eyes.
Now we need to find technical solutions.
As Atal Grand Challenges, we have been inviting the younger generations of the country to do research, innovate and come to address the problems faced by you people.
The Government of India wants to encourage and give special awards to the technology that has been identified to solve our problems.
It is also a matter of great happiness that when we talk about the tinkering lab, we have applied more than 13,000 schools and when we spoke of the Creation Centre, more than 4,000 institutions without education and education have come forward to set up such centres.
I am convinced that it is the real tribute to Abdul Kalam to find solutions through technology and to simplify the problems faced by us in research, innovations and in our daily life.
The extent to which our younger generations pay attention to these, their share in the cooking of modern India of the 21st century will be very great and it will be the true ritual that we pay for Abdul Kalam's memories.
My dear countrymen, some time ago, we had a lot of concern about the famine in our hearts and now the rains are enjoying and news of floods is also coming.
The state governments and the central government are working closely with the shoulders to help those affected by floods.
Though there were some hurdles due to the rains, there is an increase in every human mind because there is rain and agriculture as the center of all our economic activity.
Sometimes the diseases that can cause us to suffer from lifetime.
But if we wake up, if we go ahead, then the ways to avoid them are also easier.
Take the fever of dengue .
We can defend us from dengue fever.
I request all of you to be aware that even if the government, hospitals and doctors are doing their jobs, we should not allow dengue in our homes, in our families, and any disease caused by water.
My dear countrymen, I want to turn your attention into a problem.
The extent to which life becomes urgent and faster, sometimes it becomes untimely to think of us.
If you want a few moments you can get relief, but the doctors should stop the habit of taking antibiotics without recommendation.
And there has been a problem - if the doctor has suggested to take 15 antibiotic pills in 5 days, please complete the recommendation in the days of the doctor's suggestion.
If we leave that there is no need for health, the bacteria are beneficial for the bacteria and they become stronger.
It is called antibiotic resistance in medical interaction, so it is important to follow the rules that take them as much as antibiotic and use them.
Government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance
You might have noticed that the antibiotics sold at present have been drawn up to a crown of red on the bandage, it is only to make you aware of it.
When we talk about health, I want to add one more thing to it.
The health of pregnant mothers in our country is sometimes very worried.
Every year about 3 crore women in our country conceive, but some mothers die during childbirth and some die during childbirth.
Sometimes both mother and child die.
Though it is true that the maternal mortality rate has declined in the last ten years, it is still unable to save the lives of pregnant mothers.
Any kind of breastfeeding, pregnancy-related infections, high blood pressure etc.
In view of all this, the Government of India has been implementing a new movement for the past few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matridva Abhiyan, that is, Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matri's Safe Maternity Programme.
My medical brothers and sisters cannot dedicate themselves to this work for 12 days in a year
In the past several people have written a letter to me.
I believe you will surely add you to it.
My dear countrymen, today, the concerns of climate change, global warming and environment are increasing throughout the world.
Discussions are taking place between the people of the country and the world.
India has been strengthening this view for centuries.
And Lord Krishna, and Achvath, saying, Sarvavrukshanaam, that is, I am a tree in the trees.
There is no vegetation that is succumbed to succumbency, nasty, i.e. without medical quality.
The example of a woman Sonal from Pune attracted my attention, which gave my heart.
The synonym of the Mahabharata is said to be performing the duties of Maced Celebrity in the mountain, even in the heavens of the trees, which Sonal has accepted not only the wishes of his mother and father but also the desires of the entire society.
Krishi Khandu Maruti Mahatre of Narayanpur village in Jhunner, Pune, Maharashtra
Several such efforts are being made by many people.
During the period when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I have seen a large number of pilgrims coming to the Amba Devi Mandir during the month of Badra.
Once a social service organisation has given a tree tree to those who come to the temple, and if they carry it in your village, Mother Ampa will continue to give you her blessings.
The number of thousands of pilgrims who had come here gave millions of trees that year.
The temples can also start the tradition of planting trees in the rainy season instead of Prasad.
This can lead to a mass movement on tree walking.
I ask my farmer brothers again and again why shouldn't we grow coconut trees instead of wasting our lands by planting trees on the borders of our suburbs
Today, we have to import only one tree from abroad to build houses and chairs in India.
The government has created a mass movement and Rajasthan is a desert area.
There is also a large number of forest festivals being celebrated and 25 lakh trees have been resolved.
It is not a small thing to see 25 million trees in Rajasthan.
This is a big challenge for those who know about the land of Rajasthan.
In Andhra Pradesh, it has been decided to increase green cover by 50 percent by 2029.
Even in Gujarat, the Van Mahotsav is a very popular heritage.
In Gujarat this year, several schemes have been implemented in various ways like Mana forest, Ekta forest and Sheeth forest, in which work has been done between crores of crores of trees.
Multilateral agreements are being made in several sectors, including royal deeplomacy, unconnected organs, trade discussions and security related conversations.
But for me, the South African journey is like a pilgrimage.
It is natural to raise the memories of Gandhiji and Nelson Mandela when you think of South Africa.
When the words of Akims, Nesam and Magnital come in the ears of the world, the faces of Gandhians and Mandela will be seen before us.
I had to go to the Phoenix settlement, part of my South African visit, which is known as Sarvodaya.
I am happy to visit the Peter Marriedsburg Railway Station, where Gandhiji had visited the train and the train that had sown Mohandas as Gandhians.
This time I had the opportunity to meet many important people who sacrificed their youth for equality and equality.
They fought shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela and spent 20-25 years in prisons with him.
In a way, they sacrificed their entire youth, I got the greatest opportunity to see the great people who are close to Nelson Mandela, Ahmad Khata ji, Laloo (CHEEBA), Sipa ji, George Besos ji, Roney Casters.
When I was speaking to them, when they were asking for their prison experiences, no bitterness was found in their minds, no tragicness was found.
The feeling of equality and equality is the way they move towards a bright future.
Come, let us take pride in remembering these Indians who have lived the key mantras of our lives in South Africa too.
Recently, I read in a news article that a woman lying on a fraud and unconscious e-mail web lost 11 lakh rupees and committed suicide.
I am very sad about the condition of a woman and her family.
I want to know what your views are about such fraudulent emails.
A new technology harvesting system is spreading around the world.
The way technology plays a very big role in the economy, its misuse is also increasing.
If you want to get a huge amount from abroad, if you want to get it in bank accounts of Rs. 2 lakhs for the bondage solution, this person has sent a person who has suffered a loss of 2 lakh rupees in his life without worrying about anything.
Anyone who can prepare and send a robust letter text, get your credit card number and debit card number, and switch your bank accounts through technology.
This is a new kind of fraud and this is a digital fraud.
I believe that we should save ourselves from this jeopardy, I want to be awake, if such letters come then we should share them with those who know us and friends and help them wake up.
My dear countrymen, when the Parliament session continues, I have the opportunity to meet many people of the country.
I had a pleasant experience during such a meeting.
Some students from Alikar met me.
The excitement of the girl was running across the shore, they brought a huge album, and they were shouting at their faces.
They had brought the films that have beautifully decorated the Aligarh railway station.
They constructed a layer plantation built by plastic bottles at the railway station and created a new size for the station.
If you are likely to go to Aligarh, then definitely visit the railway station.
This kind of information related to several railway stations in India has come to me. People from those regions are decorating their regional arts on the walls of the railway stations.
One feels a new feeling.
This is an example of how people can transform through their contribution.
My best wishes to all those who are engaged in this kind of work in the country, especially to my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of many festivals starts in our country during the rainy season.
And you shall dwell in your houses, and in your releases.
The Raksha Bandhan Festival is very important.
Like last year, this year, during Rakshabandhan, cannot you afford the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Jeevan Bima Yojana for mothers and sisters of the country
Brothers and sisters, in life, give a gift that your sister really feels safe.
Be it cooking in our houses or doing homework, we may have sacked a lady or a poor mother's daughter.
During this Rakshabandhan Festival, cannot they also be awarded the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Suraksha Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Jeevan Jyoti Jeevan Bima Yojana
My dear countrymen, many of us will be born after the release of the country.
We can create such an environment.
The Independence Day is not a programme of governments, it should be of the people of the country.
Like Deepawali, we have to celebrate this day as a festival.
In collaboration with the vision of patriotism, I want to do something positive.
You can tell the people of the country that I invite you to make it clear from the Red Fort base.
I don't want to be the Prime Minister's comments from the Red Fort.
The ramparts of the Red Fort should be the feelings of 125 crore people.
Many people are planning several events on holidays.
Awareness spreads in many villages
Someone told me a few days ago that the villagers of Hivre Bazar village Panchayat in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra and the people of the village had taken an emotional look at the problem of water.
There may be several villages who want to save water, but after talking to the farmers, they have changed the entire cropping pattern and cultivation system.
Whatever crop is used in more water, it may be Kambagha or peasant, it is decided not to produce such crops.
It's simple to hear, but it's not so easy.
But look at my farmer brothers and sisters, because they need more water, don't take a bowl, they have left it immediately.
They cannot cultivate fruits and vegetables all the time, that is, they only crop the water required at least.
They have succeeded in their own efforts to deal with the problem of water by several ends such as sparkling, drops of water harvesting, rain water harvesting and water recharge.
Well, I've spoken about a small village Hivere Bazar, but there may be many such villages.
I extend my warm greetings to the people of such a village, for the great work you have done.
Someone told me about Gorva Gorva village Panchayat in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.
When the Government of India brings water to the ladder through the railways, I think it is a message to the world.
If a good news comes from somewhere, it is human nature to feel that the entire hardship has disappeared.
I am happy to note that this time there is a possibility of rainfall from 106 percent to 110 percent.
Despite the rainy season, the news of good rains has also been renewed.
But, my countrymen, how much pleasure the information that there will be good rains, it creates an opportunity and challenges.
We cannot even launch the village water conservation campaign
Farmers need soil and it helps them in the fields.
Why shouldn't we put soil on the lakes of the villages
When the soil of the fields grows, the water storage level will also increase.
What if you put stones and soil in black symmetrics and black dragons and put them on the way out of the water
I've always told one thing that whenever we go to the birthplace of Bapu, we can see different places and one of them is worth seeing.
I mean, it is important to know how it was constructed in 200 years ago under the house to save water.
His concern is very natural because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments have come and several schemes have been created, so that such a question arises in the minds of crores of people in the country as a model of brother Kumar Krishna.
Those who believe in time consider the Ganga as a household provider.
The Ganges provides us jobs and the Ganges gives us the power to live.
There is a rapid pace in the economic activities of the country.
A bugyal brought us to the Ganges, but hundreds of thousands of bugyals are required to defend it.
People cannot succeed in work without partition, so we all have to become a Changing Changes for cleanliness and transformation.
We need to repeat and recall this.
Several efforts are being made at the level of government.
Efforts are being made to seek full cooperation of all the states on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to unite socio-clean organisations.
Several steps have been taken to prevent surface cleaning, hygiene and industrial masses.
Every day a large number of solid wastes are mixed through the canals.
In the days to come, many more places will be implemented by removing this garbage and applying the machine and the people living on the banks of the Ganges will experience the benefits.
I feel that there will be good results through this too.
I am happy that some officials have told me that ero Liquid Discharge, which has succeeded in expelling liquids in the past few days from the districts of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.
The expulsion of black fluor from paper plants has almost come to an end.
This shows us that we are traveling in the right direction and there has been an increase in awareness.
If anyone from the remote southern coast meets not only on the banks of the Ganges but also on the other side of the Ganges, they ask us whether the Ganga is clean or not.
It will surely bring success in cleaning the Ganga.
People are giving donations to clean the Ganges.
This system is being implemented in a very excellent manner.
My dear countrymen, on April 24, today.
We have celebrated the 125th birthday of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April, today, on 24th April, we are celebrating the Panchayat Raj Day.
This is the best thing that has happened in a concentration since the day of his birth, the largest combined villages of the Constitution, which have been accompanied by the Government of India in collaboration with the State Governments of India, the Mission called Gram Swaraj for 10 days from 14th April to 24th April to Bharat Uday.
Today, in April 24, I am going to celebrate the Panchayat Raj Day in Jharkhand, where our majority of tribal brothers and sisters live, this movement has created a great awakening.
How to strengthen rural democratic institutions at all corners of India
How to make villages self-reliant
How to demonstrate the schemes for their development
There may have been several programmes in several villages of India in ten days, which may be less.
In the most basic ways, innovative ways, I congratulate all the State Governments and the rural leaders who have been using this opportunity for the betterment of villages, for the development of villages and for the development of democracy.
There has been awakenment in the villages and that is the guarantee of Indian upliftment.
The foundation of Bharat Uday is in rural areas.
Therefore, we all are focusing on rural development and reaching the desired benefits.
Development has been required in the education sector for the last several years.
Today, if every family has a primarily dream of mother-father, then it should be given quality education to children.
The idea of home, vehicle etc. is after all.
In the minds of the people of the country like India, this feeling is the greatest strength.
Therefore, I appeal to all mothers and fathers to speak in detail about the practices of schools in a broad way.
If something gets up in mind then go to school and ask the teachers.
This awakening should be the part of the people to reduce many disorders in our education system.
All the governments in our country have been paying more attention to education and every government has made every effort towards itself.
It is true that there has been a considerable time for our people to establish educational institutions, to expand educational institutions, to create schools and colleges, to include teachers and to go to school.
In a way, an attempt to spread education has been made predominant and it is also necessary.
But the importance of expansion is more important than that of our educational system.
We have done the greatest task of expansion.
Now we have to put an end to quality education.
Our primary objective is to provide good education to all through the educational system.
It is true that we have to take a long journey.
But if we decide 125 crore people then a long journey will also be possible.
According to Sharmila ji, we need to create basic changes.
The universities of India can also become world-class competing universities.
The more the importance of education is, the more the importance of skills, the more the role of technology in education is going to be very important.
I am confident that these will facilitate our education and in some time the results will start showing their eyes.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has greeted me and I am speaking from Pijnor to Mona Karna.
In today's era, sports is also very important for the youth with education.
There should be a team spirit, a team spirit, a good leader and a good nature, which will result in their overall development.
I say this through my experience, because I have been in the Indian Common Service, which has a great impact on my life.
This required greater integration.
Their widespread spread has made me feel more encouraging and should have done something.
It is true that I have been in the national student team at a time, and I know that a national perspective is being created through such organizations.
I have experienced the benefits of my childhood, I want to fill up a new energy in these organisations and give a new boost.
This time I have put some things on their front.
During this season, why shouldn't our youngsters and all the organisers be involved in the great task of water conservation
How many circles and how many districts we can prevent open defecation.
My dear countrymen, today I have to talk about what we all need to think.
I am also surprised to see this.
You will be aware of the political situation of our country as much as the party would provide gas cylinders as it was a discussion of the last several elections.
On the other hand, the economists pressurized that subsidies should be reduced, resulting in a number of groups being formed and they gave decisions and advice on subsidies declining.
Several crore rupees have been spent in the functioning of these groups.
But today my heart glows with the pride of my people.
But, in view of the account, more than 80 percent of these crore people went to the distributors themselves and stood in the rank and gave them their subsidies in writing.
My countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government abstains from any tax bill, then the government will be applauded by the television and newspapers throughout the week.
Because they have forced political leaders to think in a new perspective.
Even today, the country's economists are forced to think in a new perspective.
It is an occasion beyond their thinking, even to the world's economists, who propose various prospects.
We need to think about it at any point.
It is an extraordinary thing that if one crore families have abandoned subsidies, instead of getting one crore poor households, the amount of gas cylinders, the amount of money that has been ruined due to the breakdown of a crore households, ordinarily seem to be simple, how much can be achieved when they do not believe in the people.
I urge all the political leaders to believe in the people wherever we are going.
And the fruits that you cannot see, and the fruits that you cannot see.
We have to travel in this direction.
For example, in my mind, the third stage, the fourth stage worker had to make a positive choice and why we should not believe in their choices.
I am supposed to know that there will not be ticket checkers at some railway stations.
Let us believe in the people of the country and we can do many such tests.
Once we put our trust in the people of the country, there will be immense benefits.
No political leaders have created this environment and one crore families have been created in the country.
A person named Ravi has written to me - Good News everyday, good news everyday, good job every day, tell your officials that one should tell you about a good thing every day.
Breaking News is the worst news in every newspaper and media.
Is there no good thing happening in our country with 125 crore people
A few days ago, a newspaper had sent a letter to me, saying that we will not even publish a bad news on Monday and release a positive news.
Something is true that the atmosphere of positive news is happening.
Everyone feels that good news and true news should be available to everyone.
Whatever a well-known person gives special information, how beautiful it can be explained, however much better it can be found through good news.
Good news is encouraging good actions.
It is true that the more we strengthen the benefit, the less the place for destruction.
If we adopt the iniquity, the darkness will shun itself, and surely it will shun.
You can also contribute in it.
Ravi ji, you have given good advice but please don't be angry with me.
We will work together in constructive efforts and we will take part in our efforts to take positive steps.
The Kumbh Mela is the speciality of our country.
Kumbh Mela can be a tourist attraction.
On the bank of the river, many people of the world have been unaware of the fact that millions of people come and gather for several days.
The festival ends in a peaceful and peaceful environment.
These events are creatively accomplishing massive standards as part of peoples participation in the programme management.
In the last two days, I have noticed that many people have been devoting films related to the Simhastha Kumbh Mela.
I want the tourism sector of the Government of India and the tourism sectors of the State Governments to organize a television competition.
You can ask people to display the most important photos.
This can definitely be done.
In the meantime, when the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh met me, he told me that cleanliness has been taken special care of.
Cleanliness is not only during this festival but also the aim of the people to keep the idea of cleanliness in their minds.
At the time of the Kumbh Mela, while I accept a function on spirituality, I believe that it can also be a social opportunity.
We can use the Kumbh Mela to enhance our love for water, how can we praise water and the news of water harvesting
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
I am afraid that you shall speak to me, yet I urge you to dedicate your words and expressions to yourselves.
You might remember that I had spoken about a book of French stories last time and I asked you to share your thoughts with the Narendra Modi Activist.
A large number of people have expressed their views on the books written about science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business and lifestyle.
Some others are asking me to talk about several other books.
I will definitely talk about some other books.
But now I have to accept that I don't get enough time to read more books.
But I feel that we have to move ahead with the experience that has been achieved in the last one month.
Friends, I have touched the voice of my heart about water conservation, but even before that, I feel that water conservation is the most popular thing for the common man.
Just a few days ago, it was water that swallowed the entire country.
Several efforts are being made to curb water conservation across the country.
People are sharing information about traditional methods.
The media has also surpassed many innovative movements related to water conservation.
I am happy to know that the most beautiful state of the northeast, Meghalaya, has created a water policy for itself.
I congratulate the state government for this.
In Haryana, less water consumption and farmers are being encouraged to afford crops that are not affected.
Why shouldn't we use these festivals for water conservation
Friends, Some things in life fill us with enthusiasm.
This, especially the achievements of children, their success, gives us enthusiasm and new energy.
The things that I say now can concentrate on you with great pride and enthusiasm.
We all know how much trembling can occur in the world, a word called cancer.
While waiting for deaths at the doors, these ten children have not only dissolved cancer in their struggle for livelihood, but have also praised the country for their marvellous acts.
This month, in Moscow, World Children's Winners Games won World Children's World Cup.
The event was organised for competitions like shooting, swimming, swimming, football, table tennis.
These ten winners of our country won medals and some of them won more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, I am confident that the victory of Chandrayaan II in the sky will give you glee and pride.
Sanjeev Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga, Kolkata, B.
Many like Arvind Rao have been asking for Narendra Modi's workshop and MyGov from different parts of the country to talk about Chandrayaan 2 in the heart.
In terms of space, India has to declare the year 2019 as the best year.
Our scientists launched A-Sat in March, after which Chandrayaan 2.
We couldn't talk much about the very important issue of A-Sat in the election process.
But the A-Sat missile is 300 km above the Earth in just 3 minutes.
On 22nd July, Bong Chandrayaan jumped on 2nd applications across the country.
Chandrayaan 2 - This target is important in different aspects.
Chandrayaan 2 will further strengthen our understanding of the moon.
We have to face temporary recessions even in our lives
Today, through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I am going to showcase the message of a very interesting competition for the students and the youngsters of the country.
Knowledge about space, Indias Space Programme and Science Technology will be a matter of competitorship.
For example, what is required to be done in the rocket drive, how the artificial cord can be placed on the track, what information we get from the artificial corner, what is A-Sat so many such things will take place in this competition.
On the MyGov Internet, information on the competition will be held on August first.
I call my young friends and students...
I appeal to all schools, parents and enthusiastic teachers to work to win your school.
I encourage all the student wealth to join them.
The most interesting thing is that the Indian government will take maximum number of students in each state to Sriharikota at their own cost.
They will also get the opportunity to see the sight of the Chandrayaan Ground in the month of September.
The voice of our minds has accelerated the cleanliness movement several times.
Similarly, the efforts made for cleanliness have also been inspiring the voice of the mind.
The journey that started five years ago today has created new dimensions of cleanliness with the help of everyones contribution.
I didn't say that we have achieved the ideals of cleanliness but the success of the Swachh Survekshan from open defecation to public places is the strength of 130 crore countrymen.
But we're not gonna stop here.
The movement is now traveling from uncomfortable to beauty.
Just a few days back, I had to know about Yogesh Chaini and his team through the media.
Yogesh Chaini is an engineer who has lost his job in the US and has returned to serve Mother India.
A few years ago, he made a challenge not only to clean Delhi but also to make it beautiful.
He joined his team and started his work from the bags in Lotti Garden.
You might have remembered how the streets of the city of Prayagraj have been illuminated as paintings.
I am aware that Yogesh Saini ji and his team had shown their handicrafts there.
We feel this experience even in the beauty of the Swachh Survekshan.
The principle of wealth from waste should be strengthened in our society and it should be our culture.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I had to read an interesting idea in MyGov.
Mohammad Aslam, who lives in Shopian region of Jammu Kashmir, has registered this.
I like Mann Ki Baat program.
I am happy to note that I have made a positive contribution in the scheme to return to the village across the country in Jammu Kashmir, my state.
The plan was planned in June.
Mohammed said that this will be the first action plan to directly drive people to the government.
And many more things have been added to this project as more interesting.
Sports Competitions were organised for children under the Khelo India Scheme.
They were awarded sports equipments, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Workshops, listed and tribal certificates.
In a way, this organisation and development festival is a celebration of public participation and a celebration of public awareness.
A large number of people participated in this development festival in Kashmir.
It is a matter of joy that the programme of returning to the village was done in the rural areas, while the government officials, who reached such remote villages, climbed all the hard hilly paths and walked for a couple of days.
The officials also visited the border villages along the border areas of Sadasarvam and the border areas, not only with fear, but also with no fear in the most vulnerable areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Gulkanav and Anantnag districts.
The extent to which the welcome received them was affected by many officials, they spent more than two days in these villages.
It is a matter of great pleasure to organize the Gram Sabha meetings in these areas, to ensure a large number of peoples participation and to create their own projects.
New commitment, new enthusiasm and wonderful results.
This makes it clear that those who seek to sow barriers and humidity during the development journey, and their ill-effective consequences are sometimes successful.
My dear countrymen, how do you know how Tattatreya Ramchandra Pendre, who won the Gyanpeeth Award, has written in his poem about the period of Marriage
People from different cultures and languages across India have been happy to celebrate the period of their lives.
If we look around us in this season, the earth will be as if it had fought a Green war on it.
There is a new power in all directions.
In this sacred month, many devotees take vacations, take the Amarnath pilgrimage, many people are eating and waiting for festivals like Janmashtami and Naga Panchami with great enthusiasm.
During this time, Raksha Bandhan is also an expression of love for brothers and sisters.
When we talk about the period of Marriage, you will be happy to note that this time, in the Amarnath Yatra, more than 4 years more devotees have been participating.
Since 1st July, more than 3 lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than the number of people who participated in the 60-day pilgrimage in 2015, the number has been reduced in just 28 days.
I would like to congratulate the people of Jammu Kashmir and their excellence after the success of the Amarnath pilgrimage.
All those who have come back after completing their journey are attracted to the people of the state with the feelings of pride and honour.
All this will be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
Even in Uttaranchal this year Sardam pilgrimage has been started and more than 8 lakh pilgrims have come to Kedarnath temple only in the last one and a half months.
For the first time since the terrible natural disaster that took place in 2013, people have taken a pilgrimage to such a number of achievements.
I appeal to you that some places of beauty in the season, wherever you go and enjoy them.
No one can be the greatest sanctuary than tourism and sacred journey to see these beautiful places of our country, feelings of the people of our country.
May this beautiful, life-saving month of Marriage provide new energy, new hopes and new aspirations to all of you.
Likewise, in August, the skirmishes of the outgoing movement are being faced by the whites.
On the other hand, there is a lot of wealth in different parts of the country and in many areas the people of the country are suffering from floods.
When we see the rains on television, we get to see only a perspective - wherever we see floods, flooded water and transport stagnant.
After a month's wait, I will return.
Today people from all over the world will be celebrating Ester Shrinay.
Today, when India is dancing with Australia, I congratulate both the teams.
India won the Gold Medal in 1951 and 1962 Asian Games and India ranked 4th in the 1956 Olympics.
But fortunately, in the last few decades, we have been forced to undermine the rankings.
Even today, it is difficult to say that the extent to which our position has fallen in the FIFA rankings.
Be it EPL or Spanish League or Indian Super League lamps, today I look forward to growing interest in football for Indian youth.
The youth of India are watching the television to know more about the football.
At the same time, we can use this opportunity to take football to every village and every street.
FIFA Inder-17 World Cup 2017 is likely to create a new zeal and innovation in the field of football amongst the youth around this year.
I consider this as an opportunity to brand India globally.
You must have planned to visit me on holidays.
Very few people go abroad and most of them go to tour every state for 5 days and 7 days.
Some people leave their states and go to other states.
There is no doubt that there will be a district where I will not go in India.
There is a huge power for tourism in creating our lives and now Indian youth are very interested in tourism and their enthusiasm is increasing.
They don't travel on the way to the old model or constructed, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
I think it's a good identity.
There is also a routine in our area that if the coal is blackened, the others themselves will move away.
But it is a pleasure to create a tourism hub by keeping the same coal.
This is just a beginning, so far more than 10,000 people have experienced a composite coal mineral tourism in the environment situated near Sawaner village near Nagpur.
This creates an opportunity to see a new one.
Can you contribute towards cleanliness when you go to other places during this holiday
This may not be done very scientificly, but it is true to walk.
Can you also work as a tourist pace with the idea of cleanliness at the tourism centre
Tourism in India is far behind in comparison to the world.
But if 125 crore people are determined to strengthen our tourism sector, then we can capture the world.
Come, let us try to travel in this direction.
My young friends, I don't like the situation that some holidays have come and gone.
You should also think in this perspective.
Does your holidays allow the great years of life to lose their immense values
I'll put an idea to your chicken.
Can you develop a skill in your holidays, cannot you add a new thing as a pride to your governance
If you don't know swimming, you can decide whether I will learn swimming during the holidays or if you don't know the cycling then I will learn the cycling.
Even today, if I take two fingers in the form of a computer, can I make a signature
How many types of skills are there to promote our governance
Why can't we learn them
Why shouldn't we remove our defects
Why shouldn't we promote our energy
Now think that there is no need for big efforts for this, no trainee is required, no more money is required, no big cost is required.
Similarly, other friends will also be interacting with them.
I am confident that you will definitely do this, tell me what you learned newly.
My name is Abi Chaturvedi.
Hon'ble Prime Minister, during the last summer vacations, you used to wear summer heat for birds, so we need to put water in a utensil in milk, or in a household surface, so that they could get water.
I was very happy when I did this job, and my friendship with many birds grew.
This time again I urge you to express it in your heart.
He's reminded me of a good act by contacting the phone.
I was asking you to fill the water in the soil vessels outside your house in the summer season.
Abhi has told me that he has been doing this work throughout the year, so many birds have become his love.
Mahadevi Varma, one of the world's great poets of Hindi literature, was immensely affectionate on her birds.
He said in his poems, I will not allow you to go away, I will fill the dirt with grains, and I will fill the cold incense anywhere.
Shilpa Kuke, a resident of Mysore, has put forward a very minute idea.
Have we ever given them drinking water
Shilpa, thank you my best, you have put a very emotional idea in a very natural way.
My farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard more about digital India.
This digital India can be a matter of some urban youth.
If you pay the App for these farmers, then all the information related to agriculture and summer will be available in your handloom.
What is the situation in the markets, what is the situation in the markets, what is the trend of good harvesting and what kind of pesticides are fit.
If you ask them some questions, they answer it or make you understand it.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to upgrade the App for the facilities of these farmers to their mobile phones.
We have tried to create wealth for water conservation through Manrekha.
There might be many villages that have created such awareness in the country, many premier farmers, many people who are aware of it.
I welcome it.
In 2014, there were about 612 crore diabetes patients in India.
Statistics show that 3 percent of the deaths occur due to diabetes.
Diabetes will be of two types, one type 1 and the other type 2.
Type-1 is genetic, hereditary and mother-father.
Type 2 is due to habits, age, obesity is due to obesity.
Since diabetes has created a worldwide concern, it has been set up as the World Health Day Centre on 7th.
Our lifestyle is a major reason for this.
The physical labor is decreasing.
Can we work as a result of the conception on 7th April to defeat diabetes in our lives
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we don't get medical check ups.
After the situation has worsened, it is known that Io has been a diabetes disease for a long time.
In comparison to the number of tuberculosis patients in other countries, there is a decline in our country.
With proper treatment, this disease can be decided.
India should be freed from these diseases.
But without your cooperation, it cannot be eliminated only by governments, doctors and medicines.
Therefore, I urge the people of the country to eradicate diabetes and eliminate tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, several important events will be held in April, especially on 14th April, the birthday of Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambedkar ji.
On his 125th birthday, he was celebrated throughout the year.
On 14th April this year, I got the privilege of going to the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Baba Saheb has given us everything that is required to be an excellent citizen.
As a good dweller, we can see him a special tribute by traveling through his path shown.
Vikram will start the year in a few days.
New Year is celebrated in different states in different forms.
My best wishes to all.
I have said that you can hear my heart's voice at any time, you know that you can hear it in about 20 languages.
You can ask it at a very good time.
You can hear it on your mobile phone.
I am happy to join you.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you.
I extend my best wishes to all for the East Festival.
My young friends, you all will be on the one hand.
There is a great inspiration.
You might be aware that in the next year 2017, India will hold FIFA under-17 World Cup competition in our country.
What do I say is insisting that the interest of the football increases, but when such a great opportunity is shutting down the doors of India, can we foster our obligations only when we are brave
I had also requested you for the last time to display the pictures of the place where you are going.
Millions of foreign nationals have done the work that the tourism sector cannot do, the work that our cultural sector cannot do, the state governments and the Indian government cannot do.
It's really enjoyable to see all the photos that they have disguised.
We have to take this task forward and do it this time, but this time we have to add something else.
Not just sending a photo but also expressing your architecturality, while visiting new places, many things can be known.
India is a country full of varieties.
If you start traveling once you want to see, you will be traveling throughout your life and you will be enjoying it.
We generally think we should stay away from the coal mines.
When we look at the films about the people there, we think what will happen
My young friends are confident that I will definitely be helpful in this work.
Be it politics, organisations, be it social, be it citizens, we all will work together.
Your governance will identify and your self-confidence will increase significantly.
They are coming to sell milk near our houses, newspaper sellers are coming, postalists are coming and sometimes the utensil sellers and clothing sellers pass.
Have we ever heard if they want to suppress their thirst when the summer temperature is sustained
Only then can one drop of rain water be used without waste.
The initial period of agriculture for farmers is very important.
But the people of the country should also think of what is happening if there is no water.
You might have noticed that this time 5 lakh lakes and waterfalls are trying to create waterfalls.
At my young age, I still remember people getting scared as soon as I heard the name of TB.
If you want to get rid of tuberculosis then proper treatment is important and complete treatment is important.
If the treatment is left in the middle, then the disease will come back.
You give Mystery foot, when you get time, you can hear the voices of the old mind and ask in your own language.
My countrymen, my best wishes to all of you.
In a way, this is a sound event of my great mind in 2015.
The next Mann Ki Baat event will be held in 2016.
If you want to see in a way, you can say that every festival leaves the hope of coming to the next festival.
Sometimes India can also be called the economy that is emerged from the festivals.
These are the reasons for the economic activity of the people under the society.
On this occasion, I extend my best wishes to all the people of the country for the Christmas Festival.
In 2016, bringing you all a lot of happiness and happiness, a new enthusiasm, a new tranquility and a new determination to take you all to new peaks.
Beware, let the world be hot, and let the earth be a natural disaster, and the evil that is created by man.
What can be more satisfactory than this that human society should live a peaceful life by getting rid of all this
Chawley Savarkar ji is a season of tourism, a large number of domestic and foreign tourists come and people go to many places for Christmas celebrations.
As much as our tourist destinations are pure, I welcome Ganesh ji's views that the thoughts and images of India are thrilling in others.
I am taking the views of Ganesh ji among the people.
If we come to our houses, when we come to the tradition of seeing the guests as God, then we all feel like cleaning and cleaning the house immediately.
Similarly, we need to keep our country's tourist destinations, centres and tourist destinations clean and clean.
I am glad that there are reports from all over the world about cleanliness.
From the beginning day onwards, I have been conveying my best wishes to the media friends.
Because they are looking for small and good things and taking them to the people's eyes.
I want to share with you that this work is a sacred one, and now I have to read the message that he has built hundreds of toilets only by his work in Bhojpura village.
The country is progressing rapidly due to the continuous efforts of many.
125 crore people of the country are walking on the path of progress and the country is also progressing.
Special education, improved skills, increasing job opportunities
Life insurance schemes for citizens, banking facilities, universal trade and setting up of new enterprises are taking place on one hand.
All the simple families who cannot even go near the banks can now easily get loans through Mudra scheme.
Today, Indians have started to understand that the milk of Yoga art has started growing around the world.
When the whole world celebrated the International Day of Yoga, the feeling of how proud our country was, didn't we
This feeling will happen only when our thoughts and thoughts are large.
And it came to pass, when the eyes of the swine were opened, when his mother opened the mouth of the sword, who could forget that she saw the eggs there, when she was opened
Similarly, Yoga Day has reflected the importance of India as Indians.
Now the talk of cleanliness is echoing every household.
Be it a farmer, be it poor, be it a child, be it mother, be it a mother-loving child, we have been the cause of a fresh transformation in their lives. This is also a very interesting thing.
Can't I do everything alone
But when I talk about this, shouldn't I give my contribution
A simple citizen can also display an App called Narendra Modi on his mobile phone and join me.
In this, I am sharing simple things.
It is a matter of great happiness that people also share many things with me.
Come, let us all communicate with each other about the benefits of the common people and bring them to the common man and give them a sympathy.
My young friends, on August 15, I had forwarded a basic idea of startup India, Stand up India from the Red Fort.
After that, the idea of this was raised in all the departments of the government.
Can India become the start up capital
Startup India has brought a great opportunity to the younger community.
My young friends, the work for start-up India and Stand-Up India will begin on 16th January in full swing.
There is a steady comment on start-up that the digital world is only those who are in the field of information technology.
Keeping in mind the needs of India, we should make changes in this.
The intellectual skills of our young generation spread all over the country.
This start-up should not be left out of India, Stand-Up India, in some cities, which cannot be spread anywhere else.
Therefore, I appeal to all the State Governments to take this scheme forward.
On 16th January, I will definitely share with you in detail.
I look forward to your comments with patience.
My young friends, the birthday of Swami Vivekananda on January 12th.
Like me, there are millions of people in this country.
From 1995 to 12th January, we celebrate Swami Vivekananda Jayanti as National Youth Day.
The events are scheduled to be held in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12th January to 16th January this year.
I urge my young friends to send your comments directly to me through my Prime Minister Modi App.
I want to understand and understand what is in your mind.
Dilip Sohahan, a visually impaired person from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, who held the Academic India Day in his school.
Thank you very much, Dilip ji.
Sometimes when we meet humans like him in our lives, there will be unified thoughts in our hearts.
The perspective of humans such as him is based on our thoughts.
There is no doubt that words have a significance.
When the Government of India inaugurated this year, arrangements were made to participate in the Swachh Bharat programme.
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially because of the severe floods in Chennai, I had to go there, I could not attend the event.
Despite not being able to participate in the event, the thoughts of it were in my mind.
Innovations needed, technology needs, systems needed, understanding, to simplify schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, accessible vehicles, lifts and fray languages.
They should not die in the curtains.
Didn't the schemes be made even for the common man and the poor
Just a few days ago, efforts were made to ensure that the beneficiaries are smoothly carrying the materials of the scheme.
The subsidy is being given to the gas cylinders in our country.
Crores of rupees are spent for this, but no account has been filed for this.
The government has made a small change in granting subsidies to know whether the subsidies reach real beneficiaries or not.
About 15 crore people are beneficiaries of the Pahal gas programme by the end of November.
These 15 crore beneficiaries go directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
This happens without intermediaries, Sifariso and any possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, the movement of Aadhaar Identification Card, on the other hand, the public opened its bank accounts, on the other hand, the central governments together formed the list of beneficiaries and the work to connect it with Aadhaar Identification Card and Bank Account is underway.
There were colours of integrated charges over the project.
In many places, money is being put directly into the bank accounts of the working class.
So far, about 35,40 projects have been put directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries up to Rs. 40,000 crore.
My dear countrymen, a golden moment for the Republic of India on 26th January.
Baba Saheb Ambedkars 125th birth anniversary is a very glorious link.
We have to take this forward.
Only during the elections, more advertisements like "Vallabhiyan is a sacred obligation" will be published and layers will be written on the walls.
We talk more about the obligations in the election season, but why shouldn't we talk about the same obligation in daily life
When this year we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, we cannot organize a commemorative competitorship, poetry competition and dialogue competition in schools, colleges, in our villages and towns, in many societies and associations.
When the people of 125 crore people are dragging each other together with the spirit of duties, see how much history will be built.
On 26th January, when we celebrate the President, cannot we clean and decorate the statues of the country's leaders and the places that are surrounding it very specially through the citizens, through school and college students
I am confident that it cannot be done as citizens.
We reflect the utmost in maintaining the statues of those leaders who are very emotional in keeping the statues.
Can we continue to clean up as a society and as a country
On 26th January, we will work together in this endeavor.
My dear countrymen, once again I congratulate you for the New Year 2016.
Thank you so much.
On the other hand, the Christmas Festival is going on.
There is a different place for festivals in social life.
Sometimes the festivals are also beneficial for wounds and sometimes they give new impetus.
But sometimes when it comes to festive days, they are sorry.
From every corner of the world, the news of natural disasters continues to come.
There are reports of disaster events even without questioning yet.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of weather changes is spreading.
State Governments are engaged in rescue and rescue operations in full swing.
The central government has always been working shoulder to shoulder.
I am sure that Tamil Nadu will again become faster on the path of progress and will contribute to the progress of the country.
But when we face such a difficult situation all around, there is a feeling that there should be a change.
Until about 15 years ago, the natural disaster was associated with the agriculture sector, because at that time the natural disaster was only with dryness and famine.
Governments, peoples society, citizens and small and big institutions have to work in the field of scientific development.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I had to interact with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
I suggested that a joint work should be done in collaboration with the South Asian countries to meet the disaster.
I am happy to note that a symposium on this regard and a symposium on the best ways to face the disaster has also taken place in New Delhi.
This is a good start.
I speak Lakwinder Singh from Jalandhar, Punjab.
We are engaged in the field of agriculture here and many are guided by agriculture.
One of the reasons for this is that you are doing natural farming
It is more satisfactory that you are not only doing this but also understanding the problems of farmers.
Your concern is just, but this is not just happening in any Punjab and Haryana states
This is usually the whole of India and traditionally we burn the agricultural wastes after the result.
Earlier, we did not know about the evil caused by such burning, all were doing, so I am doing too.
Because of this, it has continued to grow, and today it has been associated with climate change.
After the impact of this tragedy began to rise to cities, people's protests began to shout.
The concern that you have expressed in that way is real.
For the first time, we should train our farmers friends and explain the truth.
This can result in the burning of agricultural wastes, reduce the trauma and make the land ready for the next time.
But this is not the right protocol.
Vegetable wastes after surgery are also very precious.
They are natural ways.
We're losing them.
Not only this, if we make them small pieces, they can be a resident of the animals.
Secondly, when we burn them, the layer on the ground becomes red.
My farmer brothers and sisters, look at one moment, our bones are stable, our hearts work well, our kidneys work well, everything is fine, but if the skin on the body is burnt, can we survive
Just as the skin of our body is burnt, we cannot survive our lives, similarly if we burn the skin of the earth, the skin of the earth is burnt, the layer on our earth is burnt.
Therefore, we have to take positive steps in this direction.
I had an opportunity to interact with the farmers engaged in wasteful practices.
They shared their experiences with me.
They had to spend Rs 5000,000, 15,000 for a hectare to slap their lives after harvesting their lives earlier.
There was no work until the bullocks had to be taken into the tractors.
Last time I spoke of organ donation in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I told NOTO about the free phone number.
Many prominent film actress Ravina Dandon joined them.
Physiotherapy can save many lives.
What can be more than that
The Registration Centre for National Level Organ Transformation (NLOC) was inaugurated on 27th November, 2018, with details of patients who are required for limbs, organs and donors.
I am confident that awareness will spread in this sector and I am confident that it will help those who need it at the right time.
Because there is no one to donate, this help is not available in any way.
I had already said that on the 3rd of December, we are going to follow the day of handicapped people.
Physically, physically handicapped persons are unparalleled and unparalleled.
Sometimes when they are portrayed as calibs, the heart feels sad.
Sometimes it appears to be a comment on them.
But if we change our perspective, if we correct the perspective of seeing them, they will be ourselves as a vision and the achievements will be a driven power to us.
Their mental commitment, their confrontation with life, their ability to transform the complications into sympathies, thirst and very much appreciated.
Today I want to talk about Javed Ahmad, who is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, militants shot at Jawaat Ahmed in Kashmir.
But Javed Ahmad did not accept the defeat.
The wounds of radicality did not make him angry.
There was no part of his indignation, but a person who had not committed any crime had such a sentence, whose young man was disgraced, but he had no anger and anger in his mind
He has dedicated himself to the education of children for the last 20 years, though he has not cooperated with him.
As a social servant, as an awakening citizen, he is now making a peace revolution as the sovereignty of the handicapped.
Whether Javeed ji's life is sufficient for all Indians to be enlightened
I would like to recall Javed ji's life, his endeavor and his dedication in the month of December 3.
Because of lack of time, even though I have been able to talk about Javeed ji today, these visionary evils are shining all over the coast of India, they are encouraging livelihood.
In the same way, on December 3, we have to get inspiration from them.
In many cases, we need to work on the basis of governments.
The central layers are constantly associated with the government and state-related organisations that are under the middle class, the underwear, the underwear, the poor, the deprived, the deprived, the oppressed.
As a common dweller, they are likely to have a bad experience with government employees in some way.
These couples are spending their wealth in their relaxed life in the development of the poor.
The total number of people belonging to the tribal tribes is the smallest village in Balasore district of Odisha.
The poorest village, which is suffering from malaria.
Jamuna Mani Singh, an Asha Sevakhi from this village, decided that I would ensure that no one from this treasure would die of malaria.
He picked up the fight against malaria and prepared to confront the entire village.
Anything like this might have happened in the country.
Recommend not only you, but also others.
The positive power is the greatest power.
And you also share good events related to this, share these e-books and discuss it.
My dear countrymen, the world is deeply concerned about climate change.
On 14th December, National Energy Conservation Day.
Several schemes are being implemented at the government level.
The LED Bullet Mission is progressing at a pace.
On the full moon, once I had told you to tied the street lights and soak the entire moonlight for an hour.
A friend had sent a link to my sight and I got the opportunity to see it.
I had to share this with you.
He is trying to provide light to the poor by using solar energy, fighting with darkness and working according to his name, he has created a group of women.
He has inaugurated an e-giving graveyard for the light of Lander, which is equipped with solar power.
He is giving these launder lights at a cost of Rs. 100 per month.
People are going to buy these lights in the evening and give them an email in the morning.
I know that about 500 households have been given the benefits of this kind of electrification till I heard.
This Noorjahan has been working as an e-Government for the people throughout the day.
But a good start has emerged.
In a very short span of 66 lakh people have received 42,000 crore rupees through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am happy that out of these 66 lakh beneficiaries, 24 lakh women are women.
I had already said that Swachh Bharat will create such entrepreneurs.
They have done this in Salesh Bonsley.
I know that he has bought a tanker and has repaid the loan of Rs 2 lakh to the bank in a short span of time.
This is our objective of the Mudra Yojana.
This was stated by Mamta Sharma ji from Bhopal City.
He also received Rs. 40,000 from the bank under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
He's engaged in a handicraft manufacturing job.
Because there is no need to pay more than Rs. 1000 per month.
His family also had a good job.
But I want to expand this scheme more popularly.
All our banks should approach it with greater understanding and come forward to help small businessmen in large numbers.
In fact, they are acting as the country's economists.
These are the economic powers of the country.
We want to encourage them.
It's good, but it has to be more and more special.
This means that the value of Rashtriyaam Jakrayam, Eternal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty, that is, forever awakening is the price we give to freedom.
The song of unity of the country should continue to shout.
But I expect more suggestions.
I am confident that your above suggestions will surely be beneficial.
My brothers and sisters, the winter is going to start.
Once again my best wishes to the people of the country, Jai Hind
I have got an opportunity to interact with you all through the voice of my heart again.
Today, the 5th day cricket competition between India and South Africa is being played in Mumbai.
This 5-day cricket competition has been named Gandhi Mandela series.
That's why interest in the final contest has increased.
My best wishes to all sportspersons.
Today, I congratulate all the friends of the All India Radio at Kannur station.
Therefore, I extend my heartfelt congratulations and congratulations to all the colleagues of the Kannur radio station.
I once again want to tell you about Kerala today.
Duya Mary Upper Primary School students from Chittor region of Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter was specially filled in several ways.
One, these girls had registered their thumb and touched the magnitude of Mother India in a very big cloth.
The Indian map has been sent to me by the Mother India.
I am surprised first why they brought their thumb mipe records to the film.
But after reading the letter they wrote, I realized how big index they have sent me.
They are engaged in the movement of awareness about organ donation.
About 80-year-old Vasantha Rao Suduke Guruji has been running a movement for a long time in Maharashtra.
He wants to celebrate organ donation as a function.
Nowadays, many news and information are coming through my phone.
Devesh ji from Delhi has also sent such a message to me.
I am happy to note that the government's efforts towards physical donation and policy projects related to it.
I am very happy to note that the goal of donating 10 lakhs of the government's goal is that it is very important.
More than 12 lakh kidneys, liver and liver organ donations are required every year in the country.
But in the country of 125 crore people, we can only implement only 5000 organ transformations.
Every year it is necessary to give light to one lakh eyes.
But we can only give light to just 25,000 people.
If 4 people need eyes, we can only give it to one person.
Efforts have been made to provide guidelines to the State Governments.
Some states have made good progress in simplifying administrative practices and attempts to eradicate it.
I am telling you that Tamil Nadu is the first to donate body parts.
A 24-hour-long Helpline serves as a number of 180011 4770.
Our ancestors are also swallowed up as honey Deccan Bunjeetha
That is, they have said the happiness of sacrifice through the words of Honey Deccan Bunjeetha.
In the past, Delhi's G.
This surgery was successful and a life was saved.
After a few days, we are also celebrating the Deepawali Festival.
We also celebrated Eid and Democratic Chaturthi festivals.
The Indian African Conference will be held in New Delhi from 26th to 29th August, 2018.
This is the first time that such a large summit will be held on Indian soil.
54 African countries and leaders of the Union have been invited to participate in the conference.
The population of both our countries is one-third of the world.
Thousands of years ago, India and Africa have been the only geography and then it has become two parts of the Indian Ocean.
There is a lot of unity between us.
India's wildlife and the wildlife of Africa can see many competitiveness.
There is also great competitiveness in natural resources.
About 27 lakh Indians have been living in African countries for many years.
There are links between India and African countries in the fields of economic, cultural and political.
But, above all, India is playing a major role in training the younger generations of African countries.
More than 25,000 African students have been taught in India in the field of human resource development and skill development.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has organized a very important event.
Competitions have been organised in writing and increasing their contributions amongst all the students who have been associated with the CBSE.
Thousands of schoolchildren wrote about information on Indian African contacts.
Millions of schoolchildren saw this exhibition, the people of the village saw what was the contribution of several Gandhians in the relationship between Africa and India.
Several important contributions were made in this competition.
A poem enjoys my heart, it is my love, so I want to read it to you.
I congratulate Karima and all the students who have participated in this event and more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
On August 15, 2014, I had mentioned about the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, a Member of Parliament, Model Gram Yojana.
After that, many members have completed this task.
They are in full concentration.
Last month, a commentatory was held in Bhopal.
In this context, the leaders of the villages, district governments, some parliamentarians and officials from the Central State Governments, who have completed this model village programme, have been accompanied by intensive consultation.
This led to a number of new comments that were inspired.
I would like to bring some things to your notice.
Jharkhand is one of the most tribal areas.
Unfortunately, it is Mao extremists, bombing culture and killings when we talk about Jharkhand.
Many areas have been destroyed by the impact of these left wing extremists.
But our senior parliamentarian, Kariya Munda, who has been working as the Vice-Constituent General of the Parliament, has dedicated his life to the tribal people.
He started going there, curtailed the belief in the minds of the people, tried to give life to the government organisations and encouraged the officials to work there.
He has created a country to bring about development in the region that has been sweeping for a long time in the boycott.
Besides infrastructure in the model rural scheme, a successful effort to create awareness among the people was made in this Barsi village of Jharkhand.
I extend my best wishes to the Hon'ble Member of Parliament, Kariya Munda.
The other arrangements are underway and he has created a special innovation in this regard.
He handed over a job to the students studying in the schools there.
He asked schoolchildren studying upper classes to keep their parents in this class.
The school was also providing education to students and their parents in the morning and evening.
These children taught about 550 uneducated senior citizens.
See how big a change has been made in society without any budget, without any surroundings, without any other special facilities, through just mindset.
This is the song given by the village of Dwarabhudi to us.
This village is known for production of black money and for the festival of black money.
Rawala ji inaugurated the Karambu Festival on 11th March in this village.
He has attracted our attention to the right thing.
My dear countrymen, I want to remind you of one thing and after the Deepawali festival last year, the media has organised a movement in our country, especially in our country.
Whatever we are trying towards cleanliness before the festivals, even after the festivals, it is the right idea that it should be continued.
This kind of work should be done during every public event.
Today I congratulate all the media of India.
On the 2nd of October last year, when Mahatma Gandhis birth anniversary and Swachh Bharat Mission was started and completed one year, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to participate in the programme called Safai Giri, organised by the India Today Group.
For the last one year, he has been encouraging cleaning work by ETV, and there are reports on this in his newspapers and he only focuses on constructive work.
He added 51 lakh children from around 55 to 56,000 schools from Andhra and Telugu to Swachh Bharat Mission.
Be it public places, railway stations or dhaamsalas, hospitals or parks, cleanliness is being conducted in many places.
These messages also strengthen the creation of a clean India.
ABP News Channel has launched a programme called "India My Country".
The people of the country have sown the idea of cleanliness in their minds, in order to enhance the awareness of cleanliness among the people.
The NDTV was organised to create a clean India.
There are several channels and several newspapers in our country, but I cannot tell the names of all because of the deficiency of time, everybody has taken this movement.
Over the past several years, this village has been working as a pillar of cleanliness and every generation has been making rapid efforts towards cleanliness.
A few years ago, the ruler wrote in the letter that this village has been awarded the most clean village of Asia.
I am happy to note that a village in Meghalaya, a remote north-eastern part of our country has been engaged in cleanliness for several years.
This has become the culture of the village.
Such events give us all the confidence that our country is definitely clean.
My dear countrymen, when I spoke from the Red Fort on August 15, I had said corruption was lost in the country.
My best wishes to all my young social friends.
We made an important announcement in the last budget.
Accordingly, you can pay your gold in the bank and you can get the same amount of money that is deposited in the bank as you get the interest for your investment.
Now the gold will be in the bank but the money will be given to you by the bank.
Now tell the people of the country, don't wear the money
Doesn't the unprofitable load of gold turn into a life-long force
Don't waste the house.
Two advantages of its safety and deterioration, do not miss its benefits.
So we don't have to buy gold, we don't have to save the gold and nobody can steal the paper.
I will definitely dedicate this scheme to the people of the country to the nation next week.
However, we have so far been using the foreign gold currency or using foreign gold bounds.
Why shouldn't we have an indigenous indicator for our country
Therefore, in the coming weeks, the Indian Gold Currencies will be released 5 Grams and 10 Grams of Ashoka Chakra, before the Holy Day of Danteers.
Besides, 20 grams of gold boundaries will also be provided to the people.
I am confident that this new scheme will create a new transformation in the path of economic development, in which I am confident that your entire cooperation will continue.
My dear countrymen, Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel jis birthday on 31st October.
The whole of India will be reflected when Patel thinks of them as one India and the best India.
This great man has played an important role in the unity of India.
Not only these variations, but also the beauty that has given us great pride, it will not exist for us.
Therefore, only the mantra of unity is different.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the last several years, unity has been moving on 31st October.
I have already got the opportunity to participate in it.
I am told that this system is being organised in different areas and people are preparing for the promotion of solidarity with enthusiasm.
The movement of unity is actually the driving towards growth.
In another way, the guarantee for development is the only flow.
Come on, let us express our congratulations to Sardar.
We move ahead with the mantra of unity.
My brothers and sisters, you all are engaged in preparations for the Deepawali Festival.
I urge my parents to enjoy the Deepawali Festival, but indeed, we have to do our best to see the color of our children without any harm.
My dear countrymen, the next day I will go to the country of Britain.
This time my visit to Britain is very interesting.
There is a special reason for this.
I firmly believe that this memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will be a tourist destination for them while our children are going to study in Britain.
As far as possible, learn and live for the rest of the country - this is the news of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
A few years ago, the work done by Lord Basaveshwar for democracy and for the empowerment of women is a matter of great understanding.
It is an excellent example of how many centuries ago the ideals of the great people of India have been dedicated to the people of the world, how far-reaching the vision of Lord Basaveshwar in London.
When a similar event is being organized, the hearts of all the people of the country are filled with jealousy.
Your suggestions are the colors I have.
Afterwards, the programmes are being prepared in Al India Radio with your letters and discussions are being held by the government officials and some try to solve them when writing about their problems.
We need to learn many languages in a country like India.
It is true that even though I have got the difference to learn some languages, I could not learn so many languages.
In your language, at 8 o'clock in your hearts, I will definitely try.
See how close our relationship has grown.
The last one-year period was completed
Today we have replaced our feet in a new year.
My best wishes to the people of the country once again.
My countrymen, my best wishes to all of you, this is the 12th edition of Mann Ki Baat.
There is a great significance for the power of the people in the population.
There is an idea that is based on my life, because of which I have great faith in the power of this people.
But Mann Ki Baat has learned many things, they have transformed into experiences and all of us understand how great the power of the people is.
Our forefathers have made it clear that the strength of the people is the Make in India.
I can say that there is a great power in the thought of our forefathers, keeping my experiences in mind.
In this regard, I congratulate Al India Radio and they have not seen these suggestions merely as papers, but have seen them as the expectations of the people.
In terms of management, information should be above the bottom and guidance should be towards the bottom.
Who would have thought that the voice of Mann Ki Baat would be inspired by the information
But that's what happened.
I had said that on 2nd October we celebrate the birth anniversary of Gandhi Ji.
There was a time when there were doors for the country, but shouldn't it be doors for the speech
Not much, buy something.
I am happy to note that in the last one year, the sale of doors has almost doubled.
It is difficult to break the subsidies for the common man of the society, the middle class and the middle class.
Nevertheless, they plunged it.
Is this not a peace revolution
Is this not the expression of the power of the people
Besides the power circle of government sectors, there is a huge peasant power, which has a powerful, powerful and determined song, the governments should learn.
I am confident that after the Mann Ki Baat program, all of them have become sure to me.
Therefore, today I once again wish to express my heartfelt gratitude to the peoples power.
They also took the small things that I had spoken by the people and made them their own for the betterment of the country, and added them to it.
What else can be more happy than that
This time I thought of handling a new approach in Mann Ki Baat.
I requested the people of the country to contact you by phone and register your questions and your suggestions.
Discussions have been made from all parts of India as far as there is no calling area.
It's a pleasant experience.
All age groups have suggested.
It was easier to listen to some suggestions and my team is paying attention to others.
You might have spoken for a few minutes, but your advice and news are very important for me.
The government will definitely pay full attention to your suggestions.
There is generally a possibility that negative thoughts are full all around.
But my experience is another example.
Moreover, the calls received from the handicapped, particularly from the handicapped, have received more calls from the eyewitnesses.
They cannot see television and see radio requirements.
Bhawan Acharya, a member of the Alwar region of Rajasthan, is sharing a conversation with me.
I want all the people of the country to listen to the advice of Pawan Acharya and follow it.
My name is Pawan Acharya, I belong to the Alwar region of Rajasthan.
During the Deepawali Festival, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will urge the people of the country to use more soil-collar lights.
And this kind of soil streams will not harm the environment, while it will provide employment to tens of thousands of soil storage poor people.
When we listen to the advice of Pawan Acharya during the coming festivals, the soil lights of our houses will be adopted, but I appeal to the people of the country that their light will flow into the poor family.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the soldiers during the Ganapati Chaturthi.
As a 50-year-old war with Pakistan ended in 1965, an exhibition called Anjali for Veerakan near India Gate has been organised in Delhi.
We have heard about the glorious moments of war, the unprecedented courage and sacrifice of our soldiers, and there are no films or films in that period.
If you want to build history, you should understand the monuments of history well.
History connects us with our roots.
Cleanliness should be ourselves, and we should create the means of it.
I didn't consider it wrong.
I am very well aware that the Parliament of the country is also involved in discussions about cleanliness.
On the other hand, what can be the matter of pride for the country that both the children of the country are talking about cleanliness on the other hand
The movement of conceptions has created an environment against pollution and awakens cleanliness.
Do you know what Gandhians said
Once I want to choose one between freedom and cleanliness, I would like to first clean up myself and then it is the country's independence.
Cleanliness was more important than freedom for Gandhians.
Kulshan Arora, Delhi, has registered a document on MyGov Internet.
Deen Dayal Upadhyaya wants to know about his centenary.
Even last year, I had asked him to have several types of fashion clothes and several types of clothes, but he had to be with the doors.
I'm asking you to give it something else.
Last time you almost doubled the sale.
How many poor people were benefitted from this
You have done the work that the government cannot spend several crores of rupees, with the help of small ginger.
This is the power of yourself, so I once again request you in this regard.
My dear countrymen, my heart is also happy for another thing.
I want to share this with you.
I went to Kolkata in May and the family of Subhas Bose had come to meet me.
His brother's son, Chandra Bose, had arranged for the meeting.
This work was done by Chandra Bose and his family and it was decided that last week more than 50 families of Subhas Bose will come to the Prime Minister's house.
Can you imagine how great it will give me happiness
Many of Subash Babu's family live in other countries.
Everyone is coming for this specially. Do you know how much satisfactory it is to me
I look forward to welcoming them.
We have to take it as a habit.
I want the youth of the country to make efforts to connect themselves with the voters and to participate in the vote.
In the elections, I'm telling you one thing, first vote, then everything else.
Everyone should do this sacred work.
Among them, I met a young man who reads the seventh grade of Kshitiz Pandey.
Panaras is studying the seventh grade at Kendriya Vidyalaya University.
Similarly, there was a chance to meet a girl named Sonam Patel.
The 9-year-old daughter, Sadavruj Patel, who lives in Sundarpur, Varanasi, is his daughter.
She's a very poor family.
The singing of the entire song to this girl, but the biggest thing is that when she asked about any syllabus of the song, she complimented her and gave her English description and Hindi language.
When she asked her father about this, she told her that she had been telling it from her 5th year.
He added that it is very surprising to all of us in the family.
This has a big impact on me in your own right.
Some children have an interest in popularity, but child Sonamu has no such impression.
I just felt that God has given her a special power.
I met these two children during my visit to Kashi.
I wanted to share this with you.
The voice of your mind once a month should be made once a week because we get more conception from it.
Chandib ji, don't you think you're going to buy a job from me
Now it's fit for the monthly time.
One year has passed since Mann Ki Baat.
Do you know how Subhas Babu used the heaven
He started broadcasting in Germany and spread his messages through radio on free radio for the people living in India.
Azad Hind Radio was launched by a mechanical report.
He broadcast radio in many languages like English, Hindi, Bengali, Maratha, Punjab, Urdu and Pashdu.
My radio broadcasting through Mann Ki Baat programme has also been completed for a year.
Your contribution is something I can't pay.
My best wishes to you all again.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to all of you.
Once again, I have a good opportunity to tell you the voice of my mind.
On the southern part of the country, people are celebrating the Om Peace Festival and the Raksha Bandhan Festival was celebrated throughout the country yesterday.
The Government of India wants social security and has implemented several new schemes keeping in mind the welfare of the people.
I am happy that in a very short span of time, everyone has joined them in these projects.
On the day of Raksha Bandhan, we had made a small request to our sisters to take advantage of these security schemes.
I am told that within a short span of time about 11 crore families are connected with this scheme.
I am happy that half of the beneficiaries are as mothers and sisters.
I consider it a good symptom.
I congratulate all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
About a year ago, we started implementing our scheme in a big way.
Several questions and doubts were raised that a scheme that cannot be completed in 60 years could be implemented in such a short time.
But it is a matter of great pleasure that all the departments connected to the implementation of this project, all the branches of the banks have been engaged in it with full force and mind, and we have succeeded in it, so far, on the basis of the information provided by me, about 17.
Even though it was said that the number of priests could start, they saved 22,000 crore rupees.
The banking sector is one of the key instruments of the economy, which has also gone to the houses of the poor.
Today, 1.
25 lakh bank friends are working on the ground.
This has provided employment opportunities to the youth.
Thousands of people are now empowered to take overdraft because of their scheme.
There is hope that the poor will get bank loans.
Once again, I congratulate all those associated with it and I appeal to all the poor that you should not break your relationship with the banks at any time.
Banks are yours, you don't have to avoid it anyway.
We have brought the banks to the doors of your houses, do not leave it, take it seriously.
We all have to have money laundering in the bank accounts.
I am confident that you will definitely do this.
Just a few days back, the events that took place in Gujarat, the violence and the violence that destroyed the entire country, is a natural feeling.
This kind of demand has taken place on the soil born by Gandhi and Sardar, and it is painful to all the people of the country.
Peace, unity and brotherhood - this path is the right
On the path of progress, we all should move shoulder to shoulder and shoulder to shoulder.
Only progress can be solved for all our problems.
Jawaharlal Nehru Ji, the first Prime Minister of India, has visited Buddha Gaya.
I am proud to be attending this event by Buddhist clerics from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I want to share my heart with you.
I am ready to accept any suggestion regarding the welfare of the farmers. I have also told it several times.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I don't want the farmers to die.
I firmly assure you that if anyone is trying to guide you in a wrong way, we will not take any action to replace you.
For us, there is a value for every citizen of the country, but there is a special significance for the opinions and voices of the farmers.
We brought an emergency law.
Yesterday, on August 31, the period of this emergency legislation will be completed.
This will ensure that farmers are not economically damaged.
I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan are not merely a mess.
The interests of the poor farmers living in villages are in our minds.
Therefore, in my Independence Day speech, I had stated that the Ministry should work in the field of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare not just agriculture but also in the field of agriculture.
We are moving ahead with this resolution.
I want to talk about one more thing.
Two days ago, the war in 1965 ended 50 years.
When we talk about the war in 1965, it is natural to remember Lal Bahadur Sastry.
Similarly, the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan will also be remembered.
Our scientists are really making great progress.
Several new information has been given to me.
This was meant to give me sympathy and education.
Many young scientists shared with me a lot of sorrow and I have seen many dreams in their eyes.
Even in the voice of previous man, I had said that we should guide our student wealth to science.
I had also spoken about what is needed for the fraternal examination in the following works, even after my Independence Day address.
While calling for a positive selection, every poor family and widowed mothers have to waver in the matters of getting a Cyberculosis letter, seeking the help of whom to get the job.
This is also one of the reasons for corruption at the bottom.
I had said that there should not be a direct examination under a particular level.
I am glad that in the absence of 15 days, the government is progressing rapidly in this direction, suggestions are being made, this decision will almost be completed and I am happy that the system of direct examination for under-graduate workplaces will be tired.
Today, there is a colour of multilateral entrepreneurs for India.
To reduce the maternal mortality rate, 24 countries of the world have organized a conference in coordination with India to implement the Call to Action Plans.
For the first time outside the US, this think-tank meeting took place in India.
Every year about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh mothers in our country die after delivery.
As we have been released from polio, we have also been liberated from tetanus as a reason for mother-child deaths.
The world has accepted it.
But even today we must save our mothers and save our children.
Brothers and sisters, Today, dengue fever is spreading.
It is true that the fever of dengue is dangerous, but it is simple to avoid it.
My appeal to Swachh Bharat is related to this.
Even if we see advertising on television, we don't pay attention to them.
Even though advertisements are made in newspapers, our children are not paid in them.
People are being aware of the ways of clean water conservation in small households.
We are living in good houses, there are many facilities, but sometimes we do not know that water is staging around us.
I urge you not to expand such a simple pace of gratuity for death.
Life is a very valuable one.
Decrease in water consumption and clean neglect are the calls for death, it is not true.
About 514 dengue fever detection centres have been set up across the country, where free examinations have been conducted.
Timely testing and treatment is the best for life savings.
Your cooperation is very important in this regard.
From Raksha Bandhan to Deepawali, there will be festivals and festivals in the coming days in our country.
Why shouldn't we connect all our festivals with cleanliness
Good records will become habitual, right
My dear countrymen, I want to share a pleasant message with you.
Hidendra Mahajan, Dr.
The interests of the tribal people of our country are enhanced in the minds of Mahendra Mahajan.
These two brothers are proud of India.
This year, these two brothers have succeeded in this event and have been proud of India.
I congratulate both these brothers and sisters.
But in all these efforts, they are taking into account the interests of the Team India, Vision for Tribals and the Tribals.
See how everybody is contributing to the progress of the country.
Asked about such events, the grief grows in a great sense.
Sometimes, because of our perspective, we are suffering from injustice to our young people.
I believe that this trend has been going on for centuries.
But my experience was different from the young people.
Sometimes when we talk to the youth, we can learn too many things.
On Sunday, I meet many young people who have decided to take a bike ride on Sunday.
Some people are following it as a cycle day that I will travel only one day a week.
They say that this gives me good health, environmental good and young happiness.
Nowadays, there are many chocolate clubs operating in many cities of our country and there are many people who are also encouraged to visit the cycles.
This is a good effort for health and environmental health.
As the achievements of two youths of India have made the nation proud, the attitude of the youth of the country is also worth mentioning.
The building of Baba Saheb Ambedkar's memorial in the Hindu Mills land of Mumbai has been stirred for a long time.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's memorial will be reminiscent when Indians around the world go to London.
I express my heartfelt condolences and congratulations to the State Government of Maharashtra, trying to create these two memorials that will be built to enrich Babasaheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes to you, thank you very much.
There is a huge shortage of pulses and oil seeds in our country.
Poor people need pulses, and some ideas are required to be included in peasant forms.
I am happy that at this stage, 50 percent increase in pulses species and about 33 percent increase in oilseeds is seen.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to my farmer brothers for this thing.
My dear countrymen, on 26th July, the history of our country has been celebrated as a victory day in Kargil war.
Not only on the borders of Kargil war, every village and city of India has contributed to it.
On July 26, I consider it important for another matter.
After the formation of our government in 2014, we started the MyGov Internet on 26th July in a few months.
I am happy that nearly 2 crore people have gone to the MyGov Internet as the government has completed nearly one year and about 12 lakh people have expressed their views in it.
It is even more pleasant that more than 50,000 people have given their suggestions in the PMO app and have spent their golden time for this and have given their thinking in it.
They have given very excellent advice.
But the people of the state have not yet noticed this, but brother Akhilesh Vajpayee's advice, the government has sweeped into consideration and today we have implemented it.
Today, any scheme of the government has to be implemented, projects are being implemented and policies are being formulated and most positive suggestions are being received on the MyGov Internet.
My suggestions are also being made on MyGov's face-to-face for what I want to address on August 15.
Suchitra Arafatwachari from Chennai has given me many suggestions.
He has been asking to keep women children safe, keep women children alive, talk about clean Ganga and clean India.
You cannot record your comments on what I should speak on August 15
You can send Mygov to the face, write to the radio and send it to the Prime Minister's Office.
In my speech on August 15, it is a great idea that I want to get a place from the public.
Surely I think you will give me great ideas.
Two days ago, I was thinking of a disaster in Delhi, after that, the person who traveled to Scooter split his life for ten minutes.
He didn't get any help.
People have been asking me in many occasions that you should talk about road safety and wake up.
Your concern is okay.
If we wash the statistics, the heart would stop.
There is a danger every minute in our country.
I urge my parents to create an environment related to the development of two-sector vehicle or four-sector vehicles, whatever the safety related aspects.
In this regard, the government has also made several attempts to ensure that the road safety related awareness, road construction related engineering, enforcement of law, urgent treatment for the injured after the accident, we are bringing the Sale Transport and Defence Bill in mind.
In the days to come, we are planning to make several important efforts to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Programme.
We are focusing on cashless treatment on national highways like Kutgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, Mumbai and Ranchi.
Under this, we are also thinking about how to get the most important life savings and maintenance in the first 50 hours by postponing the issues related to who will pay.
We have to achieve this mainly in the perspective of the dangers that are not happening, and in reality every life is valued.
Sometimes I have to say that the workers should be the Karma Yogis.
In the past few days, I share with you some events that touched my heart with this idea.
It is a good feeling when everyone sees how they can bring alive even in their bookings.
Vijay Biswaal has expressed his appreciation of how to connect his country, his art and his opening with his work.
I believe that Vijay Piswal's picture can be a thing to speak in the days to come.
I would like to assure you that a big team of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has touched my heart.
Sometimes, some small things are also very happy, so I share them with you.
There is a village named Kesla in Rajnandka, Chhattisgarh.
Over the past few months, they have created a campaign to build toilets.
Now there is no need to spend natural resources outside the village.
Whatever this happens, when it was completed, the entire village celebrated it as a big festival.
The best examples are that how the values of social life change, how the attitude of the people is changing and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
Bhavesh Da from Guwahati has written to me about the problems faced by the North-Eastern states.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister of the country, a Ministry called DONER was formed, that is, the Ministry of Development of North Eastern states.
Well, we cannot decide the interests of the North-Eastern states by sitting in Delhi or not
Therefore, a team of officials from the Government of India went to North-Eastern region including Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim.
This effort could have had good results in the days to come.
This is an excellent attempt to move from Delhi to far-flung areas and I call ACT EAST policy.
My dear countrymen, the success of the Sevay Grameen Yojana is a great pleasure for me.
Just a few days back, India has established 5 UK satellites through its PSLV C28.
This news is not one of the most attractive ones, but it is the biggest achievement.
Sometimes when we ask the younger generations of the country, what you want after growing up, one hundred of them would be more than one scientist.
It is a matter of concern that the country is less aware of science.
Under this, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has launched a National Innovation Mission.
I would like to appeal to the officials of the Government of India to share your experiences with them in a way that you can also spend one and a half hours a week in the manner of encouraging students from your nearby school-colleagues.
Our villages should get electricity 24 hours or not
Although this work is difficult, it has to be completed.
Today, even if we need to serve mobile then we have to go to another village.
The benefits for the cities should be extended to the villages and these facilities for the poorest of the market.
For this reason, we have launched the 'Deen Day Upadhyayi Gram Jyoti' programme.
Our country is the largest country where there are tens of thousands of villages and to ensure electricity supply to most remote areas.
Your comments will be bad to me.
Thank you very much
When I said so, I don't expect a lot of answers from you.
Millions of people had sent photographs through Tower, Festival and Instakram.
I am also retweeting something that attracts my views.
If some people did not record the photographs of Andhra Pradesh (B) Fellow Caves, they would have been unaware that many of the people of the country had such caves.
This is the picture of Orccha in Madhya Pradesh
We always know Rajasthan as a less water state but it is surprising when someone sends photographs of waterfalls from there.
That is, in fact, it's a wonderful thing.
I can assure you that Yoga practices are not supposed to be sunset in the world.
In view of the extent to which the world has expanded Yoga, the glory and pride in the minds of any Indian cannot be achieved
And I also blew up in the flood of joy, and the heart was thrilled.
As the Sin River and the Eiffel Tower of the French people were immensely honourable, they also chose these marks background for Yoga training.
The New York people have learnt of the Times Square to celebrate Yoga.
As soon as Australia's Sydney talks, the scenes of the Abera House are shining in mind.
The Australian nationals had practiced yoga in front of the Abera House Centre.
Rajbhat became Yogapat.
A new upheaval, a new spirit, a new zeal and a new enthusiasm in every crore of the world could be felt.
A few days ago, a child from Vietnam had televised a picture of Yoga, which was very interesting and popular all over the world.
Everyone is associated with women, men, old people, children, villagers, urban residents, developing countries and developing countries in doing Yoga.
Yoga is actually a factor connecting the world.
I don't know how the world of intellectuals will despise and criticize this event.
But one thing I feel is that the world is very interested in knowing about India.
An interest in India has grown and the world is keen to know about Indias values, heritage and culture.
But if we have the pride and honour of our heritage then we can bring it to the world.
Sometimes we think of what is innovation in this, for example, we can tell our family values and we dont know that the family values of the world are the biggest thing.
This is the application I placed in the youth of the country, especially in the field of Information Technology. Your youths, all of you, together, plan for online Yoga.
Do you know that there is a sector called Ayush in the state
Nobody will pay attention to it.
Two-four times in five years, a small sector at one corner.
But it was during Yoga Day.
The smallest sector has worked worldwide.
This is an example of how many small organisations can fulfil the greatest tasks when the target is before us.
The world was surprised to see how we have rescued the victims of the victims in the country of Eman.
The world saw that in just a few hours, the Indians had hurriedly moved to Nepal and helped them.
If we start working in our minds, the government and the government will work faster, the government servants will work faster and the common man will take a dig at the head.
This is my own experience.
This is the real power to improve the country.
Last month, we announced three people's life insurance schemes from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people are engaged in life insurance schemes, but we have to move forward.
An idea arises in my mind, I want to put it before you.
The Raksha Bandhan Festival is coming in August, the people of the country will start a strong mass movement before the Raksha Bandhan Festival.
Come, let us all join me and try to fulfil this commitment.
When I shout Mann Ki Baat, many people give me advice.
This time, many people have advised me to tell me something about the weather.
Thiruvananthapuram, Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harshvardhan of Mysore, Privin Dinakarni and Divyanshu Gupta are asking you to talk about the season.
They have also given good ideas to their share.
You might also have been enjoying this rainy season with hot packets, buzzi and sorghum.
Just as the sun rays give us life, the rains also give us strength.
Every drop of rain was valued.
As a dweller and society, we should continue to develop the spirit of saving every drop of water.
The water in the village should be in the village and the water in the city should be used for the use of the city.
We should save every drop of water, be it water management, be it small ponds or lakes.
If you have to go to Gandhiji's birthplace, if you can see his house, then you can see a bag in his 200-year-old house where there is a stretch of water storage underground, which provides direct access to rain water.
This must be seen by you.
Even during that period, it has been taken care of.
We can't do this too
This should be transformed into a public movement.
The entire village should follow this method.
Similarly, the greenery buys our eyes.
Green life is so charming
Whether these trees, plantations and parks change their lives with greenery or not
We all have to work in this rainy season through the social organisations and through the youth in large numbers.
I give a suggestion from my own experience and this rural technology is a very successful one.
When you tremble, put an old soil near the plant, and fill it with water.
Health is one of the most important reasons for bacterial bacteria to grow due to the moisture in the atmosphere.
Cleanliness is very important.
It is necessary to drink pure water.
Most of the people are fed by boiling water during this season.
That's why there are friends too.
The more we pay attention, the more we get protection from diseases.
Water and rains are also needed, but it is also important to stay safe from the disease.
Ladies and Gentlemen, now we have introduced three new schemes, especially for the urban masses.
Under the Amrid Yojana, we have created a movement that will facilitate the lives of our cities.
In 2022, when India celebrates the 75th anniversary of its independence, all Indians should be given houses.
In view of these three things, we have started a big scheme.
This inspired all parents to take selfie photographs with their daughters and register them on social networks.
In Haryana, the rate of female children is very low compared to the male children.
There are 100 districts with such a worrying ratio in the country.
This is very high in Haryana state.
In some way, we will make the scheme "Safe and Save the girl child," as a mass movement.
Keep in mind, you will realize how happy the movement will provide protection to women and children.
Remember the rainy season well
Change our country into green
I'm telling it an experience.
Take this forward.
I salute you the next time for the next day's voice programme.
Sometimes some people believe that I want to announce the government's welfare schemes in my heart's voice programme.
This is my happiness.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You can imagine how this interim period is spent.
On Sunday, the last Sunday of the month, at 11 o'clock in the morning, the feeling that something has been released and that it is yours
But I thought it should be on Sunday.
But I waited with impatience when this Sunday was coming.
Many people have asked me why I travelled to Kedarnath amidst the election process.
But if I start traveling in that direction, I can change the course of Mann Ki Baat.
That's why I went away when the election period was frustrated and the patterns of success failed and the vote continued.
Many consider it a political instrument.
As for me, I consider it as an opportunity to meet me.
Maybe I went to meet me in a way.
I cannot say when I will do it, but I will definitely do it because it is my duty to give you the right to know.
As people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I have been consistently conscious of your efforts to strengthen the artificial aspects.
Interpretations in the letters to Mann Ki Baat are totally different from the default state levy.
Sometimes your words are also opening the ceiling between my thoughts and currents.
When one writes about cleanliness, he expresses his anger against unhygienic and also helps in cleansing efforts.
If someone discusses the environment, his pain reflects in it
But at the same time, he also describes the efforts made by him and the thoughts that he has in his mind.
That is, in his words a scene of how the solution to problems can be included in the entire society.
Mann Ki Baat acts as a glass to the nation and society.
This shows that there is no dearth of the determination, power and capability of the people of the country.
It is necessary to coordinate those strengths and capabilities, create opportunities for them and work towards constructive efforts.
Mann Ki Baat tells us that 130 crore people in the progress of the country want to be strong and positive.
One writes a letter to the Prime Minister of the country, but you can imagine that he has not made any application for himself...
The feelings of such millions of people in the country will be so excellent
When I examine all these things, I leave your imagination that how much joy I get and how much enthusiasm I am.
You can't imagine that you're driving me, you're driving me fast, you can't imagine that you're snatching my life every moment...
Without this connection, I was waiting in the camp.
Today my heart is filled with happiness.
With this feeling, we will move ahead with the voice chain of Mann Ki Baat.
When the urgency was born in the country, the struggle against it did not stop with political definitions and political leaders
It has not been imprisoned even between the prison umbrellas.
Every immigrant was wrathful in his heart.
There was a stir for the lengthy democracy.
If we don't eat food every day, we don't know what is hungry.
Similarly, whenever one knows about democratic rights in normal life and the joy that it gives, one breaks our democratic rights.
In the aftermath of the urgency, every citizen from all over the country knew that something had been broken.
It is because of this tradition that I can say that India is a living society.
That is why the people of the country understood the lack of democracy and in the emergency, we experienced this deficiency.
Therefore, the country had dedicated not for itself, but for the protection of democracy, but for the protection of democracy.
When any thing or something is far from our cake, we imagine its significance, we neglect their miracles.
In India, more than 61 crore people have voted for the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.
This figure may seem very common to us, but if we have seen China from the perspective of the world, more than any country in the world have voted for this election.
The number of voters who voted in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 is twice more than the entire population of America, which is more than the entire European population.
This indicates the vastness and vastness of our democracy.
Lok Sabha elections in 2019 have been the worlds largest democratic elections in history so far.
You can imagine how much material and human resources will be required to accommodate such a huge election.
This is possible because of the hard work of millions of teachers, officials and workers overnight.
This time, due to the hard work of all of them, more than the previous time, the vote has reached the stage.
About 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh polling machines and more than 17 lakh sweeping devices across the country for vote...
I leave the gloriousness of the arrangements behind your imagination.
All these were implemented to ensure that no voter should be denied the right to vote.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, only one woman voter was formed.
You will be surprised to know that the election officials took two days to reach there.
This is the true respect given to democracy.
The ballot in the world's highest place is in India itself.
The voter is 15,000 feet high in the place of Lahaul Spiti in Himachal Pradesh.
Apart from this, there is also a matter of pride for this election.
This may be the first time in history that women and women have participated in the vote with enthusiasm for men.
The vote percentage of women and men in this election was almost the same.
One more interesting thing about this is that today, the number of women members in the rankings is 78.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard me often that the book is not a book.
I was asking you to give books instead of flowers during the time of reception.
Since then, people have started giving books in many places.
Now one has given me a book titled 'Premchand ji's famous stories.
There has been no time for many days, but due to foreign travel, he has got a chance to read some of his stories again.
Premchand describes the true position of the society in his stories, while reading, the scenes start dwelling in your heart as a painting.
Everything he wrote is alive.
My young days were shadowed in my mind...
The second story touched the depths of my heart and its name was 'Ethgah'.
A young man's imagination, a clean love from his grandson, and his imaginative mind at such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamith comes to his granddaughter with a bread bread from the festival, the human feeling touches the peak.
Likewise, the name of a stories touching the chest is 'Poose Kirath.'
In this story, a contrast to the lives of a poor farmer has been painted with life.
Even after his consequences were destroyed, the farmer named Haldu is happy because he doesn't have to sleep in his wilderness in the winter of bones.
But even though these stories were written about a century ago, we can feel that these are still worthy.
After reading these, I realized a different experience.
While talking about the lessons, I used to live in some media about Akshara library in Kerala.
Sometimes the books have been bound by binding and binding on the back.
Today, this library is showing a new direction not only to the tribal children but also to everyone.
Gujarat's Vanje Gujarat movement is a successful effort.
In this campaign to read books, all age groups participated in millions.
In today's digital world, I urge you to spend some time in your daily books during the Kukul Guru period.
Indeed, you will enjoy this and write about the book you have read and in the NarendraModi App so that the voice leaders of the mind can also know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to know that our countrymen are thinking about things that can become witnesses in the future, not stopping with the present.
When I read the comments made by you in NarendraModi and MyGov, I could see how many people wrote about water.
Besides Pawan Kaurai from Belgavi and Siddamsu Mohan Parita from Bhubaneswar, many others have written about water related challenges like Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf.
Water has a great significance in our culture.
In the book of Recognition, it is said: Apohista Mayopova: It is a pleasure to feel that the water is the life-saving power and energy.
The water is equal to the mother that is, mother-in-law will enhance her blessings.
Water constraints affect many parts of the country every year.
You might be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water received due to rain throughout the year can be saved in our country.
Only 8 percent.
That's why it's time to find a solution to the problem.
I firmly believe that if we open 130 crore people through the power of the people, in collaboration with the people, we can solve this problem with responsibilities.
Considering the importance of water, a new Ministry of Water Resources has been established in the country.
This will enable all the water related issues to be resolved in a hurry.
Just a few days ago, I was inspired to make things different.
I also sent a letter to the Panchayat leaders and the rural leaders of the country.
I had written a letter to them, to collect water, to maintain every drop of rain water, to meet the village council, to join the villagers and to take care of them.
I am very happy that they have been involved in this work and on 22nd of this month, millions of people participated in thousands of panchayats.
People from all over the village are determined to save every drop of water and share their lives.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat programme, I want to talk to you about the leader of the party.
The people there once again became ready to fulfil their constructive contribution to water conservation.
My best wishes to all the Panchayat leaders and all the rural leaders who have done a constructive job from my level.
There are several leaders who have made such a challenge across the country.
In a way it is an opportunity for the entire village.
There is a feeling in my mind that the villagers are now engaged in the competition to build a temple for some water in their village.
As I said, positive results are achieved through social efforts.
There is no way to confront the water crisis across the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country, in different ways.
But the goal of everyone is to save water and maintain water.
Punjab's waste water streams are under construction.
This effort will liberate from the problem of barriers.
There has been a change in the lives of the villagers due to the construction of water streams at Thamiyyapalli in Telangana.
There has been a major change due to small ponds built in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
When I was reading about a social effort in Vellore, I knew that there were 20,000 women in the work of revival of the Naga river.
At the same time, I also read about the women of the Garhwal region, who have done a great job of collecting rain water for each other.
When people burst one, water will be stored.
Today, through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I appeal to the people of the country.
My first request: Just as the people of the country have transformed cleanliness into a mass movement, let us take the initiative to transform water conservation into a mass movement.
I am confident that all of us together will be determined to save every drop of water.
It is said that if this rosemary falls, it is iron gold.
But the water is also such a rosemary which produces new lives due to water swelling.
We need to create an Awareness Movement to save every drop of water.
My second request to the people of the country is that many traditional methods have been used for water conservation in our country for centuries.
I urge you all to share these traditional methods with you all.
If anyone of you gets the opportunity to go to the battlefield, then there is a 200-year-old water storage tank in a house beside the house of the house.
Come, let us create a large list of water storage and inspire people to live in water conservation.
You all share your views using Janshakti4JalShakti.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you and the people of the world for one more thing.
Many of the Republicans of many countries of the world, Prime Ministers, well-known and ordinary citizens have shown me how Yoga is being organised in every country.
On that day, the world appeared as a happy family.
We know that the need for a healthy society, a healthy and understanding person is needed and Yoga ensures it.
Therefore, the spread of Yoga is a great task of social service.
Is it not a matter of pride to accept such service
In the year 2019, it has given me the only way to make an announcement to the Prime Minister's Awards for making the best contribution to the progress and development of Yoga.
This award is given to the institutions which have played an important role in spreading Yoga art across the globe.
Japan Yoga Niketan conducts several colleges and training studies there
Similarly, Ms.
He is not an example of conception.
When it comes to Yoga, tell the people of India to stay behind
It is a matter of great pride that Yoga should be celebrated and the message of Yoga should be given to all the households and it is also important to celebrate Yoga Day.
My hearts and my dear countrymen, our journey has started today and new feelings, new experiences, new determination and new opening...
Yes, wait for your consultations as always.
We all meet again and again and we are happy to speak.
I hear your feelings, I'm saving, I understand.
Sometimes I try to live according to those sentiments.
Let your acids continue.
You are my thoughts, you will give me strength.
Come together, we will experience the voice of the heart and we will fulfill our duties in life on Tuesday.
Once again, we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat next month.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
My heart is dreaming today when the voice of mind begins.
10 days ago, Bharat Mata lost her valiant friends.
These valiant soldiers have lost their lives to save 125 crore countrymen.
Our brave friends had dedicated themselves to sleep peacefully.
In Pulwama's radical attack, the hearts of the country have been wounded and wounded after the death of our brave soldiers.
There are confused news from all sides about the martyrs and their families.
I salute the soldiers of the country who dedicate their lives to the protection of Mother India.
The task of confronting this challenge in front of the country should be forgotten by all the differences of opinion like casteism, religion and regionalism, so that our sympathies and decisions against radicalism are determined and determined.
Our armed forces have demonstrated courage and mighty iniquity for ever and ever.
On the one hand, they have expressed their immense potential for peace, while they have done the same instance of responding to the attackers.
You can see what kind of action was taken within 100 hours of the attack.
The militants and their subsidiaries have been pledged by the military to cross Kelly.
After the martyrdom of the brave army, the words and comments that their relatives expressed by the media have been widely strengthened and strengthened across the country.
Meena ji's wife, Prasanna Sahu, a martyr from Jagatsinghpur in Odisha, celebrates her immense sympathy throughout the country.
He admitted that he would join his only son in the Central Border Security Force.
When Vijay Shoren, who was fought by a tricolor, reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his nephew son and I will also join the army.
Today, the grief of this binocular is rising in the body of every child of India, inspired by the spirit that has been mixed in life.
Whether it is the family of Deoria's martyr Vijay Maurya, or the fathers of Kangta's martyr Tilakraj, or Hamraj's six-year-old daughter-in-law from Kota, the story of every family of the martyrs is inspiring and inspiring.
I urge the younger community to know and understand what these families have expressed and what they have shown.
In order to know what is the patriotism, it is not necessary that we look at the past steps of history.
My beloved countrymen...
For such a long period of independence, we all wait for a war memorial.
It is natural to have the greed and enthusiasm of the people in this regard.
Shri Onkar Shetty, Udupi, Karnataka, has expressed his happiness over the creation of a National War Memorial at the NarendraModiApp.
It is surprising that no national level war memorial has been built in our country so far.
I want it to be a memorial decorated with the prophets of the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the country.
I was sure that such a memorial should be built in the country.
The second cycle, the symbolic cycle of valour, reflects the courage and deeds of the soldiers.
On the walls of the seminar, the brave adventures of the soldiers will be carved.
Subsequently, the Thyaga Chakra
This cycle indicates the sacrifice of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the soldiers who have made the nation the most popular for the country will be recorded in golden scripts.
After this, the Raksha Chakra symbolizes security.
There is a line of dense trees in this chakra.
It is impossible for our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces to play an important role in the progress of the country.
In October last year, I got the greatest opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
This memorial was also created as an expression of the feeling that we should be grateful to men and women dependent on our police who have been in defence all the time.
I am sure you will definitely go to the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you go to those places, surely share your photographs on the social network, so that others also get encouraged to visit these sacred places.
My dear countrymen, your thousands of letters and comments come to me in different ways for the sound of mind.
This time when I was reading your comments, an interesting idea of Adisha Mukobathya ji attracted my attention.
His age is only 25 when the British arrested Birsa Munda on March 3, 1900.
Similarly, on March 3, Jamshedji Dada ji's birthday is also an accident.
He added that these two men are completely different from family backgrounds, but both of them have made the tradition and history of Jharkhand rich.
Giving tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat is similar to the respected history and heritage of Jharkhand in a way.
These two great men have brightened not only the name of Jharkhand but also the name of the whole country.
Thank you for your contribution throughout the country.
If an inspirational man is needed today for the guidance of our youth, he is Lord Birsa Munda.
The British seized him while he was asleep in a terrible and nervous manner.
Do you know why they have forgotten such a thing
Because the British who had established such a magnificent empire were also surprised to see him.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda supplied the British regime using guns in his traditional wheels.
Indeed, if people get a sympathetic leadership, the morale of the society is greater than the power of arms.
They took the destitute and oppressors to the sun brightened from dark life.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda was martyred at the end of his 25 years of life.
Like Birsa Munda, the sons of Mother India have emerged from all parts of the country.
Such great men were filled everywhere because they couldn't see anything that had been part of the centuries-old freedom struggle.
But unfortunately, their stories of sacrifice, warmth and sacrifice do not reach new generations.
If people like Bhagwan Birsa Munda have realized our lives, people like Jamshedji Dada have given great institutions to the nation.
In fact, Jamshedji Tata ji is a visionary prophet, who has not only seen the future of India but also established a strong foundation for it.
He was very well aware that it would be necessary to make India an instrument of science, technology and industry.
Due to his perspective, the Tata Institute of Science was established and now it is known as the Indian Institute of Science.
Moreover, he established a number of institutions and industries, such as Data Steel.
As a result of this conversation, the Indian Institute of Science was born.
My dear countrymen, the birthday of former Prime Minister of our country, Morarji Bai Pathy, is 29th February.
You all know that this day will come only once in four years.
At the same time, Morarji Bai, a peaceful person, is one of the most regulatory leaders of the country.
Morarji Bai Desai, who dedicated the most budgetary statement in the Parliament of Freedom India, will serve them.
During that period, the country's democratic system was a major threat.
Morarji Bai Desai dedicated himself against the urgency to protect democracy.
For this, he had to pay a huge price in his negotiation.
The then government arrested him and imprisoned him.
But when the Janata Party won in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his regime, the 44th constitutional legislation was completed.
Why this was an important fact that the 42nd constitutional amendment was brought in to reproduce the urgency, in addition to decreasing the powers of the Supreme Court, some other elements that were present in it have broken down our democratic values, so they were withdrawn.
That is, through the 44th Constitution, the functioning of Parliament and the Legislative Assembly was empowered to print in the news papers.
In the form of a written recommendation to the Cabinet, the President was first made to proclaim the urgency and could not increase the urgency period by more than 6 months in a manner.
Morarji Bai ji asserted that in 1975, how democracy was assassinated and slaughtered, it could not be resumed.
His contribution to protect the magnificence of Indian democracy is great and the generations will always remember it.
Once again I see my best wishes to such a great leader.
With the help of their hard work, they create positive changes in the lives of others in different ways.
They are the true comrades who do the service of the country in a selfless manner.
When the Padma Awards are announced, you might have seen who is the person who is the one who is awarded the Padma Awards.
In a way, I consider it a big success because they are not seen in television and papers, who are away from the world of hypocrisy.
But if they are so, there is no concern that they should be named, they are confident that they will come down and work.
They live by slapping the song called Karmasu Gaushalam.
I want to share with you some of these things.
You must have known about Odisha's Taidari Nayak, without any reason calling him Odisha of Canalman, Taidari Naik has cut his own hands in his village and constructed a footpath for three kilometres.
I reminded former US President Barack Obama of the Tree of Life painting built by Abdul Kafur.
Among the Padma awardees, Shabbir Saiyat, from Maratwada, was known as the servant of the Greens.
It is amazing that how he dedicated himself to the service of Greens throughout his life.
The small boys from Madurai first tried to contribute to the oppressed and oppressed, through the Kalanchiam movement of Tamilnadu, and also started socially interconnections.
Even though he has been a hundred years old, he has communicated Yoga to the people all over the world and has so far made 1500 people Yoga enthusiasts.
Jamuna Du (Tudu), a well-known girl named Lady Tarzan in Jharkhand, has done a sympathetic job against the slaughterers and slaughterhouses, prevented the destruction of 50 hectares of wilderness and encouraged 10,000 women to unite and defend trees and wildlife.
Today, every villager is born with 18 trees and 10 trees during the marriage of every woman.
The story of Rajkumari Devi, a farmer from Bihar's Muzaffarpur, is very encouraging.
At present, I am trying to meet some beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, that is, Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, Over the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have been benefitted from this scheme.
I can see how big a change has been made in the lives of the poor.
The scheme is owned by all such poor people.
My dear countrymen, the elections are going to start in schools.
Various educational curriculums across the country will start in the next few weeks.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who are eligible for the examination.
A few days back, a big event called Pariksha Pe Charcha in Delhi was held in Town Hall.
One of the special features of the selective address programmes is that discussions are being held without interruption, depending on various issues related to selection.
Because we have thousands of years old, traditional culture.
A few days later, Mahashivaratri is going to come on the sacred day and this time, when Shivaratri comes on Monday, a special significance spreads in our hearts.
Just a few days back, I had gone to Kashi, where I got the opportunity to spend some time with some of the disabled brothers and sisters.
It was inspiring that their self-confidence was actually impressive.
While speaking, an unexpected handicapped young man said he was an architect, while introducing him as a microscope, I asked him how you would speak.
He said I will speak like a Prime Minister, Mmikri.
I was very surprising that when I was doing something right, I was waiting for a surprising surprise, just as I used to speak in the voice of my mind, he spoke like that, he showed the voice of my heart through Mimickri.
I am glad to know that people listen not only to the voice of Mann Ki Baat but also to remember it in many occasions.
In fact, I was very unhappy with the power of this transformed youth, and they had a great impact on me.
My dear countrymen, it has given me a unique experience to connect with you all through Mann Ki Baat program.
Through radio, I am interacting with millions of families every month.
Many times, while talking to you, while reading your letters, while listening to your phone calls, you consider me a family member.
This feeling blossoms a pleasant experience in my mind and is happy.
Friends, The elections are the biggest celebrations of democracy.
For the next two months, we all have been busy in the election process.
I am still a candidate in this election.
In order to respect the healthy democratic tradition, the voice of the next mind will be replaced last Sunday in May.
That is, on March-April, with the strength of all these three months of my feelings, with a new belief after the elections, with the strength of your blessings, once again with the voice of my heart, I will communicate with your heart for many years.
Once again I thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shiv Kumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Sivakumar Swamy will lay the foundation of this theory.
In his 111-year-old life, he served for social, education and economic development of thousands of people.
The extent to which his patriotism was widespread, he had a great disgust in English, Sanskrit and Kannada.
He is a social reformist.
He spent his entire life in food, shelter, education and spiritual enlightenment.
Swamiji's main objective was to provide all kinds of benefits to the farmers.
Chittaganga Math is organising green and farm festivals in a decent manner.
I have got the blessings of Swamiji.
Our former President Dr. A.
During this occasion, Kalam Aiya read a poem written for Vanakami ji.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Iyya describes the lives of Shri Shri Shiv Kumar Swamiji and the aim of the Chittaganga monastery in a beautiful manner.
There is a very important institution in our country
This is the combination of our democracy, more ancient than our democracy. I speak about the Election Commission of India.
On January 25, the ECI's Foundation Day, which we celebrate as National Voters Day.
In view of the quantity of elections being held in India, the world is surprisingly putting a finger on the nose
Voting centres are being set up in the areas that are 15,000 feet high in Himachal Pradesh, as well as in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
You might have heard about Gujarat
In the Kir forest area, a vote has been made only for one voter at a remote location.
Think about it, my friends.
This is the beauty of our democracy that the entire team of Election Commission workers goes to far-flung areas to recognise a voter and get the opportunity to use the voter's vote.
I heartily congratulate the Election Commission for its continuous efforts to strengthen the democratic system.
I congratulate the Election Commissions of all the States, all the Defence Forces, freedom in election works and other workers who are unemployed.
Lok Sabha elections are going to be held in our country this year
This time the youth born in the 21st century are going to vote for the first time in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have the opportunity to bear the responsibility of the country in their shoulders.
Now they are going to be partners in the process of making resolutions for the country.
Your dreams have been linked to the dreams of the country.
If you are eligible to vote, I urge young social friends to register your name in the voters list.
If we cannot vote for any reason in life then we should feel that it is tragic to us.
If we say something wrong happened in the country then we should be sorry.
This activity has to be changed naturally.
I urge the people of the country to make a motivation so that we can vote together and vote on the day of polling.
I am sure the younger generation voters will register their names in large numbers, they will improve their contribution to our democracy and strengthen it.
My dear countrymen, many times the greats have emerged in this great soil of India, such greats have done some marvellous and unforgettable acts for human society.
On January 23, he celebrated his birthday in a new way.
On Netaji's birthday, I am happy to inaugurate the museum specially dedicated to the well-known soldiers of the country's freedom struggle.
Within the Red Fort many such rooms and memories have been closed since Independence.
The Closing Red Fort has been transformed into a museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army, Yat-e-Jallian
The museum, built in memory of Indias first freedom struggle in 1857, is dedicated to the entire campus as the Granddi Mandir, that is, the Revolutionary Temple.
Every brick in these museums smells the fragrance of our glorious history.
At this place, the British government prosecuted the Indian mother's valiant friends - Colonel Brem Sail, Colonel Kurbaksh Singh Tillon and Mayor General Shahnawas Khan.
When I noticed the memories associated with Netaji in the Red Fort Revolutionary Temple, one of Netaji's family gifted me a very important hat.
In fact, the courage and patriotism of our heroes need to be sustained in different dimensions for our new generations.
About a month ago, I went to Andaman Nicobar Islands on 30th December.
The place where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had hoisted the flag 75 years ago, I got the opportunity to fly the flag of the flag.
On this occasion, the announcement related to the Azad Hind Government was made 75 years ago.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier, a skilled man.
Such a brave soldier has played an important role in the freedom struggle.
Delhi Salo, you give me a swearing-in, and I am giving you freedom, and Netaji gets rid of every Indian's heart with waking up and inspiring anger.
For many years, there was a demand for the secret demands of him to be brought to public space.
I am glad that we are doing this work.
I didn't think that all the family members of Netaji had come to my house one day.
We jointly talked about several things related to Netaji. We have paid tributes to Netaji Bose.
Efforts have been made to improve many places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Be it 26, Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum or Granthi Mantra associated with Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
If you come to Delhi then you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today, when we are discussing Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, I would like to share with you an event related to Netaji's life in Mann Ki Baat.
I have always thought of radio as an important media that creates connectivity with the people.
This radio station has been broadcasting news once a week in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengal, Marathi, Punjab, Pashto and Urdu.
In this radio station management, M.
R.
Vyas jis contribution is very significant.
The broadcasting programmes on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people, whose programmes gave great strength to our freedom fighters.
A art museum has been built in this Revolutionary Temple.
Efforts have been made to explore Indian art and culture in a more attractive manner.
There are four historical museums in the museum, with more than 450 paintings and art works of 3 centuries old.
In the museum, great artists like Amruda Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Roy and Cylos Mukherjee have been excellently displayed.
I urge you all to go there and see Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore's works, especially all of you.
You might be able to imagine if you are talking about the art, but you can go here and talk about the great works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I want to tell you that Gurudev is also a painter.
The special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not given any name to his great personalities.
He thought that the person who sees the picture should understand it and see the message provided by the picture in his own eyes.
His paintings have been depicted in European countries, in Russia and in the US.
I am confident that you will go to the Granddi Mantra and see his paintings.
My dear countrymen, India is a land full of pious people.
Our pilgrims have delivered messages of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
Such a sacred person is Chand Ravidas.
On 19th February, Ravidas Jis birthday.
Indeed, it is not appropriate to distinguish him in caste, religion and categories, if God gathers in all mankind.
Guru Ravidas was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Shri Ravidas tried to understand the importance of labour and labour throughout his life through his messages.
It would not be surprising if he told the world that he had described the significance of labour.
I once again recall my heartfelt condolences to Shri Ravidas Ji.
My dear countrymen, in MyGov, Kiran Siddar ji has been asking for discussions about the Indian Space Department and the dimensions related to its future.
Vikram Sarabhai has played an important role in Indias space program.
Our space program includes the contribution of innumerable young scientists of the country.
Our heart is shocking that the satellites and soundingrockets developed by our students are carrying out the space.
On the 24th of January, the Kalamsad, which was designed by our students, was launched in the application.
Even sounding rockets made by university students in Odisha are also greetings.
All space missions have been conducted in the last four and a half years since the independence of the country till 2014.
We have achieved 104 satellites in the same space.
We will soon register Indias presence in the Chandrayaan-2 movement.
Our country is using space technology in a very special way to protect livestock.
The space technology has been providing substantial support to the beauties, rail and road safety.
NAVIC devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which protect them and help in economic development.
We are using space technology to fulfil government service delivery and responsibility.
Under the scheme of housing for all, about 40 lakh houses have been provided in 23 states.
At the same time, Geo-Tack has also made about three and a half crore properties under Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Programme.
Today, our satellites are the symbols of the growing power of the country.
It is because of its contribution that we have made great connections with many countries of the world.
There is a special effort called South Asian satellites, which gives a huge value to the development of our neighbouring allies.
Through its specific competitive aviation services, India is not only from the growing countries but also from the growing countries.
The sky and the stars have always been attractive to the children.
Our space program provides opportunities and opportunities to move ahead with the borders that you have seen that everything cannot be done so far.
Our children are attracted by nectars and inspires to seek new stars and vision.
My beneficiaries, I have always said that those who play, develop, develop, and this time the unified sportspersons in Khelo India are brightened.
About 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 sports events in the Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January.
If the sportsperson performs well at the local level, he can understand the most important activity of the world.
This time, the sportspersons from all over the country demonstrated their talent in Khelo India.
He lives in a car with his family.
Sonali Helvey, captain of Maharashtra's committee for 21-year-old women, resides in Satara.
He has lost his father at a young age and his brother and his mother have encouraged Sonali.
We often see that women are not encouraged more in sports like kidnapping.
But he chose Sonali's stubbornness and acted well.
Abinav Shah, a 10-year-old Assamese, is proud to have won gold medals at the youngest age of sports in Callo India.
A farmer's daughter, Akshadha Vaswani, has won gold medals in Kanti and Baluduku.
His father is a farmer from Belgaum.
But did you ask about the competition to brighten the toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets participated in this unique contest for nearly a month.
The name of this unique competition is clean beautiful toilets.
Besides keeping people clean their toilets, they were using beautiful and shiny paintings, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Katch to Kamrup, a number of pictures related to clean beauty toilets are found on social networks.
I urge all the Panchayat leaders and the rural leaders to take the lead for such a movement in your Panchayat.
Make sure to share the pictures of your clean beautiful toilet with MysjatGhar on the social network.
Friends, Together with the aim of cleaning the country and liberating from open defecation, we made a memorable journey on October 2, 2014.
Today, due to the cooperation of the people of India, we are moving fast towards getting rid of the habit of excreting openly before 2nd October, 2019, due to which we can dedicate to him on the 150th birthday of Channel.
During this commemorative journey of Swachh Bharat, the role of Mann Ki Baat is also great, for this reason, when I am happy to share this with you, they have announced that more than 55 lakh villages and 600 districts have been freed from their open defecation habit.
My young friends, the days of examination are getting closer.
Anshull Sharma, who lives in Himachal Pradesh, is asking MyGov to talk about the selections and exam warriors.
Anshull ji, thank you for presenting this thing.
Yes, many families have the first phase of the year.
Students, their parents and teachers are all inclined to work related to selection.
And this time, students from many overseas are also going to attend the event.
In this Pariksha Pe Charcha, I am talking about all aspects related to the selection, particularly with our young friends about the depression-free examination.
I have been asking people to send insights and comments for this.
I am happy to note that a large number of people have shared their views in MyGov.
Some of these suggestions and suggestions will definitely be given to me during the Down Hall event.
You must participate in this program...
You can also see its direct broadcast through social media and Namo App.
The journey of 2019 will be successful.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
And that is why the benefits of experiences are our opportunity and the self-confidence of making a new one.

This will be our pride.

This time, India has won a large number of medals in Asian Games.
India has done the best in the Para Asian Games.
If I talk about every Indian's efforts and our social efforts, the voice of our minds will be born too long and even in 2019.
All of these have been reflected in the uninterrupted efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
Jayachandran joined the Lord.
People say he was trying to provide treatment to patients at any time.
Similarly, Sulkiti Narasma from Karnataka also joined the Lord on December 25.
Sulkitti Narsamma was helpful in delivery to pregnant mothers.
He has served thousands of mothers in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
Earlier this year, he was awarded the Padma Shri Award.
While we talk about healthcare, I also want to talk about the social efforts of doctors in Pijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Just a few days back, some members of our party told me that some young doctors camps were organized in the city to provide free treatment to the poor.
Every month many poor patients are benefitting from this camp today.
The enthusiasm of these medical friends who are in service with selfless feelings is indeed praiseworthy.
Today, I want to say that the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful movement because of social efforts.
Just a few days back, in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, more than 3 lakh people worked together in the cleanliness movement.
In this epic of cleanliness, all the people of the city, self-reliant organisations, students of schools and colleges and the people of Jabalpur participated with great enthusiasm.
The success stories of innovators, youngsters and entrepreneurs are described in the commencement.
Well, would we do a job
Shall we share information on such Internet bases
We all have a positive feeling.
Through this, a large number of people will know about our heroes who make changes in society.
There is a special significance for sports in every community.
While playing, there is strength in the minds of those who see it.
We feel many things like the names, identity and respect for the sportspersons.
But sometimes there are more things behind them than the sports world.
I want to tell you about Hanya Nissar, a daughter from Kashmir, who won the gold medal in the Cratery contest in Korea.
Hanya is a 12-year-old girl from Kashmir's Anantnag area.
Hanya's hard work and endeavour were hardly trained by Karate, but he learnt it and made it a record.
I congratulate all the people of the country for their future being bright.
Many good wishes and good wishes to Hanya.
Like him, another 16-year-old girl, Rajini and a lot of news came in the media, you must have read.
Rajini has won gold medals in the younger section in the thunderbolt competition for women.

After this, Rajini surrounded his mess in a cloth and put it in his bag.
Yes, you all wonder why Rajini drank a cup of milk

He traveled 159 days a day at a speed of about 300 km.
His unprecedented interest in cycling is really appreciative.
Whether such achievements, when we are asked about such successes, dont we feel conceptualized
The names of all these festivals may be different, but the feeling of celebrating everything is the same. These festivals are somehow associated with harvesting and sweeping, combined with farmers, mixed with villages and crops.
During this time, the time has come for the sun to enter the Mahar Rasi.
After this, gradually starts increasing day by day and starts harvesting winter crops.
My best wishes to our farmer brothers and sisters.
The feeling of unity in diversity - the feeling of unity - One India is the joy of the supreme India, through our festivals.
We can see how close our festivals and festivals are connected with nature.
Many of our festivals have been created in the spirit of conservation of rivers and water.
The sun is worshipped in rivers and waterfalls on the day of Satpura.
During the Makar Sankranti, thousands of thousands of people bathe in the pious rivers.
Participate with all the photos you have taken during these festivals so that the diversity of India and the beauty of its culture can be seen.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela is a magnificent diversity and the divine divineness is filled with glory.
People from all over the world come and join the Kumbh Mela.
In the Kumbh festival, people come and meet with faith and rituals.
At the same time, millions of people from overseas countries are connected to one place.
The tradition of Kumbh Mela is enjoyed in our great cultural trees and blessed with smell.
This time, from 15th January, the world famous Kumbh Mela to be organised in Prayagraj is looking forward to all of you.
For the Kumbh festival, saints and pilgrims have started coming.
Last year, we can calculate its special significance from connecting the UNESCO organisation Kumbh with the Integrated Cultural Heritage of Humanity, that is, the rich cultural heritage of humanity.
A few days ago, the angels of several countries went to see the preparations for the Kumbh festival.
At the same time flags of several countries were flew.
There is a possibility of people coming from more than 150 countries to participate in this Kumbh held in Prayagraj.
With the divineness of the Kumbh, the glory of India will showcase its magnificence in the world stage.
The Kumbh Mela is a big instrument to feel itself, and every person coming here has different experiences, and they are conscious of the world.
In particular, this great learning gives the opportunity to the youth to glitter in experience.
I had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I could see that arrangements for Kumbh are being made very critical.
People from Prayagraj are seen with great enthusiasm for the Kumbh.
I dedicated the Integrated Commonwealth and Control Centre to the people there.
There will be cleanliness along with simplicity in the organisations and good news about it will reach remote areas.
This time devotees can also perform the sacred darshan of Akshayavat after the sacred bath at Sangam.

Now the doors of Akshayavat are open for everyone.
This spiritual Kumbh should be the glory of Indian philosophy.
This Kumbh of faith should be the pride of the nation.
Be it the pride of the country's unity, this Kumbh of the devotees will be the pride of the tourists of the world.
Babu had an unconnected connection with South Africa.
Mohan is the only one in South Africa.
In South Africa, Gandhiji started his first chapter and voiced a resolution against diversity.
He established Finnics and Dalsty plantations, from where voices of peace and justice began to flutter all over the world.
He got the courage and provocation of spending many years in prison from a humble brother.
Do you know what Mandela said about his brother-in-law "Indians have been an individual part of our history, because here he has done his first test with his face
Here he made clear his commitment to justice
This is where he maintained the method of his Satyagraha philosophy and struggle.'
He set up his brotherhood as his model.
And Mandela is an inspiration for the world, and their millions will inspire us to build a lovely and proud society at any time.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a meeting of the police chief directors was held at Kewariya, along the Narmada coast of Gujarat, where there were genuine discussions with the police officers of the country.

My dear countrymen, Guru Gobind Singh jis holy birthday on 13th January.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
Until a large part of his life, his works were in North India, and he gathered sovereignty in the country of Maharashtra.
Patna, the birthplace, the functions of North India, the last momentum of life in Nalanda.
In a way, it can be said that the whole of India has got his blessings.
Guru Gobind Singh got the courage to fight for justice and from Sikh Gurus.
But whenever efforts were made to suppress the voices of the poor, the weak, the injustice against them, Guru Gobind Singh ji called for the poor, the weak, and fought with the right hand, hence it is said: "Sawa Lakse AK Ladaum, Cedion Sonman Baj Tudaum, Dobe Gobind Singh Namaha Udum.
He said, "The fight with the weak cannot express their power.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that it is a great service to overcome the sorrows of human society.
He was a man of valour, warmth, sacrifice and walking on the way.
Apart from this, Gurumukhi, Prajpasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu were also experts in many languages.
Once again, I congratulate Shri Guru Gobind Singh for his good wishes.
My dear countrymen, many programmes have been going on in the country without much debate.
Such a different attempt is FSSAI.
Festivals are being organised throughout the country on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi Ji.
Healthy India-Travels are being undertaken through the Mission of Eat Right India and Diet Distribution.
Whenever India becomes clean, it becomes healthy, then it is free.
The most important need for good health is nutritious food.
The knowledge about the importance of food is essential from a childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is a concluding event of 2018, in the year 2019, we will again reconcile and interact with our hearts.
Whether it is a personal life of the country or the life of the society, the inspiration is the source of development.
Come, let us move ahead with new inspiration, new enthusiasm, new emotions, new successes and new peaks, we also see changes and changes in the country.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On the 3rd of October 2014, on the third day of Vijaya Dasameeth, we all made a journey together through the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
This time, the letters and phone calls received from you are mostly related to this 50th part.
In MyGov, Ansu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar from Delhi, Vikas Yadav from Patna, Monica Jain from NarendraModiApp from Delhi, Prasenjit Sharma from West Bengal, Sangeetha Sastri from Nagpur, etc.
Your interest is natural.
Today, when almost radio has been forgotten, why is Modi connected with radio
I want to tell you something.
This happened in 1998.
I was working as the BJP in Himachal Pradesh.
I was going to a place in the month of May.
And he said, Take one of the loads that he had with him, and eat the load before he was ready for tea.
I am surprised to know what happened to someone at home like marriage.
No, brother, don't you
I'm really real.
And, behold, I will hear the radio first.
They were talking about it on radio.
In this forest area, in such an unpopular area, a common man sells tea as an autonomous person and asks for radio throughout the day.
Therefore, the milk of the most powerful media radio is not surprising when I am the Prime Minister.
From far-flung villages to cities, from far-flung villages to farmers and young industrialists, they have been inspired by Mann Ki Baat.
Millions of letters were read every month, phone calls were heard, comments were made on the secretary and MyGov
The journey of these 50 portions, which have been connected to the same fashion and made in an interesting manner, is linked to this journey.
At present, the Indian radio has also conducted a survey on the sound of Mann Ki Baat.
Some of the backgrounds that have been found are very interesting.
Those who have been researched, 70 percent of them are constantly asking for the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Growthy people consider that there is a positive feeling in the society as a great part of Mann Ki Baat.
A large number of people movements have been encouraged by Mann Ki Baat.
There is widespread discussion on indiophositive.
All this underscores the positive sensitivity and negative feelings of the people of our country.
People are sharing their experiences that the spirit of self-confidence has increased because of the sound of mind.
The idea of social service is a great change in the minds of the people.
But people are not connected only through this program.
The people of Mann Ki Baat are making their contributions through television, FMMNoli, mobile, internet, Facebook direct broadcasting and Periscope, apart from NarendraModi.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the entrepreneurs of the family for their faith in the sound of mind and becoming its part.
Your doubts are correct.
At the end of their survey, the program was also a result of political pro-politicalism.
When Mann Ki Baat started, it should not be political, nor should it blame the government on the back, in which Modi should not be seen anywhere.
Letters, Internet comments and telephone calls before every man's voice clearly showed the expectations of the lovers.
Modi will come and go but this country will last forever and will not be destroyed by our culture.
Small stories of 130 crore countrymen will never be hidden.
If I read the letter and the same sympathy appears in another letter, I can also guess it.
In addition to my experience, I share with you.
The movement of Mass Selfi, from a small village in Aryan, spread all over the country and abroad, cannot have any power to widen and create awareness.
When every section and popularity of the society is connected, when it is said in a new dimension of social transformation, it understands today's generation, it creates unknowing awareness.
The Indrama of India is about social justice and social power.
There are thousands of aspects of social life, one is political.
If everything happens in politics, it is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes political events and politicians dominate, other skills and other efforts of the society are suppressed.
Thank you for calling your phone.
In a way, you've been asked because of your call-up.
I have to replies directly to the question you asked, that I don't work on any productive issues.
Actually, the voice of the mind is the easiest job for me.
People's letters come before every man's voice.
The letter is not merely a paper for me
In fact, for about 40-45 years, I have lived the life of a saint and I have gone to most of the deserts of the country and have spent a lot of time in remote districts of the country.
To tell the truth, the voice of the mind is mine, but examples, sentiments and sentiments are all of my countrymen.
I haven't been able to tell the names of millions of such people so far, but all this is not distraught, but they are reflecting their letters and comments.
I am confident that your views will come to me more than ever before, the heart attack will be more interesting, and your contribution will be to make it more terrible.
Efforts are being made to deal with letters and comments and to the concerned department.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to my friends in Al India Radio, FM radio, Dordarshan, other TVs and social networks.
In this way, they become Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I express my heartfelt gratitude and thanks to all of them for their capabilities and capabilities.
I urge all of you to ask for this event in your state languages.
Any political media will never be happy, only a very low coverage, which is negative.
But the media made many things raised in the voice of the mind.
The media has done a lot of things like cleanliness, road safety, non-depression, and a cell phone with daughters, and has been working towards transforming it into a movement.
If you hadn't reconciled, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Financial people, thank you for your phone call.
I have no secret to tell the truth.
It becomes easier to understand anyone until the responsibilities in our lives are restricted.
At times, we talk about the gap between the family and the elderly and the elderly.
In fact, most of the prosperous people are less likely to speak to the census.
I am always trying to continue with the youth through special programmes or social networks.
I am always trying to know what they do or what they think.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I have come here to give more importance to the efforts of the children.
But I don't think there is no time to live in the youth, this thing helps the youngsters to build more innovations because they think they are doing things quickly.
Today's youngsters are talented and think of the greatest things.
Well, they will achieve great dreams and bring great successes.
Some say that younger generations are starting to do many things at a time.
I'm asking you, what's wrong with it
Wickremes are doing a lot of work at the same time.
If we pay our glance around us, it is a social entrepreneur, start-ups, sports or other sectors, you young people who make a big change in society.
These youngsters start questions and have the power to dream.
If we establish the thoughts of the young people on the earth, if we create an independent environment to shape them, then we can create a positive change in the country and they are doing so.
My dear countrymen, I urge you to talk about the Constitution Day to be held on 26th November in Mann Ki Baat from Gurugram to Vineeta Ji in MyGov.
Today, why is it important that in 70 years we have accepted our Constitution, we are going to replace our feet.
Vinita ji, thank you all for your advice.
Yes, tomorrow is the Argentina law day.
This is the day when we remember the people who have given us the Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1949.
It has been 2 years, 11 months and 17 days for the Constitution to complete this legislative work which has been drafted by the Constitution.
Just imagine that within three years, these mahaministers have adopted such a broad and deeper Argentina law.
The urge that they have created the Archaeological Survey is still an example of direct management and manufacturing.
We are also contemplating to fulfill our responsibilities in achieving our responsibility.
The significance of our Constitution is the detailed description of rights and obligations.
It is a memorable event to reflect the awareness of the Constitution between the youth and to link them with the various parallels of the Constitution.
In the year 2020, as a Republic, we have to complete 70 years of our journey and we will complete 75 years of our Independence in 2022.
Come, let us move ahead with the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, you should never forget the contribution of the man who is the center of the Constitution.
He's a nigger doctor.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar
On the 6th of December, the day of his grandson, that is, he became a immortal.
On behalf of all the people of the country, I pay my tributes to Baba Saheb and he gave him the right to live with respect to crores of Indians.
Democracy is an integral part of Baba Saheb's nature and India's democratic values are not imported from outside.
Democracy and Parliament are not new things for the country.
Once again my best wishes to Baba Saheb.
My dear countrymen, the birthday of Guru Nanak Dev ji was celebrated 2 days earlier on November 23, next year, in 2019, we will celebrate his 550th birthday.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji always thought of human welfare.
He always pushed the path of opportunity, work, service, dignity and brotherhood in the society.
All the States and Union Territories have been requested to celebrate this festival.
Similarly, the 550th birthday of Guru Nanak Dev ji will be celebrated all over the world.
And a train will also be made on the path of the pilgrimage of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
At present, when I was attending a meeting related to this, I had a meeting with Lakbat Saheb Gurudwara.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, there was a major impact on the Gurudwara.
But in collaboration with those regions, the state government revived it is still an example.
My Christians, after the 50th part of Mann Ki Baat, we will meet again in the voice of the next Mann Ki Baat and I have the opportunity to expose the feelings of my mind for the first time in the wake of my heart.
As much as I connect with you, our journey will be deeper and will be happy to meet everyone.
The question of what I got from Mann Ki Baat can weep in the hearts of some people.
Today, I want to say that one thing touches my heart through the sound of my heart, while listening to the voice of my family, the leader of our family sits in front of us and shares with us about our things.
Your best wishes, my best wishes.
Your expectations, my expectations.
And your will is Abilas, and my will is Abilas.
Come on, let us take this journey forward.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On October 31, our beneficiaries are the birthday of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This year, the youth of the country will be ready to participate in the Ek Bharat Abhiyan.
Now the climate is intact.
Therefore, I urge a large number of people to participate in the unity movement.
About six months before the country's independence, on January 27, 1947, the world-famous international press 'Time' was released with the picture of Sardar Patel on its first side.
In the news of the newspaper, they also published the map of India
But that map isn't like it now.
The map showcased India as a piece of piece.
It contained more than 550 locations.
When they left the country, they thought that India should be divided into pieces.
The Times commented that India is facing various threats such as partition, violence, food deficit, price rise and power politics.
The newspaper also stated that Sardar Vallabhbhai would be able to unite the country and cure the wounds in the minds of the people.
The article was also on the other side of history of the life of India's iron man.
During the floods in Ahmedabad by the year 1920, the article concluded as he carried out relief operations and the Burdoli Satyagraha.
His honesty and determination were so much that he had full faith in farmers, workers and industrialists.
Sardar Patel has taken a solution to unite the country, as the war was neglected by the fear of a single book.
He ensured that all the places in the country are connected with a united India.
Whether it is Junagadh, Hyderabad and Thiruvangoor or Rajasthan, the integral India we see now is the main cause of Sardar Patel's sympathy and vision.
This statue, built on the Narmada bank of Gujarat, is two times high like the statue of the United States' freedom goddess.
This will be the idol of the world's tallest application.
Every Indian will be proud of the world's tallest statue in India.
Sardar Patel, the real friend of our soil, will also decorate our air space.
I am confident that this statue, which has been dedicated to the mother of India, will be proud of every Indian.
Because it is natural for every Indian to see the image of unity.
I am confident that this statue will be a place where people across the country want to see.
My brothers and sisters, we all celebrated the Kaladpada Day yesterday.
I bow down to all those who are part of the defence forces of India.
I also salute the families of our soldiers.
You must know why we celebrate this day on the occasion of Kaladpada.
Indian troops took a foothill in Kashmir this day and saved the valley from being caught in the backdrop of the occupation.
This incident is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I read one of the old interviews of our respected army officer Sham Maneksha.
In this, Field Marshal Shah Maneksha recalled the time he was conceived.
At that time, military operations began in Kashmir.
In a meeting at that time, Fild Marshal Manekshah pointed out how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was cut off for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir, noting that there would be no delay in sending troops, and that Sardar Patel gave a clear instruction to the problem quickly.
After this, if our forces fled to Kashmir, we can know how our army successfully worked.
The memory of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is coming on October 31.
We pay our respected tribute to Indira Gandhi.
My countrymen, who do not want to play
If we have these talents, then our country will not only develop in the field of economic and scientific technology but also explore pride in the sports sector.
I am very happy to note the recent two meetings.
I congratulate them and their responsibilities in breaking the barriers and winning will be inspiring for all the people of our country.
Similarly, I got a great opportunity to meet the winners in the summer Olympics 2018 in Argentina.
You know that in the summer Olympics of 2018, the activity of our youngsters was so excellent that it has not yet been required.
We got 13 medals in this competition and got three medals in the melting double line.
You must remember that the activity of Indian soldiers was very excellent in the recently concluded Asian Games.
You must have noticed that I have repeatedly reiterated the word "Great or unprecedented achievement".
This is a reality to reflect the progress made by the sports sector of India every day.
Not only in the field of sports but in many sectors, India is creating new achievements.
For example, I would like to point out to you the reflective sportspersons of the Asian Games 2018, namely, the winner of the Asian Games.
He's a reproductive talent.
He lost his father when he was eight.
After that, eight-year-old supporters lived in the house.
He then left the house and cleaned the buses of Delhi Transport Corporation and worked in roadside foodgrains.
Similarly, Narayan has won the medal for India in international competitions.
Besides, it should also be noted how fast the Indian sports sector is getting special attention.
Moreover, India has not yet won tension in Junior or Chinese category in Judo.
But, in the Youth Olympics, India's Tababi Devi won the silver medal and won the historic achievement.
The 16-year-old Tababi Devi is from a village in Manipur.
His father is an ordinary worker, who is doing fishing.
It's time to buy food items too.
In such a situation, his zeal and dedication did not diminish.
He has won a medal for the country and has made history.
The entire world appreciated that this competition took place very successfully.
FIFA has achieved the world's competitiveness for the age group of 17, and the number of people who are seen in the field.
More than 12 lakh sports enthusiasts have seen football competitions in different sports destinations in the country and have encouraged youngsters.
This year, we have got the opportunity to hold the World Cup in Bhubaneswar for male Hockey competitions.
The Hockey Competition will be held on November 28 and December 16.
Every Indian, whether he plays any game or is interested in any game, will definitely be interested in hockey competition.
In the Hockey Games, India has made records of golden writings.
India has won reservoirs in different competitions and has won the World Championship once.
India has also created a number of best hockey fighters.
Whenever we cited Hockey sports, we cannot finish it without mentioning our achievements.
Major Dayanchand's name, considered to be Hawki's father, is known all over the world.
Further, Balbir Singh Cineer, Lesli Cladians Mohammad Shahid, Uttam Singh to Dhanraj Bulle, is a long history of Indian Hawki.
Even today, the Indian soldiers are boosting younger generations with their hard work and aim.
This is a good opportunity for sports enthusiasts who want to see the best competitions.
Go to Bhubaneswar and encourage Indian sportspersons and every valiant person.
Odisha is the best historical background, not only the cultural heritage, but also the state.
All the people of that state are very fateful.
This is an excellent opportunity for sportspersons to see Odisha.
The world famous pilgrimages like Konark Sun Temple , Puri Jagannath Temple and Silka Lake can also be seen sports competitions.
I would like to assure the Indian men that they have the support of 125 crore Indians.
I congratulate all the teams who participate in this competition from different countries of the world.
My dear countrymen, the mood of the people who worked before social work is really an inspiration and encouragement to all the people of the country.
But in the present new era, the new generations are inspiring and encouraging with innovative means to fulfill their dreams.
I attended the inaugural function of a new Internet Account namely "I for Commonwealth". My Government's programme, the IT and Electronics Industrials of the country, the workers have also started providing opportunities to work in this sector in order to promote social activities.
Their dedication and valour will glorify every Indian.
I am not- We have changed from individuals to individuals and create a new environment for social work among the IT sectors.
Some people sing songs to older people
Some have dedicated themselves to cleanliness and some have helped the farmers.
But behind their actions, they have no perspective, they have been driven by their determination.
But a man who can sit in the chair and pack up and sports, can help the handicapped and the handicapped sportsperson.
This feeling and dedication is an activity.
This will make every Indian proud.
"No, we" will definitely attract us all.
My dear brothers and sisters, when you saw your suggestions on today's voice programme, the idea of Mr. Manish Mahbudra from Puducherry was very exciting.
My Government has said that the tribal people and their traditions and rituals have become an ideal example of the nature.
He said how to follow the traditions of the tribals in our lives, to achieve sustainable growth and to know from such traditions.
My best wishes to you for bringing this issue to the leaders of Mann Ki Baat programme.
This will inspire us to know our glorious past and ancient heritage, especially when the entire world is discussing environmental protection and exploring new ways to follow the balanced lifestyle.
Our country is facing the same problem.
But if we want to solve it, it is necessary to recall our past time and understand our traditional wealth, especially the lifestyle of the tribal people.
Music with nature is an integral part of the lives of our tribal people.
Our tribal brothers and sisters bow down to God, trees, plants and flowers.
The Bil tribes in Central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the trees of Peepal and Arjun.
The Bishnoi classes living in the desert of Rajasthan are guiding us to protect the environment.
In particular, they are ready to give their lives, rather than hurt a tree.
The mishmi tribal people of Arunachal Pradesh are in touch with the LTTE.
They consider the LTTE as their brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland, the LTTE is becoming forest guards.
The people of Maharashtra consider the LTTE as their guests and the LTTE is with them and reflect their prosperity.
The Christians of Central India consider the LTTE to be directly associated with their lives and feel that if the LTTE does not get food, the entire village will have to govern it.
During the reproduction of fish, the Gondu tribes of central India stop fishing on the river Kaithan.
They consider this area to be a fish sanctuary, and consider that nutritious fish will be found in large numbers due to this belief amongst them.
Besides, tribals are also building their homes with strong and environment friendly natural products.
The people living in some areas of the blue-giri mountain range of southern southern India only build their own settlements with the materials that are available in the region.
My brothers and sisters, this is the testimony that the tribal people are confident of living with great peace and harmony, and it also reflects that if anybody attempts to harm or harm their natural resources, they will not be ready to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that many of our freedom fighters were leading fighters, belonging to tribal society.
No one can forget Lord Birsa Munda, who fought hard against British imperialism to defend their jungle.
Apart from I still mentioned, we can list a lot of tribal communities that taught us how to collaborate with nature, and we have been very gratifying our tribal people to continue to be forest areas in the country.
Everyone should come forward to express our gratitude to them.
My countrymen, we have mentioned about the individuals and organisations that played an innumerable role in the society in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
But these things are not enough, but they have inspired deep feelings in our thoughts to show new ways to save society.
Just a few days back, I had read about the farmer brothers of Kurshan Singh from Panchayat.
Kurbachan Singh's son is scheduled to be married.
Kurbachan Singh has specifically told her parents that this marriage should be done very easily.
He added that there is no need to spend a large amount of money for wedding reception or any other thing.
He said it should be considered as a very simple diversity, and suddenly imposed a condition.
It is his commitment to ensure that women households, their fruits are not burnt in the fields and the wastes are not burnt.
You should think of the social strength of this idea.
But how high is his quality and how many families in our society solve their personal problems in the entire society.
The family members of Thiruvananthapuram Kurbachan Singh have depicted such an example.
I also read about the village called Kalarmajra near Naba in Punjab.
Instead of burning the potholes, the village of Kalarmajra has come to light by the farmers following the new technology that swallows them with soil.
My best wishes to Kurbachan Singh
My best wishes to all the people of Kalarmazra village and those who do not have any destruction in their surroundings.
You all are the real way to pursue the Indian heritage with a healthy lifestyle.
Just as a small drop of water accumulates, it is necessary for every constructive activity to create a better environment.
My countrymen, our myths also describe this: Our legends, the entire creations of water, air, land, neighbourhood, breath, medicine, plantations, gardens and deepening have to be surrounding us.
Every soul, every heart, every heart within me and you, should be peaceful anywhere.
Om Shanti: Shanti: Shanti:
Wherever there is talk of world peace, India's name and contribution will be recorded in golden writings.
For India, it is important on November 11 this year, because 100 years ago, the First World War was concluded on November 11.
We feel that the war is about a hundred years after the end of the war, catastrophe and human deaths take a hundred years.
For India, the First World War is very important.
In fact, we have no direct connection with that war.
However, our soldiers fought courageously in the war and sacrificed the highest sacrifices.
Indian soldiers have also warned that if it comes to war, Indians are not buried for anyone.
Our soldiers have expressed their courage and bravery in complicated areas and in bad weather.
The only purpose was to make peace.
This world knows that a large number of deaths and objects have occurred during the First World War.
According to reports, about one crore soldiers and other innocent people were killed.
This is the reason that the whole world realized the importance of peace.
In the last hundred years, the meaning of peace has changed.
Today, peace is not just war but global cooperation and integration are needed to address terrorism, climate change, social change and economic development.
The development of the poor will be a real example of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-Eastern states are of great importance.
There is no link between the natural beauty of the North-Eastern states- the people of this region are also very talented.
Now the North-Eastern states have been well-known with their specific activities.
The North-Eastern region has grown significantly in Natural Agriculture.
In order to promote sustainable food habits, the Golden Jubilee Award for the prestigious future policy of 2018 has been received a few days ago in Sikkim.
Not only this, Chikkim has won the award by pushing the recommendations received from 25 countries.
I heartily congratulate the people of Sikkim for this.
I believe that such festivals will be an opportunity to accept new guarantees.
Your progress is very important for the progress of the country.
If you develop, this country will also grow.
Best wishes to all of you.
