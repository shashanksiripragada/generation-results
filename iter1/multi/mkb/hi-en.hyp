Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world
The special thing is that it includes just the Indian community, it is not so, but now the governments of many countries, the citizens there, the social organizations there celebrate Diwali with full joy.

Friends, Festival Tourism has its own attraction in the world.
Our country, which is the Country of festivals, has immense potential for festival tourism.
Our efforts should be to promote festivals like Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and to include people from other states and other countries in the happiness of festivals.
There are so many festivals in every state and every region of our country that the people of other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in increasing festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last moment we had decided that we will do something different on this Deepawali.
I had said that we all celebrate the women's strength and achievements of India on this Deepawali, that is, India's Lakshmi is respected.
And immediately after seeing, there was a lot of inspiring stories on social media.

You must read, inspire and share something similar with yourself and I am proud of all these lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, Sanchi Honamma, the well-known poet of the 17th century, had written a poem in Kannada, in the 17th century, the words, the words, the words of every Lakshmi of India, which we are talking about.
It seems as if its Foundation was created in the 17th century.

Our daughters are our pride and since the glory of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, this is the day that the 550th Prakash Festival of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
Guru Nanak Dev ji ' s influence is not only in India but in the whole world .
Our Sikh brothers and sisters are settled in many countries of the world who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I can never forget my visits to gurudwaras in Venkover and Tehran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji that I can share with you, but many episodes of my heart will take place for this.
He always kept service paramount
Guru Nanak Dev ji believed that the service work done in a selfless manner cannot be afforded .
They stood firmly against social evil like untouchables
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji delivered his message in the world, far and wide
They were one of the most travellers in their time .
He went to many places and wherever he went, he won his heart, his simplicity, humility, simplicity.
Guru Nanak Dev ji visited several important religious visits, which are called sadness
With the message of goodwill and equality, they met people, saints and sages everywhere, north or south, east or west - everywhere.
It is believed that the well - known saint of Assam Shankar Dev was also inspired by him .

There he visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and all this was done for the 550th Prakash Parva of Guru Nanak Dev ji .
All these ambassadors have visited the Golden Temple, and they also got the opportunity to know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
After this many ambassadors shared pictures on social media with great glorious experiences
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that you all will remember the date of October 31.
Sardar Patel used to look at things closer and closer.
In fact, they were man of detail
At the same time he was also skilled in the organization skills .
He was glorious in formulating plans and formulating strategy
When they read about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, they know how tremendous his planning was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from across the country were going to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in the Newteen Twenty One.
Sardar Patel was responsible for all the arrangements of the session
He also used this opportunity to improve the network of water supply in the city.
He contacted the farmers and urged them to make Khadi bags
Farmers made bags and sold to representatives
Putting shoes in these bags, keeping yourself, the tension of shoes being stolen from the heart of the delegates ended.
On the other hand , Khadi sales also increased considerably .
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
He worked importantly to ensure fundamental rights, so that there is no scope for any discrimination on the basis of caste and sect.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel worked a very big bhagirath and historical work to unite the states.
Actually, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role is discussed in some special provinces in the integration of the country.
He played an important role in a small place like Lakshadweep .
Immediately after partition of India in 1947 , our neighbour ' s eyes were on Lakshadweep and he sent a ship with his flag .
As soon as Sardar Patel got information about this, he lost time without delay, immediately started harsh action.
Soon after their command , the Tricolor was hoisted therein , and they destroyed every neighbour ' s neighbourhood .
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the Mudaliar Brothers to ensure that Lakshadweep gets every necessary help for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly to Indias progress.
This is also an attractive tourist destination
I hope you'll all travel to its beautiful islands and beaches
My dear countrymen, the day of 31st October, 2018 was dedicated to the nation and the world that was built in memory of Sardar Saheb.
This is the world ' s highest statue .
The Statue of Liberty located in the United States is also higher than doubled
The world ' s highest statue fills every Indian with pride .
Every Indian ' s head rises above the glory .
You will be happy to see more than 26 lakh tourists, Statue of NITy in a year.
This means that an average of eight and a half thousand people visited the grandeur of the Statue of NITI every day.
He expressed his faith in Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and now there are new opportunities for employment to the local economy and people are also getting new opportunities for employment.
And keeping in mind the convenience of the tourists coming, many villagers are providing the facility of home-stay in their homes.
Professional training is also being given to those who provide home-stay facilities.
The people there have started farming and I am sure it will soon become the main source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, tourism industry, it can be a matter of a study.
We all are witnesses to how a space within a year develops as a world famous tourism destination.
There are people from abroad
Transport, construction, guidance, eco-friendly arrangements, one after another, a lot of arrangements are going on developing automatically.
There is a huge economy developing and people are creating facilities as per the requirements of the passengers.
The government is also playing its role
Friends, As you know, National Integration Day is celebrated every year on 31st October 2014.
This day, the message of protecting us, at every cost of unity, integrity and security of our country.
On October 31, every time Run for NITy is being organized.
It will include every section of the society, every section of the people.
Run for friendship is a symbol of this, this country is going on in one direction and wants to achieve a goal.
One goal - One India, Best India I
The last five years have been observed - not only in Delhi but in hundreds of cities of India, in the Union Territories, in the states, in the district centres, in small tier-to-tier-three cities, there is a large number of men, women, women, the people of the city, the people of the village, the children, the youth, the elderly, the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the people of the country, the people of the people of the country, the people of the people of the country, the people of the people of the country, the people of the people of the country, the people of the people of the country, the people of the
Anyway, nowadays, people are getting a hobby and junction about marathon.
Run for friendship is also such a unique provision.
Running is beneficial for all the mind and mind and body .
There is also a race here.
We also realize the feelings of India, as well as the best of India, we are associated with this purpose.
And therefore, not just the body, the mind and the rituals to bring India to new heights for the unity of India.
And therefore, you can know about the city you live in, around yourself.
In this portal, information has been given about the places across the country where Run for NITI is to be organized.
I hope you all will run on 31st October for the unity of India, for yourself.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel built the country in the form of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a ritual in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every stage, at every stage, at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious to empower the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look around us, we will find many examples that have been working continuously to increase mutual harmony, but many times it happens that the efforts of the society, their contributions, their contributions are very soon overwhelmed by the memory panel.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when Allahabad High Court pronounced its decision on Ram Janmabhoomi
The international groups were playing games to take advantage of the situation in their own way.
To create warmth in the atmosphere, what kind of language was spoken
But all this, five days, seven days, ten days, continued, but as soon as the decision came, the country felt a pleasant and surprising change.
On the one hand, everything was done for warmth for two weeks, but when the decision was taken on Ram Janmabhoomi, the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all communities, saints and saints gave a very balanced and regulatory statement.
Whenever I remember that day , the heart is happy .
The dignity of the judiciary was honored very gloriously and there was no warmth, no atmosphere of tension
These things should always be remembered that it gives us a lot of strength .
That day, that moment is a duties for all of us.
This is an example of the sound of unity, the great strength that gives to the country.
I would like to thank them today
My dear countrymen, today, if a story of every village is heard away from every corner of the country, from the north to the south, from the east to the west, from every corner of India, it is the story of cleanliness.
But there is also a pleasant experience and interesting experience .
I hear, I think I'll hear you too.
You imagine, the world's tallest batlefield, where the temperature goes to minus 50-60 degrees minus
Woygen is also the only name in the air
In such a opposite situation, living among such challenges is not less than any synergy.
In such a deteriorating situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country, but also running a clean Siachen campaign.
I appreciate the people of the country for this amazing commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my thanks
There ' s so cold that it ' s hard to develop anything
In such a situation, separating waste and managing it is a very important task in itself.
In such a situation, removing 130 tons of waste from the glacier and its surrounding areas and how much service is there between the raging ecosystems.
We all know that this Siachen is a glacier that is a source of rivers and clean water, therefore, running a cleanliness campaign here means to ensure clean water for those who live in lower areas.
as well as use river water like Nubra and Shyok
My dear countrymen, Festival is a festival that awakens a new consciousness in our lives.
And in Diwali, buying something or the other, bringing something from the market is done in small quantities in every family.
I once said we ' d try - buy local things
We don ' t need to go to tehsil if we get something we need from our village
If found in tehsil, then there is no need to go to the district
As much as we will try to buy our local things, Gandhi will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I urge you to buy something or the other from the hand of our weavers.
Even in this Diwali, you must have purchased a lot before Diwali but many people are also like this that if you go after Diwali then you might get a little cheaper.
So there will be a lot of people who have yet to buy .
So, along with the best wishes of Deepawali, I would like to urge you to come and buy local things.
See, how important can we play in fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi
Once again, I extend my best wishes to you on the holy festival of Deepawali.
In Diwali, we use various firecrackers.
But, sometimes there is a fire in carelessness
Somewhere gets injury
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm
My best wishes
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Would he then control anything over his own life and fortune
Devotees can remember that Jantar of Bapu
Can we think while buying that what I am buying will benefit my citizens
Today the whole country is celebrating the festival of Raksha Bandhan
My best wishes to all the countrymen for this holy festival.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is considered to be a symbol of mutual love and belief of sister and brother .
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries .
There are many stories in the history of the country, in which a defense source had linked people associated with two different states or religions with the door of trust.
Just a few days later , the festival of Janmashtami will also come .
The entire atmosphere is elephant, horse, palanquin Jai Kanhaiyalal's, the voice of Govinda-Govinda
The enjoyment of bowing in the color of Lord Krishna is different .
Apart from Raksha Bandhan Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on the day of Shravan Purnima .
I congratulate all those who are engaged in saving, riding and reaching the masses of this great heritage.
India is proud of the fact that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world and we all Indians are proud of the fact that since Vedic times, Sanskrit language has played a very big role in spreading knowledge.
Knowledge related to every field of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature .
Whether it is science or technology, agriculture or health, economy or architecture, mathematics or management, economists or environment, say that the mantra to deal with global warming challenges is mentioned in detail in our Vedas.
You all will be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka are still using Sanskrit language for talks.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which the creation of infinite words is possible.
Sometimes lions and poets are used but those who are familiar with Sanskrit laudables know that such accurate statement is made in very few words from Sanskrit laudables and secondly it is very easier to understand because of being connected to our tradition.
As it has been asked to explain the importance of the Guru in life - Akshakramastu, Guru : Prince Prabodhayat
We all celebrate the coming Teacher's Day with this feeling
The whole country celebrates Jayanti as Teacher ' s Day .
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the coming Teachers Day and congratulate you for your dedication to science, education and students.
Vegetation scorching with severe heat provides relief to dry reservoirs but sometimes it brings very humidity and destructive floods.
There is a situation of nature that in some places there is more rain than other places
Flood in Kerala has badly affected life and life
Today, in these difficult circumstances, the whole country stands with Kerala.
Our condolences are with those families who have lost their lives, cannot be compensated for the loss of life, but I want to assure the sad families that in this hour of sorrow, 1. 25 billion Indians are standing with you.
My prayer is that those who are injured in this natural calamity, who go healthy as soon as possible
I am sure that Kerala will be resurrected soon on the strength of the people of the state and on the strength of indomitable courage .
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and Kanyakumari is doing something at their own level so that wherever there is objection, whether it is Kerala or Hindustan or districts and areas, people's life can be normal again.
All age groups and people associated with every work area are contributing to their contribution
Everyone has been trying to ensure that the problems of the people of Kerala can be done at least, we share their sufferings.
We all know that the armed forces are the heroes of the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala.
They did not leave any stone unturned to save people trapped in the flood
I also want to specifically mention the hard work of NHR
In this moment of crisis he has done a very good job
Efforts to adjust the situation by making their community and quick decisions have become a new devotion centre for every Indian .
Tomorrow was the festival of Onam, we will pray that the festival of Onam will give strength to the country and especially Kerala so that it can recover from the disaster as soon as possible and the development journey of Kerala will be faster.
Once again, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and all other parts of the country where disaster has emerged, that the whole country is with them in this hour of crisis.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at the suggestions that came to talk about the mind
Then the topic written by the people across the country is the topic of all of us, Shriman Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapn Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, many people have asked me to talk about various aspects of Atal ji's life by writing on Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov.
As soon as the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's demise on August 16, everyone was drowned in mourning
A nation leader who had left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago
In a way he had gone far away from active politics for the last 10 years .
The news was not seen anywhere, it was not seen publicly.
For the past several days, the best aspects of Atal ji have come in front of the country.
People have remembered him as the best MP, sensitive writer, best speaker, popular Prime Minister.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act two young and three.
This change made two important changes in India ' s politics
First , the size of the Cabinet in the States was limited to 15 assembly seats
Secondly, the limit fixed under anti-party law was increased from one-third to two-thirds
At the same time, clear guidelines were also set to disqualify the party-changing people.
For many years, the political culture of setting up a huge cabinet in India was created not only for the partition of big junk cabinet work but also for cheering politicians.
Atal ji changed it
Their move saved money and resources
At the same time the efficiency also increased
It was a long vision like Atal ji who changed the situation and developed healthy traditions in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot
During his tenure there was a change in time of presenting the budget .
Earlier , according to the tradition of the British , the budget was presented at 5 o'clock in the evening , because at that time it was time for Parliament to start in London .
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 am to 11 am
Several such rules have been made in this code, which made it possible to hoist the tricolor at public places
Because of this , more and more Indians got the opportunity to hoist their national flag .
Thus they brought near to the people our supreme tricolor .
Similarly, nowadays you are seeing that discussions are going on in the country about the elections of the Center and the States simultaneously.
People are keeping their points in both sides of this subject and opposition.
This is a good thing and a good sign for democracy
I would definitely say that for healthy democracy, developing good traditions for better democracy, steadily striving to strengthen democracy, extend discussions to the open mind, it will also be a great tribute to Atal ji.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfill the dream of his rich and developed India, I pay tribute to Atal ji on behalf of all of us.
Just a few days back the monsoon session of Parliament is over
You will be happy to know that the Productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and 74 of Rajya Sabha.
After rising above the party, all MPs tried to make the monsoon session more useful and the result was that the Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and 14 bills
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and youth welfare
Several important bills that benefit young and backward communities were passed in this session
You all know that for decades, the demand for creation of BSF commission was going on like the SST Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has fulfilled the resolution to form the BCC this time and gave it a constitutional right
This step will prove to be a step ahead of the purpose of social justice .
The session also took place to pass the Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
This law will further safeguard the interests of the S  ST community .
At the same time , it will prevent the criminals from oppressing and trust in the dalit communities .
No civilized society can tolerate any injustice against the women ' s power of the country .
The country is not ready to bear the culprits of rape, so Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and made provision for severe punishment
The culprits of misbehavior will be punished for at least 10 years, they will be punished for raping girls under 12 years of age
A few days ago , you must have read in the news , a court in Mandsaur , Madhya Pradesh has sentenced two accused of raping a minor after just two months of hearing .
Earlier , a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh punished the culprits after just five days of hearing .
Rajasthan has also made similar quick decisions .
This law will play an effective role in preventing cases of crime against women and girls
Economic progress is incomplete without social change
However , this session of Rajya Sabha has not been possible . I assure Muslim women that the whole country stands firmly to bring justice to them .
When we move ahead in the country, changes can be brought about in the lives of poor, backward, exploited and deprived.
This time in the monsoon session everyone has presented an ideal .
These days millions of countrymen are focused on Asian Games in Jakarta
Every day in the morning, people first look at news, news and social media and see which Indian player has won the medal.
Asian Games are still running
I would like to congratulate all the players who won the medal for the country
My best wishes to those sportspersons whose competitions are still left.
Sportspersons of India, especially in shooting and resting, are performing excellently but our players are also bringing medals in those sports in which our performance has not been so good earlier, such as sports like ushu and rowing - these are not mere medals - proofs - Indian sportspersons and sportspersons touch the sky and dreams.
Our daughters are included in the increased number of medal winners for the country and this is a positive sign - even in the young players who win the medal, we are also 15-16 years old.
It is also a very good sign that most of the players who have won medals are from small towns and villages and they have achieved this success with hard work.
On 29th August, we will celebrate National Sports Day, I extend my best wishes to all sportspersons, as well as pay tribute to Hockey's magician great player, Shri Dhyanchand Ji.
I urge all citizens of the country to play and take care of their fitness because healthy India will create a rich and rich India.
Once again I congratulate medal winners at the Asian Games and wish the other players a good performance .
Best wishes to all on National Sports Day
Namaste spirit, I respect your feelings
We all have seen building houses and buildings with brick stones, but can you imagine that about twelve-twelve hundred years ago, a large mountain that was just a single stone hill was given the form of an excellent, large and wonderful temple - perhaps it was difficult to imagine but that was the temple - Kailashnath Temple located in Ellora, Maharashtra.
If someone tells you that a 60 meter long pillar of Granite was built around a thousand years ago and a 80 tons of forest rock was placed on its summit - would you believe
But, the Brihadeshwar Temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this incredible mixture of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patan in Gujarat .
India's Land Engineering Laboratory
There were many engineers in India who made imaginable and presented miracles in the world of engineering.
We also got a gem in our heritage of great engineers whose work is still being wondered by the people and it was Bharat Ratna Dr. M.
He is a god in that part of the country, and the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and selfishness.
In their memory 15th September is made as an engineers day .
Following their footprints , engineers of our country have made their own identity worldwide .
When I talk about the miracles of the engineering world, I remember a terrible earthquake that emerged in Kutch today in 2001.
At that time when I used to work as a volunteer, I got an opportunity to go to a village and I got an opportunity to meet a mother of more than 100 years of age and she was laughing at me and she was laughing at me.
But you didn ' t see any damage anywhere
This house was built by our ancestors in accordance with the nature here and it was saying so proudly that I thought that even centuries ago, engineers of that period had composed according to the local circumstances because of which the people were safe.
Now when we celebrate the engineers Day, we should also think about the future.
Workshops should be at places
In the changed era we have to learn new things .
World is battling natural calamities
What is the new form of sculptural engineering
What are his courses
What should be taught to students
How to make it our priority
We must think of many such things when the engineers celebrate the day.
There is an atmosphere of festivals and the preparation of Diwali starts .
We will continue to talk about the mind and we will continue to move ahead with our minds.
With this spirit, my best wishes to all of you.
Thank you
Will meet again
These days there are good news of the rain .
Sometimes news of anxiety is also coming and somewhere people are still waiting for rain.
India's vastness, diversity, sometimes shows the form of rains, but what do we blame the rain is the man who has chosen the path of struggle with nature and the result is that nature sometimes ruins us.
And that is why we all become the obligation of nature lover, we become the protector of nature, we become the promoter of nature, and the balance of the things that are present in nature remains on our own.
In the past, the incident of a natural calamity attracted the attention of the whole world, shocked the human mind
You all must have seen on TV, the team of 12 teens football players in Thailand went to the cave to roam their coach
It usually takes a few hours to go and get out of the cave.
But on that Day , the fate was yet another .
When they entered into the cave , there was a heavy rain , a lot of water accumulated near the gate of the cave .
You can imagine when death is seen in the teenage stage and if you have to spend moments then how will it be
On the one hand, he was battling the crisis, on the other hand, humanity was united all over the world and the divine human qualities were expressing it.
People around the world were praying to get these children out safely
Everyone, whether it is the government or the parents of these children, their family members, media or citizens of the country - everybody showed a wonderful conduct of peace and patience.
Everyone was engaged in their mission as a team.
In this entire operation, a young man from the Navy of Thailand lost his life.
The whole world is surprising that he did not leave his hope with so bravery and patience in a dark cave full of water despite such difficult circumstances .
It shows that when humanity comes together, there are amazing things
Just need to take care of our goals with a calm and stable mind and work for it.
In the past , our country ' s beloved poet Neeraj ji left us .
Neeraj ji had a characteristic - hope, trust, determination, confidence in himself
By the way , the month of July and August is very important for the farmers and all the youngsters .
Because this is the time when colleges have a peace session
Millions of young people like Satyam get out of school and go to colleges
If we go to Feams, Papers, Answers in February and March, then along with enjoying holidays in April and May, results, setting forward directions in life, career Choice is consumption.
July is the month when youngsters stand in that new phase of their lives when they go away from the occupations and go to the cut-o.
Students ' attention goes from home to hostel
Students come in the shadow of professionals from the shadow of Parents
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of life.
For the first time going out of the house, going out of the village, getting out of a protective environment, you have to make yourself a partner.
For the first time all these youngsters come out to give a new direction to their lives except for their homes.
Many students have so far joined their colleges, some will be connected.
I would like to tell you that Be Calm, Enjoy life, enjoy a lot of interference in life.
There is no choice without books, study has to be done but the trend of finding new things should be maintained.
Old friends have their own value .
Childhood friends are valuable, but to choose, build and maintain new friends, it is a very big understanding work in itself.
Learn something new, such as new skills, new languages.
Those youngsters who have left their homes and have gone to study in some other place, know about those places, know about the people there, the language, culture, the tourist destinations there.
My best wishes to all young people who are launching new innings
Her father nurtures her family by spoiling the waste
I congratulate them for their success .
There are many students who are from the poor family and have done something that inspires us all with their hard work and passion despite the opposite situations.
Betia Afreen Sheikh of Ahmedabad, whose father runs auto rickshaws, Nagpur's daughter is happy, whose father is also a driver in the school bus or Kartik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand whose father wages in brick kiln.
Ramesh used to sell toys in the fair or Gudgaon's divine daughter Anushka Panda, who is suffering from a hereditary disease called spinal muscular atrophy from birth, all of them crossed every obstacle with their determination and courage.
If we look around us, we will find many such examples.
Neeraj ji has said that the song is to tell the sky of the Earth, I have to call every darkness in the light, I have to sword with the fragrance of flowers, and to woke up the mountains of Gha-ga, my dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes went to a news, wrote - Two youths did the dream of Modi.
The incident was that once San Jose City of America, known as Technology Cub, I was discussing with Indian youth there.
I had appealed to them how they can use their talent for India, think and take time and do something.
I appealed to change brain-rain into brain-gain
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have jointly created a SmartGaun App using their professional skills.
These apps are not only connecting the people of the village to the whole world but they can now get any information and information on their own mobile phones .
This village of Rae Bareli, residents of Teudhpur, village-princes, district magistrates, all people made people aware of the use of this app.
If you look at this incident closely then one thing will come into mind that the youngster is living in the United States, his lifestyle and thoughts are living between him many years ago, but still he knows the nuances of his village, understands the challenges and the emotionality is connected to the village.
For this reason, he could probably make something according to what the village wants.
Every Indian has a natural feeling of doing something for this connectivity with his village, his roots and commitment.
But sometimes because of the time, sometimes because of the distances, sometimes because of the ecosystems, a slight ash gets accumulated on it, but if a small spark is touched then all things emerge again and they draw towards their past days.
We can also check if it has not happened in our case, the situation, the situation, the distances have not separated us, the ashes have not been stored.
Santosh Ji thank you very much for your phone call.
In reality Pandarpur Wari is a wonderful journey in itself .
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, who was on July 23 this year, is also celebrated as a magnificent culmination of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandarpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15-20 days before Ashadi Ekadashi, the pilgrims leave for a walk with the pilgrimage to Pandharpur.
This journey, which is called Wari, includes millions of varkari
Sant Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram, keeping the padduka of great saints in the palanquin, singing, dance, playing on foot towards Pandharpur.
Pilgrims reach there to visit Lord Vitthal, who is also called Vithova or Pandurang
Lord Vitthal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived, the victims
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense reverence, devotion.
Going to Vithova Temple in Pandharpur and its glory, beauty and spiritual joy have a different experience.
I urge the audience to take the experience of Pandharpur Wari once you get the opportunity.
Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram - Innumerable saints are still educating the people in Maharashtra.
They are giving strength to fight against superstition and this saint tradition has been inspiring every corner of India .
Whether it is their brotherhood or disillusioned, we get an important message of goodwill, love and brotherhood.
It gets a mantra to fight society with faith against superstition
These were those who prevented the society from time to time, showed hats and mirrors and ensured that the old evil practices are eliminated from our society and the rites of compassion, equality and purity come in the people.
Our Indo-Bhoomi is Bahuratna Vasundhara as a great tradition of saints in our country, in the same way, the great men dedicated to the powerful mother-Bharati, dedicated this land to their lives.
One such great man is Lokmanya Tilak who has left his deep impression in the minds of many Indians .
We remember Tilak ji's birth anniversary on July 23 and his death anniversary on August 01.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and self - confidence .
They had the power and wisdom of showing British rulers the mirror of their mistakes .
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he tried to sedition him three times in 20 years, and this is not a small thing.
I want to place an interesting event related to one of his statues in Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad today.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40,000 people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad, and during his journey Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had got an opportunity to interact with him and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Lokmanya Tilak ji was extremely impressed and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 1, 1920, he decided that he would make his memorial in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected the Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and immediately he chose the Ectoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak and this Ectoria Garden which was known as the ueen of Britain .
Finally, Sardar Saheb became a statue and inaugurated it on 28th February, 1929 - Mahatma Gandhi and it is a matter of great joy that in the inaugural function, in that speech, Lord Bapu said that after the arrival of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got one person but also got the courage, due to which the statue of Tilak ji has been constructed.
And my dear countrymen, the characteristic of this statue is that it is a rare statue of Tilak in which he is sitting on a chair, and it is written right below Tilak that Swaraj is our birth right and I am listening to this period of the British.
With the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji the tradition of public Ganesh Festival started
Public Ganesh Festival, along with traditional reverence and festival, became an effective medium to pursue the spirit of social-Jagaran, collectiveness, harmony and equality among the people.
At a time when it was necessary that the country should be united to fight against the British, these festivals worked to unite all by breaking the obstacles of caste and community.
The popularity of these events increased over time
This shows that our old legacy and history is still crawling towards our heroes.
Today in many cities it happens that you get to see Ganesh-Pandal in almost every street .
This is also an excellent opportunity for our youth, where they can learn qualities such as leadership and organization, they can develop themselves.
I had requested for the last time too and when I remember Lokmanya Tilak Ji, I would once again urge you that this time too we celebrate Ganesh Festival, celebrate Ganesh with pomp and fervour but urge to celebrate Eco-friendly Ganesh Festival.
From Ganesh ji's statue to decorative commodities, everything is eco-friendly and I would like to have different competitions for the Eco-friendly Ganesh Festival in every city, they will be rewarded and I would like to put things of eco-friendly Ganesh Festival on MyGov and Narendra Modi App for wider publicity.
I shall surely bring you to the people .
Lokmanya Tilak raised self-confidence among the people of the country, he gave the slogan Swaraj is our birthright and we will be with him
Today it is time to say Swaraj is our birthright and we will take her
Every Indian should have good results of good governance and development
I am talking about Chandrasekhar Azad
What will be a young man in India who will not be motivated to listen to these lines, Sarfroshi's desire is now in our hearts, see how strong is in Bahu-e-Katil These lines have motivated many young people like Ashfaq Allah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad.
Chandrasekhar Azad's bravery and his passion for freedom, inspired many youths
Azad put his life at stake, but he never bowed before foreign rule
I am fortunate to visit Chandrasekhar Azad village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
Chandrasekhar Azad Park in Allahabad also got the opportunity to pay tributes and Chandrasekhar Azad ji was a brave man who did not even want to die with the bullets of foreigners - if he would fight for freedom and die, he would still die in freedom. This was his characteristic.
Once again I salute the two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrasekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days back, the 400-meter race in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Island, India's brave daughter and farmer daughter Hima Das has created history by winning the gold medal.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhairan, emailed me from Indonesia in response to my letter. He is currently preparing for Asian Games.
-The most important moment in any athlete's life is that when he catches the tricolor and I am proud that I have done it.
Unity is also proud of you
You have illuminated the name of the country
Unity won the World Para Athletics Grand Primary 2018 in Tunisia
This is a special achievement because he made his challenge the medium of his success .
In 2003, due to the fear of daughter unity, half of her body's part failed, but this daughter did not lose courage and strengthened herself.
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathunia ji, who has won the gold medal in Para Athletics Grand Private in Berlin and has won the gold medal in the world record with him, Sunder Singh Gurjar has also won the gold medal in Javelin.
My dear countrymen, many events in the history of the month of August are full of festivals, but sometimes the disease also enters the house due to the weather.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for the best health, for the inspiration of patriotism, for this month of August and for many festivals that have been going on for centuries.
And surely , once , you will surely meet .
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, this programme has once again got the opportunity to be associated with you all.
Just a few days ago, there was a historic cricket match in Bengaluru
You must have understood well that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
This was Afghanistan ' s first international match and it is proud for every Indian that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India .
Both teams performed the best in this match and Rashid Khan, a ballar from Afghanistan, had done the best this year.
I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Shriman Ashraf Ghani had written me on his twitter and the people of Afghanistan were very proud of his hero Rashid Khan .
I am also grateful to our Indian friends who have given a platform to our players to show their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan .
He is the world's essay of cricket and at the same time he has written it in a little joke and we are not going to give it to anyone
This match will be a memorable for all of us
Well this was the first match so it is natural to remember but I will remember this match for some particular reason .
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world.
What can a winner team do while taking a trophy
- While taking the trophy, the team of Afghanistan, which was playing the first international match, invited the team of Afghanistan and both teams took photos together.
What happens is sportsman spirit, what happens is sportsmanship - we can experience this incident.
The skills of our youth are to unite the sports community and find out the talent they have.
My dear countrymen, on June 21, there was a different view on the fourth Yoga Day.
The whole world was united
Be it the European Parliament in Brussels, be it the headquarters of the United Nations in New York, be it the fighter ships of Japanese Navy, people are seen doing yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, Yoga was a historic event and I am told that women have done demonstration of many seats.
On the high snow peaks of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China simultaneously performed Yoga
Yoga works to break and connect all the boundaries.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have made this opportunity a big festival by going beyond all kinds of discrimination, caste, religion, region, color or gender.
If people from all over the world were so excited to participate in the Yoga Day programs then why would not it be encouraged in India
Our warriors of the IAF surprised everyone by doing yoga at a height of 15 thousand feet from the Earth in the midst of the sky.
The view was that they swimming in the air, not sitting in the plane
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or sports grounds, everywhere Yoga has been practiced.
Yoga has worked to unite the people around the world by going beyond caste, creed and geography, the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam which we have won for centuries.
Our Rishi, Muni, Saint, who always emphasizes, Yoga has proved it in the right sense.
more and more people will make it part of their lives .
Many people have written to me on MyGov and NarendraModiApp that I will talk about the Octors Day on 1st July this time - the right thing is
We are those people who naturally worship Mother as God, believe in equality to God because Mother gives us life, mother gives us birth, and many times the doctor gives us rebirth.
The role of the doctor is not limited to mere treatment of diseases .
Today, the doctor has medical expertise, and he has a deep experience about the general life style trends and what impact he has on our health.
Indian doctors have identified their capabilities and skills all over the world
Our doctors are known to serve complicated medical problems along with great, hardworking in medical profession.
We are fortunate people who are born in this land of India .
India has a rich history, when there is no such month, there is no such day in which there has been no historical incident.
See , everywhere in India has its own heritage .
There is a saint associated with it, there is a great man, there is a famous person, everyone has their own contribution, its own glory.
Very thankful for your phone call
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, Kabirwad of Gujarat, you know very well.
When I used to work there, I had also done a big national convention of a saint Kabir's tradition.
You know why Kabirdas ji went to Maghar
At that time there was a belief that those who die in Magahar do not go to heaven
On the contrary, the body that leaves in Kashi goes to heaven
Magahar was considered invisible but Saint Kabirdas did not believe in it .
And they broke the evil deeds and the superstitions of their time , and therefore they went forth , and they obeyed it .
Saint Kabir Das emphasized on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his credentials and brotherhood.
That was their ideal .
We see this ideal in his works and in today ' s era he is equally inspiring .
That is the true saint who knows and understands the sufferings of others who do not know the sufferings of others is desperate .
Kabirdas ji gave special emphasis on social harmony
They used to think longer than their time
Put it on you, please all the corner
Kabir writes in another double - where there is mercy and religion, where love is sin
He said: - Do not ask the caste, ask the sadhu, know
It happens that it is the greatness of the Guru and one such guru, Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev
Those who showed sensitivity to many people, keep inspiration for centuries
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God
Wherever he went , he took several initiatives for the betterment of society .
The system of free LPG from social discrimination, where every caste, creed, religion or sect could come and eat food, Guru Nanak Dev only started this anchor system.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji to be celebrated in 2019
I want all of us to join with zeal and zeal
I urge you people to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji in the entire society and around the world, what are new ideas, what are new ideas, what are new ideas, what are new imaginations, we should think about it, prepare it and with great pride make it a festival of inspiration.
My dear countrymen
The struggle for India's independence is very long, very widespread, very deep and is full of innumerable royalties.
There is another history associated with Punjab
100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh in 2019, which embarrassed the entire humanity.
We can imagine how 100 years of this incident are going to be completed, but we should always remember the immortal message that this incident has given us, this violence and cruelty can never solve any problem.
The victory is always peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice.
Shri Raman Kumar, Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that on July 6, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee is the birthday and he wants to talk to the countrymen about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
Raman ji first thank you very much
It was very good to see you interested in India ' s history
You know, yesterday was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on June 23
Very few people would know that Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convocation at Kolkata University in Bengali at the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in 1937.
This was the first time when the British ruler was and somebody addressed the Convocation in Bengali at Kolkata University.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first industry minister of India and in a sense, he had laid the foundation stone of Indias industrial development, had prepared a strong base, had prepared a strong platform.
Dr. Mukherjee dreamed that India should be industrially self-reliant, efficient and rich in every field.
He wanted India to develop big industries as well as focus on MSMEs, handlooms, textiles and cottage industries.
They were quite passionate about the development of West Bengal
The result of their understanding, discretion and activism is that a part of Bengal could be saved and it is still part of India.
The most important thing for Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the integrity and integrity of India - and for this, he lost his life at the young age of 52.
We should always remember the message of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's unity, with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood, continue to live in India's progress.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video call.
They got the opportunity to learn directly about the changes in the lives of the people going beyond the files.
People told about their determination, their happiness and sorrow, their achievements
I believe that this was not just a government programme for me but it was a different kind of learning experiment and during this time, the moment of great satisfaction that was seen on the faces of people can happen in anybody's life.
When an ordinary man listened to the stories, the words of his experience touched his heart.
In far-flung villages, daughters are providing services from the pension of the elderly to the construction of passports through Common Service Centre.
When a sister from Chhattisgarh collects Sitafal and does business by making her face-cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, millions of young people of the country are running medicine centres as well as providing cheap medicines in nearby villages.
At the same time, a young man from West Bengal is looking for a job two to three years ago and now he is only doing his successful business
Not only this, giving jobs to ten to fifteen people
Students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on an impartant topic like waste management at the school's training lab at their young age.
Do not know how many stories there was no corner of the country where people do not have to tell their success.
In such an environment, when the common man (human) comes with new hope, new enthusiasm and incidents in his life, he is not credited with the government.
Even the incident of a small girl from a remote village becomes inspiration for 1. 25 billion countrymen.
With the help of technology for me, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been very happy and very inspiring and it gives me satisfaction to work but is also encouraged to work more.
Another new joy of spending life for the poorest of the poor, another new enthusiasm, another new inspiration.
I am very grateful to the countrymen
40-40, 50-50 lakh people joined the programme of this video bridge and you have worked to give me new strength.
I once again wish to express my gratitude to you all
I always feel that if we look around us then something or the other is good.
And those who do good .
We can also experience the smell of goodness
In the past one thing came in my mind and it ' s a very strange combination
On the one hand, where there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand, our farmers are brothers and sisters associated with farming.
Together with the TE engineers, they have made a simple prosperity trust and they have doubled the income of the farmers, they have activated this trust.
Together with the farmers, planned and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Farmers producing grains are also associated with it .
On the one hand, farmers play a key role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing, while on the other hand, efforts are made to ensure the entitlement of farmers' participation in profits.
A separate sead-bank has been made for good breed seeds to be good for the crop.
Women see the functioning of this seed-bank, women have also been added
I congratulate these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these youngsters associated with the professionals, technology, engineering world have come out of their purview and have adopted the path of connecting with the farmers, connecting the village, connecting with the fields and the fields.
Once again, the young generation of my country will have some innovative experiments that I have to go, some people will not know anything, some people will not know anything but many people are doing something good, all of them are greetings from me.
GST is going to complete one year. One nation, one TA was the dream of the people of the country, it has turned into reality today.
If I have to give credit to anybody, then I give credit to the states.
GST is an excellent example ofoperative federalism, where all the states decided in the country and then such a big tax reform could be implemented in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can all proud that people of different political ideology sit there, people from different states sit there, have different priority states but despite all the decisions that have been taken so far in the GST Council, all of them have been disagreements.
Before GST, 17 different types of taxes used to be made in the country but now only one tax is applicable across the country.
GST is the victory of honesty and is also a festival of honesty .
In the first country, inspector Raja's complaints used to come in the case of Ta.
From returning to refund everything is done through online information technology
Due to the arrival of GST, check posts have ended and the movement of goods has accelerated, which is not only saving time but also benefiting in the logistics sector.
GST will probably be the world's largest tax reform
This huge tax reform was achieved in India because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST could be ensured only through public power.
It is usually believed that such a big reform, such a large country, such a large population takes 5 to 7 years to stabilize it completely, but the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the festival of honesty of the country, the result of the participation of the people-power, that within a year, this new tax system has made its place, stability and it also improves through its input system as per requirement.
Through the point of mind once again you ' ve got the chance to be the most responsive
You will be very well aware of the 6 women commanders of the Navy, this team was on a sea journey for the last several months.
Bovika Sagar Parikrama - i want to talk about them
These six daughters of India, their team has spent more than 250 days through the sea.
NS has returned to India on 21st May and the whole country welcomed him very warmly
He travelled in different oceans and many oceans and distanced about twenty thousand nautical miles
It was the first event in itself in the world
On Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters, listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate these daughters for enhancing their adventure, enhancing the pride of Navi, and especially the world that India's daughters are not less.
Who knows the sense of adventure
If we look at the development journey of mankind then progress has been made in the womb of some adventure.
Development only takes birth in the lap of adventure
The intention of doing some taxes, the intention of doing some leaks and doing some etra ordinary thing, I can do something - these feelings, those who do less, but for ages, some people get inspiration.
On 16th May, 5 tribal children from an ashram-school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Tribal Students Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam, a team of our tribal children climbed the highest peak in the world.
These students of Ashram-School had started training in August 2017, Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh, Ladakh - they were trained.
These youths were chosen under Mission Shaurya and they have honored the entire country by defeating their name.
I congratulate the people of Chandrapur school, my young friends and my heart.
Recently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to win Verest from Nepal
Best greetings to daughter Shivangi
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter became the pair of the first Indian father-son to climb Diya Verest
Not only that , only young people are climbing the verest
Sangeeta Bahal climbed Verest on 19th May and Sangeeta Bahal is more than 50 years old
This work is commendable, as well as reflects their commitment to cleanliness, environment.
For years people have been climbing Verest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I congratulate all these brave heroes, especially the daughters.
so large numbers of people from every region will come forward in its support
When I talk about India, I believe that as much as we play, the country will play.
On social media, people are sharing videos of the Finance Challenge, tagging each other in it and challenging them.
In the matter of mind, in respect of sportspersons, you have listened to me and for the last time, our heroes of the Commonwealth Games were telling us through this programme - Namaskar Sir.
Image Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that the games that used to be part of every child's life are becoming less today.
These games were particularly part of summer holidays .
Yes, it may be that at different places they were known by different names, like now Pitthu is known by many names.
No one knows how many names are Lagori, Satolia, seven stones, dikori, Satodiya
There are two types of games in traditional sports
There are also outdoor, indoor too.
The unity hidden behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games .
One game is known by different names at different places.
I am from Gujarat, I know that there is a game in Gujarat, which is called Chomal-Isto
These are played with codies or ginger seeds or dishes and with 88 square boards
This game was played in almost every state
We used to do this game .
Which of us will be, who has not played in childhood
Gillie-Danda is a game played from village to cities
It is known by different names in different parts of the country .
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla .
In Orissa it is called Gulibari and in Maharashtra it is called financing .
Some games have one of their own seasons
You must have seen many children, who are embarrassing, but are very scattered while playing
From children to grandparents, grandparents and grandparents, whenever they play everything then what they say or generation gap, they also get touched.
At the same time we also know our culture and traditions.
Many games make us aware about society, environment etc.
Through crude sourceing we can create a very large architecture of our traditional sports
Videos of these games can be made, which can be shown about the rules of sports, the way of playing.
On June 5, our country will officially host the World Environment Day.
This is a very important achievement for India and it is also indicative of Indias growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change .
This time theme is Beat Plastic Pollution
I appeal to all of you, understanding the feelings of this theme and its importance, let us all ensure that we do not use the pollution, low grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on life and on our health.
Go to the website of World Environment Day wed-India 2018 and many suggestions have been given in a very interesting manner - see, know and try to bring them to your daily life.
In the last few weeks, we all saw that dust and dust went halfway in different areas of the country, along with strong winds and heavy rains, which is unusual.
Deficit was also done, goods and losses were also done
We have to live in harmony with nature, to live with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated every step of life
When India played a key role in the Op21 and Paris Agreement, when we united the whole world through International Solar Alliance, Mahatma Gandhi had a sense of fulfilling that dream.
On this Environment Day, we all think about what can we do to make our Planet clean and green
How can you move forward in this direction
Can you innovate
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends.
You remember equally on June 21, not only you but the whole world remembers on June 21.
21 June is celebrated as International Yoga Day for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparations months ago.
These days news is being received, preparations are being made to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21 all over the world.
Centuries ago, it means that by doing regular yoga practices some good qualities become like relatives and friends.
Yoga creates courage which always protects us like a father .
The emotion of forgiveness arises as the mother is for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend .
Bharatrihari has said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our children, mercy, our sister, self-confidence, our brother, our bed and knowledge becomes our hunger eradicator.
When all these qualities become partners , the yogi triumphs over all kinds of fears .
Once again, I appeal to all the countrymen to extend their legacy of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is 27th May, the death anniversary of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji, the first Prime Minister of India
I salute Pandit ji
The memory of this month of May is also linked to another thing and it is Veer Savarkar
This was the month of May in 1857, when Indians showed their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our young and farmers stood up against injustice while showing their bravery.
It is sad that we had long been calling the events of 1857 only rebellion or soldiers rebellion .
In fact , it was an attempt not only to reduce the incident but also to hurt our self - respect .
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the same month in which the first freedom struggle began.
Savarkar ji ' s personality was full of characteristics
A wonderful description of Savarkar ji has been made by our dear Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji .
How precisely did Atal ji paint
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution together
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was also a bold revolutionary
I was watching a story on TV, of our poor daughters of the raw colonies of Sikar in Rajasthan
Our daughters, who were ever forced to ask for garbage from beef to home-to-house - are learning the work of sewing and sewing clothes to cover the poor.
Here's the daughters, apart from the clothes of yourself and your family, are shining from normal to good clothes.
They are also coursing skill development as well.
Our daughters are self-reliant today. They are living their lives with respect and have become a power for their families.
I extend my best wishes to these daughters, full of hope and trust.
They have shown that if you are determined to do something and you are contemplating it , success can be achieved among all the hardships , and it is not just a thing that you will be able to see all this in every corner of India .
If you look at the neighborhood, you will notice how people overcome the problems.
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, we also have discussions and discussions with some people.
These discussions are also political, social, films are also, sportspersons and sportspersons are also on the problems of the country - that is, it should be resolved - but often these things are limited to discussions but some people who move forward towards bringing about changes in their work, their hard work and passion.
D. Prakash Rao, who lives in the slums of Cuttack city of Orissa, some such story of spending himself to make dreams of others and fulfill them.
Tomorrow I got the opportunity to meet D. Prakash Rao
Shriman D Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades
They make full arrangements for education, health and food to all children coming to school
I congratulate D. Prakash Rao for his hard work, his passion and giving a new direction to the lives of those poor children.
They have finished the darkness of their life .
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and the whole country.
Let us proceed positively
In the month of June , it is so hot that people wait for rain and look at the sky with clouds .
They will wait for the moon a few days from now .
Showing the moon means that Eid can be celebrated .
After one month of fasting during Ramzan , the festival of Eid is a symbol of celebration .
I am confident that all people will celebrate Eid with full enthusiasm, especially children will get good Eid on this occasion.
I hope the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bondage of goodwill in our society .
Best wishes to all
My dear countrymen, thank you all.
Once again next month we ' re going to get in mind .
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
V.
Link it to India, I am happy that people are connected with it with a lot of enthusiasm and many people have written to me while showing their support for this, letters have been sent to the social media.
Ruma Devnath writes that by Morning walk, I feel satisfactory and healthy and she further says - for me itness comes with a small and we should smile, when we are happy.
Make these holidays an opportunity to learn for a new experience, my dear countrymen
When we hear that there is a war on water in the world in the future , everybody talks about it , but is there any responsibility for us
Do we not think water conservation should be this social responsibility
That is, it is the responsibility of those who have knowledge that I don't know the language of Bengali, but when I was young, I was a habit of getting up very quickly - from childhood and radio in eastern India starts late in West India, then in the morning I am guessing.
At 30 o'clock, Rabindra Music started, and I had a habit of it, I didn't know the language. I had a habit of listening to Rabindra Music on the radio early in the morning and when Anandloke and Agunar and Poreshmoni had the opportunity to listen to these poems, you also got a lot of consciousness.
The Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian, we should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who has guided millions of people across the globe, reminds us of the responsibility of striving and walking on their path, recalling Lord Buddha's equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Ambedkar insisted that he was inspiring Lord Buddha in his social violence, he had said that my social help may be safe to be inspired in three words.
Today is the sacred festival of Ramnavami .
My best wishes to the countrymen on this holy festival of Ramnavami.
We have seen the power of Ram in his life every moment.
On 26th January, when all the dignitaries of ASEAN countries were here, they had come with them with a ultra-troop and it is a matter of great pride that the most of them were presenting the Ramayana before us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are creating similar inspiration and influence not only in India but in the ASEAN countries in this territory of the world.
Once again I wish you all Ramnavami
My dear countrymen, like every time I have also received all your letters, emails, phone calls and comments in large numbers.
Soft Thakkar ji on MyGov - I read what you wrote about starting Sanskrit Hon-line courses.
Being a T professional, it was very good to see your love for Sanskrit.
I have asked the concerned department to reach you the information about the efforts being made here .
The listeners who work on Sanskrit, I would also request them to consider how to move forward the suggestions of Komal ji.
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar ji, village Baraker, District Nalanda, Bihar - Read comments on your Narendra ModiApp
The concern that you have expressed on the decreasing water level in the ground is certainly very important.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animals and birds in summer.
Shakal ji, I have delivered your emotions to all the listeners.
Shriman Yogesh Bhadresha Ji says that I will talk to the youth about their health this time.
They think that compared to Asian countries are our young physics.
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time I will talk to everyone about health in detail.
In the past, the President of Ranche had visited Kashi, Shriman Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the scenes of that journey were to touch the heart and to create impact.
And, he had requested that all the photos, all the videos and social media should be promoted.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had shared that photo on social media and Narendra ModiApp on the same day.
Anga, Jayesh, I want to tell you all the children that your letters touch my tiredness throughout the day.
So many letters, so many phone calls and comments, whatever I could read, whatever I could hear and there are many of those things that touched my heart, but I still have to say something continuously for months.
This time most of the letters are from children who have written about Weam
Have your plans, shared holidays
Worried about the water of animals and birds in summer
Farmer brothers and sisters have come to know about the activities being carried out across the country regarding farmers and farmers.
Some active citizens have sent suggestions regarding water conservation
Our festivals, our culture and our traditions are discussed in the festival season.
That is, the things of the mind also change with the weather and perhaps it is true that the things of our minds, sometimes change the weather in someone's life.
And why do not you change
Indeed , it has the power to change the climate throughout the land .
13 years ago, due to lack of timely treatment, Saidul Laskar's sister died, so that no poor died due to lack of treatment.
Sadul sold home ornaments in his mission, collected money through donations.
In this way, after 12 years, after the last 12 years, Sadul Laskar brought the color of Bhagirath and today due to his hard work, due to his determination, he is ready to become a hospital with a capacity of around 30 beds in the village of Punri near Kolkata.
Many such inspirations introduce my country.
Today, in the country, in the youth, in the latter, in the poor, in the middle class, in every class, it is believed that yes
We can move forward, our country can move forward.
There is a positive atmosphere of self-confidence filled with hopes and expectations.
This self-confidence, this policy will realize our resolve of a New India, it will prove to be a dream.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very important for the farmers brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji, Chaudhary Devi Lal ji - Everyone considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and ordinary life.
How much affection Mahatma Gandhi had been with soil, farming and farmers, this feeling reflects in his line when he had said that forgot how to dig the Earth and to tend the soil, it is forgotten for years.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri used to emphasize the need for trees, plants and plants and better agricultural structures.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia had spoken of massive public awareness for better income, better irrigation and ensuring food and milk production for our farmers.
This state with less area has done a great job .
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced records compared to last five years during 2015-16.
He has shown that when the goals are fixed, the zeal is strong and the will is in the mind, it can be proved, it can be shown.
In the letters that I have received, I was watching that many farmers had written about MSP and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to provide proper crops to the farmers.
It has been decided that MSP for notified crops will be declared at least one and a half times their cost.
Efforts are being made to connect the rural local markets, holesal markets and then global markets.
Farmers will not have to go far away to sell their produce - for this, integrating 22 thousand rural houses of the country with APM and e-NAM platform, upgrading them with infrastructure.
That is, in a way, connect is being made with any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will be inaugurated.
How do the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our resolve, apart from this, how can one hundred and fifty crore countrymen pay the best tribute to Gandhiji by mixing shoulders and shoulders
You are the most requesting me to share your views on this through MyGov.
What's the Logo of Gandhi 150
What is the slogan or mantra or horse sentence
Give your suggestions about this
We all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and recall Bapu and inspire him to bring our country to new heights.
Tell us something about how to mobilise the institutions. Thank you, Thank you have said the truth and I believe that both clean India and healthy India are complementary to each other.
Today, the country has moved ahead of the conventional approach in the field of health.
Every work related to health in the country where there was only the responsibility of the Health Ministry, now all the departments and ministries, whether it is the Ministry of Cleanliness, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Health and Entrepreneurship, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs or the Ministry of Women and Child Development, either the State Governments are working together for Health and Provisional Health as well as Fordable Health.
Preventive health care is also the cheapest and the easiest.
And as much as we are aware of the preventive health care, the people, the family and the society will also benefit.
The first need for life to be healthy is - cleanliness
Yoga has created its identity in the form of preventive health care.
Yoga guarantees both Jitness and Wellness
It is the result of all of us that Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home today.
This time International Yoga Day is 21 June - between which less than 100 days are left .
On the last three International Yoga Days, everywhere in the country and the world, people participated with great enthusiasm.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and motivate the entire family, friends, all of them for yoga.
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
I will share this video with you so that we can practice asana and pranayama together.
Whether it is health care accessible or forwardable , people are cheap and accessible for the common man , efforts are also being made at a wider level .
Today more than 3 thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are being provided at affordable prices.
More new centres are being opened
I appeal to the audience to inform the needy about these public medicine centres - their expenditure will be reduced.
They will have a great service .
The cost of heart station for heart patients has been reduced to 85.
Under Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore families i. e.
In the current 479 medical colleges of the country, the number of MBBS seats has been increased to around 68 thousand.
A new medical college will be opened between every 3 districts
Aims to make the country TB free by 2025
It ' s a great job
You need help in bringing awareness to the people
To get rid of TB, we all have to make collective efforts.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is on 14th April.
Years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of India's industrialization.
The industry was an effective medium for them to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, India has emerged as a brief spirit in the global economy and today the highest foreign direct investment in the world.
The whole world is looking at India as B for investment innovation and development
This was the thought that the development of industries would be possible in cities, due to which Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar relied on urbanization and urbanization of India.
Today, the Smart Cities Mission and Urban Mission have been launched in the country to provide all kinds of facilities in big cities and small towns of the country - whether it is good roads, water resources, health facilities, education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in self-reliance and self-reliance.
They did not want any soul to live in poverty for ever .
At the same time , they also believed that their poverty would not be relieved from a partition among the poor .
India, Stand-up India initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators and young उद्यमs.
During the 1930s and 1940s when only roads and railways were discussed in India, Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke about ports and waterways.
These were Dr. Baba Saheb who saw the water and power as the nation-power.
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built on different seashores of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
During the period of the 40's, most of the discussions were about 2nd World War, Emerging Old-Ar and Partition.
Placed the foundation of the spirit of India
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federal system and emphasized on working together with the Center and the States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and more and more competitive cooperative federalism in every aspect of governance and the most important thing is that Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for millions of people like me associated with the backward classes.
He has shown us that in order to move forward, it is not necessary that people born in big or rich families, but those born in poor families in India can also dream, they can try to fulfill those dreams and can achieve success.
Yes, it happened when many people ridiculed Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar
India which belongs to Ambedkar, the poor belongs to the backward.
Village-Swaraj Abhiyan is being organised from 14th April to 5th May at the birth anniversary of Dr Ambedkar.
Under this, there will be different programmes on village development, poor and socio-economic integrity across India.
My, all of you are urging to take part in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, many festivals are going to come in the next few days, Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi
The day of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir is the day to remember his sacrifice and penance .
The life of Lord Mahavir Ji, the messenger of non-violence, will inspire us all.
Best wishes to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti
As the discussion of the Easter recalls the inspirational teachings of Lord Jesus Christ which have always conveyed the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion to mankind.
In April, the festival of Vaishali will be celebrated in Punjab and West India, in the same days, twins and saturations in Bihar, Bihu in Assam, then the joy and happiness of Poila Vaishak in West Bengal will be shadowed.
All these festivals are attached to our farms and foodgrains in some form or the other, through these festivals, we thank nature for the precious gifts we get in the form of yields.
Once again, greet you all on the occasion.
Today in the beginning itself the talk of mind starts from a phone call itself .
We have seen that the color of the sea is blue but we know from our daily life experiences that there is no color of water .
Have we ever thought that the river, the sea, why the water becomes colored
This question came into the mind of a young man in the 1920s .
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India .
When we talk about science, the name of Indo-Ratn Sir C.V. Raman first comes to us.
One of his treasures is known as Raman Effect .
We celebrate National Science Day every year on 28th February because it is said that on this day he had spent the event of Lift Scattering for which he was given the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in science
On the one hand, there is a tradition of great mathematician Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatt, while on the other hand, Sushrut and Charak are our pride in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose are proud of India
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose was also named Hamus Particle Boson
It was very interesting to know about the miracles that are happening in science sector
Nowadays machines make their own intelligence more smart by self learning
Can anyone help the farmers on the yield of fruits
In the past, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I had the opportunity to visit Gujarat and Ahmedabad to inaugurate the I Retreat.
Science and technology are value networks.
These values are not automatically
Any machine will work as we want
But, it depends on us what we want to work from the machine
Thomas Alva Disson who invented Light Bulb has failed many times in his experiments
Once asked about this, he replied that I have discovered ten thousand ways of not creating a Lift Bulb, that is, Dison has also made his failures his strength.
Unfortunately , today I am in the Karmabhoomi Auroville of Maharshi Arabindo .
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against him, questioned his rule.
Similarly, he questioned every aspect of life as a great sage.
Answer searching and guiding humanity
The feeling of asking questions repeatedly to know the truth is important
This is the real inspiration behind scientific diet .
Till then you should not sit quietly until you get answers to questions like, what and how
I congratulate all our scientists and scientists on the occasion of National Science Day.
Friends, At the time of cruciality, security and disasters keep coming to me a lot of messages about all these things, people keep writing something or the other.
Shri Rabindra Singh from Pune has spoken on an occupational security in his conference on the Narendra Modi mobile app.
He has written that the security standards are not equally good at factories and constructions in our country.
The next 4th March is India's National Safety Day, so that the Prime Minister will talk about the safety of his mind in the program so that awareness about the security of the people increases.
If we are not aware of security in everyday life, we are unable to achieve it then it becomes difficult to get it during the disaster.
We all read bores written on the paths several times, it says that vigilance has decreased, one mistake, loss, smile and smile - leave the world so fast, do not join the relationship with security - no fun, otherwise life will be cheaper than that. There is no use in our lives.
If we are cautious, follow the rules required, we can save our lives, but we can save the society from great accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that a lot of sources have been written about security on the workplace but when we see it, it is not seen anywhere.
As far as disasters are concerned, Disasters are concerned, India is a country full of geographical and climate diversity.
This country has suffered many natural and man-made disasters, such as chemical and industrial accidents.
Disaster friends have also been initiatives for training of volunteers in floods and cyclones in districts.
Training and awareness play a very important role
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year from Lu Wheat Wave.
After this, NMA organized workshop for the management of wheat waves, launched a campaign to create awareness among the people.
A good result came from everyone ' s participation
The number of deaths due to Lu in 2017 declined unexpectedly to nearly 220
This shows that if we prefer security, we can get security.
There are innumerable people working in this manner, social organizations, aware citizens - I would like to appreciate all those who are involved in relief and rescue work within minutes of disaster.
And the number of such anonymous heroes is no less
We have to become a risk conscience society.
In our culture, we often talk about the safety of values, but we have to understand values of safety and security.
We have to make it a part of our lives
I mean , what was the system of information
Why
Because we are not conscientious and therefore listen to our ears and airplanes after sitting, but none of us feel that this information is for me.
We have experience in every field of life like that .
We do not think that security is for someone else, if we all are aware of our safety then the spirit of society is also inherent.
My dear countrymen, this time, in the budget, emphasis was laid on creating health and waste to energy through biogas for villages under Swachh Bharat.
The initiative was initiated for this and it was named GBAR-Han-Galvanising Carganic Bio-Agro Resources.
The objective of this GBAR-HAN scheme is to clean up the villages and convert the solid waste curtains of animal dung and fields into MPST and BI-GAS, to generate wealth and energy from it.
Some European countries and China use cattle dung and other organic wastes to generate energy but its full capacity was not being used in India .
We are moving forward in this direction under Swachh Bharat Mission Rural
The goal of using cattle dung, waste from agriculture, garbage from the kitchen, all of them to make biogas-based energy has been fixed.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to see dung and waste not only as waste but as source of income.
Gobar Dhan Yojana will help rural areas to keep the village clean
Animal Health will be better and productivity will increase
In case of energy for cooking and lighting from biogas, self-reliance will increase
Farmers and Animal Husbandry will help in increasing the income
New job opportunities will be available for East Collection, Transportation, Biogas sale etc.
A online Trading platform will also be created for smooth management of Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect farmers with buyers so that farmers get the right price of dung and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially my sisters living in rural India to take full advantage of this opportunity by creating cooperative societies by creating a self-employment group.
I invite you to become partners of this movement of clean energy and green jobs to transform waste into wealth in your village and to make dung-dhan with dung.
My dear countrymen, till date we have heard about how many types of festivals we have heard about music festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
But the state's first garbage festival was organized in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
The objective behind this festival organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about cleanliness and creativity of the city waste and to create awareness about various methods of reuse of garbags.
There was a variety of activity during this festival, from students to adults, everybody joined.
Different types of artworks were made using waste
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of the East Management
Inspired by Raipur, different types of waste festivals were also held in other districts.
Everyone took initiatives on their behalf and shared innovative ideas, discussions and poetry related to cleanliness.
A festival-like atmosphere was prepared for cleanliness
Especially the way schoolchildren took part, it was amazing
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the entire Chhattisgarh and the government and administration for the innovative way in which the importance of last management and cleanliness was shown in this festival.
International Women's Day is celebrated every year on March 8
There are many programmes in the country and the world
On this day, women who have done exemplary work in different fields in the past are also welcomed by the Women's Power Award in the country.
On this occasion I remember Swami Vivekananda ' s words .
He said that this idea of Swami ji represents the thoughts of women's power in Indian culture every hundred and fifty years ago.
Today, it is our responsibility to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
We are part of the tradition where men were identified by women, Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-Pate, this was the identity of a son.
They have not only forwarded themselves, but have also worked to pursue the country and society and to take it to a new stage.
In the past, a very good suggestion was given to me by a great prince.
He suggested that on 8th March, like celebrating Women's Day, there are programs like this, who have completed 100 years in every village-city
Can such mothers and sisters be honoured organised and can one talk of a long life be discussed in it
Under the campaign launched on 26th January, 2018, these women have set up a new example by creating 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
It includes about 1 lakh Sakhi Mandals, 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water bodies, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women Raj Mistry.
you can imagine how big the event is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will effectively transform the cleanliness campaign in normal life and the culture of cleanliness into the nature of the people.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in News that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence and how much joy and enthusiasm among the people about it.
You all know, Elephanta Island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai
I am surprised to know that despite the presence of Mumbai and being such a big center of tourism, electricity has not reached Elephant for so many years of independence.
For 70 years, the three villages of the Elephanta Islands, Rajbandar, Morbandar and St. Bandar, which were shadowed in the lives of the people there, are now dark and their lives have been illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there
I am happy that now the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be lighted with electricity .
This is not just a power, but a new beginning of development.
What can be the moment of greater satisfaction and happiness than the lives of the people of the country are illuminated.
My dear brothers and sisters, now we celebrate the festival of Shivaratri.
Now the month of March is the decoration of the fields decorated with scorching crops, the golden sands of wheat and the swollen mango of the heart - this is the characteristic of this month.
But this month is also very fond of us for the festival of Holi .
On March 2, the whole country will celebrate Holi with joy
The importance of Holi is equally important for combustion because this day is the day of burning evils in the fire .
Holi is a good opportunity to forget all the hearts and feelings together, to be participants in each other's happiness and gives message of love unity and brotherhood.
Greetings and best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Holi.
This festival is full of colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen - this is the good wishes
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, today I have written a long letter on NarendraModiApp and I have requested you to touch the topics written in his letter.
He has written, on February 1, the imagination going to Antariksha is the death date of Chawla.
He left us in the Columbia Antarctican accident but inspired millions of young people around the world
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji that he has started his farewell to Kalpana Chawla in his long letter .
It is a matter of sadness for all that we lost Kalpana Chawla ji at such a young age, but he gave a message to thousands of girls from all over the world, especially in India, that there is no limit for women-power.
If there is a desire and determination to do something then nothing is impossible.
It is heartening to see that in India today women are moving fast in every field and enhancing the dignity of the country.
Since ancient times, the respect for women in our country, their place in society and their contributions have been surprised by the whole world.
Indian widows have long traditions
Several Indian scholars have contributed to the creation of Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreya are many names
This shows the importance of women in our society .
And then, in our society, women have been given power status.
This women power binds the entire country, the entire society, the family, the source of unity.
Shriman Prakash Tripathi has given several examples ahead
He has written that our bold defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman's fighter aircraft Sukhoi 30 will give him inspiration
Three brave women have become emotional, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi higher pilots and are training in Sukhoi-30.
All Women Rue, led by Capacity Vajpayee, from Delhi to San Ransisco, USA and back to Delhi.
Flying in India BoeingJet - and all women
Hon'ble President ji has taken a new initiative in the past.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, met a group of extraordinary women who have done something first in their respective fields.
The first lady train driver of the country's women accommodators, first ease of doing business, first lady train driver of passenger train, first lady fire officer, first lady bus driver, first lady to reach Antarctica, first lady to reach Everest, in this way, the first lady to reach Everest in every field- our women-speakers have achieved an extraordinary achievement while breaking the orthodoxy of the society.
He showed that a new path can be prepared by crossing all obstacles and obstacles on the strength of hard work, passion and determination.
A book on these women educationers, First Ladies has also been prepared so that the whole country can take inspiration from these women powers, their lives and their works.
This is also available as e-book on Narendra Modi website.
Today, the country has an important role to play in positive changes in the country and society.
Today when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to refer to a railway station
A railway station and women empowerment, you might be wondering what is in the meantime
Matunga Station of Mumbai is the first station in India where all women employees are there .
Women stake in all departments - whether it is commercial development, railway policy, ticket hacking, innovation, point personality, more than 40 women's stake.
This time, after seeing the Republic Day Parade, many people wrote on Twitter and on the other social media that it was one of the main points of the parade, BS Biker Contingent, in which all women were participating.
The adventurous experiment and the scene was also surprised by the guests coming from abroad.
Empowerment is the only form of self-reliance
Today our women-power is leading
self - sufficient
When the tribal women come to know, a definite picture emerges in everyone's mind, in which there are forests, footpaths, women carrying wooden burden on them.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women-power has created a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected area
Violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols - Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere of this
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running the Rickshaw in such dangerous areas.
In a very short period many women have joined it .
I also appreciate the District Administration from providing Grants to Training, the District Administration has played an important role in the success of these women.
Leave the time and external, accept the correction of what is necessary
Any lifestyle is identified, its self-effecting mechanism.
Over the centuries against social evils and evils , efforts have been made in our country at the individual and social level .
Just a few days ago Bihar took an interesting initiative
In order to eradicate social evils in the state, the world's longest human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometers, Kuman Hain, was built
Through this campaign, people were made aware of evils like child marriage and dowry.
The whole state resolves to fight with dowry and child marriage
Children, elderly, zealous and zealous youth, mothers and sisters were all involved in this war.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, the human chain has been connected to the borders of the state.
It is necessary for all the people of the society to get the benefit of development in accurate sense that our society should be free from these evils.
Let us all take a pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and a New India.
Construct a strong and capable India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the State, the administration there and every person involved in the human chain that they took such a special and comprehensive initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan of MyGov, Karnataka, has written on MyGov that the cost of medicines was 6 thousand rupees a month on his father's charges.
He was not aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana earlier.
But now when they got information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and they purchased medicines from there, their cost of medicines decreased by 75 percent.
He wants me to talk about it in the programme so that more and more people get information and they can take advantage of it .
For the past few days, many people used to write me in this regard.
One gets deep satisfaction
And I was also very happy that Shriman Darshan ji had come to know that whatever he had received, he also met others.
The objective behind this scheme is to create health care and encourage ease of living
The medicines available at the Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper than 50 to 90 from the branded medicines sold in the market.
This helps the people, especially senior citizens who take medicines every day, and saves a lot.
The generic medicines purchased in it are according to the fixed standards of World Health Organization .
That ' s why good quality medicines are available at cheap prices
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This not only provides affordable medicines but also creates new employment opportunities for industrial उद्यमs.
Affordable medicines are available at Amrit Stores of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and Hospitals.
The only purpose behind all this is to provide quality and health service to the poorest of the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be created .
My dear countrymen, from Maharashtra, Shriman Mangesh shared a photo on Narendra Modi Mobile App
That Photo was such that my attention was drawn to that Photo
The photo was such that a grandson was taking part in the Lean Morna River Cleanliness Campaign with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organized cleanliness drive to clean the Morana river under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Morana river flowed for twelve months first but now it has become seasonal .
The other pain is that the river was completely filled with wild grass, watercourse
And the river and its edges were dripping .
An action plan was prepared and one day before Makar Sankranti, on January 13, under the first phase of Mission Lean Morna, both sides of the bank of Morana river were cleaned at fourteen places in the area of four kilometers.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than hundred NGOs, colleges, students, children, elderly and mothers and sisters participated in this good work of Mission Lean Marna.
The Swachhta Abhiyan was continued on January 20, 2018 and I am told that unless the Morana river is completely cleaned, this campaign will run every Saturday morning.
It shows that if a soul decides to do something , it is impossible .
Big changes can be brought through mass movement
I congratulate the people of Akola, the people of the district and the administration of the city and the people gathered to make this work a mass movement and your efforts will also inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot of discussions about the Padma Awards these days.
In the newspapers, it also attracts attention to T.
Every year there is a tradition of giving Padma awards but in the last three years, its entire process has changed.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone
Transparency has come since the entire process is online
In a way, the selection process of these awards has been completed.
Those people who are generally not seen in big cities, newspapers, TVs, functions.
Now there is no identity of the person to give the award, the importance of his work is increasing.
You must have heard Shriman Arvind Gupta ji, you will be happy to know that.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent his entire life making toys for children
They have been making toys from waste for four decades so that children can raise their curiosity towards science
Their efforts are that children are inspired by scientific experiments with useless things, for which they are going to three thousand schools across the country and inspiring children by showing films made in 18 languages.
How amazing life, how amazing dedication
One such story is Sitawa Jodhati (SI) of Karnataka
They have not been called the goddess of women-powerment.
For the last three decades , he has contributed greatly in changing the lives of countless women .
He had dedicated himself to Devdasi at the age of seven , but then made his entire life for the welfare of Devdasis .
Not only this, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard the name about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family, tribal family.
He used to do normal jobs for life but he was fond of creating traditional tribal paintings
Today, due to this hobby, they have respect not only India but all over the world.
Bhajju Shyam ji ' s talent , who illuminated India ' s name abroad , was recognized and awarded Padma Shri .
You will be surprised to hear the story of Kerala's tribal woman Lakshmikutty
Laxmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in tribal areas between dense forests.
He has created five hundred herbal medicines on the basis of his memory
He is great in making medicines used after snake bites .
Lakshmi ji is constantly serving society with her knowledge of herbal medicines
He was awarded the Padma Shri for his contribution to the society by identifying this innate person .
I wish to mention another name today , the 75 - year - old Subhasini Mistry of West Bengal was chosen for the award .
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold vessels, oranges and vegetables in others' houses to build a hospital
When he was 23 years old , his husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired him to become a hospital for the poor .
Today, thousands of poor people are treated freely in their hard worked hospital.
I am confident that there are many males and males in our Bahuratna-Vasundhara, there are many males and males that no one knows or no one knows.
Do not identify such individuals, it also loses the society. Padma Puraskar is a medium but I will also tell the countrymen that there are people who live around us, those who consume for the society, those who live for the society, those who work for the entire life with some specialty, sometimes they should be brought among the society.
They do not work for respect but due to their work we get inspiration.
Sometimes in schools, colleges such people should listen to their experiences by calling them.
Beyond the award, there should be some efforts in the society too.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas every year on 9th January.
This is January 9, when the goddess Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from ST ARIA
On this day, we celebrate innumerable bonds between Indians living in India and the world.
On Pravasi Bharatiya Divas this year, we had organized a programme where all the MPs of the Indian origin living around the world had invited Mayors and Mayors.
You will be happy to know that in that programme, from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tannia, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America, and many other countries where our mayor is the original Indian, where MP is the original Indian, all of them participated.
I am happy that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are serving those countries as well as maintaining their strong relations with India, this time the European Union, the European Union has sent me a calendar in which they have shown their contributions in different fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe.
Somebody is dedicated to Ayurveda, somebody brings the hearts of the society with their music, somebody from their poems.
Somebody is doing research on the Climate Chang , somebody is working on Indian texts , somebody has built a gurudwara by running a truck , somebody has built a mosque .
I would like to thank you for this remarkable work of the European Union, to recognise the people of Indian origin and to give information to the people around the world through them.
On January 30, the death anniversary of revered Bapu, who has shown us a new path.
On that day we celebrate the martyrdom Day , on that day , we pay tribute to the great martyrs who have lost their lives in the defence of the country at 11 o'clock .
The path of peace and non-violence, this is Bapu's path
Whether it is India or the world, whether it is a person or a family or a socio-devout Bapu, whatever ideals he has told us, they are still extremely relevant.
They weren't just core principles
At present, we look at the dagger-dagger how well Bapu's talk was
If we resolve to follow Bapu's path - let us go, what can be greater than that
My dear countrymen, I comfort my speech by giving you all the best wishes for 2018.
Where these young people from 18 to 25 years of age, together, churn on New India, find ways, plans
How can we prove our determinations before 2022
How can we build an India that our freedom fighters dreamed
B.
A.
I had not spoken to them, the name of despair was enthusiastic, enthusiasm, energy, dreams and resolutions from those daughters, the time I spent, the strength of the country, these are my youth, these are my countrys future, my dear countrymen, my dear countrymen, not only of our country but also of our country, whenever the famous religious places of the world are discussed, it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala, in this world-famous temple, every year millions of devotees come here to bless Lord Ayyyyappa.
And especially in the place where the hills and forests are located, how can this problem be changed into rites, how can the path to overcome the problem and what is so talented in the public participation - it is a example of the Sabarimala Temple in itself.
Who will have such rules
Hardly, there will be a citizen of India who does not respect them.
They are very bigger than all of us at the age, and they are witnesses of different stages and different phases of the country.
It's going to be 90 years old on 28th September.
Before going abroad, I got the good fortune to talk to Didi on the phone.
This conversation was the same, like, in a very remote, younger brother, speaks to his elder sister.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranama
I am speaking Narendra Modi
Modi ji: So, before I was thinking, Helta ji: Hamodi ji: I congratulate you on birthday, congratulate you on the occasion.
Lata ji: A lot of people are bigger than age, but it is very big to get blessings from what is bigger than your work.
Lata ji: I think my parents have blessings and blessings of those who listen
I'm nothing
Modi ji: This is what your humility is for all of us, this is a great education for all of us, it is an inspiration for us that you have always given priority to the rites and humility of your parents even after losing all this in your life.
Lata ji: G
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you ji: G Modi ji: you fed me something or the other Gujarati
Lata ji: What are you, you do not know yourself
I know that the picture of India is changing due to your arrival and that is the same, I am happy.
Looks very good
Modi ji: Just sister, keep your blessings, keep your blessings on the whole country, and people like us do something good, you have always inspired me.
I also get your letter and if I get some of your gifts, then I am happy to have a personality, a family relationship.
Lata ji: G, G.
No, I don't want to give you a lot of trouble, because I'm looking at you, I know how busy you are and how much work you do.
What to think
When you came to touch your mother's feet, I had sent somebody to him and blessed him.
Modi ji: Yes
My mother remembered and she was telling me
Lata ji: And she blessed me on the telephone, so I liked, Modi ji: Our mother was very happy because of your love.
And once again I congratulate you on the birthday.
Modi ji: This time when Mumbai came, I used to think that Rubru would come, ji:
Lata ji: ee necessarily, necessarily
This will be my bounty .
Modi ji: Pranama, Didi
Lata ji: Prayer
Modi ji: Thank you very much: very much salute
Modi ji: Pranam ji
For many weeks, across the country, the festivals will be enchanted.
All the best wishes to you all, the coming festivals.
Festivals, all family members will come together
Perhaps, this saying is not just words, we have an order, a philosophy, a motivation.
Think, on one hand, some houses glitter with light, on the other hand, in front of it, in some houses around, there is dark shadow.
In some houses, sweets are getting worse, so in some houses, children craving for sweets.
The real joy of these festivals is only when this dark sixth, this darkness is reduced - the light spreads.
We also share happiness, where there is lack, and this is also our nature.
In our houses, sweets, clothes, gists, when there is a delivery in, then also think about a moment, delivery out.
At least in our homes, those who are in excess, those whom we don't work now, need a delivery out of these things.
In many cities, many NGOs start-ups of young colleagues do this work.
They collect everything from the houses of the people, clothes, sweets, food, search and transport the needy and do an anonymous activity.
Can this time, in this season of festivals, with full awareness and determination, erase the darkness under this mirror
The smile on the faces of many poor families, the festivals will double your happiness, your face will be shiny, your face will be shiny, your light will be, your wall will be illuminated and illuminated.
My dear brothers and sisters, in Deepawali, Laxmi comes home in the form of luck and prosperity.
In our culture, daughters have been considered Lakshmi, because daughter brings good luck and prosperity.
Can we do the programme of honoring this Lakshmi of India on this Diwali
There will be many daughters around us, many daughters who are doing extraordinary work.
Someone will be working for the education of poor children, someone will be engaged in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health, someone will be serving society by becoming a doctor and engineer.
By becoming a lawyer, try to get justice to anyone
Our society, recognize, respect such daughters, and respect them,
Program of their honor, happen across the country
One more thing can be done, about the achievements of these daughters, share more and more social media and use shttags.
As we all had launched a grand campaign, Self-with-Daughter and it spread all over the world.
Similarly, this time, we will launch India's Lakshmi.
Encouraging Indias Lakshmi means strengthening the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had said beforehand that it is a great advantage that I get the opportunity to communicate directly and indirectly with many unknowing people.
A student from far-flung Arunachal has sent a big internet letter to me, Alina Tayang.
And it says, I read the letter in front of you. Excellent Prime Minister, my name is Alina Tayang
I am from Roeing, Arunachal Pradesh
This time when the result of my eam came, some people asked me, did you read the Em Arriors book
I told you, I didn't read this book.
But, after returning, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times
After that my experience was very good .
I thought if I had read this book before Eam, I would have been very beneficial.
I liked many aspects from this book, but I also saw that there are many mantras for students but there is nothing more in this book for parents and teachers.
My little student friend, first thank you for writing the letter
Thank you for reading the Lam Arriors 2-3 times
What you have said that if I get out at the time of a new rediscipline then I will definitely try to write something for Parents and Teachers.
I urge all the students and teachers of the country to tell me their experiences about the aspects related to stress free features.
I ' m going to study it
I will think about it and I will try to write it in my own words and in my own way, and it may be possible that if your suggestions are more then the matter of my new rediscipline will also be confirmed.
So I ' ll wait for your ideas
I once again express my gratitude to my friend, student Alina Tayang from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you also know about the programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through television, through newspapers, and also discuss the busyness.
But, don't you know I'm a normal man like you
If there was someone else on this occasion, he would have been sad and disappointed, but, his face did not smile, but he smiled on everyone's faces with his words.
Everyone became convinced that the form of Sportsman Spirit was seen in their humility, simplicity and real sense.
The audience present there warmly welcomed their words
After losing in tough collision , he praised his rival Nadal and gave evidence of Sportsman spirit .
On the other hand, Champion Nadal also appreciated the game of Enil.
The humility of the loser in the same match and the humility of the winner was both worth seeing .
The thought of our forefathers is indeed worthy .
Mani Kanchan Coincidence: Janayati Loksya Lochan Anandamayani, when the qualification and humility of a person gets simultaneous, then who can not win the heart
In fact, this young player has won the hearts of the people around the world.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, I am doing what I am going to talk directly to you.
It is very difficult to stop it later .
But, if we wake up in the beginning and stop him, a lot can be saved.
With this sense, I feel, today, especially with my youth, I will talk about something.
We all know that tobacco addiction is very harmful to health and it becomes very difficult to leave its addiction.
Those who consume tobacco increase the risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure.
Everyone says this
The intoxication from tobacco is caused by the nicotyne present in it .
By its consumption in adolescence the development of the brain also affects .
But, today, I want to talk to you, on a new topic
You will know that recently, e-cigarettes have been banned in India.
e-cigarette is a type of electronic device separate from normal cigarettes.
Where we all understand the dangers of normal cigarettes, there is a misconception about e-cigarette.
This error has been spread that there is no threat from e-cigarette.
This is their endeavor, that no member of the family should smoke, not smoking.
They know that smoking causes huge losses to the body due to tobacco.
The drinker knows , and the seer knows .
But the case of e-cigarette is very different.
There is not so much environment in people about e-cigarette.
They are completely unaware of its threat and that is why sometimes e-cigarettes enter the house secretly.
Our young people walk on the path of waste, unknowingly.
In fact, many harmful chemicals are added in e-cigarette, which has a bad effect on health.
You know, when someone smokes around us, we know it only goes smelling.
In such a situation, many teenagers and youngsters are seen roaming around in their books, in their offices, in their pockets, sometimes in their hands and sometimes they become victims of it.
Young generation is the future of the country
E-cigarette has been banned so that this new way of intoxication does not destroy our young country.
Children's life will not be wasted by the dreams of every family
These diseases do not root in the society.
I urge all of you to leave the drunkard of tobacco and do not follow any misunderstanding regarding e-cigarette.
Let us all build a healthy India
You have it ID
Do you remember India
India means a little here that if we go to the gym for two-two hours in the morning and evening, then it will happen.
This is our Bharat Mata, this is our country, Bahuratna Vasundhara.
Many human gems have come out of this land
India-Year has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, has been the land of action.
And these are those people who have spent theirselves, not for themselves, for others.
Similarly, a great geography is being honored in Vetican City on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian, that Pope Francis will declare Mary Threasia as saint on October 13
The work done by Sister Mary Threasia for the betterment of humanity in his young age of 50 years is an example for the whole world.
From the field of social service and education, he had a wonderful attachment.
He built several schools, hostels and orphanages, and throughout his life, he was engaged in this mission.
Once again, I pay tribute to Sister Mary Threasia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for the entire world but for the entire world that today when we are celebrating Gandhi 150, 130 crore people have resolved to be free from single-seven plastic.
In the direction of environmental protection, seeing the kind of lead India has taken in the whole world, today the eyes of all the countries are drawn towards India.
I am confident that all of you will be going to be part of the campaign to liberate Single See Plastics on 2nd October.
People are contributing in this campaign in their own ways everywhere .
But, a young man from our own country has launched a very unique campaign.
I noticed his work, so I tried to understand his new experiment by talking to him on the phone.
Maybe these things have been used to other people of the country.
Shriman Riputman Belvi is making a unique effort to plough
When I heard the plogging word for the first time , it was new to me too .
In foreign countries , perhaps these words have been used in some quantity
However, in India, Riputman Belvi ji has propagated it a lot.
Let ' s talk to them
I congratulate you and the Ministry of Sports on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Puja Bapu.
These programs are scheduled to be held across the country on 2nd October, 2019.
How to do this programme, what happens in the programme, we have heard from the experience of republicans.
With this we will not only take care of our health , but will also be able to protect the health of the earth .
With this campaign, awareness is also increasing about hygiene as well as cleanliness in people.
I am confident that if 130 crore countrymen will take a step in this direction then their India will move 130 crore steps towards the liberation of single use plastic.
Riputman ji, once again, thank you very much
And congratulate you, your team, and for this new imagination, from me.
want to move forward to transform our lives into a country
One thing you want to remember in advance
However, I will tell him in detail in the next mind but today I am saying something in advance so that you get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember, October 31, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary
So you have to start preparations right now
I will talk in detail but now it is time, some people can start work, some can also do some schemes.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on August 15, I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 you would go to 15 places of India.
If at least 15 places and those can be done then make a night, two night stay program.
You see Hindustan, understand, experience
How many varieties we have .
And when they come to the festival of Diwali on holidays, people definitely go and therefore I will again urge you to visit any such 15 places in India.
Today our rank is thirty-five and five years ago our rank was at number 65, that is, in a way we have jumped a lot.
If we try more, we will make our place in the world's major places in tourism when we come to 75 years of independence.
It is also necessary to see that in the days of Diwali, firecrackers etc., there will be no loss of any person.
Whatever objection (necessity) should be taken for this, you must take the objection (necessarily)
Come on
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat , November 2017
Can you imagine how hard they must have worked to build the Constitution of our country filled with diversity
The Konkan coastal region, where the sea plays an important role, was under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj, many of the arts associated with Shivaji Maharaj such as Indus Durg, Murud Janjira, Gold Fort etc. were either situated on the beaches or the sea beaches. The responsibility of the security of these arts was to serve Maratha navy.
It is also feared by thinking that there will be no soil, neither plants nor trees will grow, where will human life be possible
Where would the organism be possible
It has been proved by every kind of scientific method that the use of more urea causes serious damage to the soil and the soil, the farmer is the son of the soil, how can the farmer see the soil and the soil sick
The need of the hour is to wake up the relations of this mother and daughter once again. Can our farmers, the sons and children of our soil determine that how much urea they use in their fields today, 2022, when 75 years of independence, half of the use will stop
The person of North-India will not know what is in South-India
The person of West-India will not know what is in East India
Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and former President Abdul Kalam ji, who are full of diversity, once again come to know that when they visited India, they got a new inspiration to see and die and see India, all these great men visited India in the beginning of their work. They tried to understand and understand India in their own way.
Can you put the hash tag on incredible India
You see, if all the people of one state say this then I would like to tell the government that they should scrutinize it and prepare publicity support on the seven things that have come from every state, that is, how to promote tourist destinations from the public.
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
On the one hand , the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand , when news of violence comes from any corner of India , it is natural for the country to worry .
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who is giving life to the unity of the country.
For centuries our ancestors have accepted public life and values, non-violence and respect.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: These have been listening to us since childhood, say
I want to assure the people of the country, those who take law, those who suppress the path of violence, whether it is a person or a group, will never tolerate this country nor will any government tolerate it.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, living standards and clothing.
We find diversity in every behavior of life .
Even our festivals are filled with diversity and because of our thousands of years old cultural heritage, see cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events, there will hardly be a day left in 365 days, while we are not connected with any festival.
Now you must have seen that all our festivals follow the leaflet at the time of nature.
There is direct relation with nature .
Many of our festivals are directly connected to the farmers and are connected to fishermen.
Today I am talking about the festivals . First of all , I would like to call you Michami Dukkaram .
The festival of Sanvatsari was celebrated yesterday in Jain society
Parushan Parva is celebrated in the month of Bhadra in Jain society .
The last day of Parushan Parva is the day of Sanvatsari .
It ' s really a wonderful tradition in itself
The festival of Sanvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
This is also called forgiveness festival in a way and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other Michami Dukkaram .
Anyway , forgiveness in our scriptures is the Bhushan of Veerasya Bhushanam i . e . forgiveness of Veeras .
Forgiveness is brave .
We have heard about this and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say sorry is the characteristic of the powerful person.
Shakespeare had written in his drama The Mercant of Excellence, describing the significance of forgiveness, the Mercy is twist blest, it is blessed with him that gives and him that texts i.e. forgives and those who were forgiven, both receive the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, these days, every corner of India has a stir in Ganesh Chaturthi and when it comes to Ganesh Chaturthi, it is natural to talk about the public-Ganesh festival.
Balgangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and he had become a symbol of freedom movement in the last 125 years prior to independence .
And after Independence, he has become a symbol of socio-education and social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi runs for 10 days .
This great festival is called the symbol of unity, equality and purity.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for the festival of Ganesh.
Oommen Festival is currently being celebrated in Kerala
One of the colorful festivals of India, Onam is one of the major festivals of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance .
Oommen Festival showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala
This festival awakens the message of love and harmony in society as well as a new spirit, a new hope and a new belief in the minds of the people.
And now these festivals are also becoming the reason for the attraction of tourism.
And I would like to tell the countrymen that like the festival of Navaratri in Gujarat or Durga Festival in Bengal has become an attraction for tourism in a way
Our other festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
What can we do in that direction
A few days after the series of these festivals, the festival of Eid-ul-uha will also be celebrated across the country.
Many congratulations to all the countrymen, Id-ul-uha
Festivals are the symbols of faith and belief for us, we have to make festivals in New India a symbol of cleanliness.
Festivals and sanitation are connected in family life
Festival preparation means cleanliness
This is not a new thing for us , but it is also necessary to create a social nature .
Public urge for cleanliness should not only be in the house, but in our entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state, in our country, these festivals should be an incomplete part.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of being modern are changing.
These days, a new dimension, a new perameter, how modern you are, how modern you are, how modern your thought-process is, how much modern you are, how much aware you are about the environment.
Eco-friendly, environment-friendly behavior in your own activities is against him.
In the community , if it is against it , it is considered evil today .
And today I am seeing the result of this that even in these days, the eco-friendly Ganapati has become a big campaign.
If you go to the Tube, you will see that in every house children are making Ganesh ji, bringing soil and creating Ganesh ji.
Various types of uses are being done in every family
See how big a change has come and this is a pleasant change
And as I said, our country is also full of crores of stunning minds.
Three years ago when the cleanliness campaign was started, it will take three years on October 2.
And, its positive results are coming out.
The coverage of toilets has reached around 67 from 39.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from open defecation.
In Gujarat, there was a terrible flood
Many people lost their lives , but after the flood , when the water was reduced , so much was ruined everywhere .
At present, the workers of Jamiat Ulemayehind, in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat, cleaned the flood affected 22 temples and 3 mosques in a phased manner.
Everyone sweats, everybody gets out
The best example of unity for cleanliness, such an example that inspires everyone, given by all the workers of Jamiat Ulemayehind
The efforts made by dedication to cleanliness, if this becomes our permanent nature, then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I call upon all of you that once again, 15-20 days before the Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, just like the Swachhta Hi Seva, this is the service of the Lord.
Create an environment for cleanliness across the country
As we get the opportunity, wherever we get the opportunity, we find opportunities.
But we all add
Assume it in a way preparing for Diwali, consider it in a way preparing for Navratri, accept the preparation of Durga Puja
My friends of social media can run some creative campaigns and create inspiration for the work of the Virtual World on the ground.
Swachh Sankalp to Swachh Siddhi Competition, this campaign by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, which is a competition to create a small film, is being organized by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation.
In this, you can write essays in different languages and there is no limit of age, there is no age limit.
You can make short films, make your mobile
Can make a 2-3-minute movie that inspires cleanliness
It can be in any lunguage, it can also be solved.
You see, this 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti will be shining
You can imagine that after this 15-day cleaning campaign, after the cleanliness service, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, it will be a sacred pleasure within us to pay homage to Lord Bapu.
My dear countrymen, I want to accept a particular loan of all of you today.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you, not because you have been associated with your heart for so long, I would like to express my gratitude because millions of people from all corners of the country join this programme of mind.
The number of listeners is in crores but millions of people write me letters, sometimes messages, sometimes the message comes on the phone, and I have a huge treasury.
This has become a great opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I wait for your message more than you want to talk about .
I ' m greedy because I get to learn something from all of you
Yes, man, you've ever made such a mistake
Sometimes some things become part of our habit that we do not feel that we miss .
Prime Minister, I am speaking from Pune
I want to tell you about my friend
She ' s always trying to help people but I ' m surprised to see her habit .
I once went to mall shopping with her
On one sari, he spent two thousand rupees very easily and Rs. 450 on Pizza, while the auto that had taken to go to the mall, he continued to swing for five rupees for a long time.
While returning, purchased vegetables on the way and saved 4-5 rupees by swinging on every vegetable again.
I feel very bad
You must tell about your mind about this
Now after listening to these phone calls, I am sure you might have been surprised, you might have been surprised and may have decided not to commit such a mistake from the front.
Do you not think that whenever we come to sell some goods around our house, a ferry person comes from a small shopkeeper, a small shopkeeper, a vegetable seller, sometimes the relationship comes with the auto-rickshaw driver, whenever we come with a hardworking person, we start losing emotions from him, we start losing money, not so much, reduce two rupees, reduce five rupees.
And we are going to eat food in a big restaurant, we dont even see what is written in the bill, we pay money from the money.
Not only that, if you go shopping in the shovolume, you don't have any money, but if you come to a close relationship with someone then you don't live without money.
What will happen to the poor's mind, have you ever thought
Two rupees don't make any difference in your life, but how deep will this small habit of yours happen to his mind
Madam, I'm grateful to you and you gave me a message by calling such a heart touching phone.
I am convinced that my countrymen will have a habit of behaving with the poor , so they will surely quit .
My dear young friends, on August 29, the whole country celebrates as National Sports Day.
This is the birthday of great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to Hockey was incomparable
I am reminding you that I want the new generation of our country to join the game.
Sports became part of our lives
If we are young nations of the world then we should also look at these youthful games.
Sports i. e. Physical Intelligence, Mantal Alertness and Personality Development I understand what more needed
Sports is in a way a very big herb of heart mixture .
The young generation of our country came forward in the sports world and in today's computer era, I would like to also inform that playing is more important than play-state.
Play a game , but even in the outskirts , sometimes work with the Hootball .
Crickets will be played on computer but playing cricket below the sky in the open ground is a different joy
There was a time when the family kids used to go out , the mother used to ask before when you would come back .
Today the condition is that when the children come home, they either get to see a cartoon film in a corner or stick to the mobile game and then tell the mother when you will go out.
It is a matter of great happiness for our youngsters that India is going to organize an Inder 17 World Cup from 6 to 28 October in India.
24 teams from around the world are going to make India their home
Let us welcome our young guests from the world, with the festival of sports, enjoy the game, create an atmosphere in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I want to share a very touching incident last week with the countrymen.
I got an opportunity to meet a few daughters of a very young age and some of them were born in the Himalayas .
Sometimes spend 40-40 days together in water
Sometimes 30-30 days will spend in water
Our six daughters with courage between the waves of the sea and this is the first incident in the world.
Who will be Hindustani who do not deny our daughters
I salute the tongue of these daughters and I have asked them to share their experiences with the whole country.
I will also arrange a separate arrangement for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read it because this is a brave story, a story of self-interest and I will be happy to deliver these daughters to you.
My best wishes to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September, we all celebrate Teachers' Day.
The birth anniversary of former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji
He was the President but he presented himself as a teacher throughout his life .
He always liked to live as a teacher
I bow down to him, the great scientist, Albert Einstein, said.
It is the Supreme Art of the Teacher to walken happy in creative expression and knowledge. It is the most important quality of a teacher to enjoy creative emotion and knowledge amongst his students.
This time when we celebrate Teacher ' s Day , can we all resolve together
Can you run a campaign in a mission mode
If we work collectively, we will play a very big role in nation transformation.
Let's talk to transform this mantra.
Prayer PM ji
My name is Doctor Aninya Awasthi
I am a resident of Mumbai city and work for the Indian Research Centre of World University.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) has been a matter of discussion not only in India but in the entire world but also in the discussions of the Pandits of the financial world.
On August 28, 2014, the campaign was started by taking a dream in the mind.
The Prime Minister's Jan Dhan Yojana's campaign is going to be held on August 28 for three years.
30 crore new families have been connected with this, Bank account has been opened.
This number is more than the population of many countries in the world
Today, I am very happy that within three years, my poor brother, who is sitting on that last corner of the society, has become part of the original stream of the countrys economy, his habit has changed, he has started coming to the bank, he has started saving the money, he is feeling the security of the money.
Sometimes they live in their hands, live in their pockets, they are in their homes, so they feel like spending.
If you want to do a good job in the coming days, money will be useful
In Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in banks by our poor.
This is a kind of poor saving, this is his power in the days to come.
And with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana whose account is open, he has also got the benefit of insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Rs.
In many families, when the poor man suffered a crisis due to a rupee insurance, the family chief's life ended, he got Rs 2 lakh in a few days.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-up Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Dalits, Adivasis, Women, Read-written youths, millions and millions of young people who wish to do something by standing on their feet, from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, without any guarantee money from banks and they stood on their own feet.
Today, there is not so much time but I will surely tell the people of Bank that they should upload it on MyGov.
I will make every effort to reach you and it is an inspirational event that people of Media can also take advantage of it.
They can also inspire new generations by interviewing such people.
Man's mind is such that the rainy season is a very charming period for the mind.
Animals, birds, plants, nature all are happy on the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a vicious look, then it is known that there is also a great power to destroy the water.
Nature gives us life, keeps us alive, but sometimes natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, its terrible nature destroys us.
There is a huge negative impact on the changing weather cycle and environment.
For the past few days, some parts of India, particularly Assam, North East, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bengal, have suffered natural calamities due to excessive rains.
The flood affected areas are being monitored.
Relief work is being done at a wider level.
Wherever possible, my colleagues of the Council of Ministers are also reaching.
State governments are also making every effort to help flood victims in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and civil servants are also making every effort to help people in such a situation.
On behalf of the Government of India, the army, the people of the air force, the people of the NCR, the Paramilitary Forces, everybody gets involved in serving the disaster victims at such a time.
And 247 controlle from helpline number 1078 is constantly working to deal with the flood situation.
People also tell their difficulties.
The entire government system was prepared by drilling a mock at maximum places before you.
NCR teams were set up.
Gradually, we also make the nature that if we can create our activities according to the weather forecast, then we can avoid losses.
Whenever I prepare for myself, I see that citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time so many letters have come about GST, so many phone calls have come and people still express their happiness and curiosity about GST.
I also tell you a phone call: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking Netu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard the speech of your hearted accountants day and was very impressed.
Similarly, Goods and Services Tax (GST) was launched in our country on todays date last month.
Can you tell me whether the government has epeacted the same results are coming after a month or not
I would like to listen to your ideas about it, thank you.
The implementation of GST has been nearly a month and its benefits have started to appear.
And I am very satisfying and happy when a poor man writes a letter to me and tells me how poor things needed are reduced due to GST.
If a person living in the forests in the North-East, far-flung mountains, writes a letter that initially he was afraid that what was not known but now when I started learning about it, I think it became easier than before.
Trade became easier.
And the biggest thing is that customers have started growing trust in the businessman.
I was just watching how GST was impacted on Transport and Logistics Sector.
How has the movement of trucks increased now
How the time is decreasing
The highways have become clear.
Due to increased speed of trucks, pollution has also been reduced.
The goods are also reaching very quickly.
This facility is not only, but also the economic pace gets strength.
Earlier, due to being a separate tax structure, the maximum resources of transport and logistics sector used to be maintained and they had to create new vehicles within every stage.
GST, which I call Good and Simple Tax, has actually produced a positive impact on our economy in a very short span of time.
The faster the smooth transition has taken place, the faster the migration has taken place, the new registrations have created a new faith throughout the country.
And sometimes Pandits of the economy, Pandits of Management, Pandits of Technology, will definitely write the use of GST of India as a model before the world.
There will be a case study for many universities of the world.
Because it is a huge height of success in itself to implement it in such a large country with the innovation of such a large scale and millions of people.
The world will definitely study it.
And GST has been implemented, all the states have partnerships and responsibility of all the states.
All the decisions have been made by the states and the Center unanimously.
And the result of this was that every government had the same priority that there was no burden on the poor plate due to GST.
I congratulate all the ministries, all departments, all the meetings of the Central and the State Government.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform, it is an economy that strengthens the culture of a new honesty.
There is also a campaign for social reform in a way.
Once again, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the countrymen for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
We have been hearing this since childhood and the reason for this is that the non-cooperation movement began on August 1, 1920.
The uit India Movement began on August 9, 1942, which is known as the August Revolution and the country was freed on August 15, 1947.
In a way, in the month of August, several events are particularly associated with the freedom struggle.
But very few people know that leaving India, this slogan was given by Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of the country, who have been associated with the glitter of freedom, struggled, struggled, the pages of history are our inspiration for building a magnificent India.
Our freedom fighters have sacrificed sacrifices and sacrifices, what can be a great inspiration from them
uit India movement was an important struggle for the Indian freedom movement.
This movement had resolved the entire country to liberate the British-Raj.
This was the time when the people of India had become part of the uit India movement in every corner of India, in every corner of India, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in the city, in every corner of the country.
Jan-Akrosh was on its peak.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were fighting their lives with the mantra of death.
Millions of young people of the country had left their studies, had left books.
The non-cooperation movement and the uit India Movement 1920 and 1942 show two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
The nature of the non-cooperation movement was different and the situation of 42 came, the intensity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave mantra to do or die.
There was public support behind all this success, people-power, people-conscience, people-conscience.
The whole country was fighting together.
And sometimes I think that if we look at the pages of history, then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1857.
The freedom struggle, which began from 1857, continued to run every moment in any corner of the country till 1942.
This long period created a glimpse of freedom in the hearts of the people of the country.
Everyone was committed to doing something or the other.
Peninsula changed, but there was no reduction in the resolution.
The country has been trying every moment to overthrow the British rulers.
This movement, from 1857 to 1942, created a situation that reached its peak in 1942 and left India, played an important role that the British had to go in 1947 within 5 years.
The freedom fighters from 1857 to 1942 reached the people.
And from 1942 to 1947, five years became such a mass movement, with the determination, it became the reason for the country to give independence as a five-decisive year of prosperity.
These five years were decisive years.
Now I want to add you to this math.
We were free in 1947.
Today is 2017.
It's almost 70 years.
Governments came.
Arrangements made, changed, grown, increased.
Everyone tried their own way to free the country from problems.
Successes were also found.
Aspirations also woke up.
Like 1942 to 1947, there were a decisive five years of prosperity.
I am seeing that from 2017 to 2022, a five-year period of achievement has come to us.
On August 15, 2017, we celebrated as a Sankalp Festival and when we have 75 years of independence in 2022, we will continue to transform the resolution into achieving it.
There are millions of resolutions.
Millions of efforts should be made to fulfil the resolve.
So, like 1942 to 1947, five years have become decisive for the country's independence, these five years from 2017 to 2022 can also become decisive for the future of India.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of our country's independence.
Then we all have to take a determination today.
2017 is to create a year of our resolve.
This is what we have to connect with the resolution of the month of August and we have to resolve.
Come, let's run a Mahabhaiyan of Siddhi from the resolution in August 9 this month.
A resolution which we will prove in the next 5 years.
Young organizations, student organizations, NGOs etc. can organize a collective discussion.
Can expose new ideas.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
What can I contribute to as a person
Let us join the festival of this resolution.
Using technology, videos, posts, blogs, articles and new ideas brought them all together.
Change this campaign into a public movement.
This is an attempt to connect young people with the glorious history of the country and to introduce them to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe you must make a comprehensive publicity, spread it.
My dear countrymen, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort as the chief servant of the country on August 15.
I am just a pledge, there he doesn't speak.
From the Red Fort, the voices of 1. 25 billion countrymen echo.
I am happy that for the last 3 years, I suggest from every corner of the country on August 15, what should I say on August 15
This time too, I invite you. You must send your thoughts to my Government either on Narendra ModiApp.
I myself read it and I will try to express it in whatever time I have on August 15.
On the last three occasions, I have heard a complaint in my 15th August speeches that my speech is a bit longer.
I have tried to make rules for me in more than 40-45-50 minutes.
I don't know if I can.
But I intend to try this time how to make my speech smaller
Let's see whether success is achieved or not.
I want to do another thing today, my countrymen.
India has a social economist in the economy.
And we should never underestimate it.
Our festivals, our festivals, these are just the occasions of joy and happiness.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign for social reform.
And in these festivals, a natural joy is also added.
Festivals bring sweetness in relationships, affection in the family, brotherhood in society.
Add the person and society.
There is a comfortable journey from the person to the person.
There is an opportunity to move from importance to the left.
As far as the economy is concerned, many months before Rakhi, rakhi starts making rakhis in small domestic industries in hundreds of families.
From Khadi to silk threads, no one knows how many rakhis and nowadays people like homemade rakhis.
Rakhi makers, Rakhi sellers, thousands of sweets and hundreds of business joins a festival.
Our poor brothers and sisters, family goes through this.
We burn the lamp in Deepawali, it is just a light festival, it is not just a festival but adornment of the house, it is not so.
He is directly related to those poor families who have given small soil.
But today, when I talk about the poor economy associated with festivals and festivals, I would like to talk about the environment.
I have seen that sometimes I think that the countrymen are more aware than me, are more active.
For the last one month, conscious citizens have written letters to me.
And he has urged you to tell about eco-friendly Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturthi prematurely so that people plan the preference of soil.
First of all, I am grateful to such aware citizens.
They have urged me to say on this subject before time.
This time public Ganesh festival has a special significance.
125 years and 125 crore countrymen Lokmanya Tilak ji had started the public festival for the sake of collective rites for the basic spirit of unity and awareness of society.
We once again recall the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak in this year's Ganesha Festival.
And this time I said very quickly
I am confident that you all will join me and this will benefit from the poor artisans who are poor and those who make sculptures, they will get jobs and the poor will fill their belly.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for the festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that the field of education, the economic sector, the social sector, the sportspersons, our daughters are illuminating the name of the country and getting new heights.
We are proud of our daughters.
Just recently, our daughters performed well in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those players daughters this week.
I was very happy to talk to them, but I was feeling that World Up could not win.
He had pressure on his face, there was tension.
I told those daughters and I gave my separate assessment.
I said, Nowadays the period of media is such that expectations are increased so much, so much is increased and when it does not succeed, it is also transformed into resentment.
We have seen many such games that if the players of India fail, then the country's anger breaks on those players.
Some people break the limits and say something like this, write such things, there is a lot of pain.
But for the first time that when our daughters were not successful in the World Cup, 125 crore Indians took the defeat on their shoulders.
Not only that, these daughters glorify their daughters, they have glorified their daughters.
I see this a pleasant change and I told these daughters that you look at this kind of good fortune that you have only met the people and get out of your mind that you have not succeeded.
Whether you won the match or not, you have won 125 million countrymen.
My dear countrymen, once again I recall the August Cranti, once again on 9th August, once again I am reminiscing you on 15th August, once again I am reminding you of 2022, 75 years of independence.
Every countrymen should resolve and prepare a 5-year roadmap for every countrymen to prove their resolve.
We all have to reach new heights, reach and reach the country.
Come together, let us do something or the other.
The fate of the country will be better and move forward with this belief.
Changing weather
This time heat was also very much
But it is better for you to follow your footsteps .
Rainfall has made the weather pleasant in many parts of the country
After the rains, cold winds have been relieved from the heat of the past.
And we all have seen that however anxiety in life, however stress, personal life, public life, the arrival of rain also changes our mindset.
Today, the chariot journey of Lord Jagannath ji celebrates a lot of devotion and joy in many parts of the country.
Now in some parts of the world , the festival of Lord Jagannath ji ' s Rath Yatra is celebrated .
and the country is closely connected with Lord Jagannath ji
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor
And very few people will know, there is a word in English language juggernaut and that means a magnificent chariot that no one can stop.
And this juggernaut dictionary meaning also shows that this word has emerged from the chariot of Jagannath .
And so we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath ji, I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen and salute Lord Jagannath ji in his greetings.
India's diversity is also its characteristic, India's diversity is also India's power.
The sacred month of Ramadan was celebrated with sacred passion in worship .
Now the festival of Eid is
My best wishes to all of you on this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr
The month of Ramadan is the month of Punya Dan, the month of distributing the happiness and the happiness that you share, the happiness increases
Let us all share the treasures of happiness and inspiration from these sacred festivals and move forward the country.
In this holy month of Ramzan, a big inspirational incident of Mubarakpur village of Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh came to me.
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters live in that small village, in a way more and more population belongs to brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
Inside this Ramzan the villagers decided to build toilets together
And this individual toilet is also helped by the government and the amount of assistance is given to them around Rs 17 lakhs .
These 17 lakhs you spend for other facilities in the village
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for reversing this sacred occasion of Ramzan on the occasion of the good of the society.
We know that three states in our country are Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala, they have already been declared open defecation free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana also announced this week
I especially express my gratitude to the administration of these five states, the government and the people-governance for fulfilling this work.
We know well that in the life of the person, whatever is good in the life of the society, we have to work hard.
If our handwriting is bad, if it is to be corrected, then it has to be very aware for a long time.
Then go and change the habit of the body, the mind
The subject of cleanliness is similar
Such bad habits have become part of our nature .
Everyone ' s attention has to be attracted
Good motivational events will also have to be remembered repeatedly
And I am happy that today cleanliness is not a government programme
This is becoming a movement of masses and masses.
And when people sitting in the government also take part in this work, how much power increases.
A very excellent event came in my mind in the past, which I would like to tell you.
This is the incident of Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh
The administration took a big job with the people ' s participation .
100 hours of non stop campaign
And what was the goal
10 thousand household toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats in one hundred hours
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the people and the government have successfully completed the work of constructing ten thousand toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of those villages of Vijayanagaram district that you have presented a very inspiring example of hard work.
NarendramodiApp comes on MyGov. In, comes from letters and comes on the sky.
Shriman Prakash Tripathi, while recalling the Emergency, wrote that on June 25, he has presented in the history of democracy as a period of time.
This awareness about the democracy of Prakash Tripathi ji is commendable and democracy is not just an arrangement, it is also a ritual.
Regular awareness towards democracy is necessary and therefore, the words that hurt democracy have to be remembered and move forward in the direction of good things of democracy.
1975 - June 25 - It was a dark night that no democracy lover could forget.
No Indian can forget I.
In a way, the country was converted into prison.
The opponent sound was buried
Jayprakash Narayan, including the dignitaries of the country, had been locked up in jail.
The justice system was also not able to escape the shadow of that horrific form of emergency.
Newspapers were completely wasted.
Democracy lovers fought a big battle and a country like India, such a large country, when an opportunity was received, how democracy prevailed in the rumours of the people of India, I demonstrated that power through elections.
We have to further strengthen this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling the gloriousness of his head in the world today.
June 21, 2017 - The whole world became Yoga.
From water to mountain, people welcomed the sun rays in the morning through yoga.
Who will be Indian, who will not be proud of this.
It is not that Yoga was not the first, but today when Yoga has been tied in the thread of Yoga, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Nearly all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
In China, the Great All of Hisna was practiced by the people, then on the World Heritage Seete Machu Picchu in Peru, 2400 meters above the sea level, people made Yoga.
People Yoga in the shadow of the Field Tower in France
Programmes were held at 70 places in small places like Singapore and they have launched a campaign throughout the week.
NHAI extracts 10 Stamps of International Yoga Day
Oga session with Oga Masters was organised in NEEDUARTER.
Each one of the worlds diplomats participated in the NHS stadium.
This time again Yoga also worked as World Records
About 55 thousand people in Ahmedabad together made a new world record in Gujarat.
I also got the opportunity to attend the Yoga programme in Lucknow
But for the first time I got the good fortune of doing yoga in the rain
Our soldiers also contributed in Siachen where Minus 20, 25, 40 degrees are tendered.
Whether it is TBP or CRPF or IS everyone has made Yoga a part of its duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations because it was the third International Yoga Day, so I had said that three generations of the family should share their photos while doing yoga together.
Some TC channels also carried forward this thing
Sir, I have a question that in recentrality Kerala we had heard you that we should replace the bouquet as a gentleman on deterrent-diversity platforms.
You had started this thing in your tenure in Gujarat, sir, but now we are not getting to see this much.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a tradition in the government that we will not give bouquet, booke or handloom and handicraft will welcome it.
And Handkerchief of Khadi so that Khadi can also be promoted.
As long as I was in Gujarat, we all had a habit, but after coming here, I lost my habit.
But she went to Kerala, once again she became aware
And I ' ve just started giving information back to the government
We can gradually create a habit.
And the age of bouquet is very low
Once taken in hand, then leave
But if you booke, then in a way it becomes a part of the house and becomes part of the family.
And when I am saying this, how historical is the value of such things
When I went to UK last year, Britain's ueen, ueen Liabeth invited me to dinner.
There was a maternal absorption
He also had food with great love, but later he showed me a small khadi and a handkerchie manufactured with thread in an emotional voice with great respect and he said that when I was married, this handkerchie Mahatma Gandhi sent me to the gift as a good wish for marriage.
How many years have passed, but this handkerchief given by ueen Liabeth by Mahatma Gandhi is kept in hand.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life, became part of his history.
I am confident that these habits do not change overnight and whenever they talk like this, they also have to be criticized.
But despite this, such things should continue to be done, efforts should be made.
Now I cannot say that if I go somewhere and bring a boost, I will refuse it, I will not be able to do this.
But still there will be criticism, but if you keep talking, then gradually improvement will also happen
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister, there are many kinds of work.
But I have developed a habit for me that I read some of the letters that come to me every day and because of that I get an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Various types of letters come, different types of people write letters
These days I got the opportunity to read such a letter, I think I should tell you.
In far-flung south, in Tamil Nadu, a Houswee of Madurai, Arulmozhi Saranan - He sent me a letter.
And what was the letter, he wrote that if I thought of doing something economic activity to keep in mind the education of children in my family, then the family would get some financial help.
So I took money from the money scheme and started some work towards supplies by bringing some goods from the market.
In such a situation, I noticed that the Government of India has created a system called Government-Marketplace.
So I also registrated myself in it. I want to tell the people of the country, if you get the opportunity then you will get the opportunity.
There is a new kind of system
And then he has to order
So those who register within the GM keep looking at the government's departure.
Because there is no intermediary , things are very cheap .
Now this Arulmozhi Madam has made all the registrations of the goods that he can pay on this website of the government.
And the funny thing is that the letter they wrote to me is a big interneting.
This is Emppowerment
This is the opportunity to promote the industry.
Perhaps Aurulmozhi ji had not written a letter to me, I might not have noticed that a housewife is doing a small thing far away from the system of GM, his goods can be purchased to the Prime Minister's Office.
That is the power of the nation .
There is also transparency in it, there is also emphourment in it, there is also an interpretationship.
I would like to add more to those who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way.
I believe that this is the best example of Minimum Government and Maimum Government and what is its goal is Minimum Price and Maimum Ease, Education and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other we can also proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the characteristic of India that if our feet are on the earth associated with yoga, then our dreams are also to cross those horizons of remote heavens.
In the past, India has shown a lot in sports and science.
Today, India is not only on earth but also in space.
Just two days ago, ISR launched 30 Nano Satellites with Artosat-2 series satellites.
And these satellites include about 14 countries in addition to India, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and America.
And this non-satellite campaign of India will help us in the field of farming, in the field of farming, in the field of natural calamities.
And this is the most weightful healthy satellite in the satellite launched by India so far.
And the newspapers of our country compared with the weights of its elephants, so you can imagine how big our scientists have done in space.
A thousand days of Mars Mission have been completed on June 19
You all will know that when we had successfully set up a place in the orbit for Mars Mission, this entire mission was for a period of 6 months.
Our scientific journey to complete a thousand days is an important stop in our space journey.
These days we are also witnessing in the sports that the trend of our youth is increasing.
Now it has been seen that along with studies, our young generations have started showing their future in sports and because of their purity, the country's name is also illuminated due to their achievements.
Recently , India ' s badminton player Kidambi Shrikant has won the Indonesia Open and increased the value of the country
I heartily congratulate him and his coach for this achievement
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to join the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of the Child School of Athletics of Athlete PT Usha Ji.
As much as we promote sports, sports and sportsman sportsperrites.
Sports plays a very important role in the development of personality
The importance of sports is very high in the overall personality development.
There is no shortage of talent in the country
If children are interested in sports in our family too, then they should give opportunity.
Everyone should save dreams for the next limpic
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season, the atmosphere of continuous festivals, in a way the experience of this period is new.
I ' ll once again convey my best wishes to all of you at the time of the next mind ' s talk
We will hardly forget the heat of this year.
But the rain is waiting.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the advent of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my best wishes to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Muslim community, this holy month.
This is such a country that people who believe in God and those who deny God, those who deny God, those who deny idol worship and those who oppose idol worship, every kind of ideology, every kind of worship system, every kind of tradition, every kind of tradition, we have inspired the art of living together.
And after all religions, sects, ideology, traditions, give us this message of peace, unity and goodwill.
It will help in pursuing this path of peace, unity and harmony of the holy month of Ramadan.
I once again congratulate all of you.
I am happy that many people have given me foodback.
Individually everyone showed me the enthusiasm to tell my point.
I have not been able to read everything, I have not been able to hear the message of everyone, so many things have come.
But, even from the surprising sight I have seen someone who has tried to learn music, someone is trying to hand over a new instrument, some people are trying to learn new things using you tubes and trying to learn new languages.
Some people are learning cooking, some are learning dances, some are learning strata, some people have written that we have started writing poems now.
Knowing, living, understanding the nature is trying in that direction.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much struggle India has had to fight, how much sacrifice has to be made, how many freedom fighters spent years in prisons.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who has achieved a lot at a very young age, so I am requesting you to give some messages to the present generation in this regard.
I am happy that the young generation is interested in knowing our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed for this country.
Many years ago I went to Andaman Nicobar.
Cellular went to see the jail.
Today Veer Savarkar ji is born Jayanti.
Veer Savarkar ji had written a Maji Janmatha book in jail.
Poems used to write, write on the walls.
They were closed in a small cell.
What kind of torture the people of freedom would have suffered.
When I read a book from Savarkar ji's mother-in-law, I got the inspiration to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a lift and sound show, it is very inspiring.
There was no state of India, there would be no language speaker of India who had spent the sentence of black water for independence in Andaman jail, in this cellular jail.
Today, the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji is the birth anniversary of the people of every language speaker, every province and every generation.
I would surely tell the young generation of the country how people had suffered the sufferings of the freedom they had suffered, if we had visited Cellular Jail, why was it called black water
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Connect with nature means to nurture the better planet.
And who can tell this better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say several times that one must make a world one will not see, that is, the world we will not see, it is our duty to worry about it too.
If you are tired, open the room windows, open the doors, breathe the fresh air - a new consciousness comes.
A new consciousness appears in our body, a new energy emerges when it comes to touching those five greats.
We all have experienced this, but we don't register it, we don't add it to a thread and a formula.
After this, you must see that whenever you come in contact with the natural condition, a new consciousness will emerge within you and therefore the global campaign to connect with the nature of June 5 should be our own campaign.
Our ancestors have protected the environment, we are getting some benefits of it.
If we protect then our coming generations will benefit.
Earth and environment are considered to be the origin of power in the Vedas.
And Atharvaveda is completely, in a way the biggest guiding scripture of the environment and has been written thousands of years ago.
Motherland is said here: Sons are important separately:
It has been said in the Vedas that the purity that we have is due to our Earth.
Earth is our mother and we are their sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, then one thing is obvious that Mahatma Buddha was born under the three trees, he got the knowledge and his Maha-Parinirvana.
These days I have news from the states.
A very big campaign of plantation runs in almost all the states as rains come.
Plants are planted in crores.
Children of the school are also added, social and service organizations are added, NGs are added, the government itself takes initiatives.
This time we also encourage this work of plantation, contribute in the rainy season.
My dear countrymen, June 21 has become a well-known day for the world.
The whole world celebrates it as World Yoga Day.
This World Yoga Day of June 21 has failed in every corner, connecting people in a very short time.
On the one hand, many powers of scattering in the world are showing their distorted faces, at such a time the world is a great gift of India.
Through yoga, we have added the world to a formula.
As Yoga connects the body, mind, intellect and soul, today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, due to lifestyle, due to temperament, due to rising responsibility, it is becoming difficult to live a stress-free life.
And even at a young age, this situation has reached.
Taking unnatural medicines and passing the day, Yoga's role is important to live a stress-free life in such a clock.
Yoga is the guarantee of both Wellness and Finance.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible to experience that interaction with the body, with the mind, with the thoughts and ideas, how to move a distance of health from practice.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments and all the leaders of the world about Yoga Day.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to yoga, some rewards.
Gradually the work will move forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day and told me that you should appeal that this time three generations of the same family together on the third International Yoga Day.
Whether it is grandparents or grandparents, sons and daughters, all three generations should do yoga together and upload their pictures.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow, there will be a great coincidence that Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that as we had launched a Selfie with augmentor and a very interesting experience.
These three-generation pictures will surely make the picture comfortable for the country and the world.
You must send pictures to me on the Narendra ModiApp, wherever three generations of Yoga perform at MyGov.
Tomorrow, this picture of today and tomorrow will be a guarantee of a beautiful tomorrow.
I invite you all.
We have nearly three weeks for International Yoga Day.
You should also spread the topic of Yoga for three weeks, add people.
In a way, this is the movement of preventive health care.
I invite you all to join it.
These phone calls will also bring you to mind: Pranama Modi ji, I am from Naina Mumbai.
Today, I always see that on Modi ji T. and in social media, people of those areas wherever you go, pay special attention to cleanliness.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission on your call.
The elderly, the children have also got awareness about cleanliness.
Many times they have seen the elders spreading dirt on the road.
There the government machinery works for cleanliness but these days there is a celebration of cleanliness in the society too.
Five days before my departure, seven days ago, ten days ago, there are a lot of cleaning programs.
The media also gives him great importance and I had just visited Kutch a few days back in Gujarat.
There was a very big cleaning campaign.
I did not even see it by adding it.
But when this phone call came, I started thinking and I saw that this thing is correct.
You can imagine how much pleasure I am and how the country is doing these things in a better way.
What will be more happy for me that cleanliness has also been added to my journey.
The rest of the preparations for the Prime Minister's welcome will be the habit of being - but cleanliness will be the main thing.
It is enjoying and inspiring for any cleanliness lover in itself.
I congratulate all those who emphasize this cleanliness work.
Someone suggested me.
Well, that's a funny suggestion.
I don't know if I can do it or not.
Modi ji, while deciding the migration, whoever asks for migration, tell them how will the level of cleanliness be if I have to call
On the basis of how many tons of garbage you will meet me, I will decide my stay.
Dea is very good but I have to think.
How big humanity will work.
One thing I would like to say that we should not believe that this waste is wealth, it is a source.
Don't see it just as garbage.
Once we start accepting this waste as wealth, many new ways of waste management will come to us.
With the help of State Governments, the Government of India has decided to launch a massive campaign of waste management with the help of people representatives of the cities.
On 5th June, on World Environment Day, solid waste and live waste in about 4 thousand cities of the country are going to be available for this kind of benefit.
Two types of garbage will be available, one green color and the other blue color.
Like the waste of kitchen, the skin of vegetables, the remaining food, the peels of eggs, the leaves of trees and plants etc. are all wet wastes and put them in green garbage.
These things are those things that are used in the field, if the color of the field is green and remembered then what to put in the green dustbin will be remembered.
Today, I am proud to recall one thing - if a person takes a decision in mind then how big a mass movement can be created.
The work of cleanliness is similar.
And the way they connected the people of the entire region like a folk culture and transformed into a mass movement, this is an inspirational example in itself.
On the occasion of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Riyasi Block of Jammu and Kashmir has been told that the Riyasi Block Open Defecation Free (Open Defecation Free) has taken place.
I congratulate everyone for this.
And I am told that this entire movement has been leading the highest number of women from the region of Jammu and Kashmir.
He himself drove the torch tours and motivated people from home, streets and streets to spread awareness.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, for the month, continuous news, television channels, social media, 3 years of the present government is undergoing audit.
I see this process as a very healthy sygns.
How has this 3-year tenure been done on every criterion
Every section of the society has done its welfare.
And there is an excellent process in democracy.
And I am obvious that the governments should be accountable in democracy, people should give accountability to their work.
I thank all those who took time and discussed our work deeply, somewhere appreciated, somewhere supported, somewhere earned, somewhere else, somewhere, somewhere else, somewhere else, somewhere else, somewhere else, somewhere else, somewhere else, somewhere else.
Whether it is good, less good, bad, whatever it is, it is learned from it and it is to move forward with the help of it.
Constructive creativity strengthens democracy.
This churning is very important for an aware nation, for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you and as a common citizen, every good thing is influenced by me as it is on the minds of any common citizen.
Someone sees it as a one-sided dialogue, some people also immunize it politically, but after such a long period, I feel that whenever I started talking about my mind, I did not even think.
It seems like I sit in the house in the middle of the family and talk about the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me by writing these things.
I am grateful to the President, the Vice President, the speaker and the people sitting in such a senior position have given this importance to the mind.
In a way, he gave a new dimension to the mind.
When some of our friends were working on the book of this mind, they had also discussed with me.
An artisan who lives in Abu Dhabi, is known as Akbar Saheb. Akbar Saheb proposed from the front that the topics that have been discussed in Mann Ki Baat, they want to prepare their schedule through their arts and to show their love for a single rupee, Akbar Saheb gave the form of a art.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, till the next time we meet, the rains will have come in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the examinations will have come, the beginning of the new life will begin, and as rains come, a new pleasure, a new smell, a new fragrance.
Come, let us all move forward in this environment while loving nature.
My best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
s.
Can this aspect be emphasized on skill development
You run the system, but the three-wheeler system that takes people - has you ever tried to run
Most of the families in every corner of the country will be engaged in their children ' s ease
Those whose ease has ended, there will be a few relevant mentors and where the ease will continue, there will still be a slight increase in those families.
But at such a time, I will say that listen to the things that I have spoken to the students in the last time, you will definitely get the benefit of those things at the time of the examination.
Today is 26th March
26th March is Bangladesh's Independence Day
A historic fight against injustice, unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Banga-Bandhu
And I wish that Bangladesh should move forward, develop, and I assure the Bangladeshis that India is a strong partner of Bangladesh, a good friend and we will continue to contribute in peace, security and development in this entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories and our shared heritage.
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was not only the first Asian person to receive Nobel Prize in 1913 but also the Englishman gave him the title of Knighthood.
And when the British killed Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among the great men who raised their voices and this was the period when a 12-year-old child had a deep impact on the mind.
In the age of adolescence, the murderous massacre of Jallianwala Bagh gave a new inspiration to the child laughing in the fields and slaughter.
And in 1919, the 12-year-old boy Bhagat is the beloved of all of us, inspiration of all of us - Shaheed Bhagat Singh
Three days before today, Bhagat Singh ji and his companions, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know that the incident of March 23 - the satisfaction of serving mother-Bharati on the face of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru - was not afraid of death.
All the dreams of life were contained for the freedom of mother Bharati.
And these three brave men are still inspired by us
We will not be able to decorate the saga of sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words
And the entire British kingdom was afraid of these three young men
The prisoners were locked up, the hanging was fixed, but how to go ahead with them, the British used to worry about it.
And then it was to be hanged on March 24, but it was given on March 23
It was stolen, which is not usually done
And later, by bringing his body to Punjab today, the British had quietly burnt.
Many years ago when I had the opportunity to go there for the first time, I used to experience a kind of vibration in that land.
And I would say to the youth of the country - whenever you get the opportunity, whenever you go to Punjab, you must go to the place of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Dutt's tomb.
This was the period when the glitter of freedom, his intensity, his business was going on increasing.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the youth for the Armed Revolution.
So just a hundred years ago - 10 April, 1917 - Mahatma Gandhi had done Champaran Satyagraha
This Champaran is the centenary year of Satyagraha .
In India's freedom struggle, Gandhi thought and Gandhi style, it was clearly seen in Champaran for the first time.
This was a turning point in the entire movement of freedom, especially in the way of struggle.
This was the period, the satyagraha of Champaran, the strike of mills in Kheda Satyagraha, Ahmedabad, and all this had a deep impact on Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and functioning.
Gandhi came back from abroad in 1915 and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 to inspire the country .
Today, we cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
Just imagine a man who came back to India in 1915, just two years' tenure
Neither did the country know them, nor did they have any effect, yet it was the beginning.
We can imagine how hard they have to face and how hard they have to face at that time.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that in which Mahatma Gandhi's organization skills, Mahatma Gandhi's power to know the nerves of the Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi's behaviour in front of the British Sultanate, to organize, motivate the poor and the illiterate person to struggle, to bring them to the ground for struggle.
And so as we feel Mahatma Gandhi ' s bitterness
But if you think of Gandhi a hundred years ago, Gandhi with that Champaran Satyagraha, then Champaran Satyagraha is a subject of a very study for any person starting public life.
We can learn from them how public life can be started, how much hard work has to be done and how Gandhi did it.
And that was the time when we listen to the names of senior leaders, Gandhi had sent Rajendra Babu at that time, Acharya Kripalani ji, everyone to the villages.
Prisoning on one side, on the other hand spending yourself in creative work
A wonderful balance was in Gandhi's style of functioning.
What is the word Satyagraha, what can be disagreement, what is non-cooperation in front of such a great prince - a complete new vision was established by Gandhi not by words but by a successful experiment.
Today, when we are living in the 21st century, who will not want to change India, who will be the Indian who does not want to be a part of the transformation in the country
India is neither a government program nor a political party, nor is it a project.
India calls for 1. 25 billion countrymen
This is the feeling that 1. 25 billion people want to build a magnificent India together.
There are many people who go to the hospital everyday, help patients
There are many people, they run for blood donation as soon as they know
There are many people, someone is hungry, so they worry about her food
Our country is multiplied
Public service is the Lord-Service, it is in our rugs
If once we look at him as a collective, organised, then how much power is this
If it is a matter of India, then it is very natural to criticize, think and see it from different perspectives and it is inevitable in democracy.
But it is true that if one hundred and twenty-two crore countrymen resolve, decide the path to accomplish the resolution, take one step, then the dream of a new India can be proved in front of our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all these things are from the budget, from the government projects, from the government money.
If every citizen resolves to follow the rules of trick, if every citizen resolves that I will fulfill my responsibility with full sincerity, if every citizen resolves that one day in a week I will not use petrol and diesel in my life.
You will see that this country, which is dreaming of a New India, will be able to see it realised in front of your eyes.
The meaning of saying is that every citizen follows his civil religion, follows duty
So why shouldn't we join Swaraj by disciplining our lives in this journey of Suraj
Let me invite you
My dear countrymen, I also wish to express my gratitude to you today.
In the last few months, there was an atmosphere in our country, a large number of people participated in the Digital Payments Digital movement.
How can we be dealt with without cash, its curiosity has also increased, poor people are also trying to learn from the poor and gradually people are moving forward towards it.
Since the demonetization ban, there has been considerable increase in different ways of digital payment.
My dear countrymen, we have to move forward the fight against black money and corruption.
Can 1. 25 billion countrymen resolve to work for digital transactions in this one year
We have announced in the budget
We can do this in everyday life
You don't have imagination but you can serve the country a lot and you can become a brave soldier for fighting against black money and corruption.
Several programmes of Digidhan Mela have been organized for public education and public awareness in the past.
There is a resolve to do 100 programmes across the country
80-85 programmes have been completed
There was also a reward scheme .
About twelve and a half million people have received this reward from the consumer .
Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary on 14th April
And as it was decided earlier, on 14th April, this Digi-Mela will be concluded on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Soon after a hundred days , a final event will be held .
There ' s also a provision for very large drawings .
We should contribute ourselves in how cash should be reduced, how the behavior of notes should be reduced.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time I ask for suggestions from the people, there are several suggestions.
But I ' ve seen that there ' s always insistence on cleanliness .
A bitia called Gayatri from Dehradun, who is a student of 11th, has sent a message by phone: - Excellent Principal, Prime Minister, greetings to you.
First of all , I congratulate you that you have won this election with heavy votes .
I want to talk to you about my mind
I want to say that people have to explain how much cleanliness is needed
I go through that river every day, in which people put too much garbage and contaminate rivers
The river flows through Rispana bridge and also comes to my house
For this river we went to the settlements and also took out a rally and interacted with the people, but there was no benefit.
I want to tell you that by sending a team of myself or through Newspaper, thank you.
See, brothers and sisters, how much pain is the daughter of class 11th
How angry is she looking at the garbage in that river
I consider it a good sign .
This is what I want to create anger in the minds of 1. 25 billion people.
Once there will be anger, anger will arise, anger will arise against it, we will start doing something against dirt.
And it is a good thing that Gayatri is also expressing his anger, giving suggestions to me, but at the same time he is also saying that he made a lot of efforts but failed.
He has also taken the form of a movement .
The denial of the evil is increasing .
Be awareness, active participation, movement, it has its own importance.
But hygiene is addicted to movement .
Work is difficult, but I have to do it
I am confident that in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students and in the youth, this feeling that has awakened in itself indicates good results.
Whatever Gayatri is listening to today's mind, I would like to tell all the countrymen that the message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I am talking about the programme, many suggestions have been given to me since the beginning and most people have expressed concern about food waste.
They don't even fill the stomach and then leave it there.
You have never thought of how much waste we do from the lips we leave.
Have you ever thought that if you don't leave the lips, then how many poor people can afford it.
The topic is not that those who have to explain.
However, when mother serves small children in our family, she says that as much as you can eat, take it as much as I can.
Some efforts are being made, but yet indifference on this subject is a social treason.
Injustice to the poor
Secondly, if there is savings, then the family also has financial benefits.
Think for the society, it is a good thing, but this topic is that the family also has the benefit of the family.
I am not insisting on this subject, but I would like that this awareness should be increased.
You will find such people somewhere in every state of India.
Their lives can also inspire us not to liberate.
We take as much food as I have.
See, these are the ways for change.
And those who are aware of the health of the body always say - keep the stomach slightly open, keep the plate slightly open.
And when it comes to health, the World Health Day is on 7th April, World Health Day.
The United Nations has set a target of health for all by 2030.
We are also familiar with the word Depression, but if we have to make a literal sense then some people also call it depression.
One estimate is that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally suffering from depression.
The problem is that we cannot understand this thing even around us and perhaps we are hesitant to talk about it openly.
Those who feel depression themselves don't speak anything because they feel slightly embarrassed.
I would like to tell the countrymen that expression is not such that it cannot be liberated from it.
A psychological atmosphere has to be created and it starts.
The first mantra is that it requires an expression rather than an expression of expression.
What is happening to you, among your colleagues, among friends, among your parents, among your brothers and teachers
Sometimes only oneness, especially children living in hostels, gets more trouble.
Everyone in the house is going out somewhere and says - No, I don't want to come today - I like to stay alone.
Have you ever noticed why it does
You must assume that it is the first step towards emergence.
If he does not like to live in the group, is going to one corner alone, then try not to let it happen.
Give him the opportunity to live in the middle with those people who speak openly with him.
Entrepreneurs should inspire him to express his smiles and expel what has been said inside him.
This is the best way .
And depression becomes the reason for mental and physical diseases
As iabetes becomes a source of all kinds of diseases, efficiency also destroys all our capabilities, fighting, boldness and decision making.
Your friends, your family, your campus and your environment - they can also stop you from going to the depression and then bring you out.
Another way is II
Help me, share their happiness and sorrow, you see, the pain within you will be lost.
If you try to understand their griefs, do service, you will have a new self-confidence within you.
By connecting with others, by serving someone, and by selflessly serving, you can easily lighten the burden of your mind.
Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
Yoga helps a lot in elimination of stress, elimination of stress and progress towards a happy mind.
21st June is International Day of Yoga
This will be the third year.
If there is any suggestion in your mind about the third International Yoga Day, then you must send your suggestions through my mobile application, guide me.
Whatever songs and poetic compositions you can create, it should be done so that people can easily understand it.
I would like to talk to my mothers and sisters today because today there has been a lot of talk of health and health.
So, in the past, the Government of India has made a major decision.
The workplace women in our country, those women in the working class and their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and they are welcome but women also have special responsibility.
The Government of India has taken a very big decision.
These working classes are women who get 12 weeks before delivery, during pregnancy, during delivery, maternity leave, now 26 weeks will be given.
There are probably two or three countries in the world which are ahead of us.
India has taken a very important decision for our sisters.
And its original objective is to take care of the newborn, the future citizen of India, the proper care of her in the early stages of birth, if she gets a lot of love from her mother, then these children will grow up and become the country's trust.
The health of mothers will also be good and therefore this is a very important decision.
And this will benefit about 18 lakh women working in the local sector.
My dear countrymen, the holy festival of Ramnavami on 5th April is Mahavir Jayanti on 9th April, Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary on 14th April.
The life of all these great men continues to inspire us and empower us to resolve for a New India.
After two days, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, Nav Sanvatsar, best wishes to you all for this new year.
This is the time when the fruits begin to cook after spring and the farmers get the fruit of their hard work.
This new year is celebrated in different corners of our country in different forms.
In Maharashtra, Gudi-Padwa, Andhra-Karnataka as a New Year, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Sanvatsar Puja in Awadh, Twin-Seetal in Bihar's Mithila and Satwani festival in Magadh is held on New Year.
India is a country full of so many varieties.
Winter season is now to go
The spring season has knocked us all in our life .
After the fall , new leaves start coming in the trees .
Flowers bloom
Gardens are green .
The chirping of the birds feels the heart .
Not only flowers, fruits are also seen shining in sunlight on tree branches
The summer fruits of mango are seen in spring .
At the same time, the yellow flowers of mustard bind the farmers in the fields
The minute flower of the tasu or palash indicates the coming of the Holi .
Amir Khusro describes the moments of this change of weather very fun .
Festival of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi cultivates the color of happiness in human life
In the atmosphere overwhelmed by love, brotherhood, humanity, we are going to leave Falgun in the last month and are ready to welcome new monthly chaitra.
And thou art a coincidence of these two months .
First of all, I express my gratitude to millions of citizens of the country for this thing that when I ask for suggestions, there are many suggestions.
On Narendra ModiApp, on Twitter, Facebook, by post, I am grateful to everyone for this.
And so he said that I will give some information about the launch and interceptor missils of 104 satellites.
Shobha ji, you have remembered the example of India's pride.
Whether it is to deal with poverty, to avoid diseases, to connect with the world, to provide knowledge and information - technology has recorded its place.
15th February, 2017 is a glorious day in Indias life.
Our scientists have proudly raised the head of India in front of the world
The SER has successfully launched 104 satellites in search of various countries including USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE and India through the Mega Mission.
India became the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together.
And it is also a matter of great happiness that it is a successful launch of 38th PSU
For SER, it is a historic achievement for the entire India.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is very important - ArtOsat 2 - this is Indias satellite and it will help in enhancing its photographs, resources, mapping, infrastructure, development assessment, Urban development.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, how much water resources in the country can be used, what should be taken care of, it will help our new satellite artosat-2 on all these topics.
Our satellite has sent some photos as soon as they go.
He has started his work
It is also a matter of great happiness for us that all this campaign has been led by our young scientists and our women scientists.
Such strong participation of youth and women is a very glorious aspect in the success of ISR.
I congratulate the scientists of ISR on behalf of the countrymen.
For the general public, for the service of the nation, for the sake of bringing inner science, they have always maintained their objectives and they are constantly creating new records.
The more we congratulate our scientists, their entire team, the less.
Shobha ji has asked another question and that is India's security
India has achieved a very great achievement about it.
This has not been discussed yet, but Shobha ji has taken care of this important thing.
This mission with interception technology has achieved success by placing the enemy's miracle at a height of about 100 kilometers from the ground during its trip.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security
And you will be happy to know that there are only four or five countries in the world who have this pride.
When we see new technology, there is a new scientific proverb, we are happy to see it.
And curiosity has played a very important role in the development journey of human life
And those who have a unique intellectual talent, they not only allow curiosity to live in the form of curiosity, they also raise questions within them, find new questions and create new questions.
And that curiosity becomes the reason for new search.
They don't sit quiet until they get the answer
And if we look at the development journey of thousands of years of human life, we can say that this development journey of human life is no longer a complete break.
Complete rest is impossible
The universe, the rules of creation, the effort to know the mind of man continues.
New science, new technology is born from that.
And every technology, every new science gives birth to a new age.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said that our young generation should increase the attraction towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists
Today ' s scientists cause a permanent change in the life of generations in the coming years .
In the past, the Policy Commission and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a large universe competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Social useful innovation was invented
Sometimes the problem also shows the importance of science to solve.
It means that people of this kind of role are very much in society, in the country.
And our society is also becoming technology-driven
Systems are becoming technology driven
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the past, big emphasis is being seen on digitization
Gradually, people are moving out of cash towards digital currency.
Digital Translation is also growing rapidly in India.
In our country, Lucky Customer Plan, Digi-Dhan Business Scheme has received huge support in the past.
About two months have passed, 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And it is a matter of great happiness that so far 10 lakh people have been rewarded under the Digi-Dhan Yojana, more than 50 thousand traders have been rewarded and more than 1.
Under this scheme, more than 100 customers have received a reward of Rs. 1 lakh.
More than four thousand traders are those who have received rewards of fifty-five thousand rupees.
Be it farmers, businessmen, small entrepreneurs, professionals, domestic women, students, everyone is taking part in it and they are also benefiting from it.
When I asked her analysis, brothers and sisters, I am glad that there are 15-year-old people who get the rewards, then there are also seventy-seven years old people.
Shriman Santosh ji has expressed his happiness at NarendraModiApp that he received a thousand rupees reward under the Lucky Customer Plan.
Now they run the cars, but in a way they have become ambassadors of this scheme.
All the moneylenders keep giving information about digital payments.
I am very enthusiastic to tell you and encourage others.
I would like to urge the people of the country, especially the youth of the country and the people of the country to make the scheme of this Lucky Customers, either the Digi-Dhan Trade Scheme - the reward they have received.
You should lead this movement.
You should take this forward and this work is a big role in the fight against corruption and black money in a way.
I am confident that everybody associated with this work has a new anti-corruption centre in the country.
In a way, you are a soldier of purity.
You know that the Lucky Customer Plan - 100 days will be completed when I
On 14th April is the festival of birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
On 14th April, a very large amount of rupees will be drawn.
About forty-twelve days are yet to be left.
Can you do one thing while remembering Babasaheb Ambedkar
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary has now taken place.
This time Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary and BI
M. App, give special importance to this and therefore I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation laid by Dr. Baba Saheb.
We have to reach BIM App by adding everyone to 125 crore hands.
The impact of the movement that has been going on for the last two-three months is that many townships, several villages and many cities have achieved a lot of success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture is a major contributor to the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village gives strength to the economic pace of the country.
I want to tell you a very happy thing today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard and filled the food storage.
The work of farmers in our country has resulted in the production of record foodgrains this year.
All the signs are saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time there is a wave in the fields, every day, like Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
The last record of our farmers was recorded is more than 8.
So this is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I especially like to thank the farmers of the country.
I am happy that the farmers of my country listened to the voice of the poor and cultivated various pulses on almost two hundred and ninety lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service of the poor people of my country by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters are specially thankful to the way my farmers of my country have worked hard on their heads and eyes and produced the record of pulses.
My dear countrymen, this is going on in our country, by the government, by the society, by the institutions, by the organizations, by everybody, in this direction of cleanliness.
In a way, everybody is seen behaving aware about cleanliness in some form.
The government is constantly making efforts.
In the past, a programme of senior officials of 23 State Governments led by our Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, was held in Telangana.
And not only in the closed room in Warangal, Telangana state, what is the significance of direct cleanliness
Toilet Pit Empting Exercise organised in Hyderabad on 17-18 February
It was cleaned by opening toilet pits of six houses and officials themselves showed that the twin pits used by the toilet can be opened and used again.
He also showed how comfortable the toilets of the new technology and there is no inconvenience in sanitation, there is no hesitation, which is psychological barrier.
And we can also clean a toilet pit and clean the pit.
And the result of this endeavour was that the media of the country also promoted it a lot, gave it importance and it is natural when an I
If the AS officer himself cleans the toilet pit then it is very natural to take care of the country.
And this is the toilet pit which you consider as garbage and waste but it is in a way black gold.
We can see what wealth is from waste.
And it has been proved .
For a six-member family, a standard twin Pit Toilet - this mode is filled in almost five years.
After this, the waste can be easily removed and redirected to another pit.
In six to twelve months, the garbage deposited in the pit completely decomposes.
It is very safe to handle the decomposed waste and is extremely important fertilizer from the point of view of fertilizer NPK
Farmers are well-known from NPK.
Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassim - It is full of nutrients and it is considered to be an excellent manure in agriculture.
The manner in which the government has taken these initiatives, others have also done such experiments.
And now there is a special programme of cleanliness news in Doordarshan
The more such things will be exposed, the more will be the benefits.
In the government, different departments celebrate Swachhta Pakhwada Regulations.
In the first fortnight of March, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Ministry of Development of Tribal Affairs along with them are going to strengthen the cleanliness drive.
And in the second fortnight of March and two ministries - Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Water Resources, Review Development and Ganga Rejuvenation - these ministries are also going to take forward the last two weeks of cleanliness campaign of March.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does something good, the whole country experiences a new energy, increases self-confidence.
We all welcomed the demonstration of our divine players in Rio Paralleympics.
In the Winal of the Blind T20 World Cup held this month, India has enhanced the pride of the country by becoming a World Champion for the second consecutive time by defeating Pakistan.
I once again congratulate all the team players
The country is proud of the achievements of these Divyang colleagues.
I always believe that Divya brothers and sisters are strong, determined, brave and determined.
Every moment we can learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science - women of our country are not behind anyone.
They are steadfastly moving forward and illuminating the name of the country with their achievements .
In the last few days, Asian Ruggy Sevens Trophy won the Silver Medal by our female players.
I congratulate all those players
World Women's Day celebrates on 8th March
In India too, giving importance to daughters, awareness about them in family and society increased, sensitivity increased
Beti Bachao Beti Teache this movement is progressing at a fast pace
Today it ' s not just a government program
This has become a social sensitivity campaign for public education.
During the last two years, this program has linked the common man, has compelled people to think on this burning issue in every corner of the country and has brought about a change in the thinking of people towards old customs that have been going on for years.
When news is found that the festival was celebrated on the birth of the daughter, so much enjoys.
In a way , positive thinking towards daughters is becoming a cause of social acceptance .
I have heard that the Uddalore district of Tamil Nadu has banned child marriage under a special campaign.
More than 175 child marriages have been stopped so far
District Administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand daughters under Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojna and along with orphaned girls adopted by the district administration, their education is being made.
A campaign is being launched for the education of rural and rural daughters under every house knock programme in Madhya Pradesh.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to re-recruit the girls who had been drop-out by running their children and their school campaign.
The meaning of saying is that Beti Bachao Beti Padhao this movement has also taken several forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement
New-new imaginations are associated with him.
He has been turned as per local requirements
You are also actively associated with
I get to know a lot from you
What is happening on earth, what is happening in the minds of the village and the poor reaches me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your contribution
Tomorrow, Shri Krishna Janma Mahotsav was celebrated across India
Someone can imagine how personality will be, even after thousands of years, every festival brings innovation, brings new inspiration, brings new energy and thousands of years old life is such that even today, which can give examples to solve problems, inspiration, every person can find solutions to the problems of the present life of Shri Krishna.
Sometimes to pick up the rock, sometimes to pick up the leaf of food, that is, every thing feels a newness and therefore, today, whenever I am talking to you, I pay my attention to two Mohans.
One Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, then the other Charkhadhari Mohan
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, leaving the banks of the Yamuna, went to the sea coast in Gujarat, stabilised in the city of Dwarka and came to the banks of the Yamuna and breathed his last in Delhi.
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan had used a lot of contemplation of his intellect, his power and his contemplation to avoid the war, thousands of years ago, and Chakradhari Mohan also chose such a path for freedom, for the protection of human values, for the conservation of the basic elements of personality - for this, the war of freedom has been turned into a way that is strange for the whole world today.
Whether it is the importance of selfless service, whether it is the importance of knowledge or the importance of moving ahead smiling in the midst of all the ups and downs in life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna and therefore it is also known as Shri Krishna, Jagatguru.
Today, when we are discussing the festivals, India is preparing for another big festival and it is discussed not only in India but also in the whole world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He served those farmers who were being distinguished in Champaran, who served the mill laborers who were not being given proper wages, who considered the service of poor, destitute, weak and hungry people as the ultimate duty of their lives.
Whenever anyone, wherever needed, Mahatma Gandhi was always present for service.
He not only emphasized the service but also emphasized the self-sufficiency associated with it.
The meaning of the word service is that it should be done with joy - service Paramo Dharma :
But, as well as excellent joy, comfort: The experience of this feeling is also inherent in service.
We can understand this well from Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, individuals and society, humanity and humanity, this was everything.
Whether it is Phoeni Farm in Africa or Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, everywhere, in a unique style, they have always been emphasized on social development community mobility.
It has been my privilege that I have got the opportunity to bow down to several important places related to the goddess Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi used to emphasize the organization-synergy with service.
Social service and socio-economic service and community mobility is the spirit that we have to bring in our practical life.
In true sense, this is a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, a true workmanship.
No countrymen
and collectiveness has its own strength
This whole, in the programmes of Gandhi 150, there should be collectiveness and service.
Our ladies are club
The work done by the modern times of the Ladies Club will continue to be done, but all the schemes of the Ladies Club will work together.
You can do a lot
Build books, share the old and the poor, spread knowledge and I believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen have 130 crore imaginations and 130 crore ventures.
There is no limit that has come in mind - just a goodwill, a goodwill, a goodwill, a goodwill and a service of full dedication and that too, a free pleasure: - a unique pleasure.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha, Dandi is a very important turning point in the freedom movement.
In Dandi, I inaugurated a very modern museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
The feelings arising out of your minds may be more powerful than any great literature, and may be more relevant in today's time, in your eyes, in the form of a donkey written by your pen, perhaps even more relevant.
Several programs, competitions, exhibitions have also been planned in the coming days.
But in this context one thing is very interesting that I want to share with you
Haripura Panels were specially interesting in this
You will remember that the Congress session was held in Haripura, Gujarat, where the incident of Subhash Chandra Bose's Presidential election is recorded in history.
These Art Panels have a very beautiful past
Mahatma Gandhi invited the then Principal Nand Lal Bose of Shanti Niketan Art Bhawan in 1937-38 before the Haripura session of Congress
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and showcase this work during the session.
This is the same Nand Lal Bose whose Art work enhances the beauty of our Constitution
gives a new identity to the Constitution
And his artwork has made Nand Lal Bose immortal along with the Constitution.
Nand Lal Bose visited the villages around Haripura and finally made some art canvas showing the lives of rural India.
There was tremendous discussion in the engagement of this precious artist
Once again, with the greetings of Gandhi Ji on the 150th birth anniversary, some or the other resolution from every Indian, I expect.
For the country, for the society, something else should be done.
This will be good, true, authentic workforce for Bapu
Mother Bharati's sons, you will remember that in the last few years, we run the Swachhata Hi Seva Abhiyan across the country for nearly 2 weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will start from 11th September
During this, we will come out of our houses and work towards Mahatma Gandhi through labour.
Whether it is home or streets, square-square or drains, schools, colleges to run a great campaign for cleanliness at all public places.
Similarly, we have to finish the single use plastic items together.
This will also save money and they will also be able to contribute to the protection of the environment
This time, when Bapu's 150th birth anniversary will be celebrated on 2nd October, we will not only dedicate him to open defecation free India but will also lay the foundation stone for a new mass movement against plastic throughout the country.
Celebrate 2nd October as Special Day
I also appeal to the corporate sector to come forward for proper disposal of all these plastic wastes when they are collected.
It can be recycled
It can be made fuel
Thus, to this Diwali, we can also work for safe settlement of this plastic waste.
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhashit is a kind of knowledge gem.
We can get what we need in life .
These days my contact has become very low , but my contact was very first .
Stupid people call stone as gems .
Our culture is very glorious of food .
Until We have turned the knowledge of food into science .
Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, especially for women and infants, because it is the foundation of the future of our society.
Nutrition is being made public movement through modern scientific methods across the country under the nutrition campaign.
People are fighting malnutrition in new and interesting ways
Sometimes one thing was brought in my mind
And within Nashik is a great movement .
In it , in the days of harvesting , Anganwadi servants gather a hard grain from the people .
This grain is used to make hot food for children and women
In this the donor becomes a kind of aware civil society servant .
After this he himself is dedicated to this goal and becomes a soldier of that movement .
We all heard about food processing in every corner of India .
This ritual is done when the child starts feeding solid food for the first time .
iwood not solid food
Gujarat thought in 2010 why children should be given complications on the occasion of food processing so that people can be aware of it.
This is a very magnificent initiative that can be adopted everywhere.
In many states people run the date food campaign
If there is a birthday in the family, a good day, a memory day, then the family members go to Anganwadi to make nutritious food and tasty food, go to schools and the family members serve children themselves, feed them.
They also share their joy and express their happiness .
A wonderful union of service and joy is seen .
Friends, There are several small things that our country can fight an effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, in the absence of awareness, both poor and rich families are affected by malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as Nutrition Campaign across the country
You must join it, get information, add something new, you also contribute.
If you bring one person out of malnutrition also means we bring the country out of malnutrition
This time, when I was thinking about the matter of mind, I was sure that there would be a lot of questions in this regard and the same thing happened and in the last few weeks wherever I met the people, the men vs.
With this episode, I have not only joined Hindustan but also the youth around the world. I had never thought that this way my place would be made in young hearts.
I never thought of how many diverse things our country and the youth of the world pay attention to .
I never thought that there would be a chance in my life to touch the heart of the young people around the world .
And what would happen
Just last week I went to Bhutan
I have seen that as the Prime Minister, from wherever I got the opportunity to go and because of International Yoga Day, the situation has become such that if someone who goes to the world, some or the other five-seven minutes then they ask me about Yoga.
There will hardly be a big leader in the world who has not discussed with me about Yoga and has experienced me all over the world .
But there ' s a new experience in these days
Anyone who gets the opportunity to talk, he talks about Wildlife, discusses about the Environment.
Tiger, ion, biology and I am surprised how much people are interested.
Eiscovery has planned to broadcast this program in 165 countries in their language .
I am confident that this programme will help in introducing the world with the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity towards nature in the sacramental journey of India, this episody of this episode will be very helpful and now people want to know the steps taken towards clean justice and clean environment in our country.
But one more interesting thing is that some people also ask me one thing with hesitation that Modi ji tell us that you were speaking Hindi and if you don't know Hindi, then how would it be between you so fast
What ' s this updated later
This has been shooting so frequently.
They ask with great curiosity .
Look, there's no secret in it.
Reality is that technology was used a lot in conversation with Bear Grills.
So I used to say Hindi but it used to be heard English and because of that the dialogue would be very easy and this is a wonderful technology
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing about Jim Corbett, National Park.
You must also visit places related to Natural and Wild Life Nature and Life.
I have said before, I say that you must go North-East in your life.
will expand inside you
The country filled with diversity will also fill you with diversity from within as a teacher.
Last month I had the good fortune to release Tiger Consensus in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
The tiger population in India is 2967
a few years ago we were even harder than half
In 2010, Tiger Summit was held in South Petersburg, Russia.
It took a resolution expressing concern over the decreasing number of tigers in the world
This resolution was to double the number of tigers all over the world by Twenty Twenty Two 2022
We doubled the number of Tigers here in 2019
Not only the number of tigers in India but also the number of protected areas and community reservations has increased.
When I was releasing the data of tigers, I also remembered the lion of Gir in Gujarat.
When I took charge of the Chief Minister there, the hubbit of lions was shrinking in the forests of Gir.
their number was decreasing
We took several steps after one in Gir
In 2007, it decided to deploy women guards.
Improvements in infrastructure to enhance tourism
Whenever we talk of nature and wildlife then only we talk about conservation.
But now we have to move ahead with conservation and think about compassion.
Our scriptures also have great guidance in this regard .
Therefore, we need to not only preserve our forests, plants and wildlife, but also create an environment that they can flourish properly.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda ji on September 11, 1893.
This young sannyasi of India, who shouted the human race of the whole world, left a stunning identity of India within the world.
The words of the great man like Swami Vivekananda, 1893, the world, which was looking at India with a very distorted sense, forced the world to change the view of looking at India.
Come, Swami Vivekananda ji who had seen the form of India had to go to the power of India.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that on August 29, the nation is celebrated as Sports Day.
This will be a big entertainment campaign for all children, elderly, young and women and it will be yours.
But I ' m not going to tell her nuances today
I want to make you aware of itness and set some targets for the country for India.
My dear countrymen, I will be waiting for you on August 29 in India.
Come, let's go with a new ambition, a new resolve, a new power.
My dear countrymen, today you will get the same thing in mind.
I'll wait for your words, your suggestions
Let us all go together to fulfill Gandhi's dreams to make India the dreams of freedom fighters:
Please move inwards expressing joy in service
My dear countrymen, greet you all.
On 26th January, our Republic Day was celebrated with zeal and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, in a way it is also a festival of rituals that makes the future generations aware of democracy, even aware of democratic responsibilities.
But in our country, the duties of citizens and the rights of citizens should be debated as deeply as it should be debated, as much as it should be discussed in a comprehensive manner.
I hope that at every level, at every time, the more emphasis is given on rights, the more emphasis should be given on duties.
On two tracks of rights and duties, the vehicle of democracy of India can move forward at a fast pace.
Yesterday is 30th January, our deity is Bapu's virtue date.
On January 30, we all pay homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country by keeping them silent at 11 am and 2 minutes.
As a society, as a country, on January 30, at 11, 2 minutes of tribute, it should become a simple nature.
Why not be it 2 minutes, but it also expresses collectiveness, determination and reverence to the martyrs.
In our country, there is a simplicity of respect for the army and the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers who were honored with various bravery awards, their family members.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal - many categories.
When we know deeply about their courage, valour and valour, then we are surprised and proud and inspired.
On the one hand, we all were happy with the news of the emergence and enthusiasm of January 26, at the same time, the soldiers of our army who are engaged in the defense of the country in Kashmir have achieved bravery due to avalanches.
I pay my homage to all these brave soldiers and bow down.
My young friends, you know very well that I keep talking about my mind continuously.
January, February, March, April - These are the months of criteria in every family, every month.
There are one and half to two children in the house, but the entire family is buried under the weight of ease.
So I realized that this is the right time when I talk to the students friends, talk to their administrators, talk to their teachers, because for many years, wherever I went, I got the reason for a great problem.
Families are disturbed, students are disturbed, teachers are disturbed, a very strange psychological environment is seen in every house.
And I have always felt that I should come out of it and that is why I want to talk to my young friends in detail today.
I got a telephone message from the world.
So I want to ask you so much that this environment cannot be happy
Well, the question has been asked by the world, but this question will be in your mind.
The examination should be an opportunity of happiness in itself.
We have worked hard throughout the year, now the opportunity to tell is that this festival should be a festival of enthusiasm.
There are very few people for whom there is a pleasure in the eam, the eam is a presumption for most of the people.
You have to decide that you will consider it as a presumption.
The person who accepts the pleasure will be able to regret those who accept the presumption.
And therefore, I believe that the examination is a festival, take the examination as if it is a festival.
And when the festival takes place, whatever is best within us comes out.
The power of society is also experienced during the festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
We should also create an atmosphere of festival between the family and friends and the neighborhood.
You see, this profession will be converted to pleasure.
Festival environment will make the burden free.
And I urge my parents to create an environment for these three-four months.
The right thing is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these three-four months of examinations are conducted.
It is the responsibility of all of us to transform these three-four months every year by taking their traditions and by taking the environment of their families.
And you must have seen that when you are happy, you smile, you find rela yourself, you are easily relaxed and when you are relaxed, you can easily remember your years old things.
A year ago, what Teacher said in classroom, the entire scene is remembered.
And you should know that the power to recall the memory is the highest in the revolution.
If you are in tension, then all the doors are closed, not inside, not inside.
There is a stagnation in the idea process, it becomes a burden in itself.
You were the only one who didn't tell me.
But what was inside, immediately came out and came out because you became rela.
Therefore, if there is one of the biggest medicines to recall the memory then it is a relief.
And I tell my feelings that if we have a pressure, we forget our things and rela, then we can never imagine.
But when there is tension then your knowledge, your knowledge, your information gets pressed down and your tension gets rid of it.
And that is why it is necessary that a happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.
It seems that it is a question of life and death.
The eam you are going to give is the eam that you have studied throughout the year.
This is not the criterion of your life.
How you live, how you live, how you want to live and how you want to live.
In your life, there would have been opportunities to pass through several criteria other than the examination given by classroom and notebook.
Therefore, the examination has to be done with the success of life and get rid of such a burden.
They went to the Air Force and became affiliated.
Assume that if they were disappointed due to that failure, lost their lives, would India get such a big scientist, wouldn't they get such a big president
The points have become the most important.
Because of this, the competition has increased very much, as well as the tension among the students has increased very much.
So I would like to be aware of your ideas about this present direction of education and its future.
By the way, he himself has answered, but Cha wants me to keep something in it.
Marks and marks sheets are a limited use.
That's not what happens in life.
Life goes on how much knowledge you have earned.
Whether you have tried to live what you have to go
Whether there is a synergy between your mission and ambition that you have got a sense of mission and your sense of combition
If you trust these things then you will come back after asking the marks and you will never need to run behind the marks.
You are going to work in life, skills are going to work, self-confidence is going to work and will power is going to work.
You should tell me that there will be a doctor from your family and all the family members will have to go to them and they are a family doctor.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a bigger case, do you see the marks sheet of that lawyer
You see his experience, his knowledge and his journey of success.
And that is why the number of points that they are burdened sometimes stop us from going right direction.
But this does not mean that I just say that it is not just to read.
It needs to be used for your criteria.
I was yesterday, where I am today, it is necessary to know.
But if you focus on marks, then you gradually shrink yourself and limit yourself to a certain area to get only marks.
It may be that in spite of being influential in the ease, sometimes they fail in life.
Cha ji, one thing has also said that competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
Most successful players have a characteristic of their lives that they compete.
If we take the example of Shriman Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Breaking your own record for twenty years, defeating yourself every time and moving forward.
His great amazing life journey is because he adopted the path of competition more than competition.
Friends in every field of life and when you are going to give the eam, would you be able to do it for three hours if you were able to read for two hours in peace
From inside, that energy is born automatically.
If you are better then you will be careless, you will be filled with great faith.
If you trick against him, you will be sad and disappointed, you will be filled with jealousy, the jealousy that will eat you, yourself and if you are equal then you will never feel the need for improvement.
Just focus on what I had done before and how I will do well.
You see, you will feel a lot of change.
Shri S. Sunder ji has expressed his feelings on the role of parents.
They say that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
She further wrote that my mother was not read-written, yet she used to sit with me and asked me to solve the questions of mathematics.
Once you will learn to access, the maximum problem will end.
Acceptance opens ways to solve problems.
The expectations make the road difficult.
Accepting the situation, gives an opportunity to open new paths and therefore access whatever is there.
You will also be free of burden.
If one of our familiar persons was in hospital due to heart attack, then before the Lok Sabha of our country, Speaker Ganesh Dada Mavalankar, his son Purushottam Mavalankar, he was also MP, he came to see his health.
I was present at that time and I saw that they did not come and ask any questions regarding their health.
As soon as he sits and comes, what is the situation, what is the disease, no things, he started shouting and in the first two-four minutes he made such an atmosphere light.
By going to a sick person in a way, like we fear the disease.
I would like to tell the parents, sometimes we do the same with the children.
Did you ever feel that in the days of ease, give the children an atmosphere of laughter and happiness
You see, the atmosphere will change.
I have received a phone call of a great marvel.
They do not want to tell Sajjan their name.
After hearing the phone, you will know why they do not want to tell their names
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I cannot tell my name because I had done something like this in my childhood.
I had tried to copy once in my childhood, I started preparing a lot to find out how I could copy and how many times I was wasted.
In that time I could also read the number as much as I spent in using the brain to copy.
And when I tried to duplicate and pass, I was caught in it and because of me many friends around me had a lot of trouble.
Your point is right.
These are the short-cut paths which become reasons for copying.
So cash never benefits.
Copies make you bad, so do not copy.
You must have heard it again and again that do not copy or do not copy.
I'm telling you the same thing again.
And once there was a habit of copying, there would never be any desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you be
If you give the same creativity on the issues of your eam, then perhaps it is not necessary to copy it.
The self-confidence that will be achieved by your own hard work will be wonderful.
This basic notion is wrong, it is the root cause of the problem.
If we have to develop integrally, then there is a life outside the books and it is very large.
This is the time to learn to live.
Someone says that I will complete all the examinations first and play later, then I will do this later, it is impossible.
Have you ever thought that when all this is in front of you, you will come out for two moments in the sky, look at the trees and plants, lighten your mind, you will see, with a freshness, you will come back to your room and your books.
Whatever you are doing, take a break, get up and go out, go to the kitchen, find something like yourself, find something like yourself, get a biscuit of your choice.
Even if you don't have five minutes, but give your break.
You will feel that your work is becoming simple.
Everyone likes it or not, I do not know, but I have experience.
There is no need to stay in a room to breathe deeply.
If you come under the open sky, go to the roof, take a deep breath of five minutes and then sit down for your reading then you will see that the body will be relaxed and the relaxation of the body will not be felt by you, nor will it relax the brain organs.
When I hold meetings in the election, sometimes my voice is sitting.
So I came to meet a folk singer.
They asked me how long you sleep.
I said - Why brother, are you doctor
No, no, no, it is related to your voice which is disturbed while speaking during the election.
If you take full sleep then your local card will get complete rest.
Now I had never thought of sleep and my speech and my voice, they gave me a herb.
So we really understand the importance of these things, you see, you will be benefitted.
But this does not mean that just keep sleeping but some will say that the Prime Minister has said that there is no need to wake up now.
So don't do this, otherwise your family will be angry with me.
And if your marks sheets come on the day you will not see them, I will see them.
So don't do that.
And that is why I will say that this is a very big medicine to keep in mind, mind and intellect and body wary of the players who play and play.
Well, young friends, you're preparing for the exam and I'm tied to your mind.
It may be that today's things will also work for you.
If you can do it, do not do it, otherwise it will also become a burden.
So as I advise your parents not to be burdened, they apply to me too.
To get across every criterion, make the criterion a festival.
Then there will never be criteria, criterion.
Go ahead with this mantra.
On this occasion, I thank all officers and jawans of the East Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the East Guard has made its place amongst all its 126 ships and 62 airports in the country and the world's 4 largest East Guard.
Reflecting this ideal sentence, the young people of the East Guard are also ready in adverse circumstances to protect the maritime boundaries and maritime environment of the country.
And very few people will know that there are not only men in the East Guard in our country, women are also working together with their shoulders and working successfully.
Our women of East Guard are Pilots, be it beers and beservers, they also take charge of the overcraft.
Vidya is considered an opportunity to worship.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
My color is given Basanti Chola - this is the inspiration.
My best wishes to my countrymen on the auspicious occasion of this Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in the matter of mind, Akashwani always keeps on flowing with her imagination.
Since last month, he has started listening to the mind in regional languages immediately after fulfilling my mind.
This has got widespread approval.
People are writing letters from far away.
The matter of mind gives me a great opportunity to join you.
Best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
But, in newspapers, new people are being caught everyday, notes are being caught, raids are being carried out, good people are being caught. How is this possible

Last month we were all enjoying Diwali
Like every year, on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border on the border of China to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I go every time, but the experience of this Diwali was something else
In a strange manner, it was dedicated to the soldiers of the bankrupt army, dedicated to the security forces, its impact was expressed on the faces of every soldiers.
They were filled with feelings and not only that, the good news sent by the countrymen, including the security forces of the country in their happiness, was a marvellous response.
And people sent only messages, not so, they were connected with the mind.
Somebody wrote poems, somebody made pictures, somebody made cartoons, somebody made videos, that is, every house became a checkpoint like soldiers.
The work is going on, with the contribution of all of you, the feelings of the army personnel of the country will be compiled in this book with your imagination and your emotions towards the security forces of the country.
A young man from the army wrote to me - Prime Minister, Holi for the soldiers, every festival of Diwali is on the border, every time they are immersed in the country's defence.
Yes, yet the house remembers at the time of festivals.
But tell the truth, this time it didn't look like that
There wasn ' t any eel that the festival was and I ' m not home
It feels like we are celebrating Diwali with 125 million Indians.
My dear countrymen, the feelings that this bankruptcy has awakened among the security forces and the soldiers of our country, should it be limited to just a few occasions
I am pleased with you that we must remember the soldiers of the army of our country in some form or the other, in the form of a society, in the form of a nation, in the form of a nation, in our nature, in any festival or festival or in the atmosphere of happiness.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases 125 million times.
Some time ago, I had come from Jammu and Kashmir to meet all the heads of the village.
for a long time he got the opportunity to talk to me .
He had brought some things about the development of his village, had brought some demands, but when the talk started, it was natural, the situation of the valley, the law and order, the future of the children, it was very natural to get out all these things.
And so lovingly, so openly, these heads of the village spoke, everything was going to touch my heart.
I requested them to go and concentrate on the future of these children
Today, I am happy that all these Prime Ministers who came from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled their promises.
Going to the village and awakening all the remote people .
Just a few days back when Board's emergence took place, the sons and daughters of Kashmir took part in the Board's examination, about 95, Pachnabe fees and students from Kashmir.
Include such a large number of students in board examinations points to the fact that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieving new heights of development through education for a bright future.
For this excitement, I congratulate the students, but I congratulate their parents, their families, their teachers and all the village heads.
Dear brothers and sisters, This time when I asked for the suggestions of the people for the matter of mind, I can say that one-sided suggestions have been made.
Everyone used to say that talk more in detail on notes with 500- and 1000
While addressing the nation at 8 o'clock in the night, I had discussed the launch of a mahabhian to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is to implement that decision.
And I was also supposed to have to face many new problems in our normal life
And even then I had said that the decision is so big, it will take 50 days to get out of its effect and then we will be able to move forward towards the normal stage.
The campaign for liberation from diseases that we have been facing for 70 years cannot be simple
I can understand your difficulties well.
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation.
In spite of the efforts being made to confuse you, sometimes you have understood this path of truth, you have accepted this thing of patriotism well.
Five hundred thousand notes and such a large country, so much of currency, billions and billions of notes and these decisions - the entire world is closely watching, every economist is analyzing and evaluating it.
The whole world is looking at whether India's 1. 25 billion people will be able to achieve success even after facing difficulties.
There may be questions and marks in the minds of the world
India has only faith in India's 1. 25 billion countrymen, belief is that only 1. 25 billion countrymen will continue to fulfill their resolve.
And our country will come out with every kind of heat like gold, and the reason for this is the citizen of this country, because you are the reason for this success is also possible because of you.
The central government, the state government, all units of local Swaraj institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, millions of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank friends are engaged in this work every day and night.
In the midst of tensions, all these people are working very quietly, considering it as a sacrifice of the country-service, as an attempt to make a great change.
Start in the morning, when the night will be completed, do not even know, but are all
And that is why India will succeed in it, it is clearly visible.
And I have seen that all the people of the bank, post office are working between such difficulties.
And when it comes to the issue of humanity, they are seen two steps ahead.
Someone told me that an old man in Khandwa became an accident
Suddenly the money was needed
I am glad to know that they have paid to their homes and elderly people so that they can help in treatment.
In such cases, countless stories come out every day in TV, media, newspapers, conversations
Their strength was introduced .
Today, once again, he has taken the challenge and I am confident that the resolve of 1. 25 billion people, the collective pursuit of all, will make this nation a new power.
But evils are so widespread that even today some people do not have the habit of evil .
Some people still feel that this money of corruption, this black money, this unaccounted money, this anonymous money, will find some way and bring it back to the system.
They're looking for illegal ways to save their money.
Sadly , he also liked to choose a way to use the poor .
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, talking about greed or temptation, putting money in their accounts or doing some work from them.
But, please don't play with the lives of the poor
You don't do anything that the name of the poor will come up on the record and afterwards when it is checked, my dear poor will be caught in trouble because of your sin.
And Anonymous property has been built so hard that it is being implemented, how difficult it will be.
And the government doesn ' t want our countrymen to face any problem
Any Shree Ashish from Madhya Pradesh, who has telephoned me against corruption and black money through this five hundred thousand, is appreciated: -Sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Mercury.
I am a common citizen of Gram Tirali, Tehsil Tirali, District Harda, Madhya Pradesh.
It is very commendable that the currency that you have closed thousands and five hundred notes.
Similarly, I have received a telephone from Sriman Yelappa Velankar ji of Karnataka: -Modi ji Namaste, I am talking to this village of Koppal District of Karnataka, Yelappa Velankar.
I want to thank you with my heart, because you had said that good days will come, but no one thought you would raise such a big step.
Five hundred thousand notes, seeing all this, teaching lessons to black money and corruption
Every citizen of India will never come better than this.
I want to thank you for this .
Some things are known through media, through people, through government sources, the enthusiasm to work also increases.
It is so happy that it is so proud that what is the wonderful potential of the common man in my country
And people go there, eat food and when they pass again after 2-4-6 days, they also return the money again.
This is the power of my country, including service, sacrifice and authenticity.
But I don't know that there is a discussion on tea, marriage too.
I came to know that on 17th November in Surat, there was a wedding that took place with discussion on tea.
In Surat, a daughter who came to her house in Surat, only drinking tea and did not drink anything, no food program, because there was some difficulty due to the ban on bondage.
Baratis also considered him the same honor
Bharat Maru and Saksha Parmar of Surat - They have contributed to the fight against corruption, against black money, through their marriage, this is inspiring in itself.
I also bless the newly-married Bharat and Daksha, and I congratulate you for changing the occasion of marriage into this great sacrifice and turning it into a new occasion.
Tea-worker lives and Tea-Worker receives weekly money
Now get a note of 2000 rupees, what did they do
The women of four neighbours gathered together and the four purchased together and paid a note of 2000 rupees, then they did not need a small currency because the four purchased together and decided that they would meet the next week, then we will take account of it.
People are looking for ways themselves
See how the life of the village is also changing.
Some people have got immediate advantage of this campaign
The country will get benefits in the coming days, but some people have got immediate benefits
Every municipality hardly gets 50 of tax .
But this time because of the decision of 8th , all people ran to submit their old notes .
Last year, about three and a half thousand crore rupees have been deposited in 47 urban units.
You will be surprised to know that they have deposited Rs 13 thousand crore in this week.
Said three and a half thousand and said 13 thousand
And that also came from the front
Now this money has come 4 times in that municipality, it is natural that the poor settlements will have the facility of jaggery, water will be arranged and anganwadi will be arranged.
There are many such examples that its direct benefits are also visible.
Brothers and sisters, Our village, our farmers are a strong axis of our country's economy.
On the one hand, due to this new transformation of the economy, among the difficulties, every citizen is adjusting himself.
But I want to especially congratulate the farmers of my country today
Now I was taking statistics of sowing this crop
I am happy, whether it is wheat, whether it is pulses or oilseeds, till 20th of November, I had a considerable number of sowings compared to last year.
Between difficulties, farmers have discovered ways
The government has also made several important decisions, which have given priority to farmers and villages.
Even after that there are difficulties, but I am confident that the farmer who is suffering from all our difficulties, the natural difficulties, always stands firm and still stands firm.
Small traders of our country, they also provide employment, also increase economic activity.
Millions of crores of rupees have been given to such small people because they do small business, millions of people and speed up the business of billions and billions of rupees.
But due to this decision , it was natural for them to have difficulty .
But I have seen that now our small traders are also serving customers through technology, through mobile app, through the credit card, through their own ways, on the basis of belief.
And I want to tell my young business brothers and sisters that there is a chance, you can also enter the digital world.
You should also download the bank ' s app on your mobile phone
Place PSL machine for Credit Card
I invite you that you can contribute immensely to creating a cashless society, you can create a complete banking system on your business, mobile phone and today there are many other ways other than notes, which can lead to business.
Technological routes are, witnesses, security and is quick
I would like you to help just succeed this campaign, not only this, you should also lead the change and I am confident you can lead the change.
I also want to tell my dear brothers and sisters, you have been exploited.
There is a salary on paper and when it is given in hand, then it is another
Sometimes the salary is fulfilled, somebody stands outside, he has to pay a cut and forced to make this exploitation a part of life.
With this new system, we want you to have accounts in your bank, the money of your salary should be deposited in your bank so that Minimum wages are followed.
And once you have received money in your bank account, you are also not required on a small mobile phone, today your mobile phone also works as an e-buttle - you can also pay the money from the same mobile phone to the small shop in the neighborhood.
Therefore, I urge the hardworking brothers and sisters to become participants in this scheme because after all, I have decided so much for the poor, for the poor, for the farmers, for the deprived, for the deprived, for the victims.
Today I want to talk to young friends in particular
We say in the world that India is a country that has 65 population, under 35 years of age.
You are young and young women of my country, I know, you have liked my decision.
I also know that you support this decision
I also know that you also contribute very positively to this
But friends, you're my true soldier, you're my true partner
A wonderful opportunity to serve Mother Bharati has come to us to take the country to economic heights.
My young men, can you help me
You're not gonna talk to me.
As much as today's experience is yours, not the old generation.
Maybe your family will not even know the elder brother Sahib and parents, uncle and uncle, maternal uncle and maternal uncle may not even know
You know what happens to App, you know what happens, online banking is, you know how online technology is booking.
Things are very common for you and you also use
But today the great work that the country wants to do is our dream is cashless society.
It is fine that 100 percent cashless society is not possible.
And I want your physical help in this, you need your time, yourself, your determination and you will never disappoint me, I am confident because we are all those who want to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know, how many opportunities are today for cash society, digital banking or mobile banking.
Every bank provides online facility
Wallet directly means e-Batuwa
Several types of cards are available
There can be more cash transfer from the ordinary environment phone.
Whether it is a dhobi or a vegetable seller or a milk seller or a newspaper seller or a tea seller or a gram seller, everyone can easily use it.
And I have also emphasized to make this system more simple
All banks are on this, are
My young friends, even after all this, there is a whole generation that is unaware of it.
And all of you, I know well, are active in this great work.
The kind of creative messages you give on the WhatsApp - Slogan, poems, scripts, cartoons, new imaginations, laughter and joke - I am seeing everything and the creative power of our young generation between the challenges, it seems as if it is the characteristic of the land that the Gita was born in the battlefield at any time.
But my dear young friends, I once again say, I need your help in this work.
G-G-G, I say again, I need your help and you, I am confident that millions of young people from my country will do this work.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business
You voluntarily have to lead the campaign to bring out this cash society, the campaign to liberate the country from corruption, the campaign to liberate people from black money, the campaign to liberate people from difficulties and problems.
Once you will teach people how to use the Rupay card, then the poor will bless you.
If this system is taught to the common citizen then it will probably get rid of all the concerns and if this work is done by all the youngsters of India, I do not believe it will take longer.
Within a month, we can stand as a new modern India within the world and you can do this through your mobile phone, you can go to 10 houses every day and add 10 houses everyday.
This country has made a big revolution
My youngsters, I once again ask you to move this campaign forward with great urge.
You must have seen that Amitabh Ji, the most popular artist of this century, is moving ahead with the cleanliness campaign.
It seems that the topic of cleanliness has spread in their rugs and only then did they remember the work of cleanliness on the birth anniversary of their father.
He has written that Harivansh Rai ji has a poem and he has written a line of it, the soil of soil, the mind of fun, the life of a moment, my introduction
Harivansh Rai ji used to introduce himself through this.
The soil of the soil, the heart of the fun, the life of the moment, the introduction of me, his son, Shriman Amitabh ji, whose rings are running a mission of cleanliness, he has sent me by writing, using the poem of Harivansh Rai ji - clean body, clean mind, clean India, my introduction
I salute Harivansh Rai ji.
I also thank Shriman Amitabh ji for thus connecting the minds and pursuing the work of sanitation.
My dear countrymen, now through your thoughts, your sentiments, through your letters, on MyGov, on NarendraModiApp continuously connect me with you.
Now it is a matter of mind at 11 o'clock, but in regional languages it is about to start immediately after completing it.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all for Deepawali.
Deepawali festival is celebrated with enthusiasm and zeal in every corner of India.
India is a country that for 365 days, in every corner of the country, there is a festival.
Those who see from far flung places will feel that like the Indian public life, this is the second name of the festival, and this is also natural.
We have seen the courage to end the tradition of time-bound changes, and changes in the festivals as per the requirements of time and society have been easily accepted.
But one of these things can be seen well that this entire journey of the festivals of India, its business, its depth, its penetration in the people, its penetration in the people, its original system is connected to the satisfaction.
Efforts should be made to expand individual and personality, to expand the scope of your limited thinking from society to the universe and through these festivals.
All these things have been collected by our ancestors in a very scientific way and in the festival.
Today the whole world discusses the environment.
Nature-destruction has become a matter of concern.
The festival of India has been ritualizing every person from childhood to childhood, making the tradition, nature-loving strong.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody has the obligation to raise their feelings.
Nowadays we celebrate the holiday, but those who are older generations, those who are workers, fishermen, you must have seen that for centuries we had traditions here to celebrate the holiday of Purnima and Amavasya.
That is, the tradition of celebrating our holidays with the universe and science was also developed.
Today, when we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I said, every festival of ours comes with the sense of education.
This festival of Deepawali gives a message to the mother Jyotirgamay - from darkness to light.
By burning Deepawali, the society becomes a festival of blindness, the blindness of the blind person, the blindness of the blind person, the liberty of the blind person, and the same is the festival of lighting by burning Diwali.
We all know one thing well, go to any corner of India, go to the house of rich-se-Amir, go to the hut of poor and poor people, in the festival of Diwali, the campaign for cleanliness is going on in every family.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
If the poor will have their soil utensils, then the soil utensils are also cleaned like it has come to Diwali.
Diwali is also a cleanliness campaign.
But the need for time is not just cleaning in the house, cleaning the entire premises, cleaning the entire area, cleaning the entire village, we have to expand this nature and tradition.
Deepawali's festival is no longer limited to the borders of India.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated in some form in all the countries of the world.
Many governments of the world are also becoming part of the festival of Deepawali, the Parliament and the rulers there.
He has put a picture on the instagrum and has shared that picture with the world and has done it with great pride.
And what's the picture.
16 women MPs from Singapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament wearing Indian saris and these photographs have been viral.
And all this has been done for Diwali.
Now the Prime Minister of New ealand had come, he said to me that I have to go back soon because I have to attend the Diwali celebrations.
I mean to say that Deepawali, this festival of light is becoming an inspirational festival of bringing the world community from darkness to light.
By gathering many firecrackers and inviting a very big contingent in an attempt to make a big voice.
Sometimes it does not even notice what things are around, there will be no fire.
In the days of Deepawali, news of sudden news, news of fire, news of immunity, makes big concerns.
And there is also a problem that in the days of Diwali, doctors have also gone to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers.
It's not just one day.
Say Govardhan Pooja, Bhai Duj, say Benefit Panchami, and take it to the light of Kartik Purnima, then there is a way of a long period.
Along with this, we also celebrate the festival of Deepawali and prepare for Chhath-Puja.
In the eastern region of India, the festival of Chhath-Puja is a very big festival.
In a way, there is a great festival, it lasts for four days, but its characteristic is that it gives a deep message to the society.
But the saying is that people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath-Puja is such a festival, in which the setting sun is also worshiped.
There is a very large social message .
I would like to tell you about the festival of Deepawali. This is the time to give you all good wishes, but at the same time I have more time to thank you, especially the countrymen.
Our army personnel have been looting everything for our happiness and happiness for the past few months.
My feelings are shadowed by the soldiers of the army, the soldiers of the security forces, these sacrifices, penance, hard work, my heart and heart.
And one of the same thing was done in the mind that it was dedicated to the name of the bankrupt security forces.
I invited the countrymen for a campaign from Sandesh to Soldiers.
But today I want to say that there will be no human being in India whose heart is proud of the soldiers of the country, the pride of the army, the pride of the security forces.
The way it has been expressed, it will give power to every countrymen.
We cannot imagine the soldiers of the security forces, it is so encouraging that one of your messages has emerged as a power.
Be it schools, colleges, students, villages, poor, businessmen, shopkeepers, politicians, sportspersons, sportspersons, sportspersons, who have not given messages for the soldiers of the country, who have not given messages to the soldiers of the country.
The media also reversed this Deepotsav in an opportunity to express gratitude to the army and why not, whether it is BSF, CRPF, I.
Indo-Tibetan policy, Assam Riles, Water-Service, Army, Navy, East Guard, I cannot speak the names of all.
When we are in the mood of the festival, remember it at the same time, there is a new strength in that memory.
The strength increases in a message and the country showed tax.
I really express my gratitude to the countrymen.
Many, who had art, did it through art.
Sandesh to Solidiers, all these things have come on this ashtag in a symbolic manner.
I have sent a poem to Shriman Ashwini Kumar Chauhan, I would like to read it.
Ashwini ji has written - I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I am smiling, I am happy, I am smiling, this is all because you are, I tell you today, the reason for my freedom is because I sleep with cheer because you are deployed on the border, the mountain range and the skin of India are bowing down to you, the mountain range of India and the bowing down to you and the bowing of India are yours.
My dear countrymen, whose mother-in-law is also full of army personnel and whose in-laws are also full of army personnel, Shivani gave me a telephone message.
Come, let us hear what the Fauji family says: - Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
The Sandesh to Solidiers campaign on this Deepawali is encouraging our brothers and sisters.
I'm from a Army family.
My husband is also Army Officer.
My letter and letter-in-law have been both army officers.
So, we are full of amallies and there are several officers on the border who are receiving such good messages and are encouraging everyone in the Army Circle.
And I would like to say that along with the Army Officers and the Solidiers, their families and their wives also do a lot of education.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the army personnel are found standing on every front of life, not just on the border.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was free from open defecation.
Earlier Sikkim was the province, now Himachal was also there, Kerala is also going to be on November 1.
TBP jawan Shri Vikas Thakur - he is originally from a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
So, in the village, he was likely to be a village-seminar at that time, he reached there and was discussing in the village gathering, it was found that some families were unable to construct toilets due to lack of money.
This development Thakur is our patriotism.
And then came the power to free Himachal Pradesh.
Similarly, in Kerala, I really want to express my gratitude to the youngsters.
I am aware that in the remote forests of Kerala, where there is no road, the village can hardly be reached after walking all day long, it is difficult to reach such a tribal panchayat Idmalakudi.
People never go.
In the urban areas, the students of engineering came to know that toilets have to be constructed in this village.
The students of NSS, NSS, Engineering, all together decided that we will build toilets.
The goods that had to be taken to make toilets should be bricks, cements, all these young men picked up their shoulders and went to those forests throughout the day on foot.
Work is going on at a very fast pace in all the states.
I have mentioned something.
The way they have taken this task, the entire state, I am confident that the Kerosen will be free soon.
The big changes will come, theft will also stop, the environment will also benefit, our foreign exchange will also be saved and the convenience of people will also increase.
Yes, the middlemen will have trouble, the dishonesty will have.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
Everything that should be called the country today, decides the standard for how to go.
Based on this standard, you decide.
The need of the hour is that now we have to address the aspirations of the poor people of the country.
To get rid of troubles, we have to take one step after another.
Why should not our old thinking be anything, but society has to free from the distinction of son and daughter.
Now schools have toilets for children and also toilets for children.
This is an opportunity for our daughters to feel discrimination free India.
There is vaccination from the government, but even then lakhs of children are left out of vaccination and become victims of illness.
A mission of Mission Indradhanush vaccination, which is also aimed at integrating the missing children, which enables children to get rid of serious diseases.
After so many years of independence, the poor mother, cooked food on a wooden stove and took 400 cigarettes of smoke to her body in a day, what will happen to her health
Efforts are made to provide smoke free life to 5 crore families and are moving towards success.
The small businessman, the small businessman, the seller, the seller, the seller of milk, the runner of the ny shop, the moneylenders used to be so busy in the interests of the moneylenders.
Mudra Yojana, Stand-Up Yojana, Jan Dhan account, this is a successful campaign to liberate interests.
Establish the money directly to the banks through Aadhaar and get the money directly to the beneficiary.
This is an opportunity to get rid of intermediaries in the life of common man.
There is a campaign to ensure that there is no improvement and change, the path to liberation from the problem and is happening.
My dear countrymen, yesterday 31st October, the great man of this country, the oneness of India who created a mantra of his life, showed that such a festival is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
But the phone of a gentleman from Punjab, his suffering touched me: Prime Minister, Namaskar, Sir, I am speaking from Punjab.
Sir, as you know that on 31st is Sardar Patel ji's birthday.
And as we all know how there were events in the country after their assassination.
Sir, I wanted to say that how can we stop such unfortunate events that are happening
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of one person.
One Sardar, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, History is witness to the fact that after Chanakya, the work of uniting the country was done by Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Successful efforts to bring Azad Hindustan under a flag, such a great Bhagirath work that the great man who has done, bowed down to that great man.
But it is also painful that Sardar Saheb lived for unity, due to his priority of unity, many were also victims of annoyance, but never left the path of unity.
On the birthday of that great man who lives for unity and on the birthday of Sardar, a page of injustice, history with Sardars suffers all of us.
But, in the midst of these crisis, we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the power of this country.
We also avoid scattered thinking, scattered tendency and save the country.
Sardar Saheb gave us an India, the responsibility of all of us is to make a best India.
The original mantra of unity is the strong foundation of the best India.
Sardar Saheb's life journey started with the struggle of farmers.
The farmer's son was.
Sardar Saheb played a very important role in reaching the freedom movement to the farmers.
It was Sardar Saheb's successful endeavor to make the movement of freedom in the village, and his organization was the result of strength and skill.
But Sardar Saheb was not just a person of struggle, he was also a man of structure.
Today, sometimes we listen to Amul's name.
Today people are also acquainted with every product of Amul outside India and India.
But very few people would know that Sardar Saheb had a divine perspective that he had imagined the Union of Cooperative Milk Producers.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of light festival in the series of Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev, his educational initiation is a guide to the entire humanity, not only for India but for the entire humanity.
Service, truth and goodness, this was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
This was the basic mantra of peace, unity and harmony.
Be it discrimination, be it superstitions, beliefs, beliefs, beliefs, it was the campaign to get rid of the society in every aspect of Guru Nanak Dev.
When we were at the peak of the spectacular, caste-sect, height-down, its distortion, Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo as his colleague.
Come, let us also, Guru Nanak Dev, who has given us the light of knowledge, inspires us to leave discrimination, instructs us to do something against discrimination, if everyone has to move ahead with this mantra then who can be our best guide from Guru Nanak Dev.
I also bow down to Guru Nanak Dev and this light festival.
My dear countrymen, once again, my best wishes to you all on this Diwali, the names of the soldiers of the country.
Your dreams and your resolves are successful in every way.
Your life is a life of happiness and happiness. I wish you all the best.
Thank you very much
In the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir, in a terrorist attack, we lost 18 brave sons of our country.
I bow down to all these brave soldiers and pay tribute to them.
And therefore, I will tell the countrymen so much today and I want to repeat the same thing that I had said on the same day that I will remain guilty.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We're denying our army.
Today, I also want to talk to the citizens of Kashmir in particular.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding anti-national forces well.
And as they have started to understand the truth, they have been moving towards the path of peace by separating themselves from such elements.
Every parents wish to work completely at the earliest.
Farmers are also feeling that the fruits and fruits that have been prepared will reach the market across India.
Economic business also runs well.
And for the last few days the business has started running smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are also the path of solution to our problems, our progress is also the path of development.
For our future generations, we have to cross new heights of development.
I am confident that we will find solutions to every problem in a meeting, find ways and also provide better ways for the future generation of Kashmir.
Security of the citizens of Kashmir, it is the responsibility of governance.
To create law and order, the government has to take some steps.
Sometimes people who think differently from what we think.
These days I get an opportunity to learn a lot in social media.
From every corner of India, every kind of people get an opportunity to know and understand and promote the power of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harshvardhan of class 11 had a different kind of idea in front of me.
He wrote that after the Uri terrorist attack, I was very distraught.
But there was no way to do it and what can a small student like me do
So I realized how to work for the country and the country.
And I resolved that I would study more than 3 hours a day.
I can work for the country, will become such a qualified citizen.
This is a matter of great happiness for me, brother Harsh Vardhan, at such a young age in this atmosphere of resentment.
But Harsh Vardhan, I will also say that there is a huge value of resentment among the citizens of the country.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had made a great effort to touch this emotional world of the country in a very best manner.
And he inspired the common man of the country to work for the country by giving a mantra of Jai Jawan- Jai Kisan.
There is another way to express patriotism among the voices of bombs and guns for every citizen, it was presented by Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
When Mahatma Gandhi used to run the freedom movement, when the movement was intensified and there was a need for a halt in the movement, he used to use the intensity of the movement to motivate the creative work of the society.
All of us have fulfilled our responsibility, the people sitting in the government have fulfilled their duties and with the responsibility of our countrymen, every citizen and this patriotism, if we make any creative contribution then the country will surely cross new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr. TS Kartik wrote to me on the Narendra ModiApp that those who had visited Paralleympics created history and their performance was the victory of Human Spirit.
Shri Varun Viswanathan also wrote on the NarendraModiApp that our thlets have done a very good job and you should refer to it in mind.
You are not two but every person in the country has been emotional attachment to our players in paralysis.
Perhaps more than the sports, the performance of these paralympics and our sportspersons has completely changed the perspective of humanity and the perspective of looking at Divyang.
And I will never forget this thing of our winner sister Deepa Malik.
When he received the medal, he said that I have defeated the handicappedness with this medal.
There is a great power in this sentence.
This time 19 ethlets, including 3 women from our country, participated in Paralleympics.
When Divyang plays in comparison to other games, physical capabilities, sports skills, this is the biggest thing - will power, will power.
You will be surprised to know that our players have achieved 4 medals in the best performing so far - 2 gold, 1 silver and 1 bronze medal.
Devendra Jhajria, brother who received the World Medal, brought him back to the Gold Medal and brought him back after 12 years.
And they were not divyang from birth.
Due to electric concentration, they had to lose one hand.
You can imagine that the person who achieves the first gold medal at the age of 23 and at the age of 35, he has done so much in his life.
Mariyappan won the Gold medal at Thangavelu High Jump.
And Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of just 5.
The poor did not even come under their determination.
He is neither a resident of big city nor a middle class rich family.
Despite passing through a difficult life at the age of 21, despite physical difficulties, the country has been given medals with the strength of determination.
In the name of Athlete Deepa Malik, many types of winners have been associated with their name.
Varun C. Bhati achieved bronze medal in a high jump.
These medals have done a great job to look at the medals of Paralleympics, their importance, in our country, in our society, in our neighborhood, in our divine brothers and sisters.
Our condolences have been awakened, but has also changed the perspective of looking at these people.
Very few people will know how the people of Divyang have performed this time in Paralleympics.
Just a few days back, there was a limpics competition at the same place.
Anyone can think that the General Lympics Record has also been breached and broken by the people of Divya.
This time it has happened.
Abdellati Baka of Algeria made a new record in a short span of 1. 7 seconds, in a short span of 1500 metres, in a short span of 1500 metres.
Moreover, I am surprised that as the fourth number of Divyangjans, no medal was found, they had run in lesser time than those who received the gold medal in the general runners.
Once again, I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving forward towards creating a smooth scheme for parlance and development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had many wonderful experiences in Navsari, Gujarat.
He also told me some parts, and I presented them in front of the people, people were surprised.
On that day, I got the opportunity to inaugurate a book and collected the successful stories of the lives of some divine people.
There were big inspirational events.
The Government of India recorded the world on the soil of Navsari, which I consider important.
Within eight hours, six-seven Divyangjan, who could not hear, successfully used to eat machines to listen to them.
He got a place in the Guinness Book of World Record.
It is a matter of pride for the countrymen to have three-three World Records in one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, we had launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of Lord Bapu on October 2.
And on that day also I had said that cleanliness should become a habit, every citizen should be duties and the atmosphere of hatred towards dirt should be created.
Now when two years are happening on October 2, I can say with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 1. 25 billion countrymen.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today we can all say that everybody has tried to move forward one step.
That means that the country has moved towards cleanliness and cleanliness.
It has also been ensured, the direction is correct, the results are so good, what happens from a little effort, it has also been seen and therefore everybody, whether it is a common citizen, whether it is a government office or a government office or a road or a bus stand or a railway, whether it is a school or a college or a religious place or a hospital, from children to old people, the village poor, the farmer women, everybody is contributing something or the other within cleanliness.
Media's friends have also played a positive role.
But the beginning has been good, the efforts have been fulfilled, and we will succeed, this belief has also been created.
If we talk about rural India then we have to build two crore thirty-two lakh toilets, that is, about two and a half crore toilets have been constructed and we have the intention to construct one and a half million toilets in the next one year.
If I had just gone to Gujarat, then the officers told me that Porbandar, which is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will prove the goal of Porbandar on October 2.
Congratulations to those who have done this work, greetings and best wishes to them and I urge the countrymen that for the respect of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children, we have to free the country from this problem.
I specially want to present a scheme for young friends who use a lot of technology today.
Everyone has the right to know what is the cleanliness mission in your city and for this, the Government of India has given a telephone number - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and celebrated the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019.
This number 1969 - You will not only be able to know the condition of construction of toilets in your city by calling it, but will also be able to apply for toilets.
The Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward.
Sponsor such young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent in the form of Swachh Bharat Ellows within the districts.
This cleanliness campaign does not matter even if it is limited to rituals.
Become a cleanliness habit, it is not enough.
In today's era, it is compulsory for cleanliness as well as environment models.
It is also important to be a part of health and therefore we have to move forward towards the hygiene mission as well as the fast to the compost.
Certificate companies have been asked to buy the compost that is produced from the waste.
This provides to those farmers who want to go to organic farming.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, reflect the health of the earth, those who have suffered a lot due to the chemical fertilizer, if they need such fertilizers in some quantity then they should provide them.
And Shriman Amitabh Bachchan is contributing a lot in this work as a brand ambassador.
It's like doing this.
Ministers from all over the country, Chief Ministers, Metropolitan Mayor, Communicators - all of these are just and only cleanliness.
What can happen in technology
How can employment opportunities be increased in it
All topics are going to be discussed.
And I am seeing that new news is coming continuously for cleanliness.
Just one day I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technologies University went to 107 villages and launched Jagaran campaign for toilet construction.
He laboured himself and contributed to making about 9 thousand toilets.
In the past, you must have seen that a team led by Eng Commander Paramveer Singh swimmed away from Devprayag in the Ganges to Ganga Sagar, 2800 kms and gave a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also made its departments a year-long calendar.
Every department passes 15 days specially on cleanliness.
In the coming month of October, from 1st to 15th October, the Rinking Water and Sanitation Department, Panchayati Raj Department, Rural Development Department - these three together will work by creating a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
And the last two weeks of the month of October, 16th October to 31st October, three more Department Agricultural and Farmer Welfare - Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing II
My citizens also request you to join the work done by these departments.
You must have seen that these days the Survey Campaign of Sanitation is also going on.
Once again, after surveying 73 cities, what is the situation of cleanliness, it was presented to the people of the country.
Now there is a turn of 500 people who have more than 1 lakh people and this creates a belief within every city that let us remain behind, we will do something good next time.
There is an atmosphere of competition for cleanliness.
I hope that all citizens should contribute to this campaign.
October 2 is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
Swachh Bharat Mission is taking 2 years.
I urge from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali to buy something or the other of Khadi.
This time too, I urge every family to have something of Khadi so that it can be given Diwali in the poor house.
On October 2, when Sunday is, as a citizen, can we connect ourselves to cleanliness
Two hours and four hours of physically connect yourself in the work of cleaning and I tell you that you share a photo of the cleanliness campaign that you have joined me on Narendra ModiApp.
If you have video then share your video.
See, the efforts of the people across the country will once again get new strength and new momentum.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we resolve to do something or the other for the country.
My dear countrymen, it is a pleasure to give you life and whether someone has recognised it or not.
It is his campaign to collect food items and clothes to the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the streets and used to donate the old toys that were with the families and those toys that used to come to the poor settlement used to present in the Anganwadi.
This is a kind of donation festival.
I extend my best wishes to the youngsters who are engaged in this work.
My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay jis birth anniversary is today, and from today the centenary year of his birth is being started.
The theory of Sarvajan Hitay- Sarvajan Sukhai Antyodaya - this is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also talked about the welfare of the last end person.
How did the poor person get the fruit of development
He had presented the entire economic agenda to every field in two words.
The country celebrated their birth centenary year as a poor welfare year.
Societies, governments, everyone's attention and the benefits of development should be concentrated on the poor and then we can get rid of the poor.
It is a symbolic form of the poor welfare year of that century.
I salute Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji, the rich devotee of our ideological heritage, the inspirational man of all of us.
My dear countrymen, I had started talking about the mind two years ago on the day of Vijayadashmi.
It was my authentic attempt that it should not be a programme to commemorate government works.
How the common man of this country inspires me.
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
Today, when I am completing this week, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the manner in which you salute Mann Ki Baat.
I am also grateful to Akashwani that he not only spread these things, but also made every effort to reach it in all languages.
I am also grateful to the people of those countries who have written letters and suggested and exposed the government's doors, highlighted the deficiencies of the government and the Akashwani provided platforms for solving problems by inviting the people of the government by making special programmes on such letters.
So the talk of mind was not just a 15-20-minute dialogue, it became a new opportunity for social transformation.
What can be the reason for greater satisfaction for anyone and therefore I express my gratitude to everyone associated with making it a success.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja next week, the festival of Vijaya Dashmi, the preparation of Deepawali, in a way, is a different atmosphere throughout the country.
This is the festival of power and suppression, the unity of society is the strength of the country.
Whether it is Navratri or Durga-Puja, how can it be the festival of worship of power, the worship of unity of society
How to make the festival connecting people
And that is the practice of true power and only then can we go and celebrate the victory of tax.
Come, let's sadhana the power, let's take the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, on August 29, Hawki magician Dhyan Chand ji is the birth date.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day throughout the country.
I pay tribute to Dhyan Chand ji and remind you all of them of his contribution on this occasion.
In 1928, in 1932, in 1936, he played an important role in providing Hockey Hockey Gold medal to India in limpics.
We all know the name of cricket lover Bradman.
He had asked for Dhyan Chand ji- We scores goals like runs. Dhyanchand ji was a living example of spirit and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, a opposition player hit the head of Dhyan Chand ji.
At that time the match was only 10 minutes left.
And Dhyan Chand ji made three rounds in those 10 minutes and said that I gave the revenge of the injury to the round.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a time of mind, there are several suggestions on MyGov or Narendra ModiApp.
I am looking at this so much at the attitude of the common citizen towards the Rio Limpics, so awareness and pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to say something on this.
Even outside cricket, there is so much love for Indian nationals and sports, so awareness and so many information.
Reading this message for me, it also became a cause of great inspiration in itself.
A Sriman Ajit Singh has written on NarendraModiApp, Please talk about her participation in daughters education and sports because she has glorified the country by winning medals in the Rio Limpics.
Any Shreeman Sachin writes that you are requested to remember the Indus, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in the matter of this time.
The medals we get, the daughters gave.
Our daughters once again proved that they are not less than anyone in any way.
It seems like the daughters of entire India have taken the initiative to illuminate the country's name.
On MyGov, Summit Thakur has written that we could do even better in limpics.
He has written, Hon'ble Modi Sir, congratulated the two medals we won in Rio first.
But I want to draw your attention on whether our performance was really good
And the answer is, no.
We need a long journey in sports.
Our parents still emphasize on focusing on education and education.
In the society, the game is still considered to be waste of time.
We need to change this thinking.
The society needs motivation.
And no one can do this thing better than you.
Similarly, Shri Satyaprakash Mehra ji has written on the Narendra ModiApp that there is a need to focus on etra-curriculture activities in the mind.
In a way, thousands of people have expressed this feeling.
It can not be denied that we can not perform according to our hope.
In some cases, those who used to perform in India, those who used to perform in the sports here could not reach there, and only two medals were found in the medal table.
But it is also true that even if you look at medals, then for the first time in many subjects, the players of India have shown a very good job.
Now look, in our shooting, our innovative Bindra ji remained in the fourth position and he missed the medal at a very short distance.
Deepa Karmakar also wondered at the Gymnastics - he was in fourth place and lost medal due to a little distance.
But how can we forget that she is the first Indian daughter to qualify for limpic and limpic final
Something similar happened with Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna's pair in tennis.
We have performed well this time in the athletics.
After PT Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar has qualified for track fields.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, the women hockey team reached the limpic.
Krishna Yadav reached the quarter-inal, but could not get the bronze.
Many players, such as - Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das are many names, whose performances are good.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But whatever we have done, we will perhaps be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
The Government of India will go into its depth and study what is happening in the world.
We will create a roadmap for what we can do well.
2020, 2024, 2028 - We have to plan with a far-reaching thinking.
I also urge the State Governments to create such committees and what can we do in the sports world, what can we do in each state, what can we do in each state, what can we like one of our games and two games
And I urge every citizen in India to send suggestions on the Narendra ModiApp that anyone who is interested in it.
Write to the government, discuss Association and give it to the government.
State governments should discuss and send their suggestions.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is the Teachers' Day.
I also learned a lot from these small boys.
For me, there was also a 5-september Teachers Day and for me there was a day of education.
But this time I have to go to the G-20 Summit. I realized that today I will express my feelings in my heart.
As much as the place of mother is in life, the same is the place of teacher.
And we have seen such teachers who have more concern than themselves.
He spends his life for his disciples, for his students.
These days, after Rio Lympics, Pulela Gopichand ji is discussed all around.
They are players, but they have presented an example of what is a good teacher.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher from a player.
And on Teacher's Day, I salute Pulela Gopichand ji, her penance, her dedication to sports and her ways to enjoy her students' success.
The contribution of the teacher in the life of all of us is always felt.
5th September is the birth anniversary of former President of India, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Ji and the country celebrates him as Teachers Day.
He reached any place in life, but he always tried to live himself as a teacher.
Sometimes I also think so much of my teachers because they used to be our heroes in our small village.
But today I can say that one of my teachers - now he is 90 years old - I still receive his letter every month.
And even at the age of 90, I am surprised that even in this stage, they write with such beautiful letters and my own letters are very bad, because of this, whenever I see somebody's good letters, I am very much respected.
If you have a photo with your teacher on the Narendra ModiApp, any incident with your teacher or any inspirational thing of your teacher, you must share it.
See, it is also very valuable to see the contribution of teachers in the country from the vision of students.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival is going to come in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a rebel and we all want our country, our society, our family, every person, his life to be uninterrupted.
But when Ganesh talks about the festival, it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public Ganesh Festival - this is the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Through the public Ganesh Festival, he made this religious occasion a festival of national awakening and made a festival of social rites.
And through the public Ganesh Festival, there should be a massive discussion on the issues touching social life and the creation of programmes should be such that the society gets a new brightness and a new brightness.
Even today, not only Maharashtra but also every corner of India, public Ganesh Festivals are being celebrated.
All the youngsters also make a lot of preparations to do this, enthusiasm is also very much.
And some people have still tried their best to follow the spirit that Lokmanya Tilak ji had kept.
They hold discussions on public topics, competitive competitions and competitions.
They also highlight the issues touching the society in a artistic manner.
In a way, a big campaign of public education runs through public Ganesh Festival.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us this inspirational mantra that Swaraj is our birth-sided right.
Suraj is our priority, can not we communicate with the public Ganesh Festival about this mantra
Come on, I invite you.
It is true that the festival is the power of society.
Festival fills new life in the life of the person and society.
Life is impossible without the festival but it has to be dragged as per the requirements of time.
This time I have seen that many people have written a lot on those things especially Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
And they are worried about the environment.
Someone has made Shriman Shankar Narayan Pacific, he has said with great urge that Modi ji, you should explain to the people in the matter of mind that do not use the statues of Ganesh ji built of Plaster of Paris.
Why not use Ganesh ji made of soil of the village pond
The statues made of POP are not favorable to the environment.
He has expressed a lot of pain and others have also done it.
I also pray to all of you, why don't we use the soil and the statues of Ganesh, the statues of Durga - why don't we return to that old tradition
The protection of environment, the protection of our rivers and ponds, the protection of small organisms of this water from pollution in it - this is also the service of God.
Ganesh ji is a rebel.
So we should not create such a Ganesh ji who creates disruption.
I don't know how you will take these things.
Several such institutions, individuals work hard for soil harvesting and campaigning.
Co-friendly Ganeshotsav - this is also a social service.
Durga Puja is still time.
Now we should decide that the statues that our old families used to build will also get employment and the ponds or rivers will be made of soil, and the environment will also be protected.
I extend my best wishes to you all on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa, on 4th September, Mother Teresa will be conferred with the title of saints.
Mother Teresa had put her whole life in India for the service of the poor.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud when Mother Teresa receives the title of saints.
The event will be held on 4th September by the Government of India, under the leadership of our Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, an official delegation will also be sent there.
From saints, saints, saints and great men, we get to learn something or the other every moment.
We will continue to find something or the other, we will continue to learn and do something better.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement, how big change comes.
Manpower is considered to be the form of God.
The Government of India has made a successful effort to connect people to clean Ganga and to clean Ganga with the help of 5 State Governments in the past.
On 20th of this month, in Allahabad, those people were invited to head villages living on the banks of the Ganges.
There were men too, women too.
He came to Allahabad and the heads of the villages of the Ganges coast took oath in the testimony of the mother Ganga that they would immediately stop the tradition of going to the Ganges coast in their villages, to make toilets and make the village fully contribute to the cleaning of the Ganges that the village will not let the Ganges be dirty.
I came to Allahabad for this resolution, some came from Uttarakhand, some from Uttar Pradesh, some from Bihar, some from Jharkhand, some from West Bengal, I congratulate them all for this work.
I congratulate all the ministries of the Government of India and congratulate the ministers who have realized this vision.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the 5 states that they have taken a vital step in the cleaning of the Ganga by linking the manpower.
My dear countrymen, I sometimes touch a lot and I have a special respect for those who have imagined it.
On July 15, more than half a million students of more than seventeen-two hundred schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote a letter to their parents.
Someone wrote in English, somebody wrote in Hindi, somebody wrote in Chhattisgarh, they wrote a letter from their parents and said that there should be toilet in our house.
These children of seven to seventeen years of age did this work.
And it was so impressed that after receiving the letter, when the school came on the second day, the parents had caught a letter to give it to the teacher and the parents had promised that they would make the toilet till the date of the festival.
Congratulations to those students who made this effort and especially congratulated their parents who decided to work towards making the toilet by taking their child's letter seriously.
This is what inspires us.
Mallamma, a daughter of 16 years old in this district, Koppal district of Karnataka, has satyagraha against her family.
It is said that he had also quit food and that too should not be asked for anything for himself, not to bring any good clothes, not to eat sweets, but toilet in our house.
Now the family had no financial condition, the daughter was stuck on id, she was not ready to leave her satyagraha.
Mohammed Shafi, the head of the village, came to know that Mallamma has done Satyagraha for Toilet, then also look at the features of Mohammed Shafi, the head of the village, that he justified eighteen thousand rupees and made a toilet within a week.
See this daughter Mallamma's jihad and see the head of the village like Mohammed Shafi.
How paths are opened to solve problems, this is the manpower.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become the determination.
Some Indians have made it their own.
But everyone is associated with it in some form or the other, everyone is contributing to it.
His competition will be and the winners who will be on the day of October 2, Gadhi Jayanti will be rewarded.
Hey, nowadays you can also make a film from your mobile phone.
Come on, move ahead, you have my invitation.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried that our relations with our neighbours should be deep, our relations should be simple, our relations should be alive.
A very important thing has happened in the past, our President, Honble Pranab Mukherjee, launched a new program in Kolkata, Akashwani Maitri Channel.
Now many people will feel whether the President should inaugurate a radio channel
But this is not the challenge of normal radio, it is a very important step.
Bangladesh is in our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
They will share the content between themselves and the Bengali-speaking people will enjoy Akashwani on both sides.
People to People Contact have a very big contribution to the Akashwani.
The President launched it.
I also thank Bangladesh for their involvement with us for this work.
I congratulate the friends of Akashwani that they are also contributing to the foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the work of the Prime Minister, but in the end I am also a man like you.
Sometimes emotional events touch me a little more.
Such emotional events also give new energy, inspire new inspirations and this is what inspires people of India to pass something or the other.
In the past, I got such a letter, touched my mind.
A 84-year-old mother who is a retired teacher wrote this letter to me.
If he had not refused to declare my name in his letter to me, then my mind was that today I would talk to you by giving them names and writing that when you had requested to leave the gas subsidy, I had left the gas subsidy and later I had forgotten it.
The letter of the Prime Minister of India for me is not less than a Padma Shri.
You will know that I have tried to send a letter to those who have left the Gas Subsidy and some of my representatives will go to Rubru.
My effort is to write a letter to more than one crore people.
My letter came to this mother under the same scheme and she wrote to me that you are doing good work.
Your campaign to liberate the poor mothers from the smoke of stove and therefore I am a registered teacher and in a few years my age will be 90 years, I am sending you a donation of 50 thousand rupees, so that you can work to free such poor mothers from stove smoke.
You can imagine that as a general teacher, the mother who lives on a retired pension, gives 50 thousand rupees and poor mothers and sisters to get rid of the smoke of steam and give gas connections.
The question is not 50 thousand rupees, the question is of the spirit of that mother and such mothers and sisters are their blessings, so that my country becomes confident and powerful for the future.
And he did not write my letter as the Prime Minister. He wrote a direct letter.
I bow down to that mother and I also salute these mothers of India who always work to do something or the other by suffering their sufferings.
My dear countrymen, we were troubled due to the famine last year, but this month was continuously filled with floods.
There was frequent flood in some parts of the country.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the local Swaraj Sansthan units, the social institutions and the citizens have tried their best to do whatever they can.
But among the news of these floods, there were also some news that had to be remembered.
What is the strength of unity, let's go together, how big can it get
It will be remembered this year's August month.
In August 2016, there were a lot of political opposition parties, parties who did not leave any chance against each other, and almost 90 parties across the country, a lot of parties in Parliament, all the parties together passed the GST law.
Its credit goes to all parties.
And it is an example of how big item happens when all the parties come together in one direction.
In the same way, in relation to the situation of Kashmir whatever happened in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together spoke of Kashmir with a voice.
He also conveyed messages to the world, sent messages to separatist elements and expressed our condolences to the citizens of Kashmir.
And we all have the opinion of 1. 25 billion countrymen, from the head of the village to the Prime Minister, we believe that if anyone knows whether it belongs to a young man or a security worker, this loss belongs to us, it belongs to our own country.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by furthering these small children, sometimes they will have to answer these innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a citizen, as a society, as a government, we all have the responsibility to give more strength to the unity, expose more and then by going, the country can create a bright future.
I believe in the power of 1. 25 billion countrymen.
Today, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, I got the opportunity to spend a few moments with the youth of Delhi this morning and I believe that in the coming days, the color of the game will give color to every young man in the country.
We all know that in a few days, the world's largest sports is going to be Mahakumbh.
Rio is going to repeat our ears.
Our hopes are very much, but the work of encouraging those sportspersons and their encouragement to play in Rio is also done by 1. 25 billion Indians.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organized a great event called Run for Rio, Sports and Geo, Sports and Toys.
We should do something to encourage our sportspersons in the coming days.
No matter how much food is, everything has to be left.
I am ready to do this work on behalf of you.
The Prime Minister of the country is ready to become a postman to deliver your message to these players.
If there is no research and innovation then technology becomes a burden as the stagnant water spreads dirt.
And if we continue to win the trust of old technology without research and innovation, then we will become black in the changing era and therefore in the new generation, reservoir and innovation towards science and innovation and for this, the government has taken several steps.
And so I say - Let us try to innovate and when I call Let us innovate, then my AII
If we have to prepare the next generation innovators, then our children will have to join them and therefore the Government of India has taken the initiative of a Atal Tinkering Cabs.
Wherever there will be such training pockets in schools, they will be given Rs. 10 lakhs and Rs. 10 lakhs will also be given for maintenance during the last five years.
If we have a strong and prosperous incubation centre, we get an arrangement for innovation, start-ups, to bring it to a position.
Similarly, India is battling many problems.
We find problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find a technical solution.
We have called upon a young generation of the country to find solutions and find ways of technology, research, innovate and bring solutions.
The Government of India wants to promote special awards to the technology discovered for solving our problems.
My dear countrymen, some time back we were worrying about the famine and these days we are also enjoying the rains and news of floods is also coming.
The state government and the central government are working hard to help the flood victims together.
In spite of some difficulties due to the rain, every mind, every human mind gets poured out because there is rain and farming in the center of our entire economic activity.
Sometimes such a disease occurs that we are regretted throughout life.
Engue can be avoided.
Take care of cleanliness, be slightly cautious and try to be safe, pay special attention to the children and this is not the reason why such a disease occurs in the poor settlement.
Engue comes first in a happy and prosperous region and therefore we understand it.
You must have seen advertising on TE, but sometimes we are slightly indifferent about awareness about it.
The government, the hospital and the doctor - they will do their jobs, but I will also pray to you that we should not enter our houses, in our area, in our family, and be cautious of the disease caused by water.
I want to attract your attention to another problem, dear countrymen.
The life has become so sympathetic that it has become so rampant that sometimes we do not have time to think for ourselves.
If you get sick, then you feel better and therefore someone puts in the body with antibiotics.
But my dear countrymen, this habit of taking antibiotics can create a very serious crisis.
You might get relief for a few moments but without the advice of doctors, we should stop taking antibiotics.
I urge you to complete the course as much as the doctor has asked to take.
The bacteria that spread TB and malaria are bringing about such changes in themselves at a fast pace that there is no effect of medicines.
It is called antibiotic resistance in medicinal language and therefore it is equally necessary to follow its rules.
When it comes to health, I want to add one more thing.
In our country, the mothers who are in pregnancy are sometimes worried about their lives.
In our country, about 3 crore women conceive pregnancy every year, but some mothers die while delivery, sometimes mothers die, sometimes children die, sometimes both children and mothers die.
It is fine that in the last decade, the rate of mother's untimely death has decreased, but still a large number of pregnant mothers can not save their lives.
During pregnancy or after blood deficiency, reproductive infections, high BP-When any problem can destroy his life.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign for the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Maternity Abhiyan.
Under this campaign, on 9th of every month, free checks will be done in all pregnant women's government health centers.
The lives of both mothers and children can be saved and I am gynecologists, especially if you cannot provide these services free of cost for poor mothers on 9th day in a month.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not put twelve days in a year for the poor
I'm sure you'll join.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is climate change, global warming and environment.
It is discussed collectively in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
Even in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna also discusses the tree, even in the battlefield, worrying about how much it will be, we can guess.
Lord Krishna says in the Gita - Ashwath: I am peepal in all trees i.e. all trees.
It has been said in the Venus Policy - Nasti roots Announcements - There is no such plant, which has no medicinal properties.
Whoever donates the tree, he also wipes the tree in parallel to the children of the tree.
Therefore, parents who wish for their welfare plant good trees and follow them like their children.
Our Scripture-Geeta, be it Thanksgiving Policy or the Disciplinary Festival of the Mahabharata - but in today's generation there are some people who show these ideals by doing it.
A few days ago, I had an example of a daughter Sonal from Pune, which touched my heart.
In the Disciplinary Festival of Mahabharata, it is said that the tree also fulfills the responsibility of the children in the world.
Khandu Maruti Mahatra, a farmer of Narayanpur village in Junar Taluka, Pune in Maharashtra, married his granddaughter Sonal in a big motivational way.
Such a scene that touched the mind was in that picture.
The idea that Sonal himself is an agricultural graduate has come to him and to give her mango plants in marriage, see how much nature's love has emerged.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became an immortal story of Nature Love and I extend my best wishes to Sonal and Shriman Mahatre ji for this innovative effort.
And many people use such experiments.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims come to the temple of Amba Ji in the month of Bhadra, once the social worker organisation decided that those who come to the temple will give them the plant in Prasad and they will say that this is the prasad of Mother, this plant will be made bigger in their village and mother will continue to bless you.
I often tell the farmer brothers that we waste our land by planting fences on the banks of our farms, why should we cultivate timber instead of that fence
Today, India has to bring a timber of billions of trillions from abroad to build houses and to create a tournatural.
If we plant trees on the edge of our farm, which are working in the industry and home, then after fifteen-twenty years, we can also sell it by cutting it off from the government's permission and you can also become a new source of income and you can also avoid importing timber to India.
In the past several states have launched a lot of campaigns using this season, the Government of India has also passed an AMPA Act, which is going to go to more than forty thousand crore states for plantation.
I am told that the Maharashtra government has planted about two and a half million plants in the entire state on July 1.
The government created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Desert and Bhoomi - It has done such a big forest festival and has resolved to plant 25 lakh plants.
There are not twenty five lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan know how big they have raised.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its Green Cover City Percentage by Twenty-Twenty-Nine (2029).
Gujarat also has a very bright tradition of the One Festival.
This year, Gujarat has taken several such projects as AMRON, Ekta Van, Shaheed Van - and has launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I am unable to mention all the states, but are eligible for congratulations.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa in the past.
This was my first visit and when it is a foreign visit, there is a diplomacy, there is talk of trading, there are discussions about security, there are several mos.
But for me, the journey of South Africa was a pilgrimage.
When we remember South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nellson Mandela.
Non-violence, love, forgiveness - When these words fall on the ears, Gandhi and Mandela - their faces are seen in front of us.
During my visit to South Africa, I had visited Phoeni Settlement, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
I also got the good fortune of the train that Mahatma Gandhi had travelled and the train that had transplanted Mohandas to make Mahatma Gandhi.
But what I want to tell you, I got the opportunity to meet such glorious people who had spent their youth for equality and equal opportunity.
He fought shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela and lived with Nelson Mandela in prisons for twenty-twenty-two years.
In a way, he had invited the entire youth and I got the privilege of visiting these glorious glorious feelings of Sriman Laloo Cheba, George Bios, Ronnie Kesrils.
Original Indians, but wherever they went, they got ready to give life to those among whom they won.
On his face, even after doing such a great penance, it was not seen anywhere.
A kind of duties - The duties which have been described in the Gita, were not seen in a very literate form.
My heart will always remember that meeting - equality and equal opportunity.
There can be no bigger mantra for any society and the government.
Sameभाव and ma'am-bhav are the paths that lead us to a bright future.
Children want a good future.
Priority will be different but the path is the same and the path is of development, equality, equality, equality and equality.
Come, let us proud of our Indians who have shown their original mantras in South Africa.
Being a woman, I'm sorry about her family.
And as technology is doing a big role in the economic system, those who misuse it also come to the ground.
You must have been confused sometimes and they write to you in such a great way as if it is a right letter.
Your credit card number, debit card number and your account is opened through technology.
This is a new way of fraud, this is digital fraud.
I believe that it should be avoided, should be cautious and if such false things come, then they should make them a little aware by sharing their brothers and sisters.
I would like that Shilpi Verma has brought good things to my notice. You must have experienced it, but perhaps you will not be able to look so seriously, but I feel that there is a need to see.
My dear countrymen, these days the Parliament session is going on, then I also get the opportunity to meet many people of the country during the session of Parliament.
But these days I had a pleasant experience.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
Artificial paintings have been done at the station.
Not only that, the plastic bottles or oil cans in the village were lying in such garbage, they searched and collected them and planted soil and planted them and made vertical gardens.
And by making these vertical gardens in plastic bottles towards the railway station, it was completely new.
If you ever go to Aligarh, then definitely look at the station.
Nowadays, I am receiving these news from several railway stations in India and local people are presenting their area on the walls of the railway stations through their art.
A newness is feeling.
This is an example of how changes can be brought from public participation.
Congratulations to all those who work in this manner in the country and my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with the rainy season, you also have festivals in our country.
Festivals will be celebrated in temples, pujas and you will also be associated with the festival even outside the house.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a special occasion here.
Like last year, cannot you present the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of your country on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan
Think, give such a gift to sister, who really protects her in life.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in independent India.
75 years of uit India and 70 years of India's independence can inspire us, create new fervour, can become an opportunity for the country to do something.
The whole country will be coloured with the color of freedom fighters and once again feel the happiness of freedom all around.
This atmosphere should be created by all of us and the festival of independence - this is not a government programme, it should be of the people of the country.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope you will also do something better related to the inspiration of patriotism.
Send his picture on the Narendra Modi App.
Make an environment in the country.
Dear countrymen, I am fortunate to talk to the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort on August 15.
There will also be some things in your mind, which you would like to keep your talk from the Red Fort with the same intensity.
I invite you, whatever thoughts you have in your mind, which you think as your representative, as your chief servant, I should tell you this thing from the Red Fort, you must write it and send it to me.
Whatever is spoken from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it is a matter of 1.
Let me invite you to recall the glory of the sacrifices of freedom fighters. Remember the great men who have spent their lives for India and take a pledge to do something for the country.
Happy to all the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
I am also grateful to Akashwani for his successful efforts to present this mind in regional languages at 8.00 in the evening.
And I am also happy that those who listen to me later send their sentiments to me through telephone, through myGov website, through Narendra Modi App.
Many of your things help me in the work of the government.
In the context of public interest, how active the government should be, how primary the work of public interest should be, this interaction with you for these things is very useful.
I hope you will surely emphasize the way democracy goes through public participation.
The heat is increasing.
Nearly the maximum part of the country is feeling the heat of heat.
Mercury is touching the sky.
Due to the environment, these problems are increasing.
The forests were reduced, the trees were cut off and in a way mankind destroyed the nature and paved the way for their own destruction.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
There are discussions for the environment throughout the world, there is concern.
This time, the nited nations have made it a topic of zero tolerance for the Filmlife Trade on World Environment Day.
It will be discussed, but we have to discuss trees and plants, we have to discuss water, how to increase our forests.
Because you must have seen that in the lap of Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir- Himalayas, the fire that took place in the forests.
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha - I could have a meeting of all the drought-affected states, but I did not do this.
What to say to the states, they heard them closely.
Normally, in the government, how much money was spent from the Government of India and how much was spent - it does not matter closely.
It was also surprising to the officials of the Government of India that many states have made immense efforts to deal with the situation of water, environment, to deal with the situation of drought, for animals, for the affected persons and in a way, the government of any party in every corner of the country.
In a way, it was a learning experience for me and I have told my policy commission how to take the best practices in all the states.
Some states, especially Andhra, have used a lot of technology in Gujarat.
I would like to convey the special efforts made by the NITI Aayog to the States and to the States.
Public participation is the basis for a great success in solving such problems.
As we go to the temple, give a Prasad and even a little Prasad falls, then there is annoyance in the mind.
They pick him up and apologize to God five times.
This water is also the offering of God.
If one drop is also wasted, then we should suffer.
Therefore, water conservation is equally important, water conservation is equally important, water conservation is equally important and therefore every drop-more crop, micro-irrigation and minimum water.
Now it is a matter of great happiness that in many states our sugarcane farmers are also using micro-irrigation, someone is using drip-irrigation, someone is doing sprinkler.
When I sat with the states, some states have also used the drip-inigration for the sake of paddy and those who cultivate the rice, because of which their yields also increased, water saved and wages also decreased.
When I heard from these states, there are many states that have taken huge targets, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
Three states have done a great job in drip-irrigation and they are trying to get connected with two-two, three lakh hectares of micro-irrigation every year.
If this campaign is going on in all the states then agriculture will also be very beneficial and water will also be accumulated.
Our brothers of Telangana have tried to utilize the water of Godavari and Krishna river through Mission Bhagirathi.
Andhra Pradesh has also tried to use technology, ground water recharge in the Neeru Progress Mission.
In the mass movement that Maharashtra has created, people are also sweating, giving money too.
Watery Camp Campaign - I really realize that this movement will be very useful to save Maharashtra from the future crisis.
Chhattisgarh has launched Loksuraj - Jalsuraj campaign.
Madhya Pradesh has planned Balram Talab - Nearly 22 thousand ponds are not small data
Rajasthan and Gujarat have launched a big campaign to revive them as a Jal Mandir.
Rajasthan has launched Chief Minister Water Suspending Campaign.
Jharkhand is a wild area, but there are some areas where there is a problem of water.
He has launched a very big campaign for Heck Com.
They have tried to stop water.
Some states have launched a campaign to stop 10-10, 20-20 km water by creating small dams in the rivers.
This is a very pleasant experience.
I also tell the countrymen that it will not allow one drop of water to be wasted in June, July, August and September.
And this isn ' t just a matter of farmers.
This village, poor, labour, farmers, urban, rural, wealthy and poor - is a matter related to everyone and that is why the rainy season is coming and this time when we celebrate Diwali, we can also enjoy how much water we saved and how much water we stopped.
You see, our happiness will increase manifold.
How is this precious treasure given by God
Media detailed the problem of water in the past.
I hope that the media will guide people towards saving water, drive campaigns and make the media a participant for eternal liberation from the water crisis. I also invite them.
My dear countrymen, we have to make a modern India.
We have to create transparent India.
If we have to reach many systems from one corner to the other of India, then our old habits will also have to change a little.
Today, I want to touch a topic on which if you help me, we can move forward successfully in that direction.
If you want salt, then give such a vegetable in return.
Business used to run from the start system itself.
But now the time has changed.
The entire world is moving towards cashless society.
We can also get the money and money through electronic technology system.
You can buy things, you can also square the bill.
And this will never raise the question of theft of the dung.
There will be no concern about keeping accounts, automatic accounts will be there.
The beginning will look slightly difficult, but once the habit will take place, then this system will become simple.
And this is the possibility that the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country have opened up the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
So, while coordinating Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (JAM), JAM, we can move forward towards this cash society.
You must have seen that RUPAY has been awarded with Jan-han account.
In the coming days, this card is going to work both in terms of credit and debit.
To get out of the zeb, count, there is no need.
There is no need to roam together.
Whatever initiatives the Government of India has taken, how to take money through a PSU.
It will be very easy to transact money through your mobile phone and it is a matter of great happiness that NP.
In a way, the bank has worked towards your door.
Post Office has also been alerted for banking services.
If we learn to use these systems and add habits then we will not need this currencies, we will not need the notes, we will not need the money, the business will run automatically and this will result in a transparency.
See, once we start, we will move forward very easily.
Twenty years ago, who thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands.
Gradually became a habit, now they can not live without him.
Perhaps this cash society can take the same form but it will be better if it happens in a short time.
My dear countrymen, whenever the games of limpics come and whenever the game starts, then we sit in the sir, how much behind we are in the World Medal, whether Silver has been found or not, not run from Brone.
To encourage our players going to Rio Limpics, to encourage them, everybody has their own way.
Some songs, some cartoons, some good wishes, somebody encourages a game, but the whole country should create a positive atmosphere towards these players.
The results that will come - will come.
It becomes a great strength in itself. When the player feels that 1. 25 billion people are standing with him then his fervor becomes strong.
I had spoken for an Under-17 World Up and I have seen the suggestions that I have received from all over the country, and these days I have seen that an atmosphere of football has started to be seen throughout the country.
Many people are creating their teams with initiatives.
I have received thousands of suggestions on Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Maybe many people wouldn't have played but there is so much interest in the game of thousands of young people in the country that it was a pleasant experience for me in itself.
We know the attachment of cricket and India, but I have seen such an attachment to the football which indicates a very happy future in itself.
So, in the days to come, we are encouraging and enthusiastic to all our sportspersons who are eligible for the Rio Limpics.
How to do everything with victory and defeat.
With Sportsman spirit, India has made its identity in the world.
I appeal to the countrymen to do something in creating an atmosphere of zeal and enthusiasm towards our sports companions.
Since last eight to ten days, new results are coming from somewhere.
I am talking about those students who worked hard throughout the year, eam, 10th, 12th and one after another.
It's clear that our daughters are showing paradigm.
It's a pleasure.
My best wishes and congratulations to those who have succeeded in these results.
I would like to once again tell those who have not succeeded that there is a lot to do in life.
If the result has not come according to our will, then no life is stuck.
We should live with faith, we should move ahead with faith.
But a new kind of question has come in front of me and I had never thought about this.
But I was surprised that everybody in the house said this to me, hey, four marks would come more, you would be 90 per cent.
That is, my family and my friend, my teacher - no one was happy with my 89. 33 per cent marks.
Everyone was saying to me, guy, your 90 percent was for four marks.
Now I am not able to understand how to handle such a situation.
Is this everything in life
Wasn't that good what I did
Did I get a little less
I don't know, I feel a burden on my mind.
Honour, I have read your letter very carefully and I think that perhaps this pain will not only be for you but for millions of students like you, because it has become an environment that it is another form of negativeity to discover dissatisfaction instead of satisfaction with what has happened.
We can never take society towards satisfaction by finding dissatisfaction among all things.
If your family and your colleagues appreciated your 89. 33 per cent, you would have decided to do more.
I have written Santosh Giri Goswami from Jodhpur, almost similarly.
They say that people around me are not accepting our results.
I don't remember the poetry, but I had read a long time ago, a poet had written that I made a picture of pain on the lives of the people.
Would that any one-and-a-half audience had also shed tears on the picture of my pain.
These were the words of poetry, I do not remember this now, but there is a long time ago poetry, but this was the feeling.
There is a burden on you to fulfill the expectations of the people.
I will tell you so much that in such a situation you do not lose your balance.
Everyone expresses expectations, listen, but stay on your point and try to do something better.
But you will not satisfy what has been found, then you will never be able to build a new building.
The strong foundation of success is the basis of great success.
The dissatisfaction arising out of success cannot create a staircase for success.
But I want to say this more than the neighbors and parents and colleagues that do not put your expectations on them by please with your children.
Friends, Have they ever failed in life, do they stop living
Those who can never bring good marks in the eam, they go far ahead in the sports, go ahead in music, go ahead in the artwork and go ahead in the business.
God has given some amazing legislation to everyone.
Just identify the power within yourself, emphasize it, you will move forward.
And this happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard the instrument called Santur.
There was a time when the Santur instrument was connected with the Lock Music in the valley of Kashmir.
But there was a Pandit Shiv Kumar who handled him and today made an important instrument of the world.
Shahnai - Shahnai was in a limited place in the entire area of our music.
Most of the kings and princes used to have their place on the gate.
But when Ustad Bismilla Khan handled Shahnai, today became the best instrument of the world, it has become an identity.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I see that the expenditure on health of our poor families also imbalances the track of life.
And it is true that the cost of not being sick is very low, but after being sick, the cost of being healthy is very high.
Why do not we live such a life so that there is no disease, there is no financial burden on the family.
One is the biggest basis for prevention of cleanliness disease.
If someone can do the biggest service of the poor, then cleanliness can be done.
And the other one for which I constantly urge is Yoga.
Some people call it yoga too.
June 21 is International Yoga Day.
There is also an attraction for Yoga throughout the world, there is also reverence and the world has accepted it.
There is an invaluable gift to our ancestors, which we have given to the world.
The world suffering from stress gives Yoga the strength to live a balanced life.
This is the easiest achievements of the person associated with Yoga to remain healthy, to remain balanced, to be rich in determination and to live with unprecedented self-confidence and to be concentrated in every work.
June 21 - Yoga Day, this is not just an event, it increases its business, its place in every persons lives, every person spends 20 minutes, 25 minutes and 30 minutes in his daily routine.
And for this 21st June Yoga Day inspires us.
And sometimes the collective atmosphere causes a change in the life of the person.
Look at it, get it done in your village, get it done in your neighborhood, in your city, in your school, in the institute and in the eveen offices.
Start a month from now, see, you will become a partner on June 21.
I have read several times that whenever there is a collective collection of yoga and pranayama in many offices, the functioning of the entire office increases so much, the culture of the entire office changes and the environment changes.
You must also join that day, the whole world is going to do yoga.
You should not be left behind anywhere, this is my request.
Your health is very important to make India healthy.
My dear countrymen, I continually connect with you through my heart.
Dear Countrymen, greet you all again.
Okay.
Thank you.
Namaste
Mann Ki Baat, April 2016
Please change this situation. Ravi ji has expressed great anger but I believe that perhaps he is not angry at me, he is angry at the situation, you will remember that former President of India, Dr.
P.
J.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that publish only positive news on the first page of the newspaper and he used to say this continuously. Just a few days back, a newspaper had written a letter to me and he had said that we have decided that on Monday we will not give a single negative news, will give a positive news.
This time too I saw that many letters, comments, phone calls have been received, there are many stories, suggestions and inspirations. Everyone wants to do something or the other and wants to say something and there is a lot of things that I want to absorb, but there is a limit of time, so I can not even absorb it.
You will remember that last time I had discussed a book on the stories of Premchand ji and we had decided to share some things with everyone through the Narendra Modi App.
I was watching a large number of people shared information about several types of books
I am happy that people are discussing and discussing the books written on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business, lifestyle and many such topics.
Some people have also advised me to talk about many other books
But one thing I have to acknowledge is that I ' m not going to give a lot of time to read
But there is a need to get a chance to know about several books that you send by writing.
But what this is the experience of the last one month, I think we have to move forward.
Why shouldn't we make a permanent books coorner on the Narendra Modi App and whenever we read a new book, write it there, discuss it and you can also sign a good name for our books coorner.
Friends, It seems that when I touched this thing in the matter of water conservation - but perhaps today I am feeling that even before I say that water conservation was a matter of touching your heart, it was a preferred subject of common man.
And I am feeling that these days the hearts of India have shrunk about water .
Several farewell and effective efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods
The media has launched several innovative campaigns on water conservation
Government, NGOs - are doing something at war level
Seeing the strength of collectiveness, the mind is very happy, it is very satisfying.
Villagers donated labor and worked to provide a certain direction to the waterfalls flowing from the mountain.
That too is a pure indigenous way
This has not only prevented soil cutting and waste of crops, but also the fields are getting water.
You all will also be happy to know that the beautiful state of North East, Meghalaya has become the first state in the country to prepare its water system and water policy.
I congratulate the government there
In Haryana, the cultivation of those crops is being promoted, which require less water and there is no loss to the farmer.
I would like to especially congratulate the Government of Haryana for communicating with the farmers and inspiring them from traditional farming, for low water crops.
The time has come for the festivals .
Many fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals .
Why not use these fairs for water conservation
Every section of the society reaches the fairs
We can give messages of water conservation in these fairs in a very effective manner, exhibitions, nook and plays, festivals and water conservation can be easily accessible.
Friends, Some things fill us with enthusiasm in life and especially the achievements of children, their exploitations, give us new energy and therefore today I want to talk about some children, and these children are Fund Baipatu, Monisha Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aronesh Ganguly and Hrithik Ala-Manda.
You will also be proud and zealous of what I will tell about them.
We all know that cancer is a word that scares the whole world
It seems that these ten children are standing at the door of death, but not only have they defeated the fatal diseases like cancer, cancer, but have illuminated the name of India all over the world with their exploits.
In sports, we often see that sportspersons become champions after winning or playing medals, but this was a rare occasion where they were champions before participating in the sports competition and that too.
In fact, this month, World Children's Winners Games were organized in Moscow.
This is a unique sports tournament in which young cancer residue i.e. those who have come out fighting cancer in their lives take part.
Competitions like Shooting, Hesse, Swimming, Running, Hotball and Tabble Tennis were organized in this competition.
All these ten champions of our country won the medal in this tournament.
Some of these players won medals in more than one game
In fact, 2019 has been a very good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists had launched A-Sat in March and thereafter there was not much discussion of the big and important news like A-Sat at that time in the intervening of the Handriyaan-Two elections.
When we got the ability to kill Satellite, three-seven kilometers away from A-Sat missile in just three minutes.
India, who achieved this achievement, became the fourth country in the world, and now on 22nd July, the entire country saw it with pride how to move towards space from Sriharikota to space.
The pictures of the launch of Handriyaan-Two filled the countrymen with pride and zeal, happiness
Handriyaan-two, this mission is special in many ways
Handriyaan-two, will make our understanding more clear about the moon
This will give us more details about the moon, but if you ask me what two big lessons have been received from Handriyaan-III, then I will say, these two are health and hearings, that is, trust and fearlessness.
We should rely on our talents and capacities, we should believe in our talent and capability.
You will be happy to know that Handriyaan-two is completely in Indian colour.
It is Indian from Heart and Spirit
is completely an indigenous mission
This mission has once again proved that when we have to do something new in the new sector, I have to do something new.
Just as our scientists, in the record time, in the day-night, all the technical issues have been launched by our scientists, they are unprecedented in themselves.
The whole world saw this great penance of scientists
We all should be proud of this and , despite the interruption , they have not changed the time to reach , it is also surprising .
We have to face temporary problems in our lives as well, but always remember that we have the power to overcome it.
Today, through my heart, I want to share information about a very interesting competition with the students friends of the country, about a very interesting competition with young friends, and invite the youth and women of the country to a ui Empathy.
I request young friends and students to participate in this ui Empathy and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with my share.
I urge schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their school victorious.
These victorious students will have a historic event of their lives, but for this, you will have to take part in the ui Empathy, you will have to get the highest marks, you will have to be victorious.
My dear countrymen, you must have done one thing.
Our minds have accelerated the Swachhta Abhiyan from time to time and in the same way efforts being made for cleanliness have always inspired the minds.
Five years ago, the journey started today is creating new standards of cleanliness with the participation of the people.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal position in cleanliness, but the manner in which cleanliness campaign has been successful from public places, it is the strength of the resolve of one crore and thirty crore people, but we are not going to stop so much.
This movement has now moved towards beauty from cleanliness .
Just a few days back, I was watching the story of Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team in Media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has left his job in the US and returned to serve Mother Bharati
He took the initiative to make Delhi not only clean, but also beautiful
He started with his team with the dustbins of Lodhi Garden
Through Street Art, many areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of the Bridge and School to the slums, when they began to drive out their skills, people also got together and in a way this process started.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during Kumbh.
There may not be any voice in the colors and lines, but the messages that are made from these pictures prove to be more effective than thousands of words and also in the beauty of the cleanliness drive.
It is very important for us to have a culture to create wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making waste from waste.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I read a very interesting comment on MyGov.
This conference was from Mohammed Aslam, brother of Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He says it ' s good to hear the talk of mind
I am happy to note that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in my state Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organised in June.
I think such programmes should be held every three months
At the same time, there should also be provision for online monitoring of the programme.
With my view, this was the first such event in which the public interacted directly with the government.
Brother Mohammad Aslam ji sent me this message and after reading it, my keenness to know about the back to hilage programme increased and when I went in detail, I felt that the whole country should also be aware of it.
This program shows how desperate the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development, how enthusiastic it is.
In this program, for the first time, the officers who had never seen the villagers had reached their doorsteps so that the obstacles in development could be understood and solved.
The programme lasted a week and in almost four and a half thousand Panchayats of the State Government officials informed the villagers in detail about government schemes and programmes.
How can Panchayats be further strengthened
How can their income be increased
What can their services affect the lives of the common man  The villagers also told their problems openly .
Friends, This programme was not a government food supply that the officers returned to the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat and got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
Several other things were also included to create an interesting programme
Sports competition for children under Khelo India
The same Sports Kitts, MNREGA job cards and SST certificates were also distributed.
People of Kashmir became participants in this festival of development
It is a matter of great pleasure that the Back to Willage program was organized in remote villages where government officials had to travel on foot for one and a half days while climbing the hills through inaccessible roads.
Many officers were so impressed with their welcome that they stayed in villages for more than two days .
It is very pleasant to organize gram sabhas in these areas, to participate in a large number of people and to prepare schemes for themselves.
New resolution, new enthusiasm and magnificent results
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, they can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendra, honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, presented the glory of the month of Sawan in one of his poems.
People from different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Savan in their own way throughout India.
Whenever we see around us in this season , it seems as if the earth had covered the sheet of greenery .
All around, a new energy begins to be transmitted
In this holy month, many pilgrims visit Kanwad and Amarnath Yatra, while many people fast regularly and eagerly wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami.
During this time, the festival of defense bonds is also a symbol of love of brother and sister.
When it is happening in the month of Sawan, you will be happy to know that this time most pilgrims have joined Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave since 1st July
More than the pilgrims who had joined this journey for 60 days in 2015, have joined only 28 days this time.
For the success of Amarnath Yatra, I especially appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests and their guests.
Those who come back from the journey, they become convinced of the warmth and spirit of the people of the state.
All these things are going to be very beneficial for tourism in the future .
I am told that since the journey of Chardham has started this year in Uttarakhand, more than 8 lakh pilgrims have visited Kedarnath Dham within a month and a half.
After the severe disaster in 2013, for the first time, such a number of pilgrims have reached there.
I appeal to all of you to go to those parts of the country whose beauty is seen during the monsoon.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the passions of the people of our country, tourism and travel can hardly be a teacher bigger than this.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and vibrant month of Savan will communicate with you new energy, new hopes and new hopes.
Likewise , the month of August , leave India , remember it .
I would like you to prepare some special preparations on 15th August to find a new way to celebrate the Festival of Independence
This is the time when heavy rains are occurring in many parts of the country.
By the way when we see the TO, the same aspect of rain shows floods, flooded water, traffic jams on all sides.
Another picture of the monsoon in which our farmers, shine birds, flowing waterfalls, green sheets of greenery, you will have to come out with the family to see it.
Rainfall, freshness and happiness i.e. rains and appenses bring along with you. I wish that this monsoon will continue to fill you with happiness.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
Today people from the Christian community are celebrating the Easter.
I extend my best wishes to all the people on the occasion of Haster.
And for some people, it will also be certified that on the one hand, eam and on the other, T20 ricket world up, maybe even today you will wait for the match of India and Australia.
In the past, India has won two best matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
A good momentum is being seen.
Today, when Australia and India are going to play, I extend my best wishes to the players of both teams.
65 percent of the population is young and we have lost in the world of sports.
Time is a new revolution in sports.
24 teams of the world are coming to play in India.
India won the gold medal in 1951, 1962 Asian Games and India was ranked fourth in the 1956 limpic Games.
But unfortunately, in the last few decades, we walked on the lower edge, left behind, fell down and fell.
Cootball is an opportunity. Can you give me your suggestions
I consider a very big opportunity to brand India globally.
I consider the opportunity to identify the youth power of India, what was found between Match and what was lost in that sense.
With the preparation of this host, we can decorate our strength, express power and we can brand India.
Can you send me your suggestions on this, NarendraModiApp
My dear students, you must have thought of tourism during the holidays.
Some people go out of their states.
Last time I had requested you to upload photos from wherever you go.
People, language, eating and drinking are not aware of what they can see.
India is full of diversity.
Once you get out to see you will be watching you all your life, you will be watching
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to visit a lot.
When he was not the Chief Minister, he was not the Prime Minister and was a young man like you, I traveled a lot.
I consider it a good sign.
It gives an opportunity to see something new in itself.
I hope you can contribute to cleanliness when you visit these holidays
Maybe not happening in a very scientific way, but it is happening.
Can you also emphasize cleanliness on tourism destination as a tourist
I am confident that my young man will help me in this.
India is far behind in tourism compared to the world.
But we should decide that if we have to emphasize our tourism then we can attract the world.
Can attract a large part of the world's tourism to us and provide employment opportunities to millions and millions of young people of our country.
Whether it is government or institutions or society or citizens, we all have to do this together.
Let us try to do something in that direction.
My young friends, I don't like this.
You also think in this direction.
Would you like to let your holidays go like this, the important years of life and its important time
I have an idea to think of you.
Can you make a resolve to add a new thing to your personality, a skill in the holidays
If you don't swim, then you can resolve on holidays, I learn to swim, if you don't have to walk a cycle then I can walk a cycle by setting it in holidays.
Even today, I type computer with two fingers, so can I learn typing
How many types of skills are there for the development of our personality
Why not learn him
Why not remove some of our shortcomings
Why don ' t we express our powers
Now think about it and somebody needs big classes, some trainer needs a lot of jewellery and somebody needs a big budget.
You can also believe that I will make the best of the waste.
Look at something and start creating it.
Prime Minister, in the last summer holidays, you said that birds also feel heat, then we should put a vessel in water and put it on our balcony or roof, so that the birds come and drink water.
I did this work and I enjoyed it, this excuse made me friendly with many birds.
I request you to repeat this work back in mind.
And I wasn't in my mind that today I will say something on this subject but that expression reminded me that last year I am in the utensils of soil outside the house for birds.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to Abhi Chaturvedi for a child.
He called me and reminded me of a good job.
Abhi told me that he has been doing this work for a year and many of his birds have become his friends.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi, loved the birds a lot.
He wrote in his poem - Do not let you go away, fill the courtyard with donations and fill the hood and we will fill the sweet-sweet cold water.
Let us also do this thing of Mahadevi Ji.
I also congratulate congratulate you and express my gratitude to you for remembering me a very important thing.
Shilpa Kuke from Mysore, he has put a big sensitive issue for all of us.
He said that those who sell milk come to our house, those who sell the newspapers come to the postman.
Sometimes those who sell some utensils pass through there, those who sell clothes pass.
Have we ever asked them for water in summer days
Did we ever overwhelm him
I am extremely grateful to you, Shilpa. You have put a very sensitive topic in a very simple manner.
It is true that it is small but if the postman came to the house during summer and how much we would like to drink water.
Well, this is the nature in India.
But I am grateful to Shilpa that you have objected to these things.
What is the situation of the market, what is the situation in the markets, what is the round of good crops these days, which medicines are suitable and many things are on it.
Not only this, there is a button that directly connects you with agricultural scientists, connects you with the experts.
If you put a question in front of him then he answers, explains, you are.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters to download this farmer facility app on your mobile phone.
If you try, what is your use of it
And still if you feel some deficiency then you should also complain to me.
But we also have to think of the countrymen what will happen without water
Is this time we stop coming to our ponds, water flowing through our ponds where garbage or some increment happens, water conservation is gradually decreasing.
Can we prepare those old places once again for more water conservation by digging and cleaning
If the water is saved in the first rain, if the ponds are filled, our rivers are filled with drains, then sometimes the rains are reduced.
This time you must have seen that 5 lakh ponds, fields and ponds have been created.
MGNREGA has also emphasized on creating essays for water conservation.
There will be many villages in the country, there will be many progressive farmers, there will be many aware citizens who have done this work.
But still there is a need to do more.
I welcome it.
The misuse of more fertilizer has made our soil sick and we are sons of Mother Earth, children, how can we see our soil sick
It is similar to the Certificate, however excellent artificial, but if you use more or less artificials then it will become a cause for waste.
The more the water that the farmer will save, the more the life will survive.
My dear countrymen, World Health Day is on 7th April and this time the world has concentrated World Health Day on this theme.
Viabetes is such a host that they are eager to host every disease.
Once the diabetes enters into, a lot of diseases followed by Kurupi guests enter their homes and bodies.
It is said that in 2014 there were about six crore diabetes patients in India.
The reason for 3 percent deaths is that diabetes has been found.
And there are two types of diabetes, one Type-1, Type-II and one Type-I.
And due to Type-2 habits, due to age, due to obesity.
The world is concerned with diabetes, so 7 stars have been kept in World Health Day.
We all know that our life style is the biggest reason for this.
Physiological labor is decreasing.
The name of sweat is not-O-Nishan, it is not going to walk.
Can we do something to defeat the diabetes in our personal life by taking some inspiration from 7th.
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we don't embarrass medicinal check-up.
And after a very bad situation, it comes to mind that Oh, I had a very old diabetes.
On March 24, the world celebrated TB Day.
We know, when I was young, I was afraid of listening to the name of TB.
But the number of TB patients is much compared to the world.
This means that this disease is such that it can be checked soon.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is going on in this direction.
If you check it once.
And this disease can go.
Just get proper treatment and treatment continues until the disease is destroyed.
I would urge you to defeat whether it is TB or Diabetes.
India has to get rid of these diseases.
But it does not happen to the government, doctor, medicine until you do it.
Therefore, today I urge my countrymen to defeat the diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, there are many important occasions in April, especially on 14th April, the birthday of Bhimrao Babasaheb Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country.
We are constantly trying to develop these five pilgrimages.
I am fortunate that on April 14 this year, I am fortunate to visit Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birthplace Mau.
Baba Sahib has given us a lot to become an excellent citizen.
By walking on that path, we can give them great greetings by becoming an excellent citizen.
In a few days, Vikram Sanvat will start.
Different states are celebrated separately.
My best wishes to all for my new year.
You can hear at your own time.
You can hear your mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, best wishes to you all.
The youth of India takes time to look at TB to get information about it.
Perhaps there will be no district of India where I have no opportunity to go.
As before, he does not go to the same route, he wants to do something new, he wants to see something new.
And there is a possibility of a lot of employment through tourism.
And the identity of your personality and your self-confidence will increase so much.
This will probably be a matter of concern among your colleagues.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
If you download it in your mobile phone through the Kisan Facilitation App, you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and water in your palm.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for others, there has been an opportunity for the summer holidays, but for the farmers there is an opportunity to sweat more.
He waits for the rain and before waiting, the farmer gets ready to prepare his farm so that he does not want to waste one drop of rain.
The time for the farmers to start the season of farming is very important.
Doesn't that feel bad to eat
You must worry about him.
But when TB and death were added, we were afraid but now we are unaware of TB.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
You must have listened to my mind on the radio, but the mind must have felt that the children's ease is starting, some people's ease of tenth-eighth is probably starting on March 1.
So it will be the same in your mind too.
I also want to be a partner with you in this visit.
I am also as worried about your children's eam.
But if we change the methodology of seeing the exam, we can also be worrisome.
I had said in my previous mind that you must send your experiences and suggestions on the Narendra ModiApp.
I am glad that the teachers, who have been a career, have sent me a lot of things by the parents and some thinkers of the society.
Secondly, there were thousands of things that I believe that this is probably a very important topic.
But most of us have limited the topic of eam to the school premises or to the family or to the student.
The suggestions made on my App show that this should continue to discuss these subjects of students in a very big way throughout the country.
Today, I want to talk to my parents, examiners and their teachers in this regard.
I have heard what I have read, I will also tell some of what I have been told.
I will add something that I feel.
But I am confident that these 25-30 minutes will be very useful for those students who have to give eam.
I want to recite to you the message they have sent to the youth of India, such a Bharat Ratna Shriman Sachin Tendulkar: - Namaskar, I am speaking Sachin Tendulkar.
I know the Feams are going to start in a few days.
Many of you will also be tense.
My only message is that your parents will do epections from you, your teachers will do it, your other family members will do it, friends.
Wherever you go, everyone will ask how your preparations are going on, how many percents will score you.
I would like to say that you will set some targets for yourself, you will not come in the presumption of any other option.
You will definitely work but set up a real evil target for yourself and try to achieve that target.
So I needed to indulge in a solution for this.
And the same targets I always tried to achieve.
My focus was on ballet pay and targets became self-slope-slope activists.
I would like to tell you that your thinking is very important.
Positive thinking will be followed by positive results.
So you will definitely be positive and the upper one will definitely give you good results, this is my best hope and I would like to give you the best wishes for the eams.
Friends, see what Tendulkar Ji is saying.
Don't suppress it under the burden of epection.
You have to make your own future.
Deciding your goals by yourself, setting your targets by yourself - free mind, free thinking, free power.
Why not compete
Why should we waste our time to compete with others
Why do not we fight ourselves
Why do not we decide to break all our records before us
You see, you will not be able to stop anybody from moving forward and when you break your own record, you will not expect anyone else for happiness and satisfaction.
Santosh will appear from inside.
Friends, do not consider the examination as a game of digits.
Where did you reach, how much
Do not stay in that account.
Life should be linked with a great purpose.
One should walk with a dream and be determined.
These examinations, whether we are going to be right or not, we account for it.
And therefore, if these dreams are made, then the examination will become a joyful festival in itself.
Every examination will be a step to fulfill that great purpose.
Every success will become the key to achieve that great objective.
Take a very big objective and sometimes it will be less than expected, then disappointment will not come.
And to emphasize, and to empower, and to try.
Thousands of people who have written small things from my mobile phone on my app.
Shreya Gupta has stressed that there is a healthy mind in the healthy body.
Students should keep in mind their education as well as their health so that you can write well in the ease.
Now, on the last day, I will not say that you should start penalties and go to run three kilometers and five kilometers.
But one thing is correct, how is your routine in the days of ease
Anyway, our routine should be conducive to our dreams and resolves for 365 days.
I agree with one thing of Shriman Prabhakar Reddy Ji. He has urged us to sleep on time and revise early in the morning.
Entrance certificates and other things should be accessed from time to time at the Hamination Centre.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said that I do not dare to say because I am a little indifferent about sleeping and my sufficient friends also complain to me that you sleep very little.
This is my deficiency, I will also try to cure it.
Definite sleep time, deep sleep - this is as important as your activities throughout the day and this is possible.
Otherwise there is a habit of some people, they keep talking on a long telephone before sleeping.
And when I talk of sleeping, do not think that I am asking you to sleep for eam.
I am talking about sleeping for a stress-free stage to give you a good test on the Time of Eam.
I'm not talking about sleeping.
Otherwise, it should not be such that the marks should come down and ask mother why sons and sons should come down. Say that Modi had asked him to sleep, so I was asleep.
Will you not do this
I don't believe you.
If one-and-a-half part of our body suffers a little then you must have seen that the entire body does not feel comfortable.
Not only this, our routine is also scattered.
And so we don't consider anything small.
You can see, do not compress yourself in the habit of composing it.
Deciding, see.
You must have seen these two types of people.
There is a negative impact on how the paper comes in its tension.
On Viswanathan Anand, he will tell his experiences.
You must have seen, their eyes also do not go around.
Never we used to listen, the incident of Arjun's life was how he looked at the bird's eyes.
Just likewise, when we see Viswanathan playing, his eyes are at a very big target and it is the expression of inner peace.
It is true that someone should say, so that peace within will come again, it is difficult to say but it should be tried.
You are not talking to friends or walking alone, swinging and swinging, swinging a lot of books, then it cannot be a calm mind.
You can imagine that you stand on the bank of a pond and look very good things below.
But suddenly if a stone starts swinging in water, then what was the best thing that looked below
If the water is calm, then things are seen as deep as it is.
But if the water is disturbed, then nothing is seen below.
You will not be able to find the treasury if there is an uncomfortable mind.
If you feel calm, then your treasure will emerge completely and your ease will be simpler.
So sometimes I try to understand more concentration and I feel stress within one.
Then I feel like, or not, if I relax a little then I will be good.
So I have developed myself.
Very deep breathing.
I breathe deep.
Three-five times I breathe deeply, the time goes up to 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, but then my heart gets ready to understand things.
This might be my experience, you can also be useful.
Rajat Agarwal has told a good thing.
If parents have also been read in the house and even if there are teachers in it, then tell the entire paper again what you wrote, what happened
Yeah, I made a mistake.
Hey, man, I knew it, but I didn't remember it.
We get stuck in it.
Fresh the memories of old laughter and happiness.
Sometimes you have gone somewhere with your parents, remember the scenes there.
Just get out of them and spend half an hour.
The matter of silver is really like understanding.
Ramcharitmanas, while interpreting him in the present context, is trying to reach Sarita in the country and the world.
I am also grateful to my devotee Murari Bapu that he gave us a very good message.
Friends, today I want to tell you another thing.
I am seeing that this time the people who have told me their experiences have definitely discussed Yoga.
And it is a matter of great pleasure for me that somebody who I meet in the world don't get a little time, somebody does something about Yoga.
Well Friends, I just say today, start doing yoga from tomorrow morning, it will be injustice to you.
But those who do yoga are at least feams, so don't do it today.
Do it then.
But it is true that whether the student is in life or in life, Yoga is a very big key in the development journey of Internalism.
Simple key is simple.
You must pay attention to him.
Yes, if you are aware of any yoga near you, you will ask them, you will not have done the first yoga in the days of the ease, then you will tell two or four things that you can do in two to five minutes.
Look, if you can
Yes, I have a lot of faith in it.
My young friends, you are very quick to go to the examination hall.
Why do you do these things in a hurry
Why do not you manage your entire day so that if you stay in traffic, we can reach on time.
Otherwise, such things create a new tension.
And one thing is that in the time we have received, the question papers which are infrastructures, sometimes we feel that it will be our time.
This is not the case, my friends.
You can read those instructions closely. There will be no loss of two minutes and three minutes.
But with self-confidence, this paper is now with me, no new questions are coming, I have to deal with the same questions and when I started thinking again, he has written that I understand this paper so easily, for the first time I had read it, but I did not read the same thing again, then I realized that no questions have been placed in other ways, but this is the same thing I know.
It is very important to understand questions.
Do not understand questions, sometimes the question looks difficult.
I urge Yash Nagar to read questions twice, read questions three times, read four times and try to match with what you know and it will be easier before writing questions.
It is a matter of great happiness for me today that Bharat Ratna and our very respected scientist CNR Rao have stressed on patience.
In very few words, but we have given a very good message to all the students.
Whatever I take half an hour to say, they say in three minutes.
This is the power of science and this is the power of scientific mind.
I am extremely grateful to Rao Saheb that he inspired the children of the country.
Whatever they have said, the determination and determination, the same thing is dedication, determination, deligency, stand still, friends, stand still.
If you are standing, then you will also be afraid.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do good.
Now a message on my App has been shared by Ruchika Dabbus.
He said that there is a continuous effort to create a positive atmosphere at the time of ease in his family and this discussion was also held in his fellow families.
Together, positive environment.
This is true as Sachin ji said, positive approach, positive frame of mind positive energy.
You may not be at any stage of life, excellent examples, truthful incidents also inspire a lot, give a lot of strength and create a new path during the crisis.
We all read about the inventor Thomas Elva Edison of the Electricity Bulb in our syllabus.
But today that electricity, that bulb also illuminates the lives of the people.
It is said that failure also contains the possibility of success.
JK Rolling is an excellent example that success can ever be achieved.
Harry Potter Services is popular all over the world today.
But it was not like that from the beginning.
How many problems they had to face.
Rolling himself had said that in difficulties, all the energy used to be used in the work that was really important for them.
Nowadays, it is not just the student but also the entire family and the entire school, the teacher.
But without the support system of parents and teachers alone, the situation is not good.
If we move ahead with a team like a unit, with a similar thinking, with a planned method, the examination becomes easier.
Shriman Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on App, he has complained that parents should never pressurize their children to ask for more marks.
Only encouraged to prepare.
They should be relaxed and worry about it.
Vijay Jindal writes, do not burden the children with their expectations.
This is right.
I don't want to tell Parents more today.
Please do not make pressure.
If he is talking to any of his friends, do not stop.
Make a light atmosphere, create a positive environment and see how much your son or daughter will come.
We like to join him.
We also want to move ahead of the week of science.
The curiosity is the birth of science.
Knowledge, Science and Technology should be an easy part of our development journey and this time theme of National Science Day is Make in India.
Friends, Sometimes successes are achieved in a very long way and when success is achieved, the view of the world also changes.
If you might have been very busy in the ease, then perhaps there might have been a lot of news that has not been registered in your mind.
But I want to reiterate this to the countrymen.
You must have heard in the past that there has been a huge and important dinner in the world of science.
The scientists of the world worked hard, generations went on coming, doing something or the other, and after about 100 years a success took place.
The gravitational aspects were demonstrated and detailed from the pursuit of our scientists.
This is a far-reaching success of science.
This discovery not only proves the theory of our great scientist Einstein in the last century but is considered a great discovery for physics.
This entire humanity is going to work around the world, but as an Indian, we all are happy to know that the rich and promising scientists of our country were associated with it in the process of search.
I want to congratulate all those scientists with my heart today.
In the future, our scientific efforts will be made to pursue this food.
There is such a system in two places in the world, India is the third.
The connectivity of India will give this process a new strength and a new momentum.
India will also become an active partner in the process of this great scientific dinner of human welfare between its limited resources.
Once again I congratulate all the scientists and congratulate them.
My dear countrymen, I write a number to you, you can listen to my heart by calling a missed call from tomorrow, you can listen to your mother tongue.
I also have to give exam tomorrow.
25 billion Indians are going to take my immination.
But, you must have seen, I must have heard, how well I am, how confident I am.
Just get my ease tomorrow and start yourself.
And if we all succeed then the country will also succeed.
So, my friends, my best wishes to you all.
Stay away from the stress of success and failure.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2015
I take a lot of look at my portal, Shriman Ganesh V.
No, we have to make changes in the requirements of India. The poor man wages somewhere, he has physical labor, but by innovation a young man makes a thing that the poor gets a little facility in the wages. I also consider it a start-up. I would like to ask the bank to help such a young man, I would also ask him to move ahead with courage.
Then I came to my mind that we feel that it is perhaps a disabled person, but experience feels that he has an extra power and then I thought that why should we use the Divine Word instead of disabled in our country these are those people who have a part or more organs which have divine power, which we do not have ordinary people, I feel very good that if my countrymen are able to transmit the word Divine in place of disabled persons
Send me to this portal, I would certainly like my country's younger generation to think of the duty I would like to give a little suggestion. When we celebrate Republic Day on 26th January, can we celebrate the birth anniversary of the citizens, the children of schools and colleges, the statues of the great men in our city, the cleanliness, the cleanliness of the premises, the best cleaning of the premises, the best cleaning and the best decorations can be held on 26th January
Dear Countrymen, Namaste
During the holy festival of Deepawali, you must have celebrated holidays very well.
There will also be an opportunity to go somewhere.
And with new zeal and enthusiasm, business employment has also started.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas will also start.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
Sometimes the festival works to cure wounds and sometimes the festival gives new energy.
But sometimes when the crisis comes in this time of the festival, it becomes more painful and painful.
From every corner of the world, news of natural calamity comes continuously.
Neither have you ever heard nor have you ever thought about such natural calamities.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of climate change is increasing.
In our country, in the past, the manner in which the rains and the untimely rains have been affected for a long time, especially in Tamil Nadu, and the states have also been affected.
Many people died.
I express my condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
State governments gather with full force in relief and rescue operations.
The central government also always works shoulder to shoulder.
Now a team of Indian government has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But I am confident that despite this crisis on the power of Tamil Nadu, he will once again move forward at a very fast pace and the role he plays in pursuing the country.
But when we look at the problems around it, we need to make a lot of changes.
15 years ago, the natural calamity used to be part of an agricultural department, because then more natural calamities i.e. famine was still limited.
Today its form has changed.
After the Nepal earthquake, I spoke to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shriman Nawaz Sharif.
A good start has happened.
Today, I have received a phone call from Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar in Punjab.
I am speaking to Lakhwinder Singh, Punjab district Jalandhar.
We make organic farming here and also guide many people about farming.
I have a question of how to guide the salt or wheat shrubs that are destroying the micro-organisms that are the mother Earth and how can it be relieved in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
Lakhwinder Singh ji, I am very happy to hear your message.
One Anand was that you are a biological cultivator.
And yourself make organic farming, not only that, you understand the problem of farmers well.
And your concern is correct but this is not just in Punjab, Haryana.
This is the habit of our people throughout India and traditionally we follow the path of burning our crop residues.
Secondly, what are the measures that are not even trained.
And when the impact of this crisis began to come to the cities, even a little sound was heard.
But the pain you have expressed is correct.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are also very precious.
They themselves are a biological fertilizer.
Secondly, due to this burning, the upper layer of the earth is burnt.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for a moment, think that our bones are strong, our hearts are strong, kidneys are good, everything is good but if the skin above the body is burnt then what will happen
Similarly, burning the remains of these crops does not only burn the lips, it burns the skin of the earth mother.
The upper layer of our land burns, which pushes our fertile land towards death.
Therefore, his positive efforts should be made.
Once again, it is fertilizer.
Or if a pit is pierced in a pit and put a little water of saffron then it comes out of the best type of organic manure.
Once I got an opportunity to interact with the farmer brothers who cultivated bananas.
And they told me a great experience.
Earlier, when they used to cultivate bananas and when the banana crops were finished, they had to spend 5 thousand, 10 thousand and 15 thousand rupees per hectare to clean the bananas.
And as long as those who pick up him did not bring the tractor-vactory, they used to stand like this.
But some farmers proveed that piece of 66, 8-8 inches of that piece and buried it on the ground.
So the experience came that there is so much water in this banana that if there is a tree, there is a plant, if there is a crop then there is no need to get out for three months.
Those who had to spend the first cleaning of the thighs, today they have increased the demand for thickness.
A small experiment can also be a big advantage. These are not less than our farmer brothers.
Dear countrymen, on December 3, the International Day of Persons with Disaster Responsibility will be remembered throughout the world.
Last time I had discussed the issue of generation.
I had also discussed the Healthline of the NEET for transgression and I was told that there has been an increase of about 7 times in the phone calls after that.
Many well-known people, including film actress Ravina Tandon, are associated with it.
Worgan collaboration can save valued lives.
Angan donation comes in a way with immortality.
When the organ goes from one body to another, that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
What can be the best donation from this
I am confident that there will also be widespread awareness on this sector and in true sense, the needy will get better help, because these help cannot be received from anywhere until no one donates.
As I told earlier, 3 December is celebrated as Disabled Day.
Physically and mentally handicapped people are also rich in unprecedented courage and capability.
Sometimes the pain occurs when sometimes they are ridiculed.
Sometimes the feelings of compassion and mercy are expressed.
But if we change our vision and change their vision, they can inspire us to live.
Some can inspire to go through.
If we get a little trouble then we sit to cry.
Then it is remembered that my crisis is very small, how does it pass
And therefore, these are the source of inspiration for us.
His willpower, his way of fighting with life and his challenge to convert the crisis into capability.
Javed Ahmed, I want to tell him today.
4042 is aged.
In 1996, Javed Ahmed was shot by terrorists in Kashmir.
I lost a part of the intestine and the intestine.
Serious aspects of nature have become special injury.
The ability to stand on his feet went forever, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
Terrorism injury could not even reflect them.
His own tongue, but the biggest thing is that without reason, a innocent person has suffered such a big problem, youth has been in danger, but no resentment, no anger, Javed Ahmed has turned this crisis into sensitivity.
He dedicated his life to social service.
The body does not give up but for 20 years they have been drowned in children's education.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped people
How to develop systems for disabled in public places, government offices
They are working on it.
Is Javed's life enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember Javed Ahmed's life, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
In the absence of time, I am talking about Javed but in every corner of India such inspiration is burning.
Giving new lights to live, showing the path.
On 3rd December, there is an opportunity to inspire them to remember everybody like this.
Our country is so huge.
There are many things in which we are dependent on the governments.
Whether it is a middle class person or a middle class person or a poor, a poor, a dalit, afflicted, afflicted, deprived and deprived, there is constant connection with government arrangements with the government.
And as a citizen, sometimes there is a bad experience of some government Babu in life.
And that evil experience changes our vision of looking at the government system throughout the life.
There is a truth in it but sometimes lakhs of people sitting in this government do good work with service, dedication and dedication.
Sometimes we don't even know because it is so simple that we don't know that any government system is doing this thing.
ASA workers in our country who are networking across the country.
We have never heard of the discussions between the people of India regarding the ASA workers.
But when I have succeeded in the world as a world famous family उद्यमer of the Billgates Foundation, his success has become an example.
We had given the joint Padma Vibhushan to both such billgates and Milindagates last time.
They do very social work in India.
They are spending their time of their retirement and spending whatever they have earned for the poor.
Whenever they come and meet and those who have got the opportunity to work with the ASA workers, praise them so much, and they have so much to say that they work as much as they dedicate to the hope-worker.
How excited is it to learn new and new things, he explains these things.
In the past, the Orissa Government has specially honored an ASA worker on Independence Day.
Tendagaon, a small village in Balasore district of Orissa, is a hopeful worker and all the population there is a scheduled tribe.
And there is a area affected by malaria.
And Jamuna Mani Singh, a hope worker of this village, decided that now I will not let anyone die from malaria in this Teendagaon.
He's gonna get a little bit of fever when he comes home.
Based on the primary arrangements that have been taught to him, it should be taken for treatment.
Emphasis on the use of pesticides in every household.
As soon as his own child sleeps properly and as much as the care should be done, ASA worker Jamuna Mani Singh works with dedication to avoid the entire village mosquitoes.
And he competed with malaria, prepared to fight the entire village.
So how much Jamuna Mani will be
How many millions of people will be around us
We'll see them a little honourably.
Such people become the greatest strength of our country.
How to become a big companion of the happiness and misery of society
I extend my best wishes to all such ASA workers through Jamuna Mani.
I urge you to see this.
Not only this, you can also read it and you may like to add such things.
positive power is the biggest energy.
Discuss Books and if an enthusiastic young man goes to the schools of the neighborhood and tell the children of class VIII, Ninth and Class VIII that see brother, this happened here.
So you can become a social teacher in true sense.
I invite you to join you in nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is concerned about climate change.
There is also concern about climate change, global warming, and it is getting approval as a standard before doing every work.
Earth's temperature should not be increased now.
This is also the responsibility of everyone.
Once I had said that on the night of full moon you should take a bath in the full moonlight by shutting down the street lights.
The light of that moon should be experienced.
When a friend had sent me a link and I got the opportunity to see him, I felt that I would tell you this too.
No one seems to have got the opportunity to read more than a woman T by doing Noorjah in Kanpur.
But one such thing is doing that which perhaps no one has thought.
He is working to provide light to the poor using solar energy.
He is fighting against the dark and illuminating his name.
He has created a committee of women and has planted a solar energy lantern and he gives lanterns at a rent of Rs. 100 per month.
About Rs. 3-4 per day is spent but the entire house keeps illuminating and it keeps working throughout the day to recharge the lantern with solar energy in that plant.
Now look what the world's big people will do for climate change, but a light is probably inspiring everyone.
And anyway, Noorjahan means to illuminate the world.
The light is spreading through this work.
I congratulate Noorjahan and I congratulate Jee T because he presented this work in front of the country and the world in a small corner of Kanpur.
Excellent greetings.
Thank you Abhishek ji.
The message you sent from Gorakhpur.
Prime Minister MRA Scheme and the Ununded.
Those who do not get the money get the money.
However, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But in such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people got 42 thousand crore rupees from Prime Minister MRA scheme.
Dhobi, Nai, the news seller, the milk seller.
And I am happy that there are about 24 lakh women in these 66 lakhs.
And most of these helpers are those people of SEC, SECT and BC who try to run the family with respect to their feet by working hard on their own.
Abhishek himself has told his enthusiasm.
I've got a lot of news.
Someone has just told me that there is a Shailesh Bhosale in Mumbai.
He got a loan of Rs. 8.5 lakh from the bank under the MRA scheme.
And they started business of cleaning and swag dress.
During my cleanliness drive, I had said that cleanliness drive is such that it will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhosale showed.
They have brought a tanker and I was told that in such a short span of time, they also returned the bank.
Eventually this is the intention of our MRA scheme.
Someone told me about Bhopal's Mamta Sharma that she received 40 thousand rupees from the bank from this Prime Minister MRA scheme.
He is working to make a batua.
And he used to make a batua but earlier he used to take money from more interest and used to do business hardly.
Now due to his good amount of money coming together, he made his work more good.
And earlier due to the extra interests and due to the reasons, the money spent for him was more than a thousand rupees per month due to his coming in his hand.
And his family also started growing a good business gradually.
But I would like the plan to be more propagated.
All our banks are more sensitive and help more and more small people.
In fact, these people run the economy of the country.
People doing small things are the economic power of the country's economy.
We want to emphasize that.
It's good, but it's better.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel on 31st October, I had discussed an India-Shreshtha Bharat.
These are things that should be consistently aware of social life.
National Jagriyam Vyam International Vigilance is the Prior of Liberty, the unity of the country should continue this rites.
I want to give it the form of a scheme in India-Shreshtha Bharat.
MyGov had asked for suggestions on it.
How is the structure of the programme
What's the people
How to increase public participation
I had said for all the suggestions.
I was told that many suggestions are coming.
But I expect more suggestions.
Some big questions have also been announced.
You should also put your creative mind.
How can this mantra of unity be made one India-Shreshtha Bharat connected this mantra to one Indian
What is the plan, what is the program
Be it animals, be it magnificent, be it lifestyle and be simple to connect everyone.
What do the government do
What will viville society do
There may be many things.
You enjoy wearing clothes, but I'll be urging you to exercise.
I would like to urge you to keep your body balanced for some time or the other.
And create an atmosphere in the family, it is a festival of the family, it is an hour to do it together.
So there is good weather, then there is a good habit too.
Once again, I got the opportunity to join you with my heart.
Today, the fifth day match between India and South Africa is going to play in Mumbai.
This series is named Gandhi Mandela series.
Therefore, the importance of the last match has increased further.
My best wishes to all my players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of Kannur Centre of Akashwani.
Congratulations are because when I started talking about the mind, many people went to join him.
In it, a 12th student of Kerala was associated with Shraddha Thamban.
I once again have to talk about Kerala today.
The students of Saint Mary Pepper-Primary School of Chittor, Kochi, Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter is differently special.
Once these girls have made a picture of Indo-Mata with their thumb mark, on a very big cloth.
That picture of India-Mother and map of India has been sent to me.
Earlier I was surprised why he made a map of India with his thumb mark.
But when I read his letter, I came to know how well he has delivered a symbolic message.
These are the boys who have tried to awaken the Prime Minister, it is not so.
He is also trying to make people aware in his field and his mission is Angadan.
They are running public awareness campaign for rgan donations.
He has also done dramas by going to many places so that people understand the donations.
Angan donation became a tendency and tendency.
These girls have written to me in the letter that you appeal to people about organ donation in your mind.
He says Angadan should make a festival.
These days I have a lot of messages on phone calls too.
Devesh of Delhi has given me a similar message.
Every year one lakh eyes need light.
The body's organ can be tonated when death occurs in road accidents.
Some legal entanglements are also very much.
Efforts have been made to guide the states in this direction.
Some states have made a great effort to reduce paperwork and accelerate it.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the advanced row in the field of Organ donation.
Several social institutions and several NGOs are doing a very good job in this direction.
The National Organization and Tissue Transplant Organization (NET) has been established to promote Organ Transplant.
A 247 Welpline 1800114770 service is also available.
And it has been said here that the joy of renouncing your technician Bhunjitha is the best description in this mantra.
We all had seen on TV that a poor player, Hawker and his wife were transplanted in GB Pant Hospital, Delhi.
And these livers were brought from Lucknow to Delhi by special arrangements.
And that operation was successful.
A life survived.
Angadan Mahadan
Let us fulfill this feeling and we must emphasize this.
Dear Countrymen, we have just celebrated the festival of Navaratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days, they will also celebrate the festival of Deepawali.
Eid is also celebrated, Ganesh-Churthi is also celebrated.
For the first time on the soil of India, such a big scale is being organized.
Leaders of Chavan African countries and Unions have been invited.
A major conference of African countries is being held outside Africa.
The relationship between India and Africa is deep.
The population of India is as much as the population of African countries.
And if we meet both then we are one-third of the world's population.
And it is said that lakhs of years ago, it was the same land area.
Later these two pieces were divided from the Indian Ocean.
There is a lot of similarity between us.
And about 27 lakh people of India have lived in these countries for a long time.
India has economic relations with African countries, cultural relations, diplomatic relations, but India plays a very important role in training the younger generation of most African countries.
More than 25,000 African students have read the Human Resource Development, Aapacity Building in India.
And today there are leaders from many countries of Africa who have read in India.
So how deep is our relationship
And from that point of view this summit is very important.
Usually when the meeting is held, heads of different countries are found.
Similarly, there is a meeting of the heads in a summit.
See this is our endeavor that it should also be a meeting of the people.
And this time, the Government of India, especially the URL Ministry, made a very good programme.
A day competition was organised among the children of the universities of the BSF, a program of writing poems and a program of enhancing their participation was organized.
About 16 hundred schools participated in it.
There were also schools outside India and India.
And thousands and thousands of schoolchildren wrote about the strengthening of Indo-Africa relations.
On the other hand, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi from Porbandar to Memorials of Mahatma is reaching Delhi on 29th October while visiting Northern states from Porbandar.
Millions of schoolchildren saw this exhibition, the villagers and the villagers saw it.
There were many best creations in the competition that took place.
I look forward to a composition, I like it, so I want to tell you.
But it clearly shows us how the opportunity to connect people.
I congratulate the dignity, all the children participating in it, more than 1600 schools and the RD Ministry.
On August 15, I had last made a proposal regarding MP Adarsh Gram Yojana.
After that many MP friends realized this work.
Keep engaged with great mind.
There was a workshop in Bhopal last month.
In which these ideal villages are happening, the head of the village, the collector there, some MPs, the Indo-Government, the state-Government, all together discussed deeply about the ideal village scheme.
Under the influence of these Left militants, many areas have been wasted.
But our MPs, however, are very senior, sometimes there are deputy-speakers in the Parliament, Shriman Karia Munda ji and tribals have spent their lives.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to make ideal village.
I congratulate the dignitaries, Shriman Karia Munda Ji.
I got the same news from Andhra.
Andhra MP Ashok Gajapati Raju ji himself spent the scheme of Adarsh Gram and he chose the village panchayat for Adarsh Gram through Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The rest of the system is being done, but they have done a big special innovative work.
Shriman Ruwala Ji launched the Kurtayi Kut Sugarcane Festival on 11th March in the village.
People of all the region united in it.
How can the village be made the centre of economic activity, how can it be marketed in the village itself.
Their efforts to build an Adarsh village as well as an self-reliant village are really the officers of Shriman Ruwala ji.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it happen if there is talk of cleanliness or cleanliness
Savita Rai from Mumbai has sent a message through a telephone. Every year we clean our houses for the preparation of Diwali.
We can make this Diwali clean along with our houses as well as the environment outside us and keep it clean even after Diwali.
They have attracted attention to the right thing.
I would like to recall you, my dear countrymen, after the Diwali festival last year, the media, especially in our country, launched a big campaign and all those things where the firecrackers were lying after Diwali and they said that this is not right.
So your point is correct that we should do whatever we worry before the festival even after the festival.
Every public program should be done.
And today, I especially congratulate the entire media world of India.
India Awards and I was also watching how many kinds of activities are going on.
How people are working as a One Like One Mission for this.
How are the places that have been kept so clean in our country
All these things were exposed and I congratulated the commendable work of the India TV Group at that time.
Since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan has been launched, I have seen that TNEDU from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and especially Shriman Ramuji Rao is very old but the enthusiasm that he has is not less than a young man.
And he added about 51 lakh children from around 55-56 thousand schools to this work within Andhra and Telangana.
Be it public places, stations or religious places, hospitals or parks, in many places a big campaign of cleanliness was launched.
Now these news shows the power to realize the dream of a clean India in itself.
ABP News launched this programme in the name of my country and worked to train the people of the country by highlighting the awareness of cleanliness.
There are hundreds of channels of our country, thousands of newspapers and everybody, I am unable to take the names of all, but this campaign has been launched.
And therefore, the suggestions made by Savita Rai ji today the entire country is assuming this work and moving it forward.
From Meghalaya, our Governor, Shriman Shanmuganathan, he has written a letter to me and has mentioned me about the Mavalyannong village of Meghalaya by writing a letter.
He has written that for the last several years, this village has been taking up a piece of cleanliness and almost every generation is completely dedicated to this cleanliness.
And it is said that a few years ago, he had received the award as the Leanest Alliance of Asia.
That is why we all believe that our country will definitely be clean.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to sacrifice our lives with dignity and say that we have saved our mother India from dirt.
My dear countrymen, I had told the Red Fort on August 15 that there are some things where corruption has been done.
When the poor person goes for a small job, nobody knows what he has to suffer and how to grabbe money from the brokers.
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in the world who takes a complete look at a person in an interview of one minute and two minutes.
And with this idea, I had announced that why we are the servants of this small piracy, we should finish the tradition of interview.
My dear young friends, I am proud to say today that the government has completed all the procedures and there will be no interviews for recruitment in the posts of Group D, Group C and Group B of the Central Government.
1st January, 2016 will be implemented
We will not make any hindrance in where the process is going on, but it will be implemented from January 1, 2016.
So my best wishes to all young friends
Similarly, in the last budget we had announced an important scheme.
Gold in our country has become a part of social life in a way.
Gold has been considered as a medium of economic security.
The crisis is considered to be the key gold of the time.
Gold can be the economic wealth of the country and every Indian should contribute to it.
Today, I am happy that in the festival of Diwali which we had promised in the budget and when Dhanteras and people buy gold especially on that day, we are going to launch important schemes before that.
We have brought the World Monetization Scheme.
Under this, you can deposit your gold bank and the bank will give you interest on it as you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier we used to keep the gold locker and we had to pay the locker rent.
Now the gold will be kept in the bank and the money bank will give you as interest.
Say that the countrymen can now become gold assets or not
Can the gold be transformed into a living force from Head-Money
Just this is what we have to do, you give me.
Now do not keep gold in the house.
One more thing is that you dont have to sleep in the sovereign world bonds.
So instead of that paper, you will get two and a half thousand rupees.
So we are starting it.
Where to keep gold, his concern will be removed, and no one will come to steal the paper.
So I will definitely put this scheme with security guarantee in front of the countrymen in the coming weeks.
I am happy to state that we are also bringing gold quins.
Around 70 years of independence, but we have been using the Foreign Gold Oil or the World Bulliion Birs.
At the same time, the Gold Course of 20 grams will also be available for the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring a new change in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, on October 31, Iron Man Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel is the birth anniversary.
One India Best India
As soon as Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel remembers, the map of the entire India comes out.
This great man has contributed a lot to the unity of India.
He has introduced his strength as iron-male.
We will pay tribute to Sardar Saheb, but he had the dream of uniting India.
Geographically, he showed tax, but the mantra of unity should be the medium of our contemplation, behavior and expression.
Many sects, many sects, many quotes, many castes, many climates, how many varieties of our country and this diversity is our glory.
If this diversity was not there then perhaps we cannot do the glory we proudly.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, goodwill, unity are the medicinal herbs of development.
Over the last several years, on October 31, there are programmes of Run for NITI in many corners of the country.
I have heard that this time too its plans are being made around, people are preparing for the race for unity with enthusiasm.
The race of unity is the race for development in true sense.
In other words, the guarantee of development is also a race for unity.
Come, pay tribute to Sardar Saheb.
Proceed the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, now all of you will be engaged in the preparations for Diwali.
New things will be purchased.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated differently in every corner of our country.
I extend my best wishes to you for the holy festival of Deepawali.
But, in the days of Diwali, some accidents also come in mind.
My dear countrymen, I have to visit Britain on the second day of Deepawali.
I am very excited for my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also give scholarships to such children who go abroad to study such classes of society, be it Dalits, tribals or backward.
I am confident that when such children of India go to study in the UK, this place of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage for them, inspirational land and learning something in life but later living for the country, this message was given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And that is why I am saying that in my visit to Britain, I am particularly thrilled, I have been enthusiastic for many years and now that building is the property of 1. 25 billion people, if Baba Saheb Ambedkar is associated with the name then you can imagine how much people like me will be.
I am going to get another opportunity in London, the unveiling of the statue of Lord Vishweshwar.
Several years ago, the work done by Lord Vishwaswar for democracy and for the Employment of Women is a really studying aspect of the world.
It is an excellent example of how many centuries ago the great men of India used to think about the statue of Lord Vishweshwar on the land of London.
So you know that when such incidents are connected, the minds of all the countrymen get thrilled.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with the matter of mind.
Through the telephone, your suggestions are available to me through MyGov.
Akashwani is also discussed in your letters.
There is talk of calling government officials.
Some people write their problems, efforts are also made to solve problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
Some languages have been fortunate to learn but yet there are so many languages where I learned
But still I am grateful to Akashwani that it broadcasts this mind in every state's regional language at 8 o'clock in the night.
Even if that voice is of someone else, but it is of my mind.
Last time I was completing one year today we are entering the new year.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes.
Jai Hind
Mann Ki Baat, September 2015
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all
I don't believe that it is good to see that the Parliament of the country is also discussing for the sanitation of India. On the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, the Parliament and on the one hand the child of this country should talk about sanitation, what can be the greatest fortune of the country.
Institutions of local Swaraj - Panchayat, Municipality, Municipality, Municipality, Municipal Corporation, State or Center - Everyone has to work on it. We have to move forward this movement, we have to move ahead despite the deficiencies, and when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
And I was surprised that the girl, the entire Gita, was consistent with her, but the biggest thing that when I asked her, she used to tell her, she used to define her, define her in Hindi, I asked her father, I asked her father, she said, I have said, I have learnt, I have learnt.
We do not even know, so I said, and what is the situation in studies, just the Gita reads and does something
Once again, I got the opportunity to come amongst you to talk about my mind.
In the remote south, people are in the festival of Onam, and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The Government of India has implemented several new schemes for social security for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short span of time, in a comprehensive quantity, everyone has accepted these schemes.
I had made a small passage that we should give this security scheme to our sisters on the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
I am aware that eleven crore families have been associated with this scheme since the launch of the scheme.
And I was also told that nearly half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
I consider it a good sign.
I extend my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken in large numbers a year ago.
I also saw the richness of the poor.
The ero Balance had to open an account but the poor saved and saved the amount of Rs.
The mainstream of the economy is also banking sector and this system has also emphasized the scheme of bank friends to reach the poor house.
Today more than 1. 25 billion bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got jobs.
And now thousands of people have become entitled to take overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana.
And the poor can get money from the bank, this belief is also born.
Once again, I congratulate all those concerned and all those who open the bank accounts, I urge the poor brothers and sisters not to break the bank relations.
This bank is yours, you should not leave it anymore.
I'm brought up to you, it's your job to hold him now.
All of us should be active
But in a very short time, the enlightened people of Gujarat, all my civilian brothers and sisters took care of the situation.
Active role played in preventing the situation from deteriorating and once again Gujarat went on the path of peace.
This is the right path of peace, unity and brotherhood and we have to walk shoulder to shoulder on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the past, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
There was an opportunity to listen to them.
And I tell the truth that the way I got the opportunity to listen to them, a music is playing in a way.
The selecting of his words, the way of his conversation, i.e. the generosity of the Sufi tradition, the beauty that has a music love, all of them have been experienced among these scholars.
I liked it very much.
Perhaps the world has become the most necessary to realize the true nature of Islam.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition, which is associated with love, is associated with generosity, will reach this message far and wide, which will benefit mankind and Islam.
And I also tell others why we dont believe in any sect, but sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
In the coming days, I am going to get another opportunity and I consider this invitation as my fortune.
In India, the learned Buddhist traditions from many countries of the world are coming to Bodh Gaya and are going to discuss global issues related to humanity, I have also received an invitation and it is a matter of great happiness for me that those people have invited me to come to Bodh Gaya.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru was Bodh Gaya.
I am going to get the opportunity to go to Bodh Gaya with these scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I want to tell you something special today.
I have already mentioned this topic in the matter of mind.
You must have heard me in Parliament, you must have heard me in public meetings, you must have heard in the matter of mind.
Every time I have come to say one thing that the government's mind is open about the dispute about the And Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion of the interest of the farmers, I have been repeatedly saying this.
This means that the situation that was before my government was formed has now been replaced.
But there was one thing incomplete, and there were 13 points which had to be completed in a year and therefore we brought it to the economy, but the matter was also entangled due to these disputes.
The economy is finishing but it is going to provide direct benefit to the farmers, the direct economic benefits of the farmers are connected to those 13 points, we have been implementing the rules and today that farmers should not be harmed, economic losses, and therefore the 13 points which were yet to be implemented in the earlier law are being completed today. And I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that for us, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is not the slogan for us, this is our mantra - the welfare of the village and the poor farmer. And then we had said on August 15 that not just the agriculture department but the agriculture and the farmers welfare department will be decided very fast.
I have to say one more thing that it was fifty years before the 1965 war and whenever it comes to the war of 1965, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
It is very natural to remember Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan Mantra.
And it is very natural to remember the tricolor flag of India, those martyrs who maintain their pride and pride.
I salute all those related to the victory of the 65 war.
I bow down to the heroes.
And the incidents of such history continue to inspire us.
Just as I had the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi tradition last week, there was a great pleasant experience.
I got the opportunity to talk to the dignitaries of the country for hours.
He had the opportunity to listen and I am happy that in the field of science, India is doing a very good job in many directions.
Our scientists are actually doing the best.
Now there is a chance in front of us how to reach these amendments to the public.
How to transform the principles into equipment
How to connect Lab with And
It has to move forward as an opportunity.
I also got many new information.
I can say that it was also a very inspiring and adventurous for me.
And I saw how many young scientists were telling them about their dreams.
And when I had said last time that our students should move towards science.
After this meeting, I think there are many opportunities and there are many possibilities.
I have many letters from the citizens.
From Thane, Shriman Parimal Shah has written to me on MyGov.
Emphasis on reforms in education sector.
I especially my young friends have to say one thing that I had told the Red Fort on August 15 why these interviews for the lower level jobs
Everyone runs, and perhaps this is one of the reasons for corruption at the lower level.
And I had said on August 15 that I want that the tradition of interview should be liberated below one level.
I am happy that in such a short span of time, it has just been 15 days but the government is moving forward very fast.
The information is being sent and almost now the decision will also be implemented that small jobs will be lost from the interview round.
The poor will not have to run for a recommendation.
There will be no exploitation, no conception.
These days, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For health, especially the mother-death and infant mortality, all to Action for its work plan, 24 countries of the world contemplated together in the land of India.
This was the first time in any other country outside the United States.
And it is true that even today in our country, about 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children die every year at the time of delivery and immediately after that.
It's worrying and scary.
Well, there's a lot of improvement.
India has also been appreciated internationally, yet this figure is not less.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of titanus in the death of mothers and infants.
The world has accepted it.
But we still have to save our mothers, save our newborn children.
Brothers and sisters, Today the news of dengue continues to come.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but its defense is very easy.
And that which I am not talking about clean India is directly connected to it.
We see advertising on TB but we do not pay attention.
Advertising is published in the newspaper but we do not notice.
There are ways to maintain clean water in small things in the house.
There is a comprehensive public education in these things, but we don't notice and sometimes it seems that we live in a very good house, we are a very good system and we don't know that ourselves are full of water and somewhere we invite dengue.
I will urge you all that death should not be so cheap.
Life is very precious.
Waterlessness, indifference to cleanliness, it becomes the cause of death, it is not right
Free checking facilities are available for dengue at around 514 centers across the country.
Within time, it is useful for life to get tested and it is very important for you all to co-operate.
And cleanliness should be given a lot of importance.
These days, there are festivals in our country in a way from defence bond to Diwali.
Why do not we add every festival to cleanliness now
You see the rituals will become nature.
My dear countrymen, today I have to tell you a good news, I always say that now we will not get the opportunity to die for the country but for the country we have got the opportunity to live.
Both of these brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
In America, race cross America is a pipe-race, it is very difficult and it is about four thousand eight hundred kilometers long race.
This year these two brothers won this race.
See how everybody is making efforts to pursue the country.
And this is the case, when such incidents are heard, the chest is broken.
Sometimes because of the deception, we commit injustice to our youth.
And the old generation always feels that the new generation does not understand anything and I understand that this process has been going on for centuries.
Experience in respect of my youth is different.
Sometimes we talk to the youth, we also get to learn a lot.
I have met many young people who say that I have taken a fast in my life.
Some people say that I am keeping a day time in a week.
My health is also good.
And I also enjoy my youth.
Nowadays, in our country, bicycle runs in many cities and people who promote bicycle are also very much.
But these are good efforts to protect the environment and improve health.
And today, when two young men of my country hoisted the flag in the US, I like to mention the direction in which the youth of India also think.
I would like to congratulate the Government of Maharashtra, especially today.
I am happy.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar - The land of Indu Mill of Mumbai - had been hanging for a long time to make his memorial.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and will now become the magnificent motivation monument of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, which will continue to inspire us to work for the dalit, the victim, the deprived and the deprived.
But at the same time, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar used to live in London - 10, King Henry Road and those houses have now been purchased.
When Indians traveling around the world will visit London, the memorial that Baba Saheb Ambedkar is going to be built by the Maharashtra government will become an inspirational destination.
I convey my best wishes to the Government of Maharashtra for their efforts to honor Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
My dear brothers and sisters, before coming to mind, you must tell me your thoughts because I am confident that democracy runs with public participation.
The country can move forward only by joining the shoulder.
Best wishes to you all.
This year the rain has started well.
Our farmers brothers and sisters will definitely help in sowing Kharif.
And a happy thing has come in my mind and I am very happy.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor should have pulses, the vegetable etc. should also have a little oil for eating.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this.
My dear countrymen, on July 26, Kargil is marked as Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
As much as the country's farmer is concerned with the land, the same is the youth of the country.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers was heavy on hundreds of enemies.
I salute those brave soldiers who do not care about their lives, who foil the efforts of enemies.
Kargil war was not fought only on the borders, in every city of India, in every village, this war was contributed.
This war fought for those mothers, sisters whose young son or brother was fighting the enemies in Kargil.
The daughters fought, whose hands just did not get the henna of Pehar.
Therefore, today, on Kargil Vijay Diwas, my 100-century greetings to all our soldiers.
On 26th July, I consider even more important because after the formation of our government in 2014, we started MyGov on 26th July in a few months.
Our commitment to enhancing public participation in democracy, connecting people with development and I am happy to say that after a year, about two crore people have seen MyGov.
About five and a half million people have commented and the most happy thing is that more than fifty thousand people suggested on PMApplications, they took time out and made a soft appliance.
Now it is small, but no one has ever noticed this in the government, nor has it ever been thought of.
But on the suggestions of brother Akhilesh Vajpayee, the government seriously thought and today this system was implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Today, the people who are formed, the tag-lines are created, the programme is created, the policy is created and there are very positive suggestions on MyGov.
There is a new rash hair experience in the governance system.
There is a new consciousness.
These days, I have also started suggesting MyGov what I should say on August 15.
Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai, he has sent some suggestions.
Speaking on daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, speak on clean Ganga, speak on clean India.
But this has brought me an idea, what should I say on August 15 this time Can you send me suggestions
You can send a letter to MyGov, write a letter on the Akashvani and write a letter in the Prime Minister's Office.
I believe that perhaps this is a good idea that my speech on August 15 should be suggested from the people.
I am sure you will send good suggestions.
One thing I want to express my concern.
I don't want to preach any preaching nor am I looking for a way to avoid the responsibility of the units of the state government, central government or local Swaraj.
Just two days ago, I was seen on the scene of an accident in Delhi, and after the accident, the scooter driver continued to stir up for 10 minutes.
He did not get any help.
Anyway, I have seen that many people continuously write on this thing that brothers and sisters, speak something on road safety.
Beware of the people. Beware of the Hoshakot Akshay of Bangalore, Amay Joshi of Pune, the happiness of Murbidri of Karnataka.
And when you look at the data, the heart moves.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
Due to accidents, due to road accidents, one death occurs every 4 minutes.
And the biggest concern is that about one-third of the dead are young people of 15 to 25 years of age and one die shakes the entire family.
Whatever work the government should do, but I pass through my parents, my children, whether they run two-wheeler or our-wheeler, the atmosphere of focus should also be increased in the family.
Another project is going to be expanded for us, and it is going to be expanded later, from Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara. From there to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangao and Moundia highways, we have a health treatment and it means that we are giving priority to those who are injured in the road accident, who are injured in the road accident, who are injured and who are injured in the road accident.
Toll-free 1033, ambulance system for information about accidents across the country, but all these things have been done after the accident.
For not being an accident, we all are really very fond of each life, each life is very fond of it and it is necessary to see it in that form.
Sometimes I say, be an employee worker.
In the past, some incidents came to my notice, I liked that I should talk to you, sometimes the person is tired of doing jobs, and for some years things are fine, salary is available, work will be done, this is the sense.
I liked to see such a great example that how to bring vitality in my work.
Vijay Biswal has said that how his interest, his art and capability can be associated with his work.
Maybe now the paintings of Vijay Biswal will be discussed in the coming days.
The entire team of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh started a work that touched my heart and I like this work.
He started Operation Destroy War - Now it will look like someone, hearing it will be something else.
See how the meaning of Raksha Bandhan has changed, I congratulate the entire team of government officials of Harda district.
Now a news has come to my ear, sometimes these small things please my mind, so I am sharing with you.
There is a small village by Keshla in Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh.
The people of that village have tried to create toilets for the last few months.
And now no person in that village has to go to open defecation.
He did this, but when the entire work was completed, the whole village celebrated such a big festival as it is celebrated.
The best examples of how the society is changing the values in life, how the people are changing and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
I am writing from Bhavesh Deka, Guwahati, about the questions of North-East.
However, the people of North-East are also very active.
They keep writing a lot, it's good.
But today I want to tell them that there is a separate Ministry for the North-East.
They will go to the districts, go to the villages, meet the local government officials, talk to the people and talk to the citizens.
They will listen to problems, they will also do whatever the Government of India has to do in the direction of solving problems.
These efforts will bring very good results in the coming days.
And those officers who come to visit, they also feel that how beautiful state, how good people and now they have to live up to this area and solve their problems.
If you return with this resolution then even after coming to Delhi, it has become very simple to understand the problems there.
So a good effort is to move from Delhi to far-flung East, which I am calling Act East Policy.
My dear countrymen, we all are proud of the success of the Mars Mission.
But sometimes it is also thought that if we talk to the younger generation today and ask them what you want to be ahead then it will hardly get one or half of the 100 students who will say that I have to become a scientist.
It is a matter of great concern to reduce the attitude towards science.
Take interest in innovation, encourage them, to know their capabilities, it is a great need.
I also keep telling the government's IAS officers that if you have gone ahead by writing so much then you should also go to school colleges near you for two to four hours a week and talk to the children.
The power that you have experienced will definitely benefit from this new generation.
Work is difficult, but to do.
We have started this and in the coming years, we get 24 hours of electricity to the villages.
If the children of the village have to study in the days of examination then there is no problem of electricity.
If you have to set up small industries in the village then electricity is available.
Today we have to go to another village even if we have to start mobile.
The benefits that the cities get should be met by the villages.
Therefore, we have started the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti programme.
I know that such a large country, millions of villages and villages have to reach far and wide.
But, it's only for the poor to run.
Today, in the matter of mind, the mind was convinced to talk about the variety.
In a way, our country has the opportunity of the month of August, the month of September and the festivals.
There are many festivals.
My best wishes to you all.
Definitely send me suggestions for August 15.
Your thoughts will be of great use to me.
In the last heart, I had prayed to you that if you go somewhere in the holidays, and if there is a memorable picture there then incredible I
When I said, I didn't think it would have been a tremendous consequence.
Millions of people posted photos, in Twitter, Facebook, in Instagram.
I can say that one more sight can be seen, how many varieties India is filled with.
Be it architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas.
Perhaps the Government of India has never thought that in terms of tourism, people can do such a big job which you have done.
And I felt so much that I also re-weeted it.
We will continue and continue, the world will see, our countrymen will see, our new generation will see.
My dear countrymen, you have made me the Prime Minister, but the person inside me sometimes loses from all the posts and destinies.
On 21st June, International Yoga Day, I can say that my mind has been agitated in the same way as I had put this topic in NH.
We can say with the claim that the sun never falls in the world of yoga practicers.
The way the world honoured Yoga by laying its eyes and feet, the way the whole world raised it on its shoulder, who will be the Indian who will not be proud.
The mind became confused.
And when the people of France, for whom the Sin River and the Field Tower are very glorious symbols, they preferred the place to do yoga, they gave equality.
In New York, people contributed to Times Square.
If there is talk of Australia, Sydney, then the picture of Pera House comes to us.
The citizens of Australia have done yoga at the same time keeping Yoga equal to Pera House.
Whether it is North America or Silicon Valley, it is a matter of pride in itself.
Similarly, the N Peace Keeping Force also performed very well in Yoga.
Even in India, our young men were doing yoga on the white snow sheet, then there were programs of Yoga by the Navy in the sea, wherever our naval ships were there.
Delhi has registered its place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Rajpath became Yogapath.
I am grateful to the country and the world and I can say that this was not a programme.
It seemed that from every corner of the world a new curiosity, a new joy, a new zeal, a new connectivity.
A few days ago, when I had tweeted a family from Twitter, Vietnam using a small child, it was so loving that the photo was so popular all over the world.
Everyone, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, every village, every city, every developed country or every development centre.
Yoga became a reason for connecting the world in true sense.
But one thing I feel, and every Indian can feel proud that the world is very eager to know India.
A curiosity has increased towards India.
The values and traditions here, the heritage and the world want to know.
We all have the responsibility of distributing this legacy without lague, the world should be familiar with it.
But we will be able to introduce this when we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we are so familiar with our things, what is new in it, like our family values, we dont know that India's family values are very big for the world.
I'm sure it will be amazing.
There are many things that our ancestors have given us and the world has the right to do whatever is the best.
The success of International Yoga Day has come with a new responsibility with happiness and satisfaction.
It is our responsibility to give the world the best Yoga teacher.
It is our responsibility to see all the traditions of Yoga from a platform.
Introduce institutions related to yoga, information about Yoga Gurus, information about Yoga.
If you want to learn yoga, you can learn from where you want yoga teachers, you can prepare a database and I believe you can do it.
Let us start somewhere, it will also become a new power.
I also look at the events of the last few days, the government, the government, the government, the government, the government, and once the goal is set, we have seen how to bring about the results.
And when there was disappointment all around, we do not forget that one year ago, one voice was heard from all around, nothing happens, nothing happens.
You can imagine that AYUSH is a department in the government, never pay attention to it.
If you come to the news twice in 2-5 years, you will come so much, in a corner, in a corner, in a corner, in a corner, but on Yoga Day, he has laid the foundation stone.
And in the world, small departments have organized such a big task.
If the goal is in front then the smallest unit is also the best example of how it works.
In the past, the world saw how our people saved the people suffering from Yemen.
Within hours, the people of India came to Nepal to help, when the working government had to open public accounts in the bank, people from all over the bank came to the ground and in a short time, millions of countrymen were connected with the bank.
On August 15, I had appealed to the Red Fort for toilets in schools and I had said that by August 15, we have to complete this work.
The work that was not done in 60 years was very bold to call for one year, about four and a half lakh toilets were made, but today I can say with satisfaction that the delay is still on 15th August but it has not been completed but people have completed the task of making toilets in almost schools.
I mean, the government, the people, the government meeting, everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month, we launched three public security schemes, I had done it from Calcutta.
In such a short time, there has been very positive results.
There has been very little work from the point of view of public security in India, but due to these three schemes we are setting up a large gathering.
In such a short time, more than 10 crore people have joined the schemes of these people's security but we have to move forward.
Raksha Bandhan Festival comes in August.
On behalf of Rakshabandhan's brother, sister can have a very big gift.
Let us all try to fulfill this resolve together.
When I talk about my mind, many people also send me suggestions.
This time, many people have sent suggestions that I should say something for the monsoon.
Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harshvardhan ji of Mysore, Praveen Nadkarni ji, Divyanshu Gupta ji, he said that you must tell something about the mind for the monsoon.
He has sent good suggestions.
You may also be able to enjoy hot corn, corn, along with tea in the rain.
But at the same time, just as the sun rays give life, the rain gives strength to our lives.
The water of the village should remain in the village, the water of the city should remain in the city, it should be our determination and efforts should be made to stop water.
And the rain water stops and if it returns to the ground and is recharged on the ground then problems are solved throughout the year.
I always tell the people that if you go to Porbandar in Gujarat and visit Mahatma Gandhi's house then there is a tank inside the house of two hundred years old, in which there was a system of direct rain water to go there.
Porbandar is on the coast of the sea, but sweet water was kept in the house by collecting rain water, at that time too so much care was done.
We can also do it.
We all should be in large quantities by the social organizations, the youth to plant trees and plant trees in this rainy season.
And I suggest a suggestion and I have a direct experience and a successful experience.
This is my entire rural technology.
When you plant the plant, put an old soil clock in the bag of the plant and fill it with water.
If you fill the water twice a month, it will still run.
I also tell the farmers to plant trees instead of planting fence on your farm.
He will become your wealth.
And we know that in the days of rain, diseases spread a lot by water.
Due to the increase in moisture in the atmosphere, bacteria grow and cleanliness becomes very important for this, cleanliness becomes very important.
The request for drinking pure water is necessary.
It is true that the number of cases we will do will be away from us.
Water should also be, rain should also be but it should also be avoided.
Friends, We have launched three new schemes, especially for the urban masses.
There are about 500 small towns in our country.
Under the Amrit (AMRUT) scheme, we have taken a big campaign to make our cities easier to live.
Similarly, it should be a country that can equalize the world.
There should be a smart city that can equalize the world and on the other hand, the poorest of the poor should have their homes to live in the country.
When India celebrates 75 years of Independence in 2022, we want to give home to the countrymen.
With these three things, a big scheme has been started.
I am confident that all these schemes will be useful in bringing about changes in urban life.
I myself am connected to you through social media, many new ideas are being met by you people and you keep getting good information about the government.
But sometimes even a person sitting in a remote village touches our hearts.
You know that Save a daughter from the government-Beti Teacho Program is underway.
But when the government's programme makes a person, society and village its own, then how much increases its strength.
In the past, Shri Sunil Jagalan ji, a Sarpanch from Bibipur village of Haryana, took a very fun initiative.
In Haryana, the number of girls is very low compared to boys.
There are about 100 districts in the country in which this condition is worrisome.
The highest in Haryana.
But the Sarpanch Beti Bachao Abhiyan of a small village of Haryana will turn it into this kind, then the mind is very happy and a new hope is awakened.
Therefore, I express my happiness.
But I am also inspired by this incident and therefore I urge you also to post your daughter and sister with a sister and daughter.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao with her will write a tagline and write the best line and it can be in any language, whether it is English or Hindi or your mother tongue or any language.
The very inspiring tagline that I will receive from you will be your daughter and I will retweet you.
We can transform this into a mass movement in a way to save daughters and daughters.
The work that Bhai Sunil started from village Bibipur in Haryana and we all move forward and I urge you to post the seliewithdugter.
So, my best wishes to you all in this rain and enjoy the rains.
Make our country green.
Not for one day, you will continue the practice of Yoga.
You see, you'll get the benefit.
Make it part of your life, make it.
Incredible India, you must travel somewhere and send the photo.
The country and the world will know how much diversity our country has.
One thing I felt that it has come down very little in respect of handicrafts.
We have to reach the world and reach the features of India all around.
And we have a simple medium, we will reach.
My dear countrymen, today I will meet the next time for the next moment.
He used to listen to, repeat and sometimes inspire for his own things and for his brothers and sisters, as a selfish person of the family of 130 crore countrymen.
You can imagine how it might have gone in the middle.
Perhaps it wasn't a lifeless program
This programme had livelihood, self-employment, heart-to-peace relations, and because of this, the time between this period was very difficult for me.
Every moment I was missing something and when I talk about my mind, I say, maybe I am, the word is mine, the voice is mine, but, the story is yours, the male meaning is yours, the supreme is yours.
feeling an emptyness
But this Sunday waited a lot
Well, finally got the chance.
Several messages have come in the last few months in which people said they ' re missing the mind
Sometimes I feel that this is my journey of satisfaction.
This is my vital journey of adultery
My silent dialogue with you for me was also part of my spiritual visit.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions, why I went to Kedarnath
Most people have drawn political meanings from it .
For me, that was the opportunity to meet me.
In a way, I went to meet me,
I will not tell you anything else today, but I will do so much that in the valley of Kedar, in that solitary cave, perhaps he had given the opportunity to fill something.
The rest is your curiosity - I think I ' ll discuss it too .
As people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, your efforts to strengthen a positive thing, I feel in your words continuously.
The letters that come for the sake of mind, the inputs that are received are completely different from the current government functioning.
In a way your letter also becomes the reason for inspiration for me and sometimes becomes the reason for energy .
Sometimes the task of sharpening my thought process gives you some words.
If people keep the challenges faced by the country and society, then they also tell the solution.
If someone writes for cleanliness then he is expressing his displeasure over the dirt but also appreciates the efforts of cleanliness
If someone discusses the environment then he feels pain, but at the same time he also tells the experiments he has seen, and the imaginations he has in his mind also paints.
This tells us that there is no dearth of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
It is necessary to incorporate those strengths and talents, to provide opportunities and to implement them.
It is also a matter of concern that in the progress of the country, all 130 crore people want to join the country firmly and actively and I will definitely say one thing that I have so many letters, so many telephone calls, so many messages, but the element of the complaint is very low and someone asks for something, so one thing has not come in my mind in the last five years.
When I analyze these things, you can imagine how much joy my heart will get, how much energy will I get
You have brought me, you have laid me down and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
Let's go ahead with this spirit
When the Emergency was imposed in the country, its opposition was not limited to the political realm, it was not limited to politicians, the movement was not confined to prison bars.
In the Emergency, every citizen of the country felt that something of it was taken away
Recently, the great festival of democracy, a very big election campaign, from the rich to the poor, all were willing to decide the future of our country in this festival.
When something is very close to us, we underestimate its importance, its immense effects also disappear.
In India, in the Lok Sabha elections of 2019, more than 61 crore people voted, just one year.
This number may seem very common to us but if I say that if we leave one China then more people from any country of the world had voted in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of America, almost double.
The number of voters in India is more than the entire Europe population .
It introduces the vastness and width of our democracy .
Lok Sabha election of 2019 was the world's largest democratic election in history so far
You can imagine how large resources and human power would have been required to complete this kind of election.
Millions of teachers, officials and employees have made the election possible day and night hard work
Where nearly 3 lakh security personnel of paramilitary forces performed their obligations to successfully fulfil this greatness of democracy, 20 lakh policemen from different states also performed their hard work.
As a result of the hard work of these people, more than the last time voting was held.
About 10 lakh polling stations across the country for polling, more than 40 lakh EVMs (M) machines, more than 17 lakh VVPATs (PATs) machines, you can imagine how big you can imagine
All this was done so that it can be ensured that no voter is deprived of his franchise.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, only a female voter was made a polling station.
Polling station at the highest height in the world is also in India
This polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in Lahaul-Safti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Apart from this, there is another fact that is proud to fill this election.
Perhaps this is the first time in history that women have voted with enthusiasm like men
Polling percentage of women and men in this election was almost equal
Another encouraging fact related to this is that today there are 78 women MPs in the Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the election process and bow down to the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth many times, don't book, I was urging that we can give books instead of flowers in welcoming.
Since then , they have been sufficiently replaced with books .
However, I did not get much time, but during the stay I got an opportunity to read some of his stories again.
His stories contain the mood of the whole of India .
When I was reading the story of his written drug addiction, my mind automatically went to the economic inequalities in the society.
This story of Bir of the zamindar's son God and the poor family learns that if you are not careful, then when does the effect of bad co-operation go, it is not known.
The second story that touched my heart was Idgah, the sensitivity of a child, the true love for his grandmother, such a maturity at such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid comes to his grandmother by screaming from the fair, the human sensitivity reaches its peak in truth.
The last line of this story is very emotional because it has a very great truth of life, children Hamid played the part of old Hamid, old Amina, the girl became Amina.
Such a great poignant story is the night of Puss
This story saw a living picture of the irony of a poor farmer ' s life .
Even after the destruction of its crop, the turmeric farmer is happy because now he will not have to sleep in the field in the cold winter.
Though these stories are almost a century ago, their relevance still feels the same.
After reading them, I felt a different kind
When it is being read, in a media, I was reading about Kerala's letter library.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village settled between the dense forests of Idukki.
PK Murlidharan, a teacher of primary school and PV Chinnathampi, who runs a small tea shop here, both of them have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was also a time when the books were brought here by filling the balloon and loading it on the back.
Today this library is showing a new path to everyone with tribal children.
Wanche Gujarat campaign was a successful experiment in Gujarat
Millions of people from every age group participated in this campaign to read books
In today's digital world, at the time of Google Guru, I would like to urge you to take some time and also place the book in your daily routine.
You will really enjoy and write about the book you read on the Narendra Modi App so that all the listeners of the mind will also know about it .
My dear countrymen, I am happy that people of our country are thinking about issues that are not only challenges for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about the challenges related to water.
Water is very important in our culture .
Give your blessings like your mother , and shower your blessings upon us .
Due to lack of water many parts of the country are affected every year
You will be surprised that only 8 of the water received from the rainy season is saved in our country
I am confident that like other problems, we will solve this crisis with the strength of the people, with the strength of the people, with the strength, with the strength, cooperation and determination of one hundred and thirty crore people.
Keeping the importance of water paramount, the Ministry of Water Power has been set up in the country.
This will enable faster decisions on all the topics related to water .
a few days ago , I tried to separate something .
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanchs across the country to the village head
I wrote to the village heads that to save water, to save water, to save the drops of rain, to convene a meeting of the Village Sabha, to discuss with the villagers.
I am happy that he has shown full enthusiasm in this work and on 22nd of this month crores of people have laboured in thousands of panchayats.
People in villages resolved to save one drop of water
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat program, I want to tell you about a sarpanch.
Listen, the Sarpanch of Lupung Panchayat of Katkamsandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given us all the message, my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas
The people there are once again ready to play their active role for water conservation
My best wishes to all the village chiefs, all the Sarpanches, for their activism.
There are many Sarpanchs across the country who have taken the initiative of water conservation
In a way it has become an opportunity for the entire village
It seems that the people of the village are now engaged in the competition to build water temples in their village.
As I said, collective efforts can have great positive results.
There can be no formula for dealing with water crisis across the country .
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country, in different ways.
But the goal of everyone is the same, and it is to save water, water conservation
Realizing drainage lines in Punjab
This endeavor is getting rid of the problem of waterlogging
The life of the people of the villages is changing due to the construction of the tank in Thimaipalli (Thimaipalli) in Telangana.
A major change has come from small ponds built in the fields in Kabirdham, Rajasthan.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag Nadhi.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are working closely on Rainwater Harvesting.
I am confident that many such efforts are being made and when we are united and striving hard, we can also make impossible.
When people connect, water will survive
Today I am making 3 requests from the countrymen through the point of mind
My first request is that the people of the country have given the form of a mass movement to cleanliness, initiate a mass movement for water conservation.
Together we resolve to save every drop of water and I am confident that water is the Prasad given by God, water is the form of Paras.
They used to say that iron becomes gold by touching each other .
I say, water is transparent and by touching water, a new life is created.
Start an awareness campaign to save one drop of water
Explain about water related problems, as well as propagate ways to save water.
I specially urge the people of different regions to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Whether it is a film world or a sports world or a media partner or people associated with social organizations, people associated with cultural organizations, people who are narratives, everybody should lead this movement in their own way.
Awaken society, connect society, gather with society
You see, we will see changes in front of your eyes
My second request to the countrymen is that many traditional methods are being used for the protection of water in our country for centuries.
I urge all of you to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to Porbandar and the birthplace of Lord Bapu, there is another house behind the house of Lord Bapu, there is a 200-year-old water tank and even today there is water and there is a system to stop rain water, then I always used to say that whatever Kirti Mandir goes to see that water tank.
Let us create a list of more and more methods of water conservation and inspire people to save water.

My dear countrymen, I have to express my gratitude to you for another thing and express my gratitude to the people of the world.
On 21st June, once again, with the activism of Yoga Day, three-four generations of each family, each family came together and celebrated Yoga Day.
The awareness that has come for the political health is increasing the glory of Yoga Day.
Everyone, every corner of the world, if a Yoga lover welcomes him as soon as the sun emerges, then there is a complete journey to the sunset.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to the Submarine, from Air Force to Aircraft Carriers, from A Gyms to the tropical desert, from the villages to the cities wherever possible, not only Yoga was done everywhere but also collectively celebrated it.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, well-known personalities and general citizens from many countries of the world showed me how they celebrated Yoga in their respective countries.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that healthy and sensitive people are needed to create a healthy society and Yoga ensures this .
Therefore, propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service.
Should not he be honored by recognition of such service
The announcement of Primary Ministers Awards was a matter of great satisfaction for me in the year 2019 to contribute to the promotion and development of Yoga.
This award has been given to organizations around the world about which you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly to the promotion of Yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, who has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs several instruments and training courses there or take the name of Ms. Antonietta Roy of Italy who started Sarva Yoga International and spread Yoga across Europe.
These are inspiring examples in itself .
If this is a matter related to yoga, can Indians stay behind it
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger was also honored, dedicated to Yoga for the last several decades.
To join your thoughts is a very important journey for me .
Let us meet, keep talking
Listen to your emotions, keep absorbing, understand
Sometimes I try to live those feelings.
Be your blessings
You are my inspiration, you are my energy
Let's sit together and enjoy the mind-looking responsibilities of life.
And once again next month we ' ll meet again to talk about the mind
Thank you very much for me.
This season is also summer on one side, and it is also very pleasant somewhere.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2015
Mann Ki Baat, December 2014
I have done a special one-hour programme and I have seen that it was not just the programme of the government's evils, it was anxiety and I believe that in a way the atmosphere of a good discussion has started. The government's responsibility is also sensitive and they feel that they cannot remain depressed.
Have you ever thought
imagine
This is the money of drugs if terrorists go
If terrorists buy arms from these money
And with those weapons a terrorist would be shooting in the chest of my country's young man.
My country's youth will be martyred
So have you ever thought that a mother's red killer, the life lover of the mother of India, the survivor of the country, the soldier's breast is shot, isn't it
Have we ever seen that we mostly discuss their moral progress with our children
Modi ji are not tired
One month is very long .
There are many incidents happening in the country and the world .
You all celebrated Diwali with fervor and enthusiasm .
Festivals are those who keep filling up their lives from time to time, whether it is poor or rich, whether it is a village or a city or a festival has its own importance in everybodys lives.
Sometimes we think that guys. People are useless, people have nothing to do, our country is like this.
And today I say that it is very important to change this thinking that our country is not like this, people of our country are not like this.
Sometimes I feel that the country is far ahead and the governments are far behind.
And when I feel that perhaps the governments too need to change their thinking .
And I am saying that I am seeing that these youngsters are committed to doing something or the other, especially in India, they are relieved and are looking for opportunities.
and doing it in your own way .
I had said last time, buy at least one Khadi cloth.
I didn ' t ask anyone to become a Khadidhari . But I got information from Khadi Bhandars that in a week about 200 per cent of Hundred and Twenty five per cent sales increased .
In a way , more than double khadi was sold in a week from 2nd October compared to last year .
This means that the people of the country are many times ahead of what we think.
I salute the Indians .
Cleanliness. Someone can imagine that cleanliness will take the form of a mass movement.
There are plenty of expectations and should also be.
And I am seeing a good result, cleanliness is now being seen in two parts.
One who is the old dirt, who is in the midst of dirt, is a government system. What will the people sitting in the government take for it
There is a very big challenge but you can ' t escape from responsibility .
All governments will have to take steps for this responsibility because the pressure of the people is going to increase.
And the media is also playing a very good role in this .
But the other aspect that is very enthusiastic, enjoying and satisfying the mind. Common man has started feeling that let's leave the previous thing.
We will not make a difference to the new filth .
I am from Satna, Madhya Pradesh, some from Shriman Bharat Gupta, they sent a mail to my MyGov.
He was going to visit his. He said his experience. He said that he used to go to the railway earlier, this time too went to the railway, but I am seeing that people in every passenger. Every railway in the railway keep eating and drinking, throwing paper and paper. Nobody threw it, not only that, he used to find that there is dustbin in the coach, put garbage in it.
And when we saw that there was no arrangement in the railways , they had collected their garbage in the corner itself .
It was a pleasant experience for me .
I am grateful to Bharat Ji that he had delivered this information to me .
But I am seeing this that the biggest effect has been seen in small children .
Hundreds of families discuss that if our child eats chocolate somewhere then immediately takes up the paper .
I just saw someone in the social media that someone had written. Today's my hero. And in my hero, he gave a picture of a child.
You see. Everyone feels that our country, we will not be filthy.
We will not make any difference to the filth .
And whatever they do, they feel embarrassed and somebody gets to touch them immediately.
I consider it a good sign .
A good thing is also happening that those who come to meet me these days people from all walks of life meet me.
Someone talks about cleanliness, some talk about education, some talk about social reforms.
Someone is discussing that our family life is destructive .
I understand that if such a businessman comes first , he will talk to the government about his own selfishness .
But I am seeing a big change .
They talk less about their selfishness, more about taking some or the other responsibility related to society.
When I look at these things by adding it, I am concentrated that we are moving forward towards a very good transformation.
If my poor family is not ill , there will never be any economic crisis in his life .
If he remains healthy then he will work, earn, family will run.
Therefore, my cleanliness is directly related to the health of my poor brothers and sisters.
Whether we can serve the poor better or not, we cannot do dirt or even the poor are good.
I have observed that those who are working in this field are sending me their success story .
But I learnt two things from my Government .
After my saying the officers of our H . . . ministry felt that we should do something as well .
And the officers made a plan together .
See how the changes in the government begin is an example .
One he decided that if he wants to go to the speciali-ebeld child then he has planned to give special scholarship to him by enjoying such a thousand good speciali-ebeld child .
I congratulate all the officers of the department who have come here .
I had the opportunity to go to Siachen in the past .
I spent in the midst of the dead soldiers for the country of Diwali .
When the country was celebrating Diwali, I went to Siachen.
Because we are celebrating Diwali due to them, so I went among them.
I realized how many difficulties they live in.
I salute the soldiers who protect the country .
But today I have to say something more proud .
The youth of our country work in the field of security .
At the time of natural calamity someone gets ready to take courage to protect us by putting a stake in life .
I specially congratulate these soldiers .
I had just got an opportunity to showcase a tea and drink from the youngsters, young students, youngsters and sportspersons of our country.
I got a new energy .
I was looking at his excitement and zeal that our systems and facilities are very low compared to other countries, but instead of grievances, we were talking about doing something more than zeal and enthusiasm.
For me, the programme for tea and drinks for these players was very inspiring.
To one thing I want to tell the countrymen, and I really want to tell myself.
And I am confident that the countrymen have faith in my words and I have faith in my intentions.
But once again I want to repeat it from my side .
As far as black money is concerned, black money is concerned, my countrymen, trust your principal servant, this is the Artificial of Fate for me.
This is my commitment that the money that the poor people of India have gone out should come back.
Whatever the road, what the system is, there can be differences in opinion.
And it is natural in democracy , but on the basis of my countrymen ' s understanding and the knowledge I have , I assure you that we are on the right path .
Today, nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows the government, neither the previous government knew how much money is outside.
Everyone keeps telling different statistics in their own way.
I dont want to complicate the data, my commitment is that it is Rs. 2, Rs. 5, crores, that is Arab, whichever is the money for the poor of the country, should come back.
And I assure you , there will be no dearth of my efforts .
No action will be taken .
I just keep your blessings.
Whatever I have to do for you, whenever I have to do it, I will definitely do it.
I assure you this .
I have a letter .
Mr . Abhishek has come from Parikh .
However, even though I was not the Prime Minister, many mothers and sisters had expressed this kind of feeling.
He has told me that you must discuss this matter in your mind .
I agree with his suffering .
When I will talk about the next mind, I will definitely discuss this drug addiction, this drug mafia and the next time I will discuss the big crisis that can cause India's young wealth.
If you have any experience in this regard, you have some information, if you have saved the children of this intoxicant, if you have some ways of saving, if a government meeting has played a good role, if you give me such information, then I will convey to the people of the country these good efforts and we will create an atmosphere in every family that because of the freshness, no children should go on this path, we will definitely discuss it in detail.
I know that I am handling the topics in which the Government comes first in the dockyard .
But how long will we keep things hidden
I am also daring . Because of your love .
Because of your blessings and I will continue to do it .
Some people have also told me that Modi ji, you were saying that give us suggestions, give it on the face book, give it on the tweeter, send an e-mail.
But there is a large section of the country, who do not have it, what they do.
Your point is correct .
This facility is not available to everyone .
So I tell you that if you want to say something about my mind then you listen to me on the village-village radio, then you will send a letter to the mind, the Akashwani, Parliament Marg, New Delhi, if you give some suggestions then you will definitely reach me.
And I will definitely take it seriously because active citizens are the biggest capital of development.
You write a letter, that means you are very active.
In order to talk to me, your mind should also be connected.
Maybe you ' ll definitely write a letter .
I will try, then talk to you next month.
My effort will be, whenever I talk, I will do it on Sunday, at 11 o'clock in the day.
So I ' m going to be able to reach you .
Gradually the beginning of cold is happening .
There is very good weather for health .
But along with this there is also a very good weather for health .
Don ' t let it go .
Use it very much .
My dear countrymen, today is the holy festival of Vijayadashmi.
Many congratulations to you all on the occasion of Vijaya Dashmi.
I will try, if possible, then I will talk to you once a month or twice a month.
I have also thought in my mind that whenever I talk, it will be Sunday and the time will be at 11 o'clock in the morning, you will also be comfortable and I will also be satisfied that I have succeeded in delivering my mind to your mind.
Today, the festival of Vijayadashmi, which celebrates the festival, is the festival of victory of goods on evils.
But a gentleman from Ganesh Venkatadari Mumbai, he sent me a mail, he said that in Vijaya Dashmi we resolve to eliminate ten evils within us.
I express my gratitude to them for this suggestion.
Everyone must think of defeating the evils within me, but as a nation, I feel that come, let us resolve to liberate all on the auspicious festival of Vijayadashmi and to achieve victory by ending the dirt, we can make this resolve on the festival of Vijayadashmi.
I had said one thing yesterday that in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that I will invite nine people and they will upload their video in social media while cleaning themselves and invite nine more people.
When we talk about Mahatma Gandhi, Khadi comes in very natural meditation.
You know that our scientists successfully used to reach Mars in at least cost, successfully.
There is no shortage of strength, only we have forgotten our strength.
They have forgotten themselves.
I remember Swami Vivekanand Ji who used to say something equally, Swami Vivekananda always used to tell one thing.
Once she had gone to the child with Sherni, she had grown up now.
He said what are you doing
You are a lion.
They have made me big.
Look at my voice, see the way of my conversation.
So the lion said that let me show you who you are.
He took him to a well and showed his face inside the water in the well and told him with his own face - Look, we both have one face.
I am also a lion, you are a lion and as soon as he grew self-respect from inside it, he also began to crush the lion among the sheep like that of a lion.
The essence within him woke up.
Swami Vivekananda ji used to say this.
My countrymen, there is immense power within 1.
We need to identify ourselves.
We need to identify the strength of ourselves and then as Swami Vivekananda ji had said, we will move ahead with that self-respect and we will be successful and our nation will also be successful.
I spent two hours with them, perhaps that was a very emotional, inspiring event of my life.
God has probably liked that family, but that child is the responsibility of the whole nation.
Later, I was emotionally touched so much that I used to do different Olympics for Speciali Abeld children in Gujarat.
Thousands of children used to come and their parents used to come and I used to go myself.
An atmosphere of such a belief was created and therefore, for the suggestions made by Gautam Pal, I liked it and I realized that I should share with you all the suggestions I have received.
One story gives me more attention.
If you knew why you did not tell.
My countrymen, unless we resolve to walk, we are not standing ourselves, then those who showcase the path will not be found.
We will not get those who hold the finger.
We have to start walking and I am confident that we are capable of walking and walking.
People send big interesting suggestions that come to me for some days.
Some people have said that when they start small enterprises, the process of registration should be easier.
I will definitely inform the government for it.
Some people have sent me by writing and teaching children skill development from fifth grade.
Someone has written to me that there should be a dust bean within every hundred meters, if the cleanliness is to be arranged.
Some people have sent me by writing that polythene pack should be banned.
A lot of suggestions are sending me.
I would like to tell you that if you send me any truthful incident anywhere, which will inspire me, inspire the countrymen, if such truthful incidents send me with evidence, then I will surely convey the things that I have touched my heart to the countrymen.
All this is the only intention to talk to me. Let us all serve our Bharat Mata together.
We take the country to new heights.
As you come in mind, I will definitely talk to you in the future.
Today, I have told you the things that have come to my mind.
And when I meet you on Sunday, I will meet at 11 o'clock in the morning, but I am confident that our journey will continue, your love will continue.
After listening to me, if you want to tell me something, surely deliver me, I would like it.
I am very nice today to talk to you and to radio. It is such a simple medium that I can reach far and wide.
I will reach the poorest house because the strength of my country is in the hut of the poor, the strength of my country is in the village, the strength of my country is in the mothers and sisters and the youth, the strength of my country is in the farmers.
With your trust, the country will move forward.
I express my faith.
I believe in your power so I am confident in the future of India.
Starting the talk of mind is full today
10 days ago, India-Mother lost their brave sons
These mighty heroes, we spent ourselves in protecting 1. 25 billion Indians.
The countrymen could sleep peacefully, so these brave sons had kept one day and night.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers in Pulwama's terrorist attack, people across the country, and people are shocked and resentment.
Sensitivities are raised around the martyrs and their families.
I bow down to all the brave sons of the country in the protection of Indo-Mata, those who sacrificed their lives.
The challenge faced by the country, we all have to forget casteism, communalism, regionalism and all other differences so that our steps against terror are stronger, stronger and decisive.
Our armed forces have always been introducing unique courage and supremacy .
In order to establish peace , where he has shown a wonderful ability , the attackers have also responded in their own language .
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack .
Army has taken a pledge to destroy the terrorists and their helpers .
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational talk of his family through media has further strengthened the prosperity of the entire country.
Ramniranjan ji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, also inspires us all in this hour of sadness.
They said , They will send their second son to fight the enemies , and they will go to fight .
The whole country salutes the indomitable courage of Meena ji, wife of martyr Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsingh Pur in Odisha
He has also tried to reconnect his only son to RP
When the body of the martyr Vijay Shoren , wrapped in the Tricolor , reached Gumla in Jharkhand , the innocent son said , I will also go to the army .
The tongue of this innocent expresses the spirit of the children and children of India today.
Such feelings are being seen in the house-to-house of our brave, mighty martyrs.
There is no exception in one of our brave martyrs, their family is not exception.
Whether it is the family of the martyr Vijay Maurya of Deoria, the parents of the martyr Tilak Raj of Kangra or the six-year-old son of the martyr Hemraj of Kota, the story of every family of martyrs is full of inspiration.
I would request the young generation to try to understand and understand the spirit that these families have shown.
What happens patriotism, what happens, sacrifice and penance, we will not need to move towards the old events of history.
In front of our eyes, these are living examples and these are the reasons for inspiration for the future of bright India.
My dear countrymen, for such a long period of independence, the war memorial waiting for us all is going to end now.
The curiosity of the countrymen about this is very natural.
Shri Omkar Shetty of Udupi, Karnataka on Narendra ModiApp expressed his happiness over the preparation of the National War Memorial.
I was surprised and suffered that there was no National War Memorial in India.
A memorial where the valorous legends of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation can be kept alive.
I decided that there should be a memorial in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been completed in such a short time.
Tomorrow, on 25th February, we will dedicate this national military monument to our army.
The country will make a small effort to pay its debt
Delhi's heart is that place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti exists just near it, this is a new memorial.
I am confident that it would be like going to a pilgrimage to the national military monument for the countrymen.
The National Military Memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the nation to the soldiers who sacrificed the highest after Independence.
The design of the memorial, showcases the indomitable courage of our Amar Sainiks.
The concept of the National Military Memorial is focused on our Concentration Circles i. e.
Amar Chakra's flame symbolizes the immortality of martyred soldiers
The second circle is of bravery cycle which shows the courage and bravery of the soldiers .
This is a gallery where the exploits of the bravery of the soldiers on the walls have been engraved
After this, the resignation cycle shows the sacrifices of Circle soldiers.
The names of the soldiers who sacrificed their supreme sacrifice for the country are written in gold letters
After this the protective cycle displays security
This circle has a line of dense trees
These trees are symbols of soldiers and convince the citizens of the country that every moment is deployed on the military border and the countrymen are safe .
Overall, the National Military Memorial will be identified as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country, to express their gratitude and research them.
Here is the story of the sacrifices that have made our lives for the country so that we can live so that the country is safe and can develop .
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the development of the country in words.
In October last year, I had the privilege of dedicating the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our view that we believe that the country should be grateful to men and women policemen who are constantly engaged in our security.
I hope you will visit the National Military Memorial and National Police Memorial.
Whenever you go, share your pictures on social media so that others get inspiration from it and they are also eager to see this sacred place and this memorial.
My dear countrymen, your thousands of letters and comments are available to me through different mediums.
This time when I was reading your commend, a very interesting comment from Heavenly Mukhopadhaya ji came to my notice.
He has written that on March 3, 1900, the British had arrested Birsa Munda, then he was only 25 years old, it is a coincidence that Jamshedji Tata's birth anniversary is also on March 3.
And they further write that these two personalities are completely from two different family backgrounds which have enriched the legacy and history of Jharkhand.
Birsa Munda and Jamshedji are like saluting the glorious history and legacy of Jharkhand in a way to pay tribute to Tata .
These two great scholars have not enhanced the name of Jharkhand but the whole country
The whole country is grateful for their contribution
Today, if our youngsters need an inspirational personality to guide, then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
The British had hid them, very cleverly, when they were asleep
Do you know why they resorted to such a cowardly action
Because the British who created such a great empire were also afraid of them .
Lord Birsa Munda had shaken the British rule equipped with guns and guns only with his traditional arrows.
In fact, when people get an inspirational leadership, then the collective will of the people is heavy on the power of arms.
Lord Birsa Munda fought not only for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals .
In his small life he did all this
In the life of the deprived and the deprived , shining like the sun
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed her at the young age of 25
Bharat Mata's son like Birsa Munda has happened in every part of the country.
Perhaps there would be a corner of India that no one has contributed to this war of independence for centuries.
But unfortunately, the stories of their sacrifice, valour and sacrifice did not reach the new generation.
If, personality like Lord Birsa Munda made us understand our existence, then a person like Jamshedji Tata gave the country big institutions.
Jamshedji Tata was a vision in the right sense, who not only saw India's future but also laid its strong foundation
He knew well that it is necessary for the future to make India a hub of science, technology and industry.
Not only this, he also established several world class institutions like Tata Steel and industries.
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country, Morarji Bhai Desai was born on 29th February.
As you all know that this day comes only once in four years
Easy, peaceful personality rich, Morarji Bhai was among the most disciplined leaders of the country.
The record of presenting the highest budget in independent India is the name of Morarji Bhai Desai .
Morarji Desai led India's efficient leadership at a difficult time when there was a threat to the country's democratic tactics.
Morarji Bhai Desai threw himself in the movement against the Emergency to protect democracy
For this they had to pay a huge price in old age too .
The then government arrested him and put him in jail
But when the Janata Party won the election in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country
During his tenure only 44th Constitution Amendment was brought .
This is important because the 42nd Amendment during the Emergency, which brought down the powers of the Supreme Court and other provisions which used to abrogate our democratic values, was repealed.
The proceedings of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies were made in newspapers through the 44th Amendment .
Under this, some powers of the Supreme Court were restored in this amendment also made that fundamental authorities found under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be violated even during the Emergency.
For the first time, such arrangements were made that on the written recommendation of the Cabinet, the President will announce the Emergency, as well as it was decided that the period of emergency cannot be extended more than six months at a time.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the manner in which democracy was killed in 1975 by implementing the Emergency could not be repeated again in the future.
Their invaluable contribution to maintain the glory of Indian democracy will always be remembered.
Once again I pay my tribute to such a great leader
My dear countrymen, like every year, this time too, people were very keen on the Padma Award.
Today we are moving towards a New India, we want to respect those who are doing our job at the grass-root level.
On the strength of their hard work, positive changes are taking place in the lives of others in different ways.
In fact, he is a true workman, who lives in public service, social service and most of these selfless nation service
You must have seen when the Padma Award is announced , people ask who it is .
In a way, I consider it a great success because these are those people who are not on the front stage of T.
These are far from the world of brightness, but these are people who do not care about their name, just believe in working at the grassroots level.
Yoga : He won the message of Karmasu Kaushalam Gita in a way .
I want to tell you about some people like this .
You must have heard about the Daitari hero of Odisha, they are not known as Janal Man of the Disha, the Daitari Naik has cut the mountain in his village and made the way to the canal for three kilometres.
Take only the Abdul Ghafur Khatri ji of Gujarat, he worked marvellously to revive the traditional Rogan painting of Kutch
They are doing a great job to bring this rare painting to the new generation .
I gifted former US President Barack Obama to the Tree of Fie Art Culture made by Abdul Ghafur .
Among the Padma Awardees, Shabbir of Marathwada is known as the servant of Saiyid Gau-Mata
The way they spent their entire life in the service of Gomata , it is unique in itself .
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the person who first tried to empower the victims and exploited through the Kalangium movement in Tamil Nadu and started community based small financial system.
Even at the age of 100 , he has been training people around the world and has made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers so far .
Jamuna Tudu , famous by the name of Lady Taran in Jharkhand , did the bold task of taking iron from Timber Mafia and Naxalites , not only saved 50 hectares of forests , but also encouraged ten thousand women to unite and protect trees and wildlife .
It is the glory of Jamuna ji's hard work that today the villagers plant 10 trees on the birth of every child and 10 trees on the marriage of the girl.
The story of Mukta Ben Pankajkumar Dagli of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration, even after being divyang himself, it is difficult to get the example of the work done for the upliftment of Divyang women, by establishing an institution named Chakshu Mahila Sevakunj, they are engaged in the reputed work to make blind children self-reliant.
Kisan uncle of Muzaffarpur, Bihar, i.e. the story of Rajkumari Devi is very inspiring
He has presented an example in making women empowerment and farming profitable
Kisan uncle linked 300 women from their area to Self Help Group and motivated them to make financially self-reliant.
He trained women in agriculture as well as other means of employment. The special thing is that they worked to connect technology with agriculture and my countrymen, perhaps this is the first time that 12 farmers have received Padma Awards in this year's Padma Awards.
Usually , very few people associated with the agricultural world and very few people who have made direct farming have come to the list of Padma Shri .
This is a changing picture of India in itself.
My dear countrymen, I want to talk to you today about a heart touching experience that I have been feeling since last few days.
Today, wherever I am going in the country, my effort is to meet some beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat's scheme PM-JA i. e.
He was treated by this scheme and he became the head of a healthy household, became a victim of a career of his family, was unable to work - he got the benefit from this scheme and he became healthy again and started living a new life.
Brothers and sisters, about twelve lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme in the last five months.
I found how big a change is coming in the life of the poor .
If you all know any poor person who cannot be treated in the absence of money , tell him about this scheme .
Separate education boards across the country will start the process for testing the board of class II and II in the next few weeks.
My best wishes to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who have been testing.
A few days ago, a very big event was held at the Town All Format in Delhi.
The discussion on the examination was one of its characteristics that the various subjects related to the examination were openly discussed .
There are many aspects that can surely be beneficial for students .
All students, their teachers, their parents can see the recording of this programme on YouTube, then greet all my exam warriors for the coming examination.
My dear countrymen, it cannot be the matter of India and the festival cannot be done.
There is hardly any day in our country, which has no significance, which has no festival.
Because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture
A few days later the festival of Mahashivaratri is going to come and this time Shivaratri is on Monday and when Shivaratri is on Monday, it has a special significance in our hearts and temples.
He discussed many topics and his self - confidence was surely inspiring .
During the interaction, when I was talking to a learned young man, he said, "I am a stage artificial and I am immigrant in the entertainment programs, then I asked whom do you immigrate"
So he told me that I ' m the prime minister ' s immigrant
So I told them to look at it and it was very surprising for me, so they made a complete immigration of the way I talk about the mind and the immigration of the mind.
I am glad to hear that people listen not only to the heart but also to remember it on many occasions .
I was really very impressed by the power of that divine young man
My dear countrymen, connecting with you through the Mann Ki Baat program has been a unique experience for me.
Through the radio , I am in a way from millions of families every month
Many times, listening to all of you, reading your letters or listening to the thoughts sent on your phone, I feel that you have accepted me as part of your family.
It ' s a very pleasant feeling for me
Friends, Election is the biggest festival of democracy.
Next two months, we will all be busy in the election gambling
I myself will be a candidate in this election
Respecting the healthy democratic tradition, the next mind will be on the last Sunday of May
That is, in the month of March, in the month of April and in the month of May, all our feelings of three months, I will once again start our dialogue with the strength of your blessings after the election and I will continue to talk to you for years.
Once again I thank you all with my heart.
Shri Shri Shivkumar Swami Ji, Doctor, Shri Siddhganga Math, Tumkur district in Karnataka, was not among us.
Shivkumar Swami ji dedicated his entire life to social service
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us to perform his obligations while doing hard work, the residence of Lord Shiva is similar to Kailash Dham.
His reputation was as a scholar who had wonderful hold on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer
He put his entire life in the fact that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
Farmers should have welfare in every way, it was a priority in Swami ji's life.
Siddhaganga Math regularly organized cattle and agricultural fairs .
I am fortunate to receive the blessings of the supreme god Swami ji many times .
In 2007, our former President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam visited Tumkur on the occasion of the centenary year celebrations of Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamy ji
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for the worshipper Swami ji on this occasion .
Giving in this poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Shri Shivkumar Swami ji and the mission of Siddhaganga Math in a beautiful manner.
Once again, I pay my respects to such a great man.
The Election Commission was set up on January 25, which is celebrated as National Voters Day.
Seeing the scale at which elections are held in India , people of the world are surprised and every countrymen are proud of the Election Commission by seeing the way our Election Commission organizes it .
There is no stone unturned to ensure that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, is a registered voter, gets an opportunity to vote.
It is very natural to be proud of the Election Commission when they hear these things .
In view of that voter, the entire team of EC employees goes to far-flung areas and arranges for voting and this is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for its continuous efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other employees who participate in the polling process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year, the Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country, this will be the first time that the youth born in the 21st century will use their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have the opportunity to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now they are going to be part of the decision making process in the country
It is time to connect your dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the youth to register themselves as voters if they are eligible for voting.
It is my duty to vote together. These feelings should grow within us.
For any reason in life, if you can not vote, then there should be great pain
Sometimes there should be some misery in the country .
I urge the well-known celebrities of the country to create awareness amongst the people of the country, whether it is a water registration or vote on the day of polling.
I hope a large number of young voters will be registered as voters and their participation will further strengthen our democracy
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some unforgettable and unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is multi-faceted.
On January 23, the whole country celebrated her birthday in a different style
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a Museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to the struggle for freedom of India.
You know that many such rooms, buildings were closed so far from the freedom within the Red Fort.
The closed rooms of the Red Fort have been transformed into beautiful museums, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and I.
Museum dedicated to Indian National Army
In each brick of these museums, the aroma of our glorious history is settled.
Speaking about the myths of the heroes of our freedom struggle on the museum, inspires us to go inside history.
At this juncture, the British rule was prosecuted by Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillo and Major General Shahnawaz Khan, Veer sons of Bharat Ma.
When I was visiting the Red Fort, in the Kranti Mandir, the memories associated with Netaji, the members of Netaji's family presented me a very special cap, hat.
Netaji used to wear the same hat
I kept the hat in the museum, so that the people coming there can also see the hat and inspire him to patriotism.
Indeed , the bravery and patriotism of his heroes are required to reach the new generation again and again separately .
Just a month ago on December 30 I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands
In a program, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place, where Netaji Subhash Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because it was on August 15.
This was the occasion to complete 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and efficient organizer
A brave soldier who played an important role in the fight for freedom
Let's go to Delhi, you give me blood, I will give you freedom, like Netaji made a place in every Indian's heart with the lonely slogans.
For many years, it has been demanding that files related to Netaji be made public and I am happy that we can do this thing.
I remember the day when Netaji's entire family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
We shared a lot of things related to Netaji and paid tribute to Netaji Subhash Bose .
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop many places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi .
Whether it is 26 Alipur Road related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or it is a revolution temple.
If you come to Delhi then go to see these places .
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing about Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, and that too in mind, I want to share a story related to Netaji's life with you.
I have always considered the radio as an important medium to connect with the people. Similarly, Netaji also had a deep connection with the radio and he also chose the radio to communicate with the countrymen.
I was told that these radio stations also broadcast weekly news bulletins, which were in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu etc.
The programmes broadcast on the Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes also helped the warriors of our freedom struggle .
In this revolution temple a visual art museum has also been built .
This has been an attempt to tell Indian art and culture in a very attractive way .
There are 4 historical ehibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 paintings and Art works three centuries old .
Excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Verma, Avinendra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Roy, Saloz Mukherjee have been exhibited in the museum.
And I would urge you to go there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji .
Now you ' re wondering that the art is happening here and I ' m talking to you to see the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore
You have yet to go to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as an author and a musician .
But I would like to tell that Gurudev was also a painter .
And the most important thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not name most of his works .
He believed that the person who saw his painting himself understands that painting, knowing the message given by him in the painting from his perspective
His paintings have also been displayed in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope you will go to see their paintings in the revolution temple
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed the message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
There was such a saint - saint Ravidas
Ravidas Jayanti on February 19
Saint Ravidas ji ' s doubles are very famous .
Saint Ravidas ji gave greater messages through a few lines .
He had said that there is a caste in caste, which can not be added to Ketan's parrot, unless the caste is specific, then under the leaves there is nothing under the leaves and at the end, but the whole tree ends, just like that, the person has also been divided into castes and human is not there.
They used to say that if God is indeed in every human being, it is not right to share them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi
Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his lifetime through his messages
It would not be wrong to say that they have explained the real meaning of labour prestige to the world .
He used to say that if your heart and mind are sacred in Kathauti , then God lives in your heart .
The messages of Saint Ravidas ji have influenced every section, every section of the people, whether the Maharaja and the queen of Chittor or the Meerabai, all of them were their followers.
I once again bow down to Saint Ravidas ji
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on MyGov that I will highlight Indias space programme and aspects related to its future.
He also wants me to urge the students to take interest in space programs and go a little differently beyond the sky- Kiran ji, I appreciate the message given to you this idea and especially to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad, where I got the opportunity to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Innumerable young scientists of the country contribute to our space program.
We are proud that today satellites and sounding robots developed by our students are reaching space.
The Kalam set launched by our students on 24th January
Sounding Rockets created by university students in Odisha have also made several records.
As much as the space missions have been started since Independence to 2014, almost the same space mission has been started in the last four years.
We have also made a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft.
We will soon register Indias presence on the moon through the Handriyaan-2 campaign.
Our country is also using Space Technology to protect lifestyle.
Whether it is cyclone or rail and road safety, all of these are getting a lot of help from Space Technology.
NAI services have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which are helpful in their safety as well as economic growth.
We are using Space Technology to improve the delivery and accountability of government services
About 40 lakh houses of 23 states have been jio-tagged in this scheme.
Along with this, about three and a half million properties under MNREGA were also done.
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country
It contributes greatly to our better relationship with many countries of the world
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has also gifted development to our neighbouring allies.
Through its very competitive launch services, India launches satellites not only from developing countries but also from developed countries.
For children the sky and stars are always very attractive .
Our space program provides children with great thought and opportunity to move beyond the boundaries which were considered impossible so far.
It is a vision for our children to keep looking at the stars as well as inspire them to find new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that the players who played and this time all the young players and young players have come to India.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 Games in Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January
When the local ecosystem of our departments will be strengthened, that is, when our base is strengthened, our youth will be able to perform the best of their capabilities in the country and the world.
This time players from every state have performed well at their own level in Khelo India.
The life of many players who win the medal is inspiring .
They live in a parking shade with their family
Maharashtra's Under-21 Women's Cauddi team captain Sonali Helvey is a resident of Satara
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother promoted the skills of Sonali .
Often it is seen that daughters do not get so much boost in sports like kabaddi .
Despite this Sonali chose Kabaddi and performed excellently .
10-year-old Abhinav Shaw of Asansol is the youngest Gold medal winner in Khelo India Youth Games
A farmer's daughter Akshata Baswani Kamati won gold medal in weightlitting from Karnataka
He credited his victory to his father and his father is a farmer in Belgaum .
When we are talking about the creation of India, it is only a New India for the will of youth power.
These stories of Khelo India are telling that the creation of a New India is not only contributing to the people of big cities but also to the youth and children coming from small towns, villages and towns.
