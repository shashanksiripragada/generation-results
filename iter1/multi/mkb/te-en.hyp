Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
O my beloved country , worshipped .
All of you are many luxuries in the contribution of Deepavali .
It is said that the light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which shows sadness by destroying opponents.
Festival tourism is a special attraction in the world .
There are immense opportunities for Festivals in our country's festivals.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is important in promoting Festival Tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided to do something new in Mann Ki Baat this Deepawali.
Seeing this in social meditation many stories have been discovered in social meditation .
This day our parents are in good professions.
She is actually Indian Lakshmi .
Ramesh Garu , my mother ' s blessings .
Their power of poet Tiwari is Indian Lakshmi .
How pride they feel that their daughters put good paintings .
She brought good rock in the CLAT test .
Megha Jain is coming , 92 years old hill has provided free drinking water to travellers at the Gwalior railway station .
Meghazi was very proud of the compassion and blessings of this Indian Lakshmi.
Many such stories are Shering .
You must read, get sports.
You should also share such things around you .
All these are my best wishes to the Indian Laxmis. My beloved countrymen, in 17th century, a poet was written in the language of Kannada at that time.
These emotions , those emotions , Indian Lakshmis , now the foundation of all those who say that we are kept there .
How important things , how important emotions , how excellent thoughts , Kannada is such poet .
Because of the importance of this artificial importance our society is the future of strong identity , stimulation .
My dear countrymen, on 12th November, 2019, Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji will celebrate the 550th anniversary of the world.
The effect of Guru Nanak is not only in India but in the whole world .
Our Sikh brothers and sisters live in many countries of the world, who are completely respected to Guru Nanak Dev ji's ideals.
I have never forgotten the journey done by Vancouver , Tehran Gurudwara .
How much can I tell you about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, but many episodes of Mann Ki Baat have to be required.
They were standing at the highest place .
Guru Nanak Devji believed that the service done with the emotional emotional emotional emotionality is priceless .
They opposite social misconceptions like incontinence .
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji has propagated his message from far-flung areas of the world.
Most of the travellers in their time .
We went to many places, wherever we went, we enjoyed all our hearts with their patience, comfort and simplicity.
Taking the message , equal messages they went to all the directions of the north - east , at every place with people , saints , sages .
It is believed that Shankar Dev, the well-known saint of Assam, has also been comforted with him.
They traveled to Holy Hardwar.
Guru Babagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi .
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev had stayed there .
He also visited religious places like Raj Gir and Gaya of Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Dev had traveled to Sri Lanka in south .
During the journey of Bidar of Karnataka Guru Nanak Dev had discovered the problem of water there .
During a ' Udasi ' Guru Nanak Dev visited the surrounding areas of Kashmir in the north.
They traveled to Uzbekistan , at places also the priests .
In an Udasi, he also visited a large number of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He was in the hearts of millions of people who followed his teachings with full devotion and continued to follow them today.
Some days Christians of about 85 countries have gone to Amritsar from Delhi .
There Amritsar is a visiting Golden Temple , Guru Nanak Devji 's 550th light Festival .
Where all these students have been found not only to visit Golden Temple , but also to know about Sikh traditions , culture .
Guru Nanak Devji 's 550th birth anniversary of his thoughts , ideals and ideals to bring more sports in our life .
Then once I bowed my head to Guru Nanak Devji .
It is believed that my beloved brothers and sisters , October 31 is definitely remembered for you all .
If read about the work style of Sardar Saheb , then it is known how strong their planning is done .
To participate in the Kangras event in Ahmedabad in 1921, thousands of people have to come from all over the country.
All the arrangements of the museum were on the Sardar Patel .
He also used to shine the water supply network in the city.
Nobody has been built without deficiency of water .
Not only this, you will be surprised to know that those who are not thieves, shoes and shoes at the venue.
They contacted the rails , made Khadi sanctuary .
At the same time Khadi Victor also became shining .
Our country is always debted to Sardar Patel for playing an important role in the Rajya Sabha.
As if there is no chance of discrimination formed on the basis of Kullu , tradition , they have done the main work of determining the primary hiccups .
We all know that the first Home Minister of India , Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute of India has played an important Bhagirathi , historical work .
Lakshadweep is a group of some islands .
After the division of India in 1947 our neighbour is situated on Lakshadweep .
He also sent a ship with his flag .
He had taken tough decisions without any time to know this news to Sardar Patel.
The brothers and sisters, Arcot Ramswamy and Arcot Laxmanswamy etc. have been asked to flag hoisting with the people of Travancore.
Immediately with his country Trivarna Patak was flying there , all the neighbours attacked Lakshadweep .
After that they do not want to do all efforts for the development of Lakshadweep .
Today Lakshadweep plays an important role in the progress of India .
This is also an attractive tourist place .
I believe that you will visit these beautiful islands , sea shores .
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity, built in the memory of Sardar Patel on 31st October, 2018, has been awarded to the nation.
This is the highest statue of the world .
This is twice higher than the Statue of Liberty in America.
The highest statue of the world is the pride of every Hindustani .
Eight and a half thousand people visited the Statue of Unity every day.
Apart from this many attractive centres like Cuttas Garden , Butter Fly Garden , Jungle Safari , Children Nutrition Park , Ekta Narsi are increasing respectively .
People get new opportunities everyday and for the convenience of tourists, many villages are enjoying homestead facilities in their homes.
We testify how a place has grown as a world famous tourist destination in a year.
People come from the country and abroad .
The government has played its role .
Friends, In the midst of this, Time Magazine has given a place to the Statue of Unity in 100 major tourist destinations of the world, there can be no pride of any Hindustani.
I hope you will go to see the Statue of Unity for some time in your invaluable time.
Every Hindustani, who wants to travel, is in touch with the family of at least 15 tourist destinations in India and always asks me to stay there one night.
Friends, You know that from 2014 every year on 31st October, the National Ekta Day is being celebrated.
Today, we inspire our country to save the unity and integrity of our country.
Like the symbol of 31 October the Ran Fort is organised for University .
Besides Delhi, in hundreds of cities of India, in the centres, in the capitals, in the district headquarters, in small towns, in small towns-3 cities, women men and women, residents, villagers, children, youths, elderly, Divyangs, all are meeting in large numbers.
In today 's time we were seeing an interest , jewellery on Mathan .
Ran Far University is also such a unique opportunity .
Run is beneficial for mind , brain .
Therefore, not only the body but also the mind and culture to bring India to new peaks for the unity of India.
Therefore you can know about the Ran Far University around you .
I believe that on 31st October you will also participate in the race for the unity of India, for your fitness.
My beloved country residents , Sardar Patel is sitting in the field of unity .
The Ekta Mantra is like our lifestyle. In the country with diversity like India, we should be strengthening the Ekta Mantra in every corner, every corner, every corner.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very careful and aware about the unity of the country.
If we look around us then many such examples are found which are constantly working to increase mutual understanding in those examples.
Any self-confidence attempts to forget those situations according to their own benefits .
How many types of words were spoken to increase the temperature in the environment .
Try to increase burning sensation in different voices .
Some Ninadas , those who go to great importance only do not tell what they are famous for their famous .
Whatever responsibility we remember .
But it takes five days , seven days , ten days , but as soon as judgment comes , a joyous , surprising change has been seen in the country .
On the one hand, it has been done to enhance the aspirations of two weeks, but on the completion of the Ramjanmabhoomi, the government, political parties, social institutions, the Pauri society, all the traditional representatives, saints and saints have been proclaimed with equal reconciliation.
Try to reduce temperature in the environment .
But those days are very good reminding me .
The dignity of the Judiciary has been respected and nowhere has the opportunity to increase temperature.
These things should always be kept in mind which gives us strength .
These days those moments , teach us .
It is an example of how much energy gives the country to the country .
A big wound is the day of the country .
I also dedicate my devotion to them today .
My dear countrymen, today the story of the house tells one of the beaches of the house that every village tells the story of the story from the north to the south, from the east to the west, it tells a story of the corners of Hindustani.
Every person, every family, every village, every village, wants to tell their pleasant experiences about cleanliness, because every effort is made to make one hundred and thirty crore Hindustan.
The fruits of these are also hundred crores of Hindus .
There is a pleasant experience of thrilling .
Not only separating garbage in it , it is also very important task .
In it , removing garbage around 130 tonnes , which is so much big service there .
It is also a place of accommodation of rare species of snow leopards , where rare animals like sheep , wheat colored bears .
We all know that these Siachen rivers are the roots of clean water , glaciers .
Therefore the work of cleaning here is to make people use of rivers like Nubra , Shyok by providing clean water to the lower areas from here .
My dear countrymen, the festival is a festival to raise a new awareness in all of us.
Otherwise Deepavali meaning buying something new , it keeps on happening more in the family of symbol .
I told that we try to buy things available locally .
If we get necessary things in our village then we do not have to go to Taluka for them .
Once again I tell you many lucks of this Deepavali festival .
We are different types of tomatoes for Deepavali .
But sometimes supplied with unconsciousness .
My many luxuries .
Many other thanks .
Mann Ki Baat, September, 2018
Indians are not prideed to see our soldiers , our army teams .
Any species , any place , any religion or any language every Indian is always ready to tell our soldiers , all their happiness , Madhuni .
All the 125 crore Indians celebrated the Parakarma Parv in 2016.
During the war on our country in Territory Mussoorie , our soldiers have given the form of surgical strike in the form of surgical strike .
How much capacity is hidden in us , how our soldiers keep describing their lives all the country , Manal .
Special days like Parakram Parva reminds of the traditional heritage of our soldiers in the youth of our country .
Such festivals encourage us to maintain the integrity and ethics of our country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, whose land belongs to these people.
In the two world wars that took place in the twentieth century our soldiers gave voluntary sacrifices for more than one lakh people.
With the purpose of celebrating peacefully it is adventurous to our country soldiers .
India is also one of the countries sending soldiers in large numbers of peaceful Bhadrata teams of the Ikya state .
In decades our soldiers play an important role in establishing peace in the world wearing blue helmets .
My favorite country , skyscrapers are unique .
On the 8th day of October we celebrate the day of airways .
In 1932 the smallest flight team of six pilgrims , 19 soldiers etc . had grown and our team was one of the two and a half century adventurous and powerful flight teams .
In 1965 the enemies of the enemies had also given our flight team .
The cost of Bangladesh happening in 1971 is known about the independence of independence .
In 1999, the Air Force played an important role in delivering Kargil from the cruise of voters.
In Tiger Hills, it was our aircraft team that made them soil overnight at the establishment of enemies.
If the archaeologists , scientists have been constructed then how much thanksgivings to the country because of the works of our air warriors .
It is unparalleled to show them in helping the people of the country by meeting all the species of nature from storm , air , floods in the jungle .
The flights of the country are an example of gender equality i. e.
Now, our air force has also given an alternative to the sustainable commission of short service for women.
India can now be proud of the support of women with male power in the armed forces.
As a result of strength the woman becomes even today .
My dear countrymen , some days Christian had fought with the death of Ablash Tomy of our boat team for his life .
How to save him the country of Yavat
You know Kada Abhilash Tomy is a very adventurous authority .
Without using any kind of modern technology , with the help of only a small boat the first Indians surrounded the world .
He has been moving forward in the sea for the last eighty days to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean.
But this boat team of India had spent many days fighting in the sea .
I spoke to him on the phone after he saved him in the sea a few days ago.
My beloved Desert Prajalara , October the second day of October is so important for our country .
This year October is a speciality for both .
From now on we are celebrating the 150th Jayant Festival of Mahatma Gandhi with many programs worldwide .
Mahatma Gandhi 's thoughts have given the inspiration of the world .
Gandhiji started writing some ideas in the form of a constructive programme in 1941.
Later on in 1945 when he began to fight independence he made his thoughts everybody .
To save the rulers of worshipping Bapu Railways , villages , labors , sacred , education has put their thoughts in front of the country .
It is also called Gandhi Charter .
This is the speciality of his personality .
How important , special necessity of this country has been understood everyone .
Then it is said that thy doubt is going on , thy ego is melting .
This mantra of my beloved country , Gandhiji said that this mantra is still special .
Today the middle class of the country has increased , their economic energy has increased , shopping energy has increased .
When we went to buy something we remembered the priest Bapu for a moment and remembered this mantra once .
Because of shopping this thing I am giving benefit to any person in the country .
Who has enjoyed happiness in the mouth .
I believe that this is his message that the poorest , weakest person in the life of the weakest person can bring about a great change in your feet.
It is said that Gandhiji says that if my beloved country people , cleansing songs then freedom is available .
Because he does not know but freedom came to India .
For example , due to the shopping of Khadi , production of production in special cases many people give help to the workers .
If all these dresses are also difficult then they should not be made , they should be used each other .
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was very humble from outside , who had a strong determination like a mountain from inside .
The ' Jai Jawan Jai Kisan ' is a direct exhibition of the great personality of Annadashastra .
During the seven and a half times he gave the mantra of victory to the soldiers of his country , the soldiers of his country .
It is common to talk about cleanliness when we remember the priests of my beloved country .
From September fifteenth, a garden called 'clean service' began.
I also got the opportunity to make the children suffer from cleanliness in the Ambedkar school in Delhi.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar himself laid the foundation of that school .
People of all the classes of the country participate in this September fifteenth century .
Come on, let's call a phone- "Namskar
Gunu tells you special thanks for your phone call.

The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on the 2nd of October, 2018 with the launch of the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu.
If you want to give freedom , peace , peace , justice to people , then it is specially important .
In the state built by Baba Saheb Ambedakar many chattis have been done for lices .
Inspired by them, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on 12th October, 1993.
In some days NHRC has been completed .
The NHRC has not only saved human rights but also worked to increase our pride.
Our Majesty chief, our beloved leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji has clearly stated that human rights are not ours.
In the symbol of our national human rights the ideal surroundings of Vedic times are enjoyed .
The NHRC has given a boost to human rights so that it has also played a crucial role in curbing the misuse of the hiccups.
In this journey of snakes NHRC has made an ideal , a belief environment in the people of the country .
I believe that for a healthy society, for the best democratic values, this is a great encouraging event.
In such a national level along with the work of human hakims the commission of human hakims of twenty six countries has also been established .
We have to try to understand human rights in the form of a society. This is the basis of the thought that Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vikas, SabkaVikas.
My dear countrymen, in the month of October, Jayaprakash Narayan is the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan. In this month, the centenary celebrations of Rajmata Vijayaraja Scindia begin.

This time also we made this ' Rain Far University ' in every small and big cities , areas , villages .
The best way to remember Sardar Sahib is the 'Run for Unity' program.
We sacrificed all efforts to kiss everything in the society by ' Run For University ' on 31 October , to kiss all the places of the country with equality .
This is the right religion which we give him .
My beloved countrymen, Navratri, Durga Puja or Vijaya Dashmi, I express my heartfelt congratulations to all of you on the occasion of these holy festivals.

My dear countrymen, this rainy season brings many hopes to our rails to work hard.
Due to strong sunshine dry trees , plants , dry rivers .
But sometimes this rainy season brings the floods of destroying , destroying .
At some places less rains , at some places more rains are drowned .
The destructions leaving behind them are unfortunate .
But on occurrence of danger humanity meaning what we understand .
We all know that the soldiers of the security program happening in Kerala are the soldiers of the soldiers .
In order to save the people stuck in floods they did not leave anything .
They played a very big role in helping, protection efforts, not just for a nice, but forty but also for BSF, CISF, RAF, everybody.
I specially say about the hard work done by the NDRF, how well they helped in such a difficult time.
Every Indian has to pay attention to the efforts made to keep the situations under the capacity of NDRF , their committee , active decision .
Ninna Omma Festival .
To come out of this risk very soon , especially the country , especially the state of Kerala , we pray to give the strength of this Oam Festival , the recognition of the state of Kerala .
It is believed that the people of Kerala , other places happening in the country , the whole country is with them once again .
My dear countrymen, this time I see the information that came for Mann Ki Baat, the messages that came to me more about one thing.
They are about Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
In his messages, many innumerable people like Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilash Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, Shri Narendra Modi Yap and others want to talk to me about the various aspects of Atal's life in Gau.
On the eleventh honeymoon of August the World Heritage of Atalji died in the world , the country .
And he was the chief minister of the fourteen years old , and a great country which left the eleventh .
If you want to say one way then he went away from the royal palaces of the last teeth .
People turned him into an excellent parlor , a beautiful architect , an important word , a beloved leader .
Due to the reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive organs .
Our thanks to Atal Ji for the 91st Constitution in 2003.
This sanctuary has brought two major changes in the royal family of India .
The first change is that the number of ministerial seats in the states is fifteen percent.
Atal ji changed it .
That is why the vegetation of money was done .
Because of this the work has increased .
These conditions have changed due to far-reaching people like Atalji and healthy traditions have started increasing in our political culture.
Atal ji is a true country .
Change has been done while entering the budget in their administration .
Initially, according to the tradition of the British, the time of parlor was held in London, hence in the evening used to enter the budget for the fifth time.
In 2001 Atal ji changed the time of the evening to sixteen in the morning .
Although once in the country you are seeing the churches of the states , centres of central states .
This is a good result of delivery .
Healthy democracy , best preservation , beauty of good tradition , continuous labor , unsuccessful churches etc . also give us the best devotion to the guests .
In the Lok Sabha the functioning of the work was eighteen percent , the functioning of the state was fourteen percent .
These rainy seasons of Parliament are always remembered in the form of social justice and development of young people.
In these conclusions many important children used for youth , backward classes have been adopted .
For decades, like the SC  ST Commission, there is also a desire to elect the Organisation.
To ensure the powers of the backward classes, the country has fulfiled the commitment to set up an Ocean Commission this time.
It has also given a state authority which takes forward the goal of social justice .
Therefore, the parlor entered a difficult training by entering the law and order bills.
According to this the infected doshas do not less than teeth , training , twelve girls are done .
Just a few days ago, you would have read in the newspapers, a judgement in Mandashore, Madhya Pradesh, after just two months of inquiries, has executed two iniquities in case of atrocities against the girl.
Earlier, in a judgement in Kathani, Madhya Pradesh, only five days after inquiries were found.
Rajasthan has also taken some such rapid decisions.
This chatti plays an important role in stopping the unrighteousness done on women , girls .
When we move forward for nationalism, we can bring about changes in the lives of poor, backward, backward and backward people.
In monsoons this time everybody has made an ideal ideal .
All the parlors of the country are giving thanks to the heart of Bahrang .
My dear countrymen, these days, the eyes of crores of people are on Asian sports in Jakarta.
Asia crickets are happening even more .
I am telling all the sports played for the country .
If India is fit then the bright future of India will be built.
Once again I express my heartfelt congratulations to the sportspersons in Asia along with other sportspersons also want to see the best performance.
Everybody 's national sports day is the contribution of luxury .
Besides this all the countries also remind him with great pride , spirituality .
In his memory, we celebrate the fifteenth of September as Engineers Day.
The engineers of our country walking in their footsteps have cherished their existence in the world .
It is called 'Bhu' in the coach.
These houses have been seen three earthquakes .
But if you have any harm .
Our ancestors have made this house according to the environment here , nature .
It has been said that it has been said that after listening to me that , according to the local situations of that time , normal people living safely .
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think about our future.
Keep work shops at every place .
During changing we learn something new things .
What should be taught to the students
Then we met .
In the middle of this many places rains are coming properly .
At some places more rains are coming as if there is obstruction .
In some places people are waiting for rains because of not rains .
Man is brought against nature .
That is why sometimes nature becomes tired on us .
Therefore we have to save nature from nature lovers .
Twelve Junior football sportspersons in Thailand went to a cave for their coach tour.
Normally it takes a few hours to go inside that cave, come out.
But the decision of that day is different .
There was no way to come out , they stayed near a small diabetes situated inside the cave .
Not only in one , two days , but also for eight days .
On the one hand if they fight with danger , on the other hand Yavat has displayed the values of humanity of the world .
These children were prayed to come out safely throughout the world .
These children have tried to know where they are stuck , they have done all possible to know .
How to bring water out if it is not possible to save them during the time of rainy season it is possible to bring them out .
Fortunately they were safe , as soon as they were safe , all the world had enjoyed peace .
But how did this salvation program take place in another sight .
The complete responsibility found at every level is unique .
Government , children 's parents , their family members , media , people of the country , all have also been seen marvellously .
In this entire behavior a Jawan of Dhailand Navy had lost his life .
It is enough to work on our goal with peaceful , stable mind .
Some days Christian had left us the beloved poet Neerajji .
How much strength can be given to our Indians as well , inspiration can be given to the Indians as well .
This is the time of the beginning of the art galleries .
The youngsters are asked in the most important part of their lives, where their eyes turn from questions to cut-offs.
The meditation of students turns from home to hospital.
Students come in the shadow of professors from the shadow of parents .
I believe that my young friends keep on enjoying their college life very happy , enthusiasm .
For the first time, when you get out of the house, get out of the city, get separated from a fragile environment, you have to become yourself simple.
How many youths come out to give a new direction to their life for the first time .
All of you have to say that stay peaceful , spend life enjoying life , enjoy yourself completely in life .
Small friends are priceless .
But to choose new friends , to choose friends , to make those friends standing , it has to be done with very knowledge .
Learn new experts , new languages .
A student of Ashram Chaudari of a negative family of Madhya Pradesh has done victory over all the difficult competitions of his life .
Jodhpur was successful in the first attempt of AIMS Taluku MBBS test .
He had done the work of his father ' s garbage , and played his family .
My beloved country , some days Christians attracted an archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically .
If we read inside then we try to bring changes in the life of normal person by using our youth technology , creatively .
Once in the city of Sanjoj, called Technology Hab in America, I am celebrating with Indian youth.
I would like them to do something for the country by thinking about how they can use their everybody for India.
Using their professional skills, both of them together made a smart village yp.
Apart from meeting the people of this yp village not only with the world but they have to give any advice , information , information , it has been available in their own mobile .
In a way, this yp village is trying to bring digital revolution in the village and it has become easier to record and track and monitor the development work done in the village through this yp.
The Yap consists of Phone Directory, Archives Department, Jabita, Health Centres, Information Centres of the village.
In order to know the FACT rattle between the Grameen Feature Railways of this Yap, the Market Place is useful for their products.
If you look at this thing then one thing will be understood that those youngsters are living in America, living in the midst of the lifestyle and thoughts and many years ago, even after leaving India, they have been psychologically drowned with their village, keeping in mind the small things of their village.
That is why they can do something like that of the village properly .
This relation related to their village , its roots , is natural in every Indian .
But sometimes because of time , distances , situations , because of which a thin smoke gets stuck on it , but if someone has a small swing then everything inside comes up again .
Pandaar Pu is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra.
One fifteen , twenty days before Ashad Ekadashi , the pilgrims of Varkari i . . pilgrimage along with palanquins go on foot for pilgrimage .
This journey is called Vardi, in which lakhs of devotees participate.
Gyaneshwar , Tukram etc . keep in the palanquin , Vithal , Vithal , Vithal , dance , walking on foot .
Travellers or Vithoba or Panduranga reach there for visiting Vithal Bhagwan .
Vithal Bhagwan saves the names , bows , sufferings , sufferings .
Maharashtra , Karnataka , Goa , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana people have unparalleled devotion , devotion .
Going to Vithoba Temple in Pandaarpur, there is a unique experience of glory, beauty and spiritual joy.
If possible then I want to feel the experience of Pandapur Waterfall once .
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram etc. are still training the common people in Maharashtra.
Bharud or Abhang, the main folk musicians of their folk music, we get a message of harmony, love, cordiality through them.
Due to this the society of the society gets the mantra of fighting against the beliefs .
The power to see their mistakes of British rulers is in him .
The Englishers tried to ask the royal palace three times in twenty years .
This is not a small thing .
An interesting incident about a Tilak statue located in Lokmanya Tilak, Ahmedabad is being shared with the people of the country.
He said that when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 1920, his memorial was dedicated to Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected as the Meer of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and he chose Victoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak.
Finally the idol was built . Sardarji had done this idol besides anyone , 1929 on 28 February 28 Mahatma Gandhiji .
The most important thing is that in this garden meeting the priest Bapu said that after coming to Sardar Patel the idol of Tilak was also possible because of his artificiality not only for a person of Ahmedabad city but also for his artificiality .
Because of the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak the tradition of social Ganesh Festival has started .
These cultural festivals along with traditional devotion , festivals , social awareness , social awareness , civilization , equality among people have become an effective medium to move forward .
This is also known because of such arrangements that our old heritage , history standing in the history of our old heritage , how much interest in our youth .
Today we keep looking at worshipping the statues of Ganesh in almost every street in many cities .
One team is organised worshipping together in that street .
This is an unknowing opportunity for our youth, where they can learn the quality of nutrition, management etc.
Good milk , development fruits give every Indian .
He also sacrificed his life with the concept of breathing freely throughout the country .
I am talking about Chandra Shekhar Azad .

There is no historical incident in the history of our country , there is no one day .
Every place in India has its own heritage .
It is true that on 28th honey I am coming to Maghar .
When I was working at Kabir Wad in Gujarat, a national meeting was organised by some people who played the Kabir tradition.
Why did you go to the cost of Kabir Dasji
There was a belief that if you die in Maghar, heaven would reach.
It is believed that on doing sacrifice in Kashi heaven goes .
Satpurus Kabir Das was not believed to have seen Maghar in unclean manner .
He tried to destroy the beliefs , mischiefs situated in his lifetime .
Therefore he went to Maghar and grave there .
Kabir Das has dedicated social equality , peace , civilization through his creations , traditions .
These are his ideals .
This ideal ideal is seen in his writings .
In this time also they are inspired with us .
One of his writings is Kabir Soi Peer Hai, Joe Peerzo Peerzo Peer Na Janahi, So Ka Peer Me Peer.
Kabir Dasji has shown special attention towards social unity .
He used to think more about the future than his time .
Such a guru is another guru - Jagadguru - Lord Guru Nanak .
The inspiration of centuries is giving inspiration .
They say that the service of lice , refuges is the service of God .
We will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Lord Guru Nanak in 2019.
We all want to participate in this festival with happiness .
It is a deep village full of sacrifices .
There is a history covered with Punjab .

A small child incidents of the small village situated in the changing village can also give inspiration to hundred crores of people of the country .
I am debted to the people of the country .

One nation, one tax is the dream of the people of the country.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the states if anyone has to express the 'One Nation, One Tax reform'.
GST is an important example of Cooperative Federalism and all the states have decided to set up such a large tax reform in the country.
But all the decisions taken by this GST council have also been taken with everyone .
There were 17 different types of teeth in the country before GST but after this arrangement, one single teeth came into effect throughout the country.
Before this many times in the matter of teeth of the country the cannons used to come on Ajmaishi .

Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskara
Through Mann Ki Baat, you all got the opportunity to come back again.
It is said that all of you are very well remembered that six women of Navika team have been done by the Vrindra Vrindravan for the last few months .
I would like to talk about this journey called Navika Sagar Parikrama.
They decided to travel about twenty thousand miles of sea journey in various seas , sea shores , about twenty thousand miles of sea journey .

How happy work is this .
At the same time it shows their relationship towards cleanliness , environment .
As many people try to climb someone , some of them have also completed this work successfully .
It is said that all these adventurous adventurous adventurous heart attacks , especially children .
My beloved country , especially my young friends , two months ago when I told about fit India then I did not expect so much .
It is not considered that in such a large number people do not forget it .
While talking about fit India , I believe that as much as we play , the whole country plays more .
In social meditation people are divided videos of fitness .
One of them is making a taxi on each other .
Everybody is participating in this fit India .
Whether it is cinema or sports or the heads of the country, the soldiers of the army, school teachers and all around, the same call says: "If we are fit then the country is fit."
My dear countrymen, many times in Mann Ki Baat, you are listening to me about sports, sportspersons, some sportspersons.
Christians have also shared their opinions with us through the Mann Ki Baat program .
Thank you for calling the phone, Chhavi Yadav.
Not only this , in every street , some games participating in the life of every child are gradually lost .
There was a special place in summer holidays for these games .
Once in bed , once after dinner at night , without worry , surely all children used to ask all these games for hours .
Some games were like playing all the family .
The unity hidden in diversity in our country is also seen in this game .
One game is known by various names in different areas .
I am not a resident of Gujarat, there is a game which is called ' Chomal Isti-Ashta-Chemma'.
It used to play with laughter, worries or Dais, 88 square bords.
This game was played in almost every state .
In Karnataka, it is called Chaukabara. There are many names like Attu in Madhya Pradesh, Pakidakali in Kerala, Champul in Maharashtra, Dam in Tamil Nadu, Tham Ani and Lochangapo in Rajasthan.
In Andhra Pradesh this game is called Guti-Bills or wood-Bills .
In Orissa Gulibadi is called Ani , Maharashtra .
There is a time to play some games .
There is also a time to fly air .
I mean, how to make goals, how to make yourself strong, how to learn team spirit, how to provide mutual cooperation etc.
If we play these games together from children to mother - mother , mother - father , mother - father then the international levels of generations also get destroyed .
Along with this we also know our culture , traditions .
Many games give us excellence about society , environment etc .
In schools , streets , youths come forward and encourage these games .
We can make our traditional sports Taluku the biggest sportsperson of Arcaeve through Group Crowd Sourcing.

Mahatma Gandhiji had dedicated this poison throughout the life .
If India speaks of climate justice, has played a key role in the cop21 and Paris Agreements, then through the International Solar Alliance, the entire world stands on one threshold, all of which is a thought to realize the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
If we want to make our land clean , green leaf then what will we think on this environment day .

In the year 1857 in this month our Indians had shown their success to the English .
In many places of the country our soldiers , rails are standing against unrighteousness .
It is a matter of sadness that we have to say that for a long time only 1857 incidents were rebellious churches , soldiers rebellious .
But in reality not only estimating that incident but also an attempt to hurt our self-confidence .
It was done in 1857 that Veer Savarkar Ji had said that it was not just a rebellion but it was our first freedom fighter .
Savarkar is a person with many specialities .
He worshipped both the surgeons , hospitals .
Ordinarily he reminds Ganesha to fight against his victory , British rulers .
Besides all this, he was also a shining poet, a social worker, who always sacrificed the feelings of compassion and unity.
Our beloved princes, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had made a unique description about Savarkar ji.
Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji has been pictured properly .
Savarkarji walked with both poets , crafts .
Our children are unsuccessful to keep their houses in the house because of the garbage . The poor people who learn to cover their body .

This is not just a matter of Sikar region but you can see many such things in every corner of India.
Because of your place , nearby people know how people are celebrating their situations .
While standing near some tea , while enjoying the taste of tea , people sitting on the bed , their churches , opinions , examinations have been heard .

My young friends, I am inviting you for a special internship.
The Government of India has launched a Swachh Bharat Summer Internship-2018, in collaboration with the Departments of Sports, Wildlife, Wildlife, Drinking Water, etc.

My dear countrymen, whenever I get the opportunity, I will definitely see the Good News India programme in a far-sighted vision.
This youth group has made a big proposal for reading children living in dirty children .
Initially they were so much moved to see the situations of children living on roads , how much they were moved in such a creative work .
This procedure started with fifteen children of dirt situated near Gita Kalni of Delhi today two thousand children in the capital .
The youths , educations , educations , educations have been impressed in this Bhagirathi attempt for change in society .
Brothers and sisters , similarly some rails of the mountainous areas of Uttarakhand have been done inspiration for all the rails situated in the country .
They changed their area apart from their incidents with their incidents .
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, only wheat, gardens, corn, barley etc. are planted.
Due to the reason of the hilly area these fruits are not available properly .
The rails of Kapkot area have discovered the way to increase the price of selling these fruits directly in the market -LRB- increasing rate -RRB- .
Because of the excess of iron minerals in all these fruits these iron elements are very beneficial for pregnant women .
In Munnar village all these rails have been built by a government institution , where these biscuits were opened .
The government has also contributed to the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM).
Now apart from approximately fifty anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district Almora , Kausani are provided .
We are listening to the wars for water in the future of my dear country .
Everybody says this thing but nobody is responsible .
The cost of water conservation is a social responsibility .
How to take care of one rain drop .
Everyone knows that the conservation of water is not new thing for all Indians .
Not only the subject of books but also the beauty of language .
For centuries our ancestors had seen it .
We know how much importance they gave one drop of water .
In the conservation of one drop of water they have seen new solutions .
If you have the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu then in some big stones built in some temples the arrangement of water reservoir , water conservation system , dry construction is done .
If you go to the temples like Manar Kovil , Chiran Mahadevi , Kovil Patti or Puducherry etc . then you will get to see big stones at all places .
We are well aware of the various types of descendants in the tourist destinations but we should not forget that the live demonstrations made by our ancestors for water conservation.
Gujarat's Adlaj Didubey and Patan Rani Didubey of Patna have been recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sitches.
If you want to say one way then do the temples of water .
If you go to Rajasthan then definitely see Chand Bawadi of Jodhpur .
The budget of cataract is also useful for this water conservation .
In the last three third time everybody tried their own efforts in the direction of water conservation .
About 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation, water conservation from the catalyzed budget for every student.
If you want to say about 2017-18, I have spent about Rs. 64 thousand crore in the entire amount of Rs. 555 crore i. e. 35 thousand crore for water conservation.
In the last three years such water conservation , water conservation has been beneficial for 150 lakh hectares land through the medium of water conservation .
Some of the wealth received by the Government of India for water conservation and water conservation have been very beneficial.
But in Uttar Pradesh, in some other areas, two small rivers like Sasur Khaderi, in Fatehpur district have been dried up.
The part of district instrument has put India on itself the preservation of soil , water conservation program in large quantity .
With the help of approximately 40 - 45 villages this dry Sasar Khadari river has been renovated .
This recognition of animals , birds , rails , fields , villages is successful in filling with blessings .
Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore is a person full of knowledge , scientific personality .
When the opportunity to listen to poets like Agunar , Portuguese -LRB- Portuguese -RRB- etc . then how much awareness has occurred in the mind .
You also have influenced Ravindra music , how much of their poetry .
I am dedicating to Ravindranath Tagore the Adarpuram Anjali.
The month of Ranjan is celebrated with complete respect , pride .
The estimation of fasting is that if the person is hungry himself then it is not understood that the hungry before him .

Our responsibility is to walk on the paths of equality , breeding .
Therefore sacred Ranjan keep giving donation in the month of sacred Ranjan .
My favorite country Prajalara , Buddhapurni is the main day of every Indian .
Seeing the three powers of compassion , service , sacrifice , this land of Mahamanshi , Buddha Bhagwan , this land of Buddha , we were prideed that he had done the way to many thousands of people worldwide .
While touching Lord Buddha , trying to travel on the path they saw , thinking , walking on the way , reminds us all the responsibility of this Buddhapurni .
Buddha is the power of equality , peace , harmony , brethren .
The need of such humanity is more in the world today .
Babasaheb Dr .
Ambedkar ji was very inspired by Lord Buddha in his social philosophy.
There is no important example of compassion .
It is one of all the important qualities shown by Lord Buddha towards the sufferings of people .
In many countries like China , Japan , Korea , Thailand , Cambodia , Myanmar etc . this Buddhist tradition , Buddhist teachings are included in their roots .
I am very happy to receive participants in the revival programmes of several Buddhist temples, including the magnificent enjoyment of centuries ago in Bagan, Myanmar.
To make a peaceful , compassionate world with Buddha 's blessings , to make their responsibility , to bless all the world of Buddha .
When we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the idols of Lafing Buddha, the idols of Lafing Buddha are lucky.
That day also Buddha Purnima .
Atomic use was done in Pokhran in Rajasthan on the west borders of India on May 11, 1998.
If you want to say one way then India has displayed its strength in science , technology areas .
On that day in the history of India , the soldiers of the country have been displayed in the form of exhibition .
Lord Buddha had seen how important for the peace of international strength i . . the world .
Similarly, when we stand as a strong country, we can be peaceful with all of us.
It is not only important for the country to use atomic experiments in the month of May 1998 but how it was done .
India has seen the world as a land full of some important scientists and has a strong nervous system that India can always achieve new museums and high peaks.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee had given the mantra of Jai Jawan , Jai Kisan , Jai science .
This time we are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of May 11, 1998, with the objective of creating a modern India, to create a powerful India, to create a capable India.

For its goal all the girls of Sadddle house adopted donations .
Some travellers who traveled in the cab gave their heartfelt donations.
A woman engineer gave her first jeeep to the soldiers .

Just a few days back, I went to the Agricultural Development Festival organized in Delhi.
To know about the rails of clouds the most affected me .
This place coming down has been shown by doing great work .
In the year 2015-16 our residents of clouds have been produced by recording the record of the last five records .
It has been seen that when the goal is determined , when there is courage to ignore the goal of the mind , then it will definitely be able to fulfil the goal .

Mann Ki Baat February 2018
This question has given an important scientist to our modern India .
When we talk about science, Indias Sir C.
His research is famous by the name of Raman Effect .
On one side there is a tradition of major Ganesha scientist Bodhgaya , Bhaskar , Brahma Gupta , Ayurveda etc .
On the other hand in the medical field we were prideed .
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose, Har Gobind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose are proud of India.
On the name of Satyendranath Bose the main particle BOSON has also been named .
In the meanwhile, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme in Mumbai.
It is very interesting to know about marvellous things happening in science .
Through Artificial Intelligence, robots, bots and other special types of works will help in creating instruments.
Instruments also increase their intellegens in themselves .
This technology is beneficial for glittering the lives of some lice , bahadhis , needed people .
Is it possible to get any help from the Artificial Intelligence to improve the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters in this program
Within a few days, I got the opportunity to visit the I Create in Ahmedabad, Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel.
I saw a designer made there .
I want to use Artificial Intelligence in many ways.
The qualities of science and technology are healthy .
They do not have any price .
How we want every instrument , only works .
But by instrument we do any work which depends on us .
Here human goal is important .
Science should also be used not only for human welfare but also for climbing the best peaks of human life .
Thomas Alva Edison had discovered light ball many times in his research .
Unfortunately, I am in the Karmabhoomi Auroville of Maharshi Aravind.
Similarly he has questioned everything in life in the form of a Maharshi .
They also saw the path of humanity by discovering them .
To know the truth it is important to keep questioning every time .
In the contribution of National Science Day I tell all the scientists , scientists , scientists .
Friends, At the time of disaster, many messages are coming to me on safety, dessert etc.
In his message to Ravindra Singh ji from Pune, he spoke about the occupational security.
He said that safety standards are not very important in our country where factory and construction work is done.
On the fourth of March, the National Safety Day, he said that the Prime Minister should take some precautions about Bhadrata in his Mann Ki Baat programme and increase the awareness of the people.
In daily life we are not unsuccessful about Bhadrata , not taking precautions , it becomes difficult to get Bhadrata during risks .
In such a situation, the risk is destroyed - the joy, the joy, the sweets and the swimming of the sweets - do not take the bonds so quickly - do not play with Bhadrata, do not play with Bhadrata, do not lose life.
By crossing this path all the times in our life can not be used .
But if the natural treatment is left , maximum risks occur due to our layer .
If we are very good, if we take necessary precautions then not only can we save our lives but also save the society from big risks.
There are many suggestions about Bhadrata at the place of working once but no one can play them properly .
I want to do mac drill in front of the children of various schools once a week with fire flames , once in a week .
This country has faced many chemical , industrial accidents related to many natural , human creatures .
Now the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is creating major sowing in the country.
When there are various types of risks like earthquakes , floods , storms etc . , the NDMA arrives at the same time .
Besides this they are also organising training programs for capacity building .
In the districts coming to floods , storms a program has been done by the name of Opda friend for training .
How important role is training , excellent role .
Two-thirds Christian Lu-i.e. every Etah Vehicle dies due to heat waves.
In 2017 the number of deaths occurring due to hot guards is less than 220 .
Therefore it is known that if we give priority to Bhadrata then we can be safe.
In such a situation in the society where there is a danger there I am impressing innumerable people , social incidents , best civilizations .
Under the leadership of BIMSTEC, all countries like Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal have exercised a joint disastrous management.
It is a first , important human use .
You should participate in your life .
Normally, we are travelling several times in the airways and in the beginning the air hostess is giving information about Bhadrata.
All these informations are also heard many times .
But if someone takes us to the airways , while standing , where is life jacket , how to use it , then I can say that no one of us can be properly peaceful .
There is a chance of seeing them directly .
That means.
But we do not pay attention .
Therefore, if we sit in the air then we listen to the precautions of our ears, but some of us think that they are ourselves.
We feel like in every hole of life .
We should not consider this Bhadrata for us .
If we all are best for our Bhadrata then society is also in it .
My dear countrymen, this time, in the budget, we have started a programme keeping in mind the need to create energy from waste to waste, waste to energy, from waste to waste.
GOBAR-Dhan means Galvaniing Organic Bio-Agro Resources
This gobar-dhan aims to clean the villages, improve the livestock's livestock and convert the livestock into COMPOST, BIO-GAS, and to generate wealth and energy through them.
The number of animals in India is approximately thirty crore and their names are thirty lakh tonnes.
Some European countries are in China to generate livestock and survival centric vandalism.
But in India it is not useful in complete level .
The part of Swachh Bharat Mission Rural is now moving ahead in this direction.
A goal has been set to generate bio gas based energy from the wastes available from animal litters, marble vains, etc.
Under Gobar Dhan Yojana, the rural brothers and sisters in rural India have to be encouraged not only to look at the poor, illiterate, but also to create riches.
The health of animals shines and their productivity increases.
Because of bio gas the capacity of cooking , lighting cosmetics increases self-confidence in the matter of energy .
This technique is helpful in increasing the arrival of roses , animals .
New jobs increase for vegetation , transport , bag selling etc .
A online trekking platform is also being created to enhance Gobar Dhan Yojana with rails and shopkeepers.
I am sure that the businessmen, especially the brothers and sisters living in rural areas, have to come forward and I want to use this opportunity to create self help groups and collaborative partners.
I would like to invite you to participate in the Clean Energy and Green Jobs.
My dear countrymen, till date we have heard about various music festivals, food festivals, film festivals etc.
But by a special effort in Raipur in Chhattisgarh, the first vandalism festival has been organized.
The Festival, which was inaugurated by the Raipur Municipal Corporation, aimed at enhancing sanitation and creative use of vessels in the city and encouraging various methods to reuse vessels.
Everyone participated in the various programmes of the Festival till the elders of the students.
Inspired from Raipur in some other districts also vanity festivals have been organized in various ways .
International women festival is celebrated every eighth March .
There are many programs in our country , worldwide .
That is, we are talking about the development of women and women ahead of the development of women.
On this occasion, I remember Swami Vivekananda's words. He said that the idea of perfect wemanhood is perfect independence.
In the tradition made by men ' s identity we were participating in the tradition made by women . Yashodan Nandan , Kaushalya Nandan , Gandhari sons , this is the identity of every son .
Now I got information from Jharkhand .
In Jharkhand, about fifteen lac women are not small but fifteen lac women have been propagated for a month.
In this procedure starting from January 26, 2018, only in twenty days, these women made a new example by making one lakh fifty thousand toilets.
How big accident you can imagine this .
In normal life the women of Jharkhand can prove to be effective for changing the cleanliness , cleanliness culture of normal people in normal life .
Brothers and sisters, I saw that after two and a half years of independence in three villages of Elephanta Islands, I had seen how much enjoyment was made in the news.
Everyone knows well , Elephant Island is situated at a distance of ten kilometres from Mumbai .
I am telling the government , people there .
The life of the people of the country is brightening and enjoying their lives is even more enjoying and happy moments.
My beloved brother brothers and sisters , Italy we celebrated Shivaratri Mahotsav .
Now with the artistic fruits of the month of March , golden coloured wheat , thrilling beauty of the heart , all these are also special in this month .
The festival of Holi coming to this month is also very favorite for all of us in this month .
On the second day of March the festival of Holi is celebrated with happiness .
The importance of colors in the festival of Holi is the same as the burning of Holika .
All the beliefs of the mind forget , everybody sit together , enjoy each other , Holi i . . this festival gives the messages of love , immenseity , brotherhood .
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the first word in mind in 2018.
Two days creatively we celebrated our Ganapati festival with enthusiasm .
The students of ten countries participate in this festival for the first time in the history of the country .
If they are Rasar then imagination Chawla Vartha had gone to the space of February .
In the accident of Columbia the observation of the space of the space of the space has given us inspiration to some lac youths worldwide .
If there is desire , strong conception , if there is any desire to do anything then it is not impossible .
Today all women in India are increasing the pride of the country by developing in every hole .
Since ancient times, the pride of women in our country, the place they got in the society, their support has been surprised by the world.
There is a tradition of some scholars in India .
In Vedasar museum there is some Indian scientists along with Indian scientists .
Our memories like Lopamudra , Gargy , Matri .
If we are declaring like ' saving ' children , reading ' children ' , but for a long time in our scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific
The pilgrimage occurring due to ten sons is available only with one daughter .
It shows the importance of women in our society .
Witnesses like Lopa Mudra, Gargi, Maitrei
The administration of Ahlayabai Holkar administration has been done . Rani Lakshmibai Veerti , women 's strength has always saved the pride of the country by giving us inspiration .
Shri Prakash Tripathy has given several examples.
The Sukhoi of Sitaraman built by our adventurous security minister Sitaraman gives inspiration to all women .
Bhavna Kanth , Mohana Singh , Avani Chaturvedi three adventurous adventurous games are taking training , Sukhoi 30 warriors .
Al Viman Crui, under the leadership of immunity Wazpei, moved back from Delhi to Senfrancisco, USA and then from Delhi to Air India Boeing Jet.
They say properly - apart from the queen of women in every hole they are giving leadership .
In such a situation most of our women are showing something or the other .
A few days Christian President had started a new work .
This book has also been made on the first ladies and women cheers to know about the strength of women throughout the country, to get inspiration from their lives and from their work.
This is available as an e-book in Narendra Modi website.
In such a situation in the country , society happening in society the power of the country is an important role of the women of the country .
If we talk about the civilization of women then we want to tell about a railway station .
You can say what is the relation between a railway station , a woman empowerment .
The Matang station of Mumbai is the first railway station of the whole of the country full of lady Sibba .
In all the parts there women are Sibbadi .
In the Ministry of Commerce, Railway Police, in ticket checking, in Anonymous Sibbadi, in Point Person, more than forty women are selective.
After seeing the Ganesh Festival on this time many people came to recognize the main part of the Parad through Tower , other social meditations .
The view of this adventurous experiment has also surprised all the guests coming from abroad .
This is a form of self confidence , self confidence of women .
These are our women playing the nervous system .
Skills are changing .
Another such thing has come to my notice that our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have done a great job and have seen a great example.
A decreasing picture is seen in the minds of women i . . one jungle , in which the pictures of women walking on the slopes of the head are seen .
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have shown a new picture of the country.
In Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, violence, atrocities, bombs, skulls, Maoists have created a terrible environment.
In such a dangerous place tribal women were standing on their feet by walking this rickshaw .
At the same time some women met in it .
Therefore three benefits are being done . On one side self-confidence has made them self-confidence .
Leaving unconsciousness in our hands , adopt changes at important places .
It is a speciality of our society to fulfil itself .
Such Indian tradition , such culture has been found in our heritage .
Some days Christian Bihar has taken an interesting new wave program .
To encourage the bad methods of the state with fingers more than thirteen thousand kilometres away from the world 's biggest human humidity has been done .
Through this program people have been done opposite to the marriages of childhood , virtue .
The opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the opposite to the oppo
Children , elders , enthusiasm , mothers , sisters , everybody participate in this fight .
From the historical Gandhi Maidan of Patna etc . this human hall has been associated with the borders of the state .
If all the people in the society have the right fruits of development, then the society should be freed from bad practices like houses.
Come , let us all make such bad ways from society .
We have built a new India , a strong , capable India .
I am impressing the people of Bihar state , the main minister of the state , the administrative instruments there , every person participating in that human habit , every person has made such a unique effort in the direction of their society .
My dear countrymen, the visitor of Mysore, Karnataka, who has come to Mai Gaupe, has spent six thousand rupees a month for his drunkard treatment.
They were told about the prime minister 's reproductive system .
After knowing about the genital medicine centres the expensive expensive expenses of medicines have reduced 75 percent .
The medicines found in the centres of January centres are available in the market in comparison to the branded medicines sold in the market fifty to nine percent quantity .
Therefore normal people , especially how much economic help is available for old ages .
Because of this reason good quality medicines are available at less cost .
These three thousand people have been established in the entire country .
Therefore besides getting cheap medicines the chances of traders are also available for their own business .
Medicines at cheap rates are used in the Indian Prime Ministers Jan Aushadhi Kendras, Amritsar Stores in hospitals.
The objective of this scheme is to create a healthy and prosperous India by providing healthcare to every poor person in the country.
My dear countrymen, Mangesh ji from Maharashtra sent a photo to Narendra Modi Yap.
This photograph is moving my eyes towards that side .
In which one person is pushing the Clin Mornna river with his mother , in the program of cleaning the river .
The people of Akola decided to undertake cleanliness programme to clean the Morna river in the Swachh Bharat programme.
Morna river flows in twelve months and now it flows only in a few months .
Another painful thing is that the river is completely filled with horse riding .
The shore of the road is also very bad .
Therefore, on the eve of Makar Sankranti, the first part of the Mission Clean Mornah from 13th January, was inaugurated at fourteen places on both sides of Mona river.
Big changes can be brought through labors .
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district, the city, the city, the city, and every citizen who has changed this work as a prestigious man, for their efforts. Your efforts will inspire everyone in the country.
You will have heard the churches happening on the Padmasambhavas in the middle of my beloved country .
The newspapers , TV attract our attention on this matter .
There is a tradition of giving every year Padmasambhavas but the process of Padmasambhavas has changed into three third three times .
Now anybody can naminate this book .
The process has come to transparent because of coming in online .
In order to increase the interest of science in children he is making idols with past forty years , unsuccessful things .
His goal is to give encouragement to use scientific uses with unsuccessful things .
Therefore on going to three thousand schools of the country he is giving inspiration to children by looking at films made in 18 languages .
How amazing life
You must have heard about the Bajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, which was born in a poor tribal family.
To spend life there was a habit of wearing pictures of traditional tribals .
This is the same spread not only in India but also the worldwide has brought how much fame .
These pictures have been exhibited in many countries like Netherlands , Germany , England , Italy .
After identifying the recognition of the recognition of the recognition of the recognition of the recognition of India in foreign countries , he gave him Padmasri .
The nearest airport from Thiruvananthapuram International Airport is Karipur International Airport .
The teachers of Avid Kallar are still living in a pack made of palms in the tribal areas of dense forests.
On the basis of its memory five hundred medicinal medicines have been made .
The medicine used for snacks is very simple in making medicines .
Laxmiji is continuously served by his knowledge in closed medicines .
They were also selected for Padma Puraskar. In order to build a hospital, Subhashani Mistry was selling tomatoes and vegetables in other houses.
In the hospital built with how difficulty some thousands of poor people are giving free treatment .
Everyone should listen to their experiences by calling school , art galleries .
Crossing the books also some attempts should be done in the society .
Every year we celebrate the ninth day of January .
Gandhiji returned to India from South Africa on this very day .
Today we celebrate this festival between all Indians living in India , all the corners of the world .
This time, on the occasion of the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we all invited the parlor members of the Indian Descendants of the world to a programme.
These programmes include Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tannia, Canada, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa, USA and other countries wherever there are parlor members of our Indian societies.
Some Indians living in different countries of Europe work in cyber security, some of them have been awarded Ayurveda.
I am blessed with the Ganu Irope incident to tell the people of the world through their medium of not identifying the people of Gannu , Indian origin .
January thirty honeymoon is the worshipped Bapuji Varanti showing the right path of all us .
On that day we celebrate the festival of martyrs and on that day we pay tribute to the great martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the country for eleven hours.
They are not only the principles of calmness .
Nowadays also we see how to ask Bapuji 's words are true .
If we want to walk in Bapuji ball , how much we can walk , then what is the best tribute to Bapuji .
Mann Ki Baat December 2017
This year, it is a matter of pride in the heart that this year, it has suddenly come to the end of the year 2017.
In some hours the year changes but our words keep on changing .
In the contribution of Christmas we remember all the important teachings done by Christ .
The most service of Christ is told about the most service .
We also see the synergy of service in Bible.
Dear countrymen , in this year Guru Govind Singh 's 350th birth anniversary of Guru Govind Singh was celebrated .
Guru Gobind Singh ji's life full of excitement and adventure is the best example of giving us all sports.
Guru Gobind Singh ji gave a message of great life and he spent his life while singing them.
Guru Govind Singh ji living in all these utensils of Guru , Darshan , Mahaya Jodhi Guru Govind Singh ji stands very swift for the people .
And he fought against the wicked , and against the unrighteous .
He taught the way to bring the bondages of Kullu , Dharamshala .
In these attempts he had to lose how much personality .
But he never let adventurous feeling reach .
I am fortunate to have the opportunity to participate in the 350th anniversary celebrations of Guru Gobind Ji in Patna Sahib in January this year.
Those who were born 2000 years or later , that is , in 21th century everyone born in 2018 , January .
You will also be feeling the pride of 21th century .
You can also be the construction of 21st century India, all of which have come to know of this January.
In this Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk to our chief youngsters full of 25 years of energy and concepts.
I consider all of them as New India Youth. New India Youth is hope, enthusiasm and strength.
I believe that our dream of New India will be fulfilled with the strength of this powerful youth.
New India should be a new India free from jealousy, social intensity, intensity, water, etc.
Everyone should get equal opportunities in a New India and take all the hopes and aspirations.
Shanti , unity , emotionality we need guides .
My new India has to come forward and make a new India in how to make a new India .
They decided the way for them , they should move ahead with their goal .
You can walk , also move the country ahead .
I was wondering if we started a mass movement in every district of India.
Mahatma Gandhi had changed the democracy of freedom fight .
The person full of social , enthusiasm is not impossible .
There is a proverb in English that 'Passimism Leaders to Weekness, Optimism to Power'.
I would like to welcome the people of the country for their best experiences in 2017 in the last Mann Ki Baat.
Through social media, I am happy to share their experiences with a large number of people through MyGov and the Narendra Modi App.
Lacs of forests coming from Positive India Hashtag (Positive India) reached more than 150 crore people.

He died in danger .
At that time we know only our situation .
How much help was received by the government so that I could turn myself back.

The work done by some people from their levels brings about social changes in many lives.
If we talk about the point of view of social point of view then I also want to divide one thing .
In the meanwhile, I know the inspirational story of Shri Anjum Bashir Khan Khattok Taluku, who was standing in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
He was a topper in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
In 1990 the rapidity of their ancestors were burnt .
There is so much rapidity , hysteria that their family had to leave their previous land .
All around this positive environment is enough to fill dark , cruel thoughts in the mind of a small child but Anjum does not let it happen .
He never thought .
He chose a new way for himself .
He came out from the opposite environment and came to his victory story .
This is not only in Jammu Kashmir but also in the youth of the country.
As much as the situation is not able to fulfil the situations can be displayed by the convenient tasks .
Last week, I got the opportunity to meet some children in Jammu Kashmir.
When I hear about their stubbornness, enthusiasm and dreams, they have heard how much hope they have seen in their life.
When I talked to them then they did not see anywhere .
They have enthusiasm, power, dreams, imagination.
This is my youth . This is the future of my country .
Beloved people of my country , not only in our country , but also in the famous religious regions of the world , the proposal is natural about the cave of Kerala .
For the blessings of Appa Swami in this world famous temple every year some devotees come here in numbers - crores .
How important is the devotee of all such devotions , how much sacred is it associated with sacredness .
Especially because of being situated in the middle of the hilly area , forests it is even more difficult to sing cleanliness .
But to solve this problem , not changing the problem properly , how to find out the way out of the problem , this is why the temple of Shabarimala proves to be an important example for the help of people .
Shri P.
Vijayan had started a program called Pungavanam .
Every traveller cataracts for some time in the worship of Lord and works for cleaning the garbage .
Every morning the view of cleaning the premises of the tourists here is so unique .
How important , how big authority , how much rich , everybody goes ahead after participating this pilgrimage in the program of Pungavanam .
Many such examples are for the people of our country .
This sanitation garden of so much development in Shabarimala, in which the pilgrimage Pungavanam programme will be part of every journey.

My dear countrymen, on the 2nd of October 2014, on the occasion of the graceful Bapu Jayanti, we all resolved to transform our country into a 'Swachh Bharat' and 'I don't have the right to do so.

This survey , various waters go and make the cities their own .
Talking to the Pauls and taking their opinions.
The Cleanliness App envisages changes in different types of service spaces.
Through this survey the cleanliness system organised in cities is a part of the cleanliness of the city or the lifestyle of people .
Cleanliness is not only the government .
This is also a big responsibility for everybody , every kind of incidents .
In the days of coming everybody participates with enthusiasm in this survey .
In this surveillance, your city, your place, your streets will not be lagged behind.
It is believed that in order to separate wet , dry , dry dirt in your house the use of blue color , green colored garbage is now a good habit for you all .

It is said that when I went deep then when I came to the depths of this thing then we felt that we were about fifty years old .
In decades Muslim women have done unrighteousness but no church has been done .
There is no rule of this rule in many countries .
But Muslim women of India do not have this authority .
Our government has given me a lot of happiness to pay attention to this matter .
It is my belief that Haj pilgrims are usually given permission through the latter method, but keeping alone women away from this latter method.
Our women should also get equal power as men . In the progressive way they should also give equal opportunity to walk with men .

In this contribution I want to tell some things with my brother , sisters .
The most important part of the earth is soil .
The symbol of eating we are confined to this soil .
One way the entire food chain is covered with soil.
There is no soil , trees do not increase .
Where can human life be possible .
How is it possible to live animals
This was discussed in our culture a long time ago. This is the reason that we have been the best since ancient times for the importance of soil.
On the one hand, in our culture, some of our scientific methods of nutrition have become part of our lives.
Both of us are important in the lives of the rails of this country to save the soil , to save the soil of our soil .
It is a matter of pride to show interest towards modern science , to try , to imagine , to imagine all of us .
I heard about the rails of Bhoraj Block in Tohu village of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Some residents of the village have considered the situation of poisoning with the best alternative , in the time of their soil tested their soil , any kind of red nutrition , micro-nutritional reds , micro-nutritional reds , that advice has been done .
After that you will be surprised to hear the results .
Along with this the soil has also been shining in the mud .
If we want to think about the fruit then we should preserve the land beforehand .
All our farmers across the country understand their soil better, accordingly, they have taken soil health cards over ten crores of crores of rupees.
We worship Mother Earth but how much the health of the earth is spoiled by the races .
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific tests that because of more than necessary redness the genetic damage to the mother .
Global Warming , changes in weather , we all feel .
Sometimes the winters used to come before Deepavali . Now the winters coming to December are slowly putting feet .
But as soon as winters start, we can not come out of all of us. This is an experience for all of us.
By going to 30,40 houses everyday and telling about cleanliness this child got rid of Bahrang urine from Kumahari village because of this child .

Children , elderly , women , men are everybody 's cleanliness .
Everybody needs to do something for cleanliness .
Our Divya brother , Sodrimans are strong .
Sports , adventurers can imagine anything .
You can learn something from them every moment.
These are queens in every hole .
In playing , in some social problems our Divyang brothers do not take anyone .

Blind T20 stands as a champion in the world cup.
Various types of competitions keep happening in the country .

But you did the right information.
I had thought to change your words even more .
We have forgotten the sadness of the elderly and the elderly living in our villages.
In our country also an attempt is made to remind the interesting incidents of the last year in the media .
Give inspiration to others .
If you want to divide good things , then mind to do good things .

In the coming mind, I will definitely try to give it to all the people of the country the things that have come in this positive form.
My beloved countrymen , coming month , coming in the mind will come between you .

This festival also tells how important importance of cleanliness in our life .
In front of this festival people also fulfil the entire house with enthusiasm , sanitation , river , pond , worshipping rivers .
It is natural to consider everybody proud of this great tradition of India .
But when I saw the impact of words in the minds, my belief is that 100 per cent of the people of the country have become stronger than the people of the country.
Take the example of expensive , doing .
During Gandhi Jayanti the result of giving me Khadi , Karnataka is that how much happy you are also happy .
On the fifteenth of October i. e. Dhan Opening Day, about one crore twenty lakh rupees have been approved at the record level in Khadi shops of Khadi, rural industries building in Delhi.
Khadi , doing , both girls are such a big height that you are also enjoyable .
During Deepavali approximately 680 percent old age has been emotional in the girls of Khadi Gift Coopen .
In the entire handicrafts of Khadi , handicrafts also this year about ninety percent old age has been emotional .
In the meanwhile youth , elders , children , elderly , women , all the adults also like Khadi , doing .
That is why I can imagine how much benefits of family members , many poor families .
Now, I have seen that Khadi for fashion. Now, Khadi for nation, Khadi for fashion, all the places have been transformed for Khadi.
Besides bringing changes in the life of the poor carbohydrate , the powerful means to bring them up with respiratory power , both of them change .
Tejas Gickwad ji, how to give the sweets of our house to the people of Bhadrata in the Narendra Modi App
It is said that during the festival we also remember our virgins .
I also felt that if we give the sweets of our house to the teams of Bhadrata .
On the other borders we got the opportunity to celebrate Deepavali festival with our Veer Bhadrata teams .

We believe that the family of Vasudaik family is our family i . . the whole world .
With this belief the first Indian Ekrajya Committee of India has been determined in various major attempts .
You would be aware that the proposal of the Indian Constitution, the proceeding of the Ekrajya Samity Charter, both of them begin with the word 'we the People'.
India has always demonstrated the equality of women and the UN Declaration of Human Rights is an example of this.
It looks very small but a strong thought is seen in it .
India has played the most important role in the peacekeeping activities of the United Nations in Umbrella.
India has always been playing a big role in the peacekeeping mission of the kingdom of Ikyaraj.

The Bhadrata team of India, apart from protecting the people there in many countries, has enjoyed many hearts by people friendly operations.
Indian women played an important role in peace program .
After that, all the rest of the countries also started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to hear that Indias role is not just a result of peacekeeping programmes.
Our peacekeepers from this land walking by Mahatma Gandhi , Gautam Buddha gave messages of peace and harmony to the world .
Peace care program is not so easy .
The soldiers of our Bhadrata have to work even in dangerous areas .
Various types of people have to stay between man .
Various situations , various kinds of traditions have to be detected .
They have to forget themselves according to the local needs of those areas .

After my beloved country Prajalara , Deepavali Shells , with new determination , you will start again in your daily life .
All the people of my generation want to want their dreams , luxury .
Through the sky you all had spent three times while talking to your mind .
This is the 36th part of the mind .
These things have not been told in my mind .
In this mind the calculations which I speak in this mind are the words which I sent from all the corners of the country .
Many of them give me inspiration .
Many changes are like bringing changes in the government .
Some individuals are immense , some social problems are like paying attention to problems .
I take your oath once in a month, half an hour but people keep reaching their point of view for thirty days in a month.
That is why the journey of three - three times in this mind is the journey of all the people of the country , feelings , experiences .
In such a short time I am giving thanks to all the people of the country to understand the feelings of common people of India .
Now three - three times have been completed therefore social scientists , university scientists , scientists , media specialists definitely take it .
But such positive churches are very useful in the future .
After that many social institutions of the country , many youths have come to know how many answers have come to me .
How many people who thought to use the food left in Kanchenjunga , how many people were able to use it , I enjoyed a lot , how much happiness .
Once again I saw the photograph of Selfie with Dr.
Besides one India, a big garden called Selfie With Dutter has started in the world.
This is not only a matter of social meditation .
This is the incident of producing a new self confidence , new pride in every girl .
Everybody had to take self-confidence with their daughters .
Every girl has some importance in itself , has its own importance .
Just a few days back, I have been sitting in the Government of India's tourism department.
It is said that whenever we go to an unprecedented India with those traveling there, we will take photographs there.
Then lacs of pictures coming from the corners of India have also been very big contribution for all those who work in the tourism holes .
I am experienced by talking to my mind that how big accidents can be lifted up .
On coming to the thought of three times many incidents were improved in my mind .
The country is always before walking in the right direction .
Everybody in the country wants to do something or the other for the welfare of the society , for the welfare of the society , for the progress of the country .
This is a part of my three-thirds Mann Ki Baat, which is known and learned from people of the country.
This is the biggest energy of any country , which is the biggest energy .
I am saluting the heart of all the people of the country .
Once in my heart I talked about Khadi. It is not a dress but a thought.
Discounts are given in Khadi sellers about both October, which are very less.
This Khadi procedure is like this , I want to increase again .
Increasing interest in the Khadi sector, people working in the Khadi sector and those associated with Khadi in the Government of India have also increased the enthusiasm of thinking in a new angle.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase the productivity, how to bring hand bags with solar power, how to revive the ancient tradition that has been closed from 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years.
Many people were produced .
Resumption of Khadi and Rural Industries Training Centre in Pempore, Kashmir has a lot of work to provide to this region.
I am very happy to note that the new generations will be able to create new things and create new products, in the beginning of the training centre, and in the meanwhile, I am happy to choose the Khadi items to give the Deepawali a lot.
People also began to choose expensive things while giving each other .
Some things move ahead naturally came into our experience .
O my dear countrymen, we have made a resolve in our minds in the month of Christianity and we decided to celebrate the Swachhta Festival fifteen days before Gandhi Jayanti.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated this programme.
Children , elders , men , women , cities , villages , everybody has been part of cleanliness .
As I say that this cleanliness walks ahead in such a way that we are seen before the eyes .
Everybody has adopted this proposal , to support it , to encourage it .
Therefore the jewellery told the president of the jewellery .
Along with them, every section of the country is also considering it as their own work.
They , scientists , schools , art galleries , universities , rails , coolies , rulers , police , children , youths .
If these places are poor then people will not be able to swallow up food and those who work here will also be able to see this pressure.
It is very good that more than 50 lakh people and more than forty thousand people have participated in this programme in the four days since the launch of Swachh Survekshan.
Some people are constantly working with the goal of showing results .
This time we have also noticed the new thing - keeping in mind the cleanliness of one side and not taking precautions on the other.
If you want to change cleanliness in a nature , then Bhavodwag garden is also important .
This time many competitions have been done by the service .
More than two and a half thousand children participate in the competition of this cleanliness .
Thousands of children have been made pictures .
Pictures have been pictured about cleanliness with their own imagination .
When cleanliness comes then I forget to tell them thanksgivings to media .
We are seeing in the sacred service garden of our country as much as electronic media, print media and the country are served.
In the meanwhile, somebody told me about the youth of Bilal Dar of Srinagar.
If you are happy to know that this Bill Dar has been made a brand ambassador for the sanitation of the Sri Nagar Puranas, you will be happy that whether it is a brand ambassador or not or not hero in the film field.
Not only this .
Billa Dar has paid attention to its twelve - thirteen years of age , last five years of cleanliness .
He is an inspiration for all those who are interested in cleanliness in age .
Bildard is giving many other thanks .
We should confess that my beloved country , future history , past history .
This time Nanaji Redi , Pondicherry is also the centuries of Dayal .
What is the center of all these great men
One common thing is that living for the country , doing something for the country .
It is natural to have the pride of their village programme when they celebrate their centenary.
The President of India, Shri Abdul Kalan, spoke to the youngsters every time about the rural development of the country's face.
Like Mahatma Gandhi Gandhiji Deep Dayal teacher also used to talk about the person sitting in the last stage of the society .
We should also run for unity , oneness mantra ahead .
In diversity we are normally telling the speciality of India .
We respect diversity but sometimes you try to feel this diversity .
Deepavali is situated near Deepavali .
Everybody going to tourism is a common thing .
But it is a matter of concern that people do not see our country, do not see the varieties of the country.
Our country is full of many varieties .
All these magnificences have also been tourism in the country .
Before starting this work an attempt has been made to understand India .
An attempt has been made to fill India in itself .
My own experience is that I have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India.
I got the opportunity to spend the night in more than four hundred districts .
I would like to feel all of you, not only the unity in diversity, but also the larger India, our immense strength.
One India - best India is hidden in it .
This is the biggest power situated in our country tourism .
My opinion is that if you want to go out somewhere in your holidays , changes , understand what other than Kosmo Baaldera , learn , go out with the goal of learning .
View India inside you .
Your life is rich with these experiences .
Your thought is large .
There are cost of experiences .
Normally Dakka is better for tourism from October to March .
Definitely send your photograph in the incredibly 97 (Hash Tag incredibly 97.
Also send pictures of man connected to the place where you go .
Not only the idols of construction , not only natural beauty but also write about the lifestyles there .
Can you put incredibly in 1975
You see, I would like to tell the government that after discovering from the beauty of one state, we have to create a public literature about the seven places that have come out of them.
The Government of India definitely works on them .
In such best places the government adopts information about pictures , videos , procedures , encouragement of encouragement from you .
Come on, walk with me.
This month of October to use the time of the month of March , to encourage the tourism of the country you can also become a big source of encouragement .
I am calling you .
My beloved country ' s people , many things like a man .
My mind becomes the victim of obstruction .
I leave deep effect on my mind .
As much as I am also like you .
Why is it an abnormal person that his husbands do not become heavenly while doing his service to Mother India
If the child becomes sufficient in young age then how can we imagine their internal condition .
She learned with hard industry for eleven months , she gave her life to realize her husband dreams .
Although the husband of Nidhi Dubey had forgotten the dead land while working in the army of Mukhesh Dubey .
His wife also reached the army by reaching the army .
It is natural for every Indian to have the pride of this maternal power , our valour of these virtues .
I am telling many luxuries with the heart of these two brothers .
They gave new inspiration , new excitement to the fort of the country .
These two brothers are many other opinions .
My favorite country Prajalara , Navratri Festival , Deepavali Festival is a big opportunity for the youth of our country .
FIFA Under-17 World Cup is going on in our country.
I believe that the sounds of football keep moving around .
Every generation the interest of football increases .
In any school or art gallery of India, there will be no young friends playing football.
My favorite country Prajalara , Navratri Festival is held .
Durga Devi is worshipped .
The whole environment is pure , fragrant .
There is a spiritual environment , festival environment , atmosphere filled with devotion .
It is considered to be the festival of energy .
These are also called Shard Navratris.
O my dear countrymen , Sadar Namaskar .
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand, it is natural to worry about the country when there is a humiliating news from any corner of India.
This is the country of Sardar Patel, which is the birthplace of Lord Buddha, the birthplace of Gandhi for the unity of the country.
The ' Ahimsa Paramo Dharamshala ' . We had come to listen to it since childhood .
I also told the Red Fort that it was not a traditional belief, but a political belief, a personal belief, a personal belief, a traditional belief, a traditional belief.
According to the state given us Baba Saheb Ambedakar , every person has all kinds of arrangements for getting justice .
I would like to assure the people of the country that nobody can afford this country, nobody can afford it, nobody can afford it, nobody can afford it.
Our festivals are also filled with many diversity .
Because of the archaeological culture of some thousand years we have received traditional traditions , cultural traditions , historical incidents , historical incidents , everything , because in the year some day there is no festival .
All our festivals also come according to natural times .
Everything is related directly to nature .
The society of Jain society is celebrated annual festival .
Jain society celebrates Purushu festival in the month of Bhadrapada .
The festival of Purushu is held on the last day of the year .
Actually it is a unique tradition .
The festival of the year is a symbol of forgiveness , ahins , friends .
My dear countrymen , today all the corners of the country are celebrated with the grandeur of Ganesh Chaturthi .
On coming to Ganesh Chaturthi it is natural to come to Bahraang-Ganesh Festival .
Bal Gangadhar Tilak ji gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago, which was a symbol of freedom struggle in the past 125 years.
After independence they are symbol of encouraging social education , social awareness .
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi is done for ten days .
This festival is called the symbol of unity , equality , cleanliness .
There are many luxuries in the contribution of the Ganesh Festival of all the country .
Now Oam Festival is celebrated in Kerala .
Onam is a major festival of Kerala in the colorful festivals of India .
This festival tells social , cultural importance .
Onam Festival is an important cultural heritage of Kerala .
The festival creates new enthusiasm, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people with the message of love and efficiency in the society.
Now our festivals also become their attractions of tourism .
Navratri Festivals in Gujarat, Durga Puja Festivals in Bengal have become one of the attractions of tourists.
Our other festivals also use to attract foreigners .
In that direction we should think what we can do .
In the tradition of these festivals ' Id-ul-Jaha ' festival takes place in a few days .
Many congratulations and best wishes to all the people of the country on the occasion of Eid-ul-Jaha.
Festival meaning belief is a symbol of belief .
Festivals in Navbharata should be made symbol of cleanliness .
It is not new for us but it is important to change it into a social habit .
Not only in the house, but in the entire village, in the city, in the state, in our country, cleanliness and cleanliness should be made a major part of the festivals.
My favorite country , modern meanings are changing .
These days, however rich you are, however modern your thoughts are, how new your thoughts are, all these have become a new angle, a new angle, a balance for thousands of berries.
Therefore in the days of this festival the soil Ganesh park has been started according to environmental environment .
If you look at the YouTube, the children in every house are making the soil generated and the colors are supplied.
Some vegetables are cut , some colored pieces of paper .
The media House is also giving inspiration to the people the training to make the idols of Ganesh idols according to the environment at a height of big height .
See how big change has come .
Happy change.
As I say , our country is full of hundreds of marvellous thoughts .
There is a lot of enjoyment by doing new inventions .
Some engineer himself told me , he got some special kind of soil , by mixing it , giving training to people to make soil .
After the worship, the idol will melt in water immediately after performing that goal in a small bucket.
I started the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which will be completed two-three days in October.
These parks are seen according to the consequences of Taluku .
Construction of toilets has reached 39 to 67.
It has been said that more than two lakh thirty thousand villages , Bahrang had been freed from excretion .
There was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives .
But after the swelling of flood water very bad odour spread .
During this period, the workforce of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera, Banaskanta district of Gujarat was inaugurated by two galleries and three mosques as Dussehra.
Everybody saved their sweating .
If an attempt to dedicate to cleanliness is made permanently then our country can climb more than others .
In one way before Deepavali , Navratri , Durga Puja it is considered to be sanctuary .
Go to the nearby buses , go to the nearby village but consider it as a garden .
Minister of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
All my social media friends can also work on your creative initiative, which can inspire us to work on the World Forum.

In these competitions there are three , three times in the state level of the district level .
Therefore, in the fifteenth of September, bring the 'Parishuddha Seva' mantra home.
Give some steps for cleanliness.
After the fifteen days of publicity, after the sacred service, you can imagine the sacred joy of the sacred Bapu ji while celebrating the Gandhi Jayanti on October 2.
My beloved country , especially I want to accept all your debts .
I heartily express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you, for so long you are not connected with my words in my mind, but I am obliged to thank you and my heartfelt congratulations to millions of people from all corners of the country.
The number of listeners is in crores but lakhs of people are coming to the north, sending messages, giving messages through phones, all this is like my big anger.
I have become a big opportunity to know the words of all the people of the country .
As much as you wait for things in your mind , more than that I wait for your messages .
They come to work as if I do .
Once some things are included in our habits , we also consider that we are surprising .
"Prime Minister Garru, I'm talking to Puna inappropriately.
I want to tell about my friends.
Whenever she is trying to help people, but she has a habit of her own.
I went to a shopping mall once with myself.
Two thousand rupees have been spent easily on one sari .
Pizza has paid Rs. 450 but has made barrasses for five rupees with auto driver who went to shopping mall.
The vegetables were bought on the way . Bermadi 4,5 rubbers were left on each vegetable .
I did not like it .
Not only this, if we go to shopping in Shorum, then we cannot afford to buy saris but if someone comes to work with the poor then there will not be any satisfaction.
Do you ever think that the poor does not want to do anything
In your life there is no importance of two forms , five forms , but your small habit of wounding your minds so deeply .
Madam, thank you for telling me through your phone call that hurts such a heart.
My people of my country also have the habit of proclaiming such a habit with their poor people , they will definitely change .
My beloved young friends , August 29th honey is celebrated throughout the country .
This is the birthplace of great hockey player , Hacky Mantra Major Dhan Chand .
And Hakki , and his servant , and his servant , and his servant ,
It is because of reminding this thing that my desire to be drowned with the sports of our country .
Sports should be part of our life .
When we are in the world then we should also be seen in that youth sports .
One type of sports is a big medicine for meeting minds .
I exhort you to come forward in the youth sports complex of our country and in this computer era, the Flag Station of Playing Field is very important.
Play FIFA in the computer but always show football in the outskirts.
Crickets are playing in computer but cricket playing under the sky in the open fields is different .
At one time when the children of the house go out , when asked to sell .
Now the situation is such that even if there are children in the house then they are drowned in seeing phones , cartoon films or mobile games are stuck .
Young friends, the sports talent portal has been created by the sports talent portal to discover and shine sports talents.
Where the talented children are in the sports complex of the country, the winners of the sportspersons can be uploaded in this portal with biodetta.
Electoral sports give training to the sports sports .
This portal starts tomorrow .
It is a pleasant news for our sportspersons that in India from 6th October to 28th October, FIFA And 17th World Cup is going on.
These six girls are going to cross the sea by taking a small boat of INS Tarini -LRB- Tarini -RRB- .
The name of this propaganda is Navika Sagar Parikrama .
They return to India after a few months round the world , or after many months .
The journey of our six girls between the waves of the sea has become the first incident of the world .
Indians are not prideed to see these girls .
I want to divide their experiences with the people of the country .
I will also organize a part of the Nrandra Modi App for your reading and experiences.
Because one kind of adventurous story , swimming experiences . It is very happy to reach these girls .
I am telling many blessings , many blessings to these girls .
My beloved country , September , the fifth day of September we celebrate the day of meditation .
A student , pundit , a royalist , even though the president of India is considered as a study every moment .
In its students the creative feeling , knowledge Taluku is the most important quality of staying in one study .
Everybody kissed with something or the other .
See the way to fulfil it . give enjoyment of success in life .
Such environment can make our schools , our art galleries , our educational institutions .
If we talk about changes in our country , talking about family then the teacher remembers that if we talk about the society .
The teacher has a very big role in change.
Because of its natural artificial instruments in every study the incidents of success in bringing changes in each other 's life , sometimes incidents happen .
If we try together , then we can play an important role in changing the country .
We move ahead with a mantra called Teach to Transform.
"Pranaman's Prime Minister Garu, my name's Dr.
Anna is the condition of food .
I live in Mumbai and Hovered University will work in their Indian Research Centre.
A researcher, Financial Inclusion, I am particularly interested in the economic conventions that are related to it.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Financial Inclusion, is a matter of discussion not only in India but in the world's economy.
On August 28, 2014, I started this propaganda with one of my hearts.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will conclude on 28th August from Jan Dhan Yojana.
Thirty crore new families were opened by which Jatapanch , Bank Khatas were opened .
This number is more than the population of many countries in the world .
He has changed his habit and he is going to Bank.
But now due to the atmosphere created gradually he also understood that he is also useful for the needs of money .
It is understood that in the days of coming if you want to do good work then money will come to work .
The poor is now looking at the rubber card in his pocket, he looks like rich and he feels satisfying that there is a credential card in his pocket.
It is considered glorious .
Approximately 65 thousand crores of rupees have been deposited in the banks by our poor people in the prime minister 's daily life .
In one way this is their power in the days of the poor .
Those who have become expensive by the main Prime minister 's birthplace , they also got benefit from Bima .
On occurrence of risk of poverty , if the main person dies in the family , in some days he gets two lakh rupees .
Jan Dhan Yojana , Insurance , Rupe card , Prime minister Mudra Point , common people have done some benefit .
I try to reach them completely .
Because of such inspirational incidents media can also be completely beneficial .
Such people can give new inspiration to new generations by prasading face .
My dear countrymen, once again I am sorry for you all if you are suffering .
In monsoon season the mind of man remains very positive .
Animals , birds , leopards , nature , everybody changes .
Environmental changes are taking place due to changing weather cycle and its impact is also very fast.
In the past few days the natural risk has to be faced in some places of Assam , north-eastern regions of India , Gujarat , Rajasthan , Bengal due to exaggeration .
My friends of Mantravarg are also reaching the place where possible .
State governments also provide best help to the problems of flood in their own methods .
In such situations the people working with social institutions , cultural institutions , services are helping them with their hands .
The Government of India is delighted to help those who have lost their lives at such times, whether military personnel, air force, NDRF or paramilitary forces.
Due to floods life becomes very unsuccessful .
Pulses , animals , monuments , roads , electronics , information centres etc . are affected .
Especially after destroying our brothers , fruits , fruits they have made plans to be done immediately for the companies of insurance companies , especially the fruits of the fruits , especially the climate centres , they have been prepared beforehand .
24 hours contraceptive Room Help Line is continuously working on November 1078 .
People also tell their problems .
Gradually we can also save ourselves from harms if we are doing our jobs according to the information of this environment.
When I am ready for the Mann Ki Baat program, I am guessing that more people of the country will be more prepared than me.
I heard the progress of your Chartered Accountants Day, very impressed.
Last month, on the same day, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has come into effect in our country.
That is why you can say whether the results of the government 's hope are coming in the last few months .
In this matter I want to know your thoughts .
Because of GST, I am very happy to know how they are getting cheaper and how they are getting cheaper things.
Especially the belief of yoga is increasing on the businessmen .
I am glad that the impact of GST in transformation and logistics has been so much.
How fast changed rapidly , magic registration done fast has created a new belief in the country .
The economists and technologists of the economy must study the use of GST in India and stand before the world as a specimen.
It happens to be a case of all the world university .
Because such a big height , such a great change , with the support of crores of people it is very big task to move ahead in this large country .
Definitely research this thing .
All the decisions have been taken concentrated by mixing state , central governments .
The consequences of those concentrations are not able to weigh any kind of weight in the lice .
What was the price before GST, how much is the price in the new situation, all the things you can know through your mobile phone in the GST app.
It has played an important role in enhancing the belief between the government and the businessmen.
It is said that all the ministries participating in this program , all the departments , central governments , state governments have told my hearts beforehand .
GST is an important example of the overall strength of India.
If you want to say in a way, it is a social collection.
Once again to victory such a big attempt I am executing the fort for all the people of the country .
Beloved my country is the month of August i . . the month of Victoria .
On August 1, 1920, we have been listening to it since the beginning of the collaboration.
On August 9, 1942, the uit India Park started, which is also called the August Violence.
1947 August 15 independence came to the country .
Seeing in one way , all the incidents happening in August are also drowned mainly with the history of freedom fighting .
We should know what happened in August 9th honey in 1942 .
The people of the country are drowned by the spirit of freedom from 1857 to 1942, which is inspired to build our emotional India.
On the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, lacs of Indians led their lives in the stream of garden with the mantra 'Doo Ar Du'.
Lakhs of youths stopped their studies , left books .
The great men like Lohia, Jai Prakash Narayan played a big role in the garden.
In 1920, the Cooperation Infrastructure Park, the uit India Park in 1942, both of which showcase Mahatma Gandhi's two forms.
In 1942, the rapidity of the garden has grown so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi has also given the mantra "Doo Ar Day", which is the background of the people.
Once the history of India has been rotated, I believe that the first freedom struggle of India started in 1857.
Then the initial freedom struggle was going on some original part of the country in 1942 .
During this long time the national park has been created in the minds of the people of the country .
Everybody has been determined to decide something or the other .
This industry, which took place from 1857 to 1942, reached the final stage of the year 1942.
The garden of ueen India has changed so much that English had to leave the country in 1947 .
In 1857 AD this independence park reached all the people of this independence Park .
Besides this in 1942 along with the five hundred and 1947 all the people were decided with one mind , successfully due to the independence of the country these five times .
These five are like a lip .
Now I will meet you with one Ganesha .
We got freedom in 1947 .
Now 2017.
About fifty years have passed .
Governments came .
Arrangements have been made , marai , increase .
Everybody tried to get out of problems of the country in their own way .
As soon as I saw that the five dates of 2017 were also 2022 .
Try to finish them .
However, from 1942 to 1947, five miles away from the country's independence
These five , i . . 2017 to 2022 should also be done for the future of India .
After five years we celebrate the freedom fighters of the country .
Therefore we all should make a strong contribution .
2017 should be done in our contribution year .
Every Indian, social institutions, local institutions, regional departments, schools, art galleries, various institutions and everybody is committed to 'New India'.
Come , we were part of this culture festival .
Therefore, I would like to invite my young friends and my young colleagues to come forward to collaborate with creative methods for the creation of a New India, especially online world.
Bring video, posts, blogs, businesses, new ideas using technology.
This procedure is a January .
We are also launching the uit India uiz for young friends in the NarendraModiApp.
This queue is useful in identifying the freedom fighters of our country by connecting with the history of our country .
I believe that you will spread all directions by giving an extensive publicity to this attempt.
My dear countrymen, on August 15, there will be an opportunity to interact with the people of the country from the Red Fort as the Prime Minister of the country.
The sound of hundreds of old people from the Red Fort reflects .
Attempts are made to give the form of words to the dreams of the dreams . In the last three-three years I have been giving suggestions and advice on 15th August .
This time too, I invite you to send your thoughts to MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
In the last three - three August 15 years I heard that my childhood takes more time .
Therefore this time I decided to reduce my progress time .
Beloved people of my country , I proposed another thing .
There is a social meditation in the economy of India .
We should never take it less .
Our festivals , our festivals are not only enjoyable .
Our festivals , social cultures are also there .
But along with this our every festival remains straight with the economic life of Pauri .
In some days Raksha Bandhan , Janmashtami , Vinaya Chawti , after which Chawti Chandra , Attached to Durga Puja , Deepavali .
As far as the economy is concerned, Rakhi starts making Rakhis in small households a few months back.
Those who make Rakhis , selling Rakhis , making sweets , thousands of people daily business is engraved with a festival .
The family of our poor brother , brothers and sisters are spent due to which they are spent .
Not only the festival of light but also the festival of bringing the glimpse of the house .
Its relation is tied directly with the poor families making small soil .
But I want to talk about the economic system of the poor people lying on those festivals , with which I want to talk about environment as well .
Sometimes I feel that the people of my country are very excellent , active .
In the last months the best people told me about environment .
125 years , 125 crore people of the country .
Together with this we will say that environment friendly Ganesh i . . soil Ganesha is worshipped for environment protection .
It is said that for all the people of the country there are many different kinds of festivals of different festivals .
Beloved my country residents , educational sector , economic sector , social sector , sports , playing games , our girls are continuously giving new goals to the country .
All the people of our country are also proud to see our girls .
Some days Christian women of our country have displayed marvellous games in the world camp competitions .
In this week I got the opportunity to become Bhenti with those games .
I enjoyed talking to them, but I was very happy to note that they were not able to win the World Cup.
In their mohals also those disappointments , stress were seen .
If the players of India were smitten then we saw many games to break on them with anger .
If you are not able to spend the match , then you have spent the hearts of 125 crore people .
I told those sportspersons that in reality youngsters in our country, especially our girls.
On the second time the youth of the country , especially our girls tell my heart , luxury .
It is also reminded that today 75 springs come to our independence .
Make the path of five paths for the principle of every country , for its culture .
The beauty of the country , future remains better ahead with belief .
Many best wishes , thanks to all of you .
It is a feeling of feeling that when we are in touch with tension, it can be a self-life or a people's life, it will fill the enthusiasm of each other for years.
Jagannath Rath Yatra is being celebrated in many places of the country with a sacred sense.
This festival is now celebrated in some places of the world .
They have displayed deep experiences with Lord Jagannath .
Jagannath Bhagwan is the worshipper of the poor.
I extend my best wishes to all the people of the country on the occasion of the Rath Yatra Festival of Jagannath Bhagwan.
The unity in diversity is also one of the specialities of India.
About three and a half thousand Muslim brothers and sisters live in this small village.
In this context, it has been decided that all the villages will be able to construct mattress roads together.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana have also reached the gathering.
And then we will not change our habit.

But I see clearly that some attempts have been trying to learn music , some attempts are trying to learn new things with the help of Europe , some try to learn new language .
Some are learning cooking , some are learning dance , some are learning dance , some have also started writing poets .
Knowing about nature , trying to understand , understanding .
I want to hear you a phone call.
That is, I am talking to Diksha Katyal.
The habit of reading my reading has become completely .
Therefore I decided to read again in these holidays .
When I started reading about the fighting of freedom, I understood how much fighting has to be done to give freedom to India, how much sacrifices have to be given, how many freedom fighters have spent in the jails.
How much Kirtishan had been impressed by Bhagat Singh in small age .
Therefore, I would like you to give a message to the youth about this matter.

Beloved people of my country , June is one Monday in 5 months .
If you want to say in another thing then back to basics .
Promoting better plaint .
Who can tell this better than Mahatma Gandhi .
Mahatma Gandhi ji used to say many times, "One must care about a world one will not see".
That is , we should also think about the world , take precaution .
You must have seen that the power of nature is that when a glass of water comes very tired then how freshness comes on the mouth .
On coming very tired the room opening the windows , opening the doors , fresh air comes new chain .
Therefore the world 's attempts should also be made to drown 5 naturally .
The fruit of preserving environment is now available to us .
It has been said that the reason of cleanliness in us is psychological .
It is said that when Lord Buddha touched Lord Buddha , the birth of Lord Buddha , his wisdom , his great expanse was done under one tree .
Reading , reading , reading , city residents , villagers , tribals , everybody 's natural worship , natural love is a part of their social life .
But we need to link this thing with modern definitions , modern thoughts .
In the midst of this I am giving pockets from the states .
That is , on the start of rains in almost all the states , the program of plants starts .
Plants are planted in crores .
Yoga exercise is not only .
Keeping in mind the day of two days Christian Yoga Festival I came to the north of all the governments of the world .
I have declared some competitions related to yoga in the year of Christianity .
Gradually the tasks move ahead in that direction .
It is very interesting advice .
Get these photographs done by putting yogasanas together with mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , sons , daughters , daughters , daughters , daughters .
Today, today, this beautiful combination will give a new measure to Yoga and I express my gratitude to those who have given this advice.

While returning I saw that some people are doing something very microbes .
If you hear this phone call then you will understand it .
Modi guru, I am often seen in TV and social media that people are taking special care of cleanliness everywhere you have visited.
On the invitation of the people of Mumbai, Surat, people are accepting the cleanliness of the people as a mass movement.
The propaganda of sanctuary that you started from Kashi Ghat has turned into a garden with your inspiration .
Wherever I go, the government instruments will perform cleanliness programmes, but in the midst of this, cleanliness has also become a festival.
Five days before I go, seven days ago, ten days ago, a very big cleanliness program will be organized.
The country knows how much carefully these things , you can imagine how much pleasure you can imagine .
I am also telling everyone that encourages this cleanliness program.
Somebody gave me advice .
Actually advice is very thirsty .
I am not able to do it .
Modi Garru , when you decide your tourism then what kind of tourism you want , they want to call me ' Babu ' , how much of your cleanliness level .
The solution is good but I should think .
But it is very good to make such a garden that it is more good to clean the garbage of such tonnes than giving something a gift.
By doing this many people stay safe from the victim of diseases .
With the help of the State Governments, the Government of India has decided to launch an important programme on the construction of vandalism with the help of the presidents of the cities.
On June 5th day of the World Environment Festival , about 4 thousand cities of the country are available to adopt liquid forms of liquid .
Two types of garbages are available . one green colored dubb , other blue colored diabetes .
All these works well in the fields . Keep in mind that the fields are green , then what is the symbol of green leafy vegetables .
The other type of garbage comes in the dry area of dust , dust , wood , iron , glass , plastic , polythene , broken dumb , rubber , metal etc . which has to be recycled by putting in instruments .
In the last few days, you must have heard that Versova beach has become a clean and beautiful Versova beach in Mumbai.
About eighty-nine weeks later, the residents of the city were troubled and changed the formats of this Versova beach and after the removal of a few thousand tonnes of garbage from that place, the Versova beach became clear and beautiful.
Its full responsibility has been taken by Versova Residents Volunteer -LRB- VRV -RRB- .

Three-three years ago, you have given me the responsibility of the Pradhan Mantri Surakoda.
Several surveys , opinions have been done .
All these procedures I accept healthy information .
In every test all these three times have been tested .
Every part of the society has poisoned it .
There is an excellent procedure in delivery .
I am also telling thanks to all those who have given special food baked .
On coming to the light of Lotutu , Lopalu one gets the opportunity to recover them .

The constructional examination gives strength to the democracy .
This potency is necessary for an excellent country, a conscious country.
This is the same thing that many families were written to me .
One person , a common person has increased this incident with my enthusiasm .
I am grateful to the President of Ganu, the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, Shri Ram Nath Kovind and Shri Ram Nath Kovind.
In a way, a new vision has been given to the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Some of our friends have also discussed me sometimes while working on this book in Mann Ki Baat.
I am debted to Akbar .
My dear countrymen, this time we keep on getting rains all around the country.
Come , let us all move ahead while enjoying nature in this weather .
My generation is many thanksgivings , blessings to all of you .
Beloved people of my country , Namaskar .
Probably people have become the habit of these problems .
The experience of children , youths , elders etc . are coming in my sight .
If someone coughs while traveling in the bus , then immediately someone comes and gives some advice while doing this .
Giving advice , information is only in our nature .
Many people try to give advice to reach me , they do something or the other in their life .
With some good handicrafts their intelligence , strength , capacity keep changing according to the situations .
Some people give advice to everyone by listening to their advice at the place of working , the rest of them by listening to them .
Not only this when I proposed anything then it is very happy to remember such things .
After that, in the NarendraModiApp, many people from all corners of the country in MyGov have made some creative efforts to see food not being wasted.
Some videos were also sent to me .
There are roti banks at some places .
May is the establishment day of Maharashtra , Gujarat state .
This contribution is many luxuries for the people of both these states .
The two states have made continuous efforts to cross several new development peaks and have given their support to the progress of the country.
The lives of the great men in both the states continue to stimulate us in every field of the society.
Remembering these great men , on the day of the resurrection of the state we should take the decision of fifty five , i . . 2022 , our country , all our society , all our cities , all our families .
To strengthen this culture plan should be made ahead with the help of all the people .
On the second time these two states have many luxuries .
The rapidity of summer staying in the month of May , June has to be felt in the month of April .
Therefore this time when I am consulting advice to talk in my mind , maximum advice has been given advice to take any precaution in this summer .
All these are also in public . Not only new , but it is also good to remember them at the right time .
It is said that in Balkani , Daba Pinna , water for birds .
In many families small children also I saw this work .
Once in their sight this work comes , if there is water in the bowl of birds ten times a day or not .
It gives us another sports but in reality it is a unique experience to raise the feelings in the mind .
Although all the things related to animals and birds in our country are very well known about natural life but it is important to give strength to such efforts .
When I am the main minister of Gujarat then Dadudi Bohra society of the society of the society of the society has come hundred years .
They lived hundred and three .
For the festivals of their hundred birthday Bohra society has played a very big garden to preserve the pigeons by their Buhrani Foundation .
I got the opportunity to start it .
Approximately fifty thousand Bird Feeders have been sent to the entire world .
This thing has also been approved in Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we become so unconscious that they used to name , rulers , vegetables , Post Man , in these summers somebody drink good water in the gate .
Youth friends , you also want to tell some things .
Sometimes I am confused that many people in our youth like to spend their lives in the Compart John.
Mothers are also playing their role in a protective environment .
There are also different people but most of them are seen in the conferred zones .
Now the tests have been done , they have to put the methods to enjoy the tests .
The summer season remains cosmetic only after summers .
I want to tell you how your summer shelves like a friend .
Some people do usefully , tell me that I am believed .
If you want to listen to this , do not see , do not think , go to unknown places .
Try new places , new experiences , new experiences .
I want to know why your interest in these summer holidays is trying to know them .
Take new use .
The use should be positive and your conferred zone should bring you out.
We are of the comfortable families of the middle class .
What is the matter of those travellers , what do they get down at the station .
Go to the bus terminus with your football , Wali Bal or other games in the evening .
Play yourself with those poor children , then see that you will get the pleasure of never enjoying life in that game .
If the child spending such life in the society gets the opportunity of playing with you then what change comes in his life .
If you also go once then I can say with belief that you want to go again .
This experience teaches you a lot .
To reduce technology , to reduce the borders , but its side effects have changed that even six people living in one room are also beautiful to imagine the distance between them .
Away from technology can you try to spend time with you
The country filled with many varieties is found to learn something near us only if we pay attention to the cosmetics .
If you do not come to swimming , learn swimming , do not come to the best boat , try to put something on the dog .
If we feel small tasks then sometimes we can learn something or the other .
You can learn to walk on car but at some time it feels like walking autorickshaw .
You might have been trying to pull the cycle but have you ever tried to walk the Trichakra car while carrying people
You see this new efforts , not only give you happiness , but also bring out your life tied in it .
Keep showing instruments to your friends .
I am told by my experience , how much learning the world , how much we can not even imagine to know .
See new places , new cities , new cities , new villages , new places .
But wherever you are going before going , seeing a gynaecology , seeing a gynaecology , asking people , seeing those places is different .
Therefore how much opportunity you get to learn .
Friends, this time the government of India has also given you a good opportunity.
New generations they get rid of the river nearby .
They do not need the river .
They started believing the digital concentration.
Do you also believe it , but do you ever think you can get through this plan
The Government of India has planned a plan .
Are you going to load BIM App down
Send it to another .
If you are done with twenty people in the day then you will get two hundred rupees in the evening .
This plan is implemented till 14th October .
Thus, you will have a collaboration in creating a digital India.
New India becomes a comparison to you .
And the holidays , and the evening .
Refer - Organize.
Normally there is a scorching environment of VIP culture in our country .
Now even if the red light has gone on vehicles , then the red light entered the brain can not be said fast .
I am talking to Shiv Chaube from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, the Prime Minister of Namaskar.
I want to talk about the government's decision red beacon light bun.
It seemed very pride to me .
Now my time was also enjoyed as much as possible .
I don't want to interfere in the traffic jam.
For this decision I would like to tell you thanks to my heart .
Red light is a part of the arrangement by the government .
The importance of IPIs in place of VIPs in the country is the New India emotion.
If I say IPI in place of VIPs, my feelings are clear-every person is important.
Every person has the importance , every person has importance .
If we accept the importance of 125 crore people of the country , if we accept the importance of 125 crore people of the country , then how big power to realize the great dreams .
Do this work together .
Beloved my countrymen , we will always remember our history , our culture , our traditional times .
Therefore we get strength , inspiration .
This year we celebrate a thousand Jayant of Swami Ramayana dynasty with all our 125 crore country .
Because of some reason we are not so much judged , how small is thinking that more than one century we are thinking .
Think of cosmetic.
It is also difficult to come out by bringing out social signals .
How was that before thousands
Ramayana priests had done very big fight against the evil , descriptions , intensity , species etc . during their time many people know that only .
They have imagined the society by their own self-confidence , they all imagine .
Before thousands of people he got permission to enter the house , they got permission to enter the house .
In order to end the evil of the society of that time in every age it is our best fortune to keep on coming from our society .
Today we celebrate a thousand Jayanti of Ramayanacharya , in the attempts to encourage social unity from him we will refresh the strength of immortality .
The Government of India Government has released a Tapala stone in the memory of Swami Ramjacharya .
I am giving support to Swami Ramjacharyas , giving support to Adarpur .
Beloved my country ' s people , tomorrow there is another speciality of Tarikhan .
It is celebrated in many places in the world as the Day of Shramik.
It is natural to remember Babasaheb Ambedakar ji when it comes to pass on the day of Shramik , when there is a discussion about Shramiks .
If I say about Babasaheb Ambedkar, Swami Ramajacharya, then the monk of the twelfth century of Karnataka, the society of the society, Jagadguru Basaveshwar also reminds me.
In the twelfth century he had done deep thoughts on the matter of labor and labor .
In Kannada Bashan he said , Cave Kailash .
It means that you can get the house of Shiva from your industry.
That is , heaven gets heaven only by doing work .
If you want to say in other words , Sharma Shiva .
If I am changing about the labors then it is natural to remember the Tangdi Garden .
Beloved people of my country , in some days we celebrate Buddhapurni .
All the followers of Lord Buddha are celebrated worldwide .
On the day of Buddha Purnima, I am fortunate to celebrate Vesak Day by the United Nations.
This year it takes place in Sri Lanka.
On this sacred day I get the opportunity to pay tribute to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka .
The opportunity to remind their memories is available .
Dear countrymen, we have always tried to move ahead with Sabka Saath-SabkaVikas mantra.
Sabka Saath-SabkaVikas is not only in India but also in the world.
Especially our neighbouring countries also come .
Our neighbouring countries should be helpful , development should be done for them .
Many uses are done .
The South Asia museum of India has been used on May 5.
This museum is the capacity of this museum , how beneficial to fulfil the economic , developmental primary primaryities of South Asia .
This museum helps in identifying natural forest reservoirs , tele-medicine , electronic science , high concentration of technology , attempts to contact between people .
My dear countrymen, the sun is very strong and save yourself and save yourself.
Most of the family members of the country are fixed in their children 's tests .
In their families after getting tests there is a situation of cosmetic stress in the families of cosmetics , tests .
At such a time, I can tell one another, listen to what I have spoken to the students in Mann Ki Baat.
In a historical war happening against unrighteousness Bangladesh had successfully achieved unparalleled victory in Bangladesh .
On such a special day independent Bangladesh brother Paulu , brothers and sisters want to move ahead in the development of Bangladesh .
India will continue to give full support to the development of the country by protecting the peaceful destinies of this region by mixing it with you as a good friendly country to Bangladesh.
The memories of our Ravindranath Tagore are the pride of giving the heritage of our two countries .
Because Bangladesh is the construction of our Guru Ravindranath Tagore .
One interesting thing about Rabindranath Tagore is that in 1913, he was the first person to receive the Nobel Prize, and English also gave him the title Knighthood.
In 1919 Rabindranath Tagore was also among the opposite glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious gloves .
This incident shows strong effect on the mind of one twelve children .
In the childhood of playing singinginging this Jalianwala Bagh has given an inspiration to the life of that child .
In 1919 if twelveth century then all of us were beloved , inspired , Amarvir Bhagat Singh .
These three days Christian March on 23th March he had climbed the English of Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru , English .
This incident Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru without the fear of death of three , we all know that the happiness of service of India is left .
We cannot even put the legends of life of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru in letters.
Yavat British empire was afraid of all three .
After training they were in jail , how was the British worried with them .
Therefore in the month of March the training of 24th honey has to be implemented , on March 23th March the training was done .
Besides this their dead bodies were stolen by bringing them to the place of Punjab .
When I went to that place many years old then there was a kind of campaign in my body .
Whenever you get the opportunity, I suggest to the youth of the country visiting Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Maternals and Batkeshwar tombs.
At that time call for freedom , its rapidity , its quantity is increasing .
On the one hand, these people like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru have inspired youths to become unforgettable.
Right before this on the 10th day of April 1917 AD Mahatma Gandhi had discovered Mahatma Gandhi Champaran .
This is the truth of Champaran centuries .
In the freedom fight of India Gandhi Waddan , Gandhiji 's behavior style was known only during the killing of the first time .
Specially this incident is a milestone in the entire journey for freedom fighting for freedom fighting .
During this time the contribution of Champaran Satyagraha , Khada Satyagraha , Mill Carmittee of Ahmedabad , in which Mahatma Gandhi 's thoughts , behavior style , behavior style are seen strong .
Only two functions of a man who returned to India in 1915.
Gandhijis marvellous powers have been shown by the peoples collective skills, the power to know the nerves of the Indian society, through his ways, to unite the innocent people of the British empire, to fight, to inspire, to fight and to fight.
If you know about Gandhiji during the church done a hundred years ago , then how much a person starting ordinary life has to know how much acquaintance of death .
How to start normal life , how much industry , Gandhiji had done it from him .
As Rajendra Babu ji , Acharya Kripalani ji we sent Gandhiji to the village at the same time .
How to teach it the color of freedom fighting in the working of people .
There is a unique balance in Gandhi 's work style .
In order to bring changes hundreds of old people , attempts , this is the foundation of new India , India .
There's a desire, a concept, a enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, if we come out of our lives and see the work done in the society with cosmetics, see what happens in the society, if we try to understand, then the goal of the goal of the people is not only for their own responsibility, but for the news of the society, for the mischief, for the poor, for the poor, for the poor, for the poor.
It is also like a penance , meditation , like a dung service they are doing their work .
There are many people who go to the hospital everyday .
There are many people running along with blood donation .
Those who give food habits to food are some .
Once it is seen in a collective , accident form it is known with such a big shock .
All these are not celebrated with budget evening , government proposals , government money .
But when you look at the country, the dream of the people of hundreds of crores of people of the country seems to be fulfilling the dream of a New India before our eyes.
It is said that everybody should adopt the responsibility of the responsibility .
Then it starts one of the same New India .
We remember Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
We ignore the truth of Champaran .
Will we also participate in the journey of Swaraj to Suryaj by consolidating our lives
In the last few months there has been a month of such a weather in our country that very big people have participated in digital , digital - Dhan park .
After the rubbing of mouth many kinds of digital methods can be seen .
Only two and a half months after the launch of Bhima Yap, about one and a half crore people have loaded this Yap.
We have to move ahead to fight against the people of my country , black money , which are celebrating water .
Can the people of hundreds of old countries imagine that in this year two and a half thousand crore digital Ladwa Devis can be celebrated
We proclaimed in the budget.
This work done for hundreds of old people of the country is not done for one year .
You can complete in six months .
We can do all these in daily life .
Because of this you can not imagine how much you can serve the country . black money , which can become a soldier in fighting against water .
In the last few days many programs have been done for giving all these to people , to make people aware .
In Jawad country such a hundred programs have been conceptualized .
80-85 programs have been done .
The gifts made for businessmen were fifty thousand people .
Everybody has been determined to walk ahead .
Firstly on 14 April 14 Dr . Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti this Digital fair ends .
A big event has been done on the completion of hundred days .
The biggest drama is built in it .
I believe that the time of Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti remains with us , as much as Bhima Yap is being published .
Not reducing the river , not reducing behavior with mouths our part has been polluted .
My dear countrymen, I am happy to have many kinds of advice when I asked for advice every time to speak in mind.
But in the matter of cleanliness pills keep listening every time .
The girl who reads the eleventh graduate sent a message from Deh Ra Doon and my best wishes to you, the dignitaries, the dignitaries and the dignitaries.
First of all you are many luxuries to spend in this so many numbers .
I want to talk to you in my mind .
I want to tell people how important cleanliness .
I travel everyday on a river polluted by putting a lot of garbage .
Our house comes on the Rispana bridge of that river .
I recognize it very well .
I want to anger in the hearts of hundreds of old people .
Once anger starts , if we start feeling satisfaction , then we use something to do something or the other .
The best , active partner , whose importance is so much .
But cleanliness is ever more than a garden , one habit .
I believe that this feeling awakened in the youths , in children , students , in the youths of the country itself is a good result .
We know that we have eaten food at home , we also take food in our bowl more than necessary in social food .

I want to tell the people of the country that they are not able to get rid of depression.
On making a psychological environment one starts getting rid of .
First mantra is that instead of suppression there is need of expression .
Tell your friends , parents , parents , meditations with meditations .
Sometimes the children living in the house get so distressed because of loneliness .

On seeing new technology , when we get new victory of science then we enjoy .
Gynaecology played a very important role in the development of human life Taluku .
Special scientific , efficient people do not let their gynaecology be like a gynaecology .
The same gynaecology becomes the reason of new research .
Their questions are not able to sleep .
If we discover the journey of human life Talluku thousands of years , then we can say that this human life is not so much for the development of Talluku .
It is impossible .

In the last few days designation is very strong .
Gradually people are moving ahead towards digital concentration .
Digital Ladwa Devi is also developing very fast in India .
Especially young people are adopted to celebrate their digital phones from their mobile phones .
I am considering this as a clear signal .

Through these two methods, an attempt has been made to transform the rivers into a mass movement in India.
In this project more than hundred Khatadas have been given gift according to each other 's lakh rupees .

This year about two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food has been produced in the country .
The name of our rails is emotional record this time 8  more emotional .
This is so successful that it is not known .
I am specially impressing the rails of the country .
Because they have cooked various kinds of pulses apart from traditional fruits , because the poor give the most proteins with pulses .
Keeping in mind the need of the poor people in the country near about two hundred and ninety lakh hectares of land I enjoyed various kinds of pulses .
This is not only the production of various kinds of pulses but also the great service done for the poor people of my country .
My prayer , all my hearing , how my country ' s rails were troubled by lifting up their eyes , and made the record of pulses , therefore my brother ' s brothers and sisters are specially displayed .
Dear countrymen, some or the other work is being done by the government in our country, through the society, through institutions and by everybody.
In a way everybody seems to be behaving very well related to cleanliness in some form .
The government is also trying continuously .
Six toilet pits were emptyed , they were healed .
Town Pitt toilets were opened , then the rulers had themselves seen the methods of using the toilets again .
How we do other cleanlinesss , these toilets can also be cleaned .
Because when a ruler of AIDS cleanses the toilets themselves then it is natural to attract the eyes of the people of the country .
It has also been proved .
Six members are filled with a Standard Town Pitt Toilet.
After that the garbage can be easily turned into another bit.
In six to twelve months the garbage reached inside the toilet umbrella gets completely burnt.
In any way the government takes this before , others also use such beforehand .
Cleanliness Festivals are being held continuously in different parts of the government as well.
On the first part of the month of March, along with the Ministry of Women and Child Development, the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), will also be paying homage to the Swachhta Abhiyan.
We welcomed the exhibition of our Divang sportspersons in Rio Paralipex.

The Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao programme is progressing at a rapid pace.
This is not only a government program .
A social system has become a public education programme.

This problem has imagined people from all corners of the country and has brought about changes in the thinking of people about the behaviors of the people.

You are also very active .
How do I know from you.
What happens , in villages , poor people come to Nadaka .
For your help I am observed to you .
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Today our country is enjoying rains on one side .
On the other hand some festival , fair Deepavali is organised in the corners of Hindustan .
Perhaps our ancestors , in any situation the weather , economic cycle , social life system has been imparted .
Till now we celebrated many festivals .
The birth of Shri Krishna Festival has been done throughout the Hindustan .
There is such personality , even after spending thousands of years every festival brings a new moment , brings new energy , somebody can imagine new energy .
Today I am talking to you about two important monasteries .
One is the Mohan of Sudarshan Chandradhar , one is the Mohan of Charkhadhar .
Sudarshan Chakradhara Mohan left the shore of Yamuna , went to the sea shore of Gujarat , established in Dwarka city , the Mohammad born on the sea shore came to Yamna , and spent the last clock of life in Delhi .
Sudarshan Chakradhara Mohan had completely used his intelligence , his ability to stop the war , to stop the war , to stop the war , to stop his intelligence , his science , his science .
At the same time, India is in the forefront of another big festival.
This church is done not only in India but also in the whole world .
I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He had served the rails being recognized in the Champaran .
In order to remove many deformities related to blood pitta disease they themselves have served the patients of blood pitta disease .
Through service his life has remained an example .
We can understand this thing directly from the life of Bapuji .
Mahatma Gandhi was the main source of person , society , humans , humans .
Finx Farm of African , Tolstoy Farm , Sabarmati Ashram , Wardha , all places , in a special way the society of society , Committee Mobilization were their support .
We need to bring all these feelings of society , society , society Cervical Cervical Cervical Mobilization in our behavior life .
If you want to say the truth then this is the true devotion of Mahatma Gandhi .
We are associated with people in the society , associated with all the classes , associated with all ages , rural city is a man or a society associated with everyone , I think that I can do something for my sake .
What would be good for my generation .
Community is our strength .
In the programs done in this 150 years of age the society , service is also not available .
Our women are Mandali Ladies club .
In the modern era, we will do the work of Ladies Club, but together with the meeting of Ladies Club, we will all meet some service programme.
I can do a lot.
By collecting books there are 130 crore Indians , 130 crore Indians who can start 130 crore .
There is no limit in the mind - if good appreciation, good luck, good luck and good luck can be served with complete impression.
It is also a pleasant pleasure - if it is enough for you to feel a unique pleasure.
My dear countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
A very important turning point of salt satyagraha in freedom struggle.
I participated in the inaugural function of a state-of-the-art museum that has been awarded to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
Through this others also write three-four words while expressing your feelings along with those photographs .
During the time of coming many programs , competitions , exhibitions have been done .
But in this context one interesting thing I want to participate with you .
Venice Biennale is a famous art exhibition where artists from all over the world meet.
This time, an interesting exhibition has been organised in the Indian building of Venice Biennale with Gandhi memories.
In this Haripura Panels are specially interesting .
In Haripura of Gujarat the confluence of Kangras is celebrated , in which the history of Subhas Chandrabos is remembered .
This art panel has a beautiful paste.
Prior to the Haripura meeting of Kangras, in 1937-38, Principal Nandlal Bose was invited by Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan art building.
Gandhiji appreciated the exhibition of his artwork to showcase his lifestyle in India through art.
The art gallery of our state is this Nandal Bose .
There is a special identity of the state .
With the art gallery of this Boss the art gallery has done its own .
After touring the villages nearby Haripura , finally a art canvas has been prepared by showing the life of rural India .
This precious art philosophy was discussed in Venice.
With the luck of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi Ji, I would like to make a choice from India.
Do something for the country , society , for others .
At the same time, Bapu's right, true archaeological activity will be done.
This time it starts from 11 September .
During this time we came out of our houses and dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi with hard work.
But the art gallery, but the art gallery, but the cleanliness park should be constructed at all public places.
This time pay more attention to plastic .
On August 15, how hundreds of crores of people from the Red Fort have worked towards encouraging and encouraging cleanliness.
However, we all have to stop the simultaneous use plastic.
In this matter all the classes of the society are excited .
With this, money remains sustained and it plays an important role in environmental protection.
This time, in the context of celebrating 150th birth anniversary of Babaji, Bahraang was dedicated to the people of India who had been released from excretion and laid the foundation stone of plastic opposite project.
I am giving a gift to all the classes of the society , every village , every city residents .
This year Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated to free India from plastic garbage .
All Municipality , corporation , district administration , village Panchayat government , private institutions , all the institutions , everybody has heard that plastic garbage should be done properly .
I urge all the corporate sectors to explore how to make arrangements for disposal if this plastic was served at one place.
It can be recycled .
It can be fueled .
Today I want to tell a very important thing with a culture .
Food is very important in our culture .
As much as we have also included food in science .
Nutrition is becoming a mass movement in modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting with malnutrition in new interesting methods .
Once a thing came in my eyes .
There was a big garden of cereals filled with peanuts in Nasik.
In which in the days of fruits anganwari services of anganwari services are served one child from the people .
These grains are made to prepare hot food for women , children .
In this the person donating donation becomes a member of the society .
This culture is celebrated while feeding food for the first time .
Drink food is not honourable .
In Gujarat, in 2010, a thought has been made that why shouldn't it be necessary to give complimentary food to the children.
It is very important , it can be played everybody .
People in many states eat food .
There is a unique collection of service , joy , joy .
Friends , by many such small methods our country can be brought into effect by fighting with malnutrition .
Today information about right information , poor people , rich people are also becoming victim of malnutrition .
The month of September is celebrated in the form of Nutrition Abhiyan.
This time, when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, it was certain that a lot of questions would come about this thing.
In the last few weeks, wherever I went to meet my people, there was a proposal about Man Ws Wild.
Since then I did not imagine that the opportunity to refresh the hearts of the world come in my life .
But what happened
Last week I went to Bhutan .
As the Prime Minister, whenever I come to visit, I am imagining one thing - whenever there is a discussion with anyone in the world about Yoga for five to ten minutes.
Those who do not discuss Yoga with me in the world on a bigger ground, I am telling you about this thing.
Discovery Channnel has planned to publish this program in 165 countries in their language .
People want to know the churches taken in the direction of climate , clean environment in our country .
But one more interesting thing is that some people ask me one thing while shouting, Modi ji, tell me that you are talking in Hindi, not Hindi for Bear Grills.
After this the cost of editing .
Then what happened to shoot again .
It is questioned very carefully .
See , there is no secret in it .
All right, I'll tell this mystery now.
Actually this is not mystery .
In fact, technology was fully used in the interaction with Bear Grylls.
Anything I said that it was synonymous with the absurdity of English, because Bear Grylls kept a small card laser in the ears.
Therefore, if I speak in Hindi, it has become easier for him to listen to English, it is the miracle of technology.
After this Show many people are seen discussing about Jim Corbett National Park .
You must also go to places where nature , wildlife , staying .
What is nature
You stay watching .
Your internal is also big .
On August 15, I had invited you from the Red Fort and at least 15 places in the next three years, 15 places in India are completely tourist destinations.
You go, look, study, take the family, spend some time there.
Your thought is enlarged .
My beloved countrymen , the thoughts about environmental protection , devotion i . . conservation are seen naturally in India .
In the last month I got the luck of releasing the population of tiger in the country .
You know how many tigers are there in India .
The number of tigers in India is 2967 .
It was difficult to stay half in this number below the knees .
In 2010, a tiger meeting was held in St. Peter's Burg, Russia.
In which information about reducing the number of tigers has been taken , one option .
The number of tigers in the world of 2022 is double .
But this is now a New India. We will fulfil the goals quickly.
We doubled the number of tigers here in 2019 .
Not only the number of tigers in India but also the number of wilderness , community reserves has increased .
While leaving the tigers I also recognized the Gir lions of Gujarat .
When I responsibility there the residence of lions in the jungles of Gir .
Their number was decreased .
We took several churches in Gir.
In 2007 the decision of making women parks there was taken .
We have enhanced the infrastructure to enhance tourists.
When talking about the natural , wild animals then the preservation of preservation is done .
But along with protection think about taking this church towards Karna .
Therefore we should not only save forests , trees , wildlife , but also give appropriate environment to increase properly .
My dear countrymen, how can we forget Swami Vivekananda's historical commemoration on September 11, 1893
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 29 August, we celebrate the National Sports Festival.
In this context, we are launching the Fit India Movement across the country.
Keep yourself fit and make the country fit .
All their descriptions are now told .
Wait 29 August .
Not only this , 02 October completely plastic cosmetic cosmetic .
To get rid of plastic keep us all home , household , all places with mind .
I know that in social media about this thing .
Come , let us move ahead with a new economy , new culture , new energy .
I'm waiting for your words, for your information.
Come, let us all come forward to fulfill the dreams of the freedom fighters and to fulfill Gandhi's dreams.
Mann Ki Baat - talk in the mind .
O my beloved people of the country , Namaskar .
On 26 January 26th January we celebrated the whole country with enthusiasm .
The State of India, the people of the country, the rulers of the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the country, all of whom are the festivals of our countrys culture, which reflects the responsibilities of the democracy of the previous generations.
But now the responsibility of people in our country , how deep , how deep has to be discussed that it is not so much .
To morrow 30 January is the pilgrimage of our worshipping Bapuji .
We pay tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country by singing peace for two minutes in the morning on 30th January.
This is a natural way of society , country .
Even for two minutes there is a reflection of equality , culture , Amarvirs .
There is a natural ornament of army , security forces in our country .
I am impressing all the family members of those who were honored with various books in the morning of this Ganesha Festival .
In these books there are many types of Kirti Chakra , Shaurya Chakra , Param Vishisht Seva Patak , Vishisht Seva Patak etc .
If we understand their virtue , adventurous activities properly then we also get surprising inspiration from pride .
On 26th January, when we were on one side with glorious , enthusiasm, our army personnel in Kashmir were engaged in the protection of the country.
These virgins are giving support to all the people of Adarpur .
My young friends , all of you know well , I always keep talking in my mind .
All the months of January , February , March , April are the time of tests in every family .
In the house there are tests for each other , in the house there is a test on everyone .
This is the right time to talk with friends , their students , their teachers , because I went to somewhere , whose tests were seen big problem .
The family , educational and students are seen mixing with each other and a very strange psychological environment is seen at every house.
Seeing them I want to divide the thought that came in my mind .
The message of telephone has come from creation .
Listen , what creation says , sir , what I want to tell you , during the tests , in our house , neighbouring houses , a terrible environment in our society .
Because of this reason students become unsuccessful .
Those who are enjoying are benefitted .
Therefore my goal is like a festival .
During the festival , festival the best truth situated in us comes out .
Our society is also expressed during the festival .
Whatever is the best .
Festival removes the environment test .
Therefore I told all the parents that you change all these three-four months in an exciting environment .
The fact is that these three-four months are tested from Kanyakumari to Kashmir , Kamrup Varu from Kutch , from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh .
That's why I call you "smile mor, score mor".
If you are angry then all the doors are closed , the matter does not go inside , it does not come out .
Nobody has told anything .
It was inside that Venkatet had come to know why Mirra had come out of tension .
Therefore , there is an important medicine to increase memory which is relax .
Through my own experience, I say that if we are stressed then we forget our things, but when relaxed, how much work is reminded of us.
Therefore, a Happy mind is the second for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we are not able to see properly .
It is not a life test .
How you live , how you want to live , how to live everything is not tested .
Besides the tests given by mouth books in classroom, you have to face many more tests in your life, therefore observe that you are related to the glimpse of life.
J.
The important example of Abdul Kalan is in front of all of us .
He had reached the airways .
They're not found.
Some tasty joy has sent a question to me . In this time I see the biggest education that electronic science has become centres .
Therefore in today 's direction of electronic science , I want to know your thoughts about its future .
There is a question in the question of ' Ruchaguru ' but also wanted to know my opinion .
You say , if a family doctor stays for you to show all your family .
You see his experience , knowledge , how much profit he is .
He also called RuchaGaru Pratisparth.
This is a big psychological war.
Many times the speciality of the life of the players is that they competition with themselves .
It is a unique life journey to move ahead by shipping its record every time .
Because he desired the path according to every place .
Friends, can you hide the time of reading comfortably two hours before you go to the test in every range of life
Those who are not able to get up at the time decided to get up before this . Now they are able to get up at the fixed time .
Before this the cost of test is not sleeping , now it is falling .
The same energy is produced inside itself .
If you want to say comfortably, you can see three important things that are the first ones you know more than those who are ahead.
And what came he , and said , My mother did not read much .
But sitting with me asked me to lift me up .
Adopt that .
Use it as much as you have, how much time you are in your work.
If you learn to adopt once , the main problems are eliminated from there .
In the roots of the problem there is a belief of conservation , studies .
Many things are in the hospital with heart attack .
Then the first Speaker of the Lok Sabha of India Ganesh Dada Mavalankar , his son , once A . . . Purushottam Mavalankar , came to visit the hospital .
If you want to say , when a person with unhealthy disease meets him then we fear him with the name of disease .
I told the conservation that sometimes we also walk with children .
During the days of test you will feel that the situation of laughing is simple .
Seeing this , the weather changes .
I got a picture call.
And he spake not his name .
And it shall come to pass , when he heareth , that why can not he not call his name
Therefore I started trying a lot .
I tried to find its methods so that my time became very old .
As long as I tried to see the Burj , how much time I was ready to read it properly , they were able to get the markets .
Seeing how you see that it swimms you towards the way to fail life .
If you are taken in tests then your life will be destroyed .
If you are not captured then I will do this throughout my life, not only in your mind, but also in your hearts.
When you have to say to your children then you can not speak properly in their eyes .
If you are also turning your roads into a nest then I have seen that how many people use the new methods to see how much they spend for seeing their entire creativity.
The same creativeness , at the same time it is not necessary to see at all .

The role of my mother in life is the same as meditation.
How many of us have seen teachers who love more than their students.

Today, as a player, I see Gopichand as an excellent teacher.
On the auspicious occasion of the meditation day, I salute the young ladies of Gopichand and their conscience towards their sports and their joys of the students.
And whenever the student is hidden, he is a good teacher.

But when we came to the memory of Abdul Kalanji 's name - science , technology , technology , technology , tuberculosis , this picture of India appears in front of our eyes .
You can not take technology at a level .
If this research i . . if there is no new alternative then how does the water standing without flowing spreads dirt by increasing pollution then also becomes India .
If we want to live with the help of old technology without research , imagination then we will become behind us in this world changing .
Therefore in the youth the government had done many programs of scientific science , technology , technology .
In our schools, wherever these ticketing labs are celebrated, not only will they pay thirteen lakh rupees for their construction, but also for their construction.
Otherwise if I am talking about Atal Incubation Centre then the government has also thought about it in the direction of giving the whole of ten crore rupees .
Devgarh is smitten with many other problems of India .
We get many problems from daily life .
These scholars want to encourage the Government of India by giving special books .
The true belief of Abdul Kalanji i . . research , innovation , technology , to stop our daily life problems , to stop our problems , to stop our problems , how much hard work is done in the development of India in 21th century .
It is believed that Abdul Kalanji is the true devotion of our devotion .
In order to give support to the problems related to the central governments of the central governments the shoulders are troubled without strength .
As far as we are running , we feel that we are not able to think about us once .
The medicines that are lost are not working for those patients , fighting with disease , preparing new medicines , scientific researches , ignoring those diseases , ignoring new problems .
Therefore it is very important to be cautious about the disease .
The bacteria that spread tuberculosis , malaria disease bring changes in our body so much that there is no effect of medicines .
In medical terms it is called antibiotic resistance .
Therefore how to use antibiotics , it is also important to follow those rules .
This antibiotic resistance has been built by our government .

Doctors coming forward after listening to me are thousands of doctors .
But our India is very large .
Through this technique lacs of doctors should be given .
There is a discussion about this in the country and abroad .
In India for ages this thing has been pressing .
In the battlefield of Kurukshetra also Lord Krishna is proposed about trees .
Mahabharata has been described about this in the festival of Mahabharata .
It is said in the festival of Mahabharata that if someone plants a tree then it becomes his childhood .

Many people use such uses .
I remember that when I was the chief minister of Gujarat, there used to be a large number of travellers in the month of Bhadrapada in the Ambaji Temple.
It is said that by giving a vegetation to those coming to visit the temples you will see that if you take it carefully and increase it in your house then you will continue to see the blessings of the mothers and sisters.
Although lakhs of tourists coming to the footpaths have sent this year lakhs of plants .
Temples can also start the tradition of giving plants instead of Prasad in the rainy season .
This day we have to descend from abroad to build houses in our country , to make houses , crores of rupees .
If we plant trees on our trees then we can sell the household , furniture with the permission of the government after 15-20 years.
The Central Government has also approved the Companies Act and under this Act more than 40 thousand crore Rupees of funds have been provided to the State Governments for plantation.
I know that on the eve of the Maharashtra Government two crore oldest plants on the eve of July , three crore plants and three crore plants have been planted .
In the desert area of Rajasthan, how heavy wealth festivals have been started in that state and lakhs of old plants have been planted.

In Andhra Pradesh, the forests have also been decided to increase the area of 2019.
This work has been done by the Central Government under the Green India Mission.
In Gujarat also there is a very exciting tradition for the Nama Mahotsav .

The most friendly of Nelson Mandela , Shri Ahmad Katharada , Shri Lalu Chiba , Shri George Bijos , Shrironi Castles , all these great personalities have been enjoyed in visiting this grandeur.
Our children want good future .
I had sent a message to the sculpture Vermaji .
It is believed that a woman deceived e-mail has not been able to bear this pain by losing 11 lakh rupees .
Because of being a woman I suffered about her family .

This is the right meaning of protection bondage .
However, I am the first Prime Minister born in independent India.
Just like Deepawali, we all need a festival. You should also do something good with patriotic fervor.
You can see these thoughts as much as you can hear from the Red Fort .
As the Prime Minister of this country, as the Chief Servant of this country, tell me the thoughts that I want to tell you from the Red Fort.
I got the opportunity to discover words in my mind once again .

I took care of everything that every state has said.
Generally, such churches will not exaggerate the number of diabetes that the central government has sanctioned as the state governments, how much money every state has spent.
In view of this, some states were surprised to know that some states have made excellent efforts towards water, environment, ill-fated animals, and to take care of the suffering people.
I have advised them to exercise righteousness in entering the best practices across the states.
Some states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, have fully utilised technology.
I want to reflect the extremely successful efforts made by these states in the future by righteousness Ayog to other states.
Peoples participation will be a strong foundation to address such issues.

In Rajasthan and Gujarat, efforts are being made to return them to the water gods in the oldest wells.
The Pradhan Mantri Jal-Swavalamban Yojana has been launched in Rajasthan.
Jharkhand is the wilderness of the region. Somewhere there are water bulls.
This is a matter related to the people, the poor, the diabetes, the cool, the farmers, the citizens and the villagers.
This time we can imagine how much water can be hidden when the Deepawali relations are celebrated and how much water can be stopped without growing.
Then we shouldn't be enjoying.
The water is so powerful that we feel so tired that we can swallow so much water on my face and become fresh.
Well, when we saw a big pond.
We will save that wealth by keeping ourselves in mind.
We will enhance water resources.
Increasing water .
We will bring back the boiled water .
I'm telling you about this.
Don't leave the coming time old.
In order to save the water of these four months, we will turn into a Jal Bachao Abhiyan.
Not the mantras, but ours.
It is our responsibility. The media and the media have detailed the water resource in the past.
In order to save water, these mediums also wish to take part in the guidance of the people, instruments and instruments that can fulfil ourselves from water crisis.
I also welcome the media.
Change our old habits a little.

How's Bhojan
When the sportsperson knows that 125 crore people are in their own hands, the enthusiasm will be doubled.
If we don't have the desired results, life will not stop.
Live with self-confidence, move forward with self-confidence.
But a new kind of problem came to me and I never thought of it.
My vow.
When an e-mail came in the site, my vision went there.
He said that the country's Gaurav Patel is in front of me.
It looks like a burden on me and he sent it.
Earlier, you used to say that more development could be achieved.
I would like you all to confess when your children have brought the results to the house, pleasure and goodwill.
Increase the water to achieve further development. Otherwise, the water has brought a hundred to one hundred.
And the day will come when something else is done.
The people around me don't recognize our situation.
Those punks can't be remembered properly.
But what the poet said - I have painted my pain on the egg that puts the idols of life.
When the picture was laid in view, they suggested that it was shiny, blue and red, and that the songs were better than brick.
We cannot understand the pains that can be seen in that picture, but most of the people who have to say that they are glittering.
But if you are not happy to see the results, you can never create new constructions.
Sadan ji is happy to achieve more.
It continues to face in life.

Now summer.
Everyone prepares plans for summer holidays.
It is also because of the time of mango and we want to taste these fruits.
It seems as if we take some time in the afternoon .
But this year sunshine has destroyed all entertainments .
How natural is the species of species about heat .
Since then , in the last two years , due to the emergence of ill effects , normally there has been adverse effect on the places of water standing .
Sometimes, due to Kabja, many other times, due to sand waste, water flows in the reservoirs and other reservoirs were blocked.
As a result , reservoirs can keep water less than their capacity .
To solve the problem of faeces , to solve the problem of faeces , governments try to give relief from water .

Those who feel the deficiency of water can know the deficiency of water .

Anyone can see the villages that are eager to accumulate water.
Agricultural Products in Hive Rebazar have changed the rice and solved the problem.
That is, they decided to finish the transactions like peas and peas.
It is very easy to listen but it is not so easy.
How big is this decision

But see the scientific scientific scientific scientific scientists .
He said that the Prisons have to undergo water to bolster the Pension, so that they don't put the Pension on the lines.

I can tell you about a small town like Hiv Rebazar, but many such villages are still there.
I express my heartfelt congratulations to the people of such villages for their good work.
Someone told me that there is a village of Goa in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.
About 27 PAN ponds were constructed.
Approximately 20 percent of their commercial production has increased.
When the level of water rises, how many changes can be brought in the water level.
Clean drinking water is also a cause for GDP growth.
But how many people around us are making efforts to meet untouchability, how are you delaying new methods for recompense
Why shouldn't we take soil into the pond and put it in the field
The field also enhances the capacity to accumulate water for the field.
Sometimes in cement bags, sometimes stones, soil filled in red blankets can be blocked in the paths of water flowing.
Shri Kumar Krishna has written in MyGov and expressed a variety of tactics.
Without the participation of the people, we can never succeed in this scheme.
Therefore, everybody has become a messenger bringing about changes for cleanliness.
Let us talk about this and discuss it.
It also plays an important role in social institutions and cleaner institutions.
We take several initiatives to prevent pollution and industrial pollution.
Every day, a large number of garbage will be brought through the canals in the Ganges.
In order to clean up such a garbage, it has been done to remove the garbage from Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna and other places.
All the local institutions have expressed their desire to pursue this thing and pursue it somewhere.
Whenever this cleaning work is done, it is known that at places it has been discovered from 3 to 11 tons per day.
The pollution coming from paperwork is almost halted.
This makes it clear that we are moving ahead in a smooth direction and we are getting awakening.
Not only those who live on the banks of the Ganges.
This kind of work has been done in such villages of the country for fourteen days.
For the welfare of the village, for the development of the village, many things have been changed for the welfare of the people.
Whatever consciousness has come in villages
Therefore, if we strengthen the entire village, we will achieve the hopeful results.

If anything comes to your notice, go on your own and talk to the teachers.

Technical knowledge in education plays a very big role.
Someone else keeps coming to me on NarendraModiApp.
I'm talking to Mona Karnwal from Biz Noor.
They should also have tea-spirit feelings as well as quality of good quality.
Your stress, your suggestions and all this are the result that NCC, NSS, India Scouts and Guides, Red Cross leaders and Nehru Youth Centres have made an audience.
Asked how to meet before this, they said that this is the first time that such a concert has taken place without coming to the country's independence.
They are doing a lot of water.
But if we conclude in the collective horizon, we can see the greatest results.
There is inspiration and a national perspective increases.
I got that benefit in my childhood.
I also want to fulfil a new life in these institutions.
This time I have put something before them.
How many blankets and how many districts can we abrogate outsiders.
This is why I am listening to all of you .
Please give suggestion to these youth institutions .

Today , beloved people of my country , how much enjoys me to keep my own matter in this matter .
A crore families have cleaned up their gas subsidies.
This fort is not the family of the family .
It is easier to quit subsidies.
Mobile phones can be made by Jap.
The telephone can be delivered online and the subsidies can also be delivered by giving mid-day call to the phone number.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the families of that fort.
The economic scientists in our country have also taken a different look at this matter.
We have to move ahead in this direction.
I would like to say something else. Why should I interact with the 3rd and 4th generation workers
Sometimes I feel like someone else who does not have a ticket in some ways in the railways.
Once we have this kind of wealth, there will be unforgettable results.
Okay, these are my thoughts which cannot be transformed into government laws.
But such a situation can enhance the potential environment.
He added, "Please invite your rulers to post a good event every day.
Breaking News in every newspaper and TV channel is all inevitable.

Many people in the world know that along with these days, crores of people reach the bank of a river and take sacred bath.
In the last few days, I am happy to upload several photographs of Simhastha Kumbh Mela.
I am sure the Central and State Governments tourism institutions can set up a shadowy competition.
Though the Kumbh Mela is a spiritual festival, we should also consider it as a social context.
I will surely meet you all this evening in a special context like Panchayati Raj Diwas.
This is my heartfelt thanks to all of you.
Like always, the undiscriminated bond between your thoughts and thoughts gives me immense pleasure.

I extend my best wishes to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests on the successful journey of Amarnath.
I am aware that more than eight lakh people have visited Kedarnath Dham from the beginning of the Chardham Yatra this time in Uttarakhand.
Thirthankaras reached here in such a number of records for the first time after the terrible disaster that took place in 2013.
My best wishes to all of you are that in the years of the country, you will not be able to go to those places.
To see these beauty in our country, none of these big teachers will be able to visit tourism to know the spirit of the people of our country.
There has been heavy rains in many places of the country.
Today Christians are celebrating the day of this festival .
This is my luxury for everyone in the contribution of this East .
My young friends .
On one side tests are T20 cricket world camp matches on the other side .
I know that in the evening also you are waiting for India - Australia match .
Under some days India has spent two straight matches with Pakistan , Bangladesh water .
We are looking at a good job in this T20 cricket World Cup.
Today, India is ready to play Australian waters and these two waters are my best wishes.
In our country 65 percent youth in the population of our country we have no reason to stay away from participating in the world .
This is not the work done .
We need to bring positive changes in sports .
We can see this place in India .
Like cricket, there is an increase in interest in football, hockey, tennis and cabdi.
You will be aware that India will be honoured in the year coming to FFA Under-17 World Cup.
Our country has come to play twenty four waters from all over the world .
In 1951 , 1962 Indian football hair had spent golden plates in Asian Games , and in 1956 Olympic Games the hair of India remained in fourth place .
From the point of view of scratching we fled to places from there for some decades .
I don't even want to say that our rankings are so low in the FIFA.
On the other hand, I am glad that the interest of football in the youth of India continues to grow so much that it is English Premier Leg or Spanish Leg or Indian Super Leg match.
Indian youngsters are experiencing fresh information about these matches, but they are experiencing time to see them on television.
I would like to say that when the prestige of this sports grows so much that when we get the opportunity to give support to the FF-17 World Cup then we will fulfill our responsibility only while playing the role of the guests.
Or would we encourage sports using this opportunity to benefit us
We should create a changing environment throughout the year, namely football, football and football. If we talk about it in schools and art galleries then India will be the cornerstone of the country.
In our youth , girls wet our children with sweat while playing football .
Although it has been done , we get a simple joy to give guests .
Therefore we try to take the beauty of Fate Bal village , street .
From now onwards, IFF Ander-17 World Cup in 2017 will fill up a kind of zeal in the youth.
It is good to give hospitality to this program that many basic games are made here .
We can make every youth of our country with this sports .
How can we enhance the interest of this game in the youth of India by the FF-17 World Cup in 2017
How can the competitive elements be adopted in the government , educational institutions , social institutions to make friends with this game .
We are watching this place in cricket.
These are also trying to give other sports to other sports .
I am sure there is a need to identify the world with the capabilities of the youth of India which is not smooth in the sense of any match.
We can exhibit and exhibit the energy capabilities while preparing for the World Cup of FF-17 in 2017.
By doing so, we can also do broad broadening that enhances India's commitment.
You can send me your advice and suggestions related to FFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017 through NarendraModiApp

In scientific way this attempt is not done but work is done only .
But if we want to enhance the tourism of 125 crore people of the country then we can attract the world .

Otherwise our crores can show the chances of the youth .
Government , institutions , society , society , people have done the work of combining it .
Come on, in this direction we make an attempt.

In the past the places , places , places which are present in the water can be prepared by cleaning the garbage after cleaning it and coming and ready to stay standing .
If we are filled with ponds , rivers , canals then after that there is no deficiency of water that we do not suffer much harm .
But it is possible only if we stand by holding the lap of water of every vehicle .
This time we decided to excavate five lakh water ponds .
But now how much more efforts are needed in this direction .

Millions of students reviewed this programme.
Village people have seen it.

This message was sent by a woman called Savitarai from Mumbai.
This time we will also clean our homes and our traditions for Deepawali.
As a result of this, the garden started on cleanliness as well as on its own.
You have said that whatever we think before the festival should be brought into action after the festival.
We have to do this in every effort.
Today I extend my best wishes to all media institutions in the country.
On 2nd October last year, I had the opportunity to participate in the interaction between India and the Archaeological Survey of India on the completion of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Institute has provided Clean India Awards.
I am glad that those who have worked for Swachh Bharat in Van Lake One Mission.
We have made such countries clean in our country.
I heartily congratulate the Indian TV Group that has been doing so marvellously.
Similarly, 51 lakh children in about 55,56 thousand schools in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have participated in the programme.
Bahrang regions, railway stations, spiritual institutions, hospitals and parks have spread awareness about cleanliness in such areas.
Now the news gives us the power that we need to realize the goals of Swachh Bharat.
Therefore, all the people of the country are taking this task forward by considering what Smt. Savita Rai has suggested.
He added that this village has achieved the most clean village Arav in Asia.
It is heartening to note that we are far away from the country, so beautiful in the North-Eastern region, many villages have grown in the field of sanitation.
My dear countrymen, in the context of the 15th August from the Red Fort, there are some things that have been lost.
When the poor person goes to small jobs, the number of sympathies he sends for the sympathies, the number of sympathies he asks, the number of sympathies he asks.
I have never heard in the world as much as the psychiatrist understands a person in an interval of one or two minutes.
I congratulate all the young friends on this occasion.
However, in the following budgets, I have expressed my face-to-face approach.
Our country has become a part of the golden society's life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in banks.
Now keep gold in the house .
One more thing is that in the Savarin Gold Bond, you will have gold bunches in your hand.
But now we start it .
Because of this, there is no need to buy gold now.
I will present the people of the country in the coming weeks to give a homage to this scheme.
I am very happy to say that we are also carrying gold coins and gold coins with Ashoka Chakra.
Why shouldn't we have the indigenous seal of our country
Therefore, in the coming weeks, Dhan Terracotta will be delivered to the common people and we will launch Indias gold coins with five grams and sixteen grams of Ashoka Chakra.
Besides, 20 grams of gold are also available to the people.
I would like to assure you that this new system will bring about new changes in the direction of Arthritis.
However, one mantra - we need to sustain our thoughts, commitment and personality.
There is a diference in India .
Several religions, religions, communities, many languages, different castes and cultures.
Therefore, diversity is the same mantra.
Peace, harmony and unity - these are diverse ideals for development.
Over the past several years, the Run for Unity has been implemented in many places in the country on 31st October.
Take the same mantra forward.
Now you all will be in the Deepawali system and keep on cleaning the houses.

However, there was a good relationship between us.
In the last few years, the year has been completed.
Now we are presenting in the new year.
My beloved countrymen, my best wishes for the next time.
Pradhan Mantri Mann Ki Baat Yojana (Recruitment), September 2015
My dear countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat - One year, many things.
I dont know what you have achieved because of this, but I can tell you how much I can achieve.
The power of the people is very important in democracy.
I have an important consideration in my life and I have great faith in the power of the people.
But I have learnt through our talk programme, I have understood, I have found it, because of which I say that we think that more power is incomparable than that.
Our ancestors used to say that people are part of the part of the part.
But in lakhs of people, people used to send messages to me by becoming aware.
It's a great power.
These lakhs of excitements taught me a great lesson.
That is, the information should be reached from the bottom to the bottom of the level, which is really going from top to bottom.
Someone said that this information will change in Mann Ki Baat-Mans.
But it's done.
Similarly, Mann Ki Baat has transformed into a need to showcase the power of dialogue in our minds.
Keeping in mind the tourism gap in India, I congratulate all the citizens and I congratulate you all for sending a good photo.
But how big adversity has come.
Lacs of people have sent photographs from all corners of the country.
There is a specification for the power of the people.
Once I spoke in Mann Ki Baat-Muslim.
It is difficult for the people of the society to leave stones between the people and the people of the state and the people of the state.
Not only from Siachen but from the Kutch region, there is no place to call Gani phones from Camrup, Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
Phone has been done from all the places .
This is a pleasant feeling.
He sent his message to all ages.
I liked to listen to some messages myself, it is very good.
My bundle remains on them.
But the reason is that they cannot see TV because radio is heard.
I know through this how important radio radio is for those who do not see.
I am looking at the new angles and how many good things have been explained - it is enough to consciousen the government.

How did I see it funny .
Besides, the war in Hajipur was fought in Ghani and Chamunda, but the hairs are sighted by the wonderful sights of Hajipur pass.
Everyone is associated with our heritage.
I wish you and your families- if you are close to Delhi, then I would like to see this for a few more days.
Don't go to see it soon.
I'm back in two and a half hours.
A young boy asked the Prime Minister but the boy forgot to call his name soon.
After Independence, there has been a few hours of discussion in the Parliament on cleanliness.
I am seeing good in it .
It also looks forward to discussing the country's parlor about cleanliness.
On the one hand, Parliamentarians, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other side of the country, both are talking about cleanliness.
You know what Mahatma Gandhi says.
Once it is meant that if you have to choose one of the two of the freedom and cleanliness, then you will choose the same cleanliness and freedom.
Gandhiji's cleanliness is more important than freedom.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering.
On 2nd October, Bapu Mahatma Gandhi was celebrated.
5, 50 or 50 rupees or if any amount of money comes out, then the money will be paid to those people.
This joy also gives you some shares.
When I went to Kolkata in May, I met the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose.
Chandra Bose, son of Ayan Sodar, was built.
Subhash Babu had the opportunity to spend the evening with happiness and joy.
Chandra Bose and his family members are present on the occasion, and over 50 members of the Subhash Bose family have come to the Prime Minister's residence last week.
But they are more enjoying that such a great person should never have come to the Prime Minister's residence, which I have found in October.
This is why the family members of Subhash Babu are particularly coming up to 50 people living in different countries.
It's a moment to please me.
It's preserved that I got the precious power.
In the meantime, I visited Kashi.
I met many people.
Any other student called Kshitij Pandey.

This is the right path of peace, equality and sovereignty.
Following their words, the manner in which they speak is the generosity of the Sufi community and the beauty of music is hidden.
I am happy to be amongst them all.
I believe that the real nature of Islam is the need of the people to know the entire world in a proper manner.

I am very fortunate to have this invitation.
Buddhist scholars from many countries of the world have come to Buddhism in India.
I am invited to participate in it and I am happy to invite them to me.
The first Prime Minister of our country, Pandit Nehru, went to Buddha.
Even before this, I have also mentioned this in our bath programme.
We have administered an ordinance on land acquisition.
The Ordinance will be held on 31st August, 2018.
But there was a depth in it .
Therefore, on 15th August, I said that we have taken this decision very fast.
You don't have to be a victim of fear.
It is very common to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri when he came to war in 1965.
It is a common man to remember the mantra Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan.
It is a matter of great privilege to recall the tri-color of India and its dignified representations.
Such historical events always inspire us.
Last week, I had a happy opportunity to meet the people associated with the Sufi community.
I got the opportunity to interact with the eminent scientists of the country for hours.
How to connect the private sector in the area
There is a need to take it forward as a chance.
Whatever dreams you have seen in their eyes, in the following interactions, I have said that the students should put forward the vision of science, how much need you have, how much need you have.
Especially tell my young friends one thing.
Everyone is running . This can also be the reason of water in the lower stage .
The decision to free small enterprises from intervals is now almost complete.
This is the first time that American lights are in other countries.
Today, about 50 thousand pregnant women and 13 lakh children are dying at the time of delivery or at the time of delivery.
As we get rid of polio, we can also get rid of tests about mothers and infant mortality.
There are reports about dengue.
We cannot make death so easily.
How precious life is .
Not paying attention to drinking water, observations on cleanliness, which are the reasons for the death - it is not true.
Free dengue determination tests are available in 514 centres across the country.
Now we cannot get the opportunity to return to the country but we can only get the privilege of living for the country.
The two brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
Sometimes, due to lack of awareness, we are unrestrained to our youth.
I believe that this arbitrariness has been going on for centuries.

It is said that "Sande on Cycle" has been launched.
Some say that we are playing a cycle day a week.
Mann Ki Baat, June, 2019
O my dear countrymen , Namaskar .
Sometimes we are inspired to us .
How can I imagine the time spent in this middle .
On Sunday , the last Sunday I felt as if I had lost something at 11 o'clock .
It feels sure .
Probably this is not an unsuccessful program .
In this program there was life , it seemed private , heart was loosened , therefore I felt very difficult for this program .
But this Sunday has been very waited .
In the last few months, many messages have come and people are also being missed Mann Ki Baat.
When I read these , I would be very good .
Why did I travel to Kedarnath in How many acquaintances .
Your curiosity can be done .
I also feel that feelings with you .
But if they talk then the form of Mann Ki Baat will change.
In how many acquaintances , in the contribution of the Japanese , even more polio I am Baaldera .
Many people have discovered royal meanings in it .
This is my skull, I'm the chance to spend with me.
Everything can now say that the small break in the line of Mann Ki Baat has created a chance to fill the light in the Kedar Ghats.
Besides this your efforts also try to fulfil one day .
Never say that I do but definitely do .
Because you have that right on me.
In the matter of Kedar how people have seen smiling , with the same smile you have seen some positive things , many times in your words .
Sometimes my thoughts also keep on talking to you .
Because of bringing problems related to people , country , society , challenges in my sight along with bringing them in my sight .
If someone is writing about cleanliness , then while expressing his wrath towards pollution also keeps exhibiting efforts for cleanliness .
That is , how the results of problems are seen in your words in the society .
The country of Mann Ki Baat is like a price for society.
It is known by this that there is no dearth of internal strength , strength , talent situated in the country .
There is a need to work with those strengths and talents and give them a chance.
One more thing to know from this Mann Ki Baat is that 130 crore people want to participate actively in the development of the country.
When I analyzed such things, you can imagine how much strength I get to my mind.
I didn't really come, you brought me, sat, you gave me the opportunity to speak again.
With this feeling, we have taken the tradition of Mann Ki Baat forward.
There was a climb in everyone 's mind .
Therefore the country has invited so many people not only for its own , but for the protection of democracy .
Perhaps in any country of the world, the people of the country have seen such a number of people in 77 (Debbai seven).
Today, there has been a lot of celebrations in our country, from wealth to beaches, everybody has been happy to participate in this festival and to decide the future of our country.
Anything that is close to us, we underestimate it and also ignore its adventurous factors.
We can see this number as normal, but if we leave China in the world, we can say that more than the neglected population of the rest of the world has been voted today.
But how many people were put in numbers in 2019 , that number of America is more than double , almost double .
The total number of Ootters in India is more than the population of Europe .
It introduces the vastness of our democracy.
The number of civilizations in 2019 is still the biggest democracy of the world in history .
In such a situation you can imagine how big level human power , arrangements are needed .
It is possible only if lakhs of studies , rulers , workers , workers are troubled in the daytime .
About three lakh Paramilitary team defence personnel have played their responsibility to ensure that 20 lakh police personnel of different states are also suffering at a pride.
As a result of their hard industry this time more Ooting has been done .
You can imagine about 10 lakh polling stations across the country, over 40 lakh EVM machines and over 17 lakh VVPAT machines.
It has been done that no Ooty should not come to use its Ooty .
A police station has been built for only one woman Ooty in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh .
If you have to travel for two days to reach there then you will be surprised .
But this is the real pride of democracy .
Polling center of the highest place of the world is in India .
This is located at a height of 15000 feet in the Lahaul - Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh .
Not only this , there is another chance of pride in these so many so many societies .
Perhaps for the first time in history, women also participated in Ooting with enthusiasm as men.
In this number the quantity of women , men , polio is almost equal .
Although enthusiasm is that in parlor today 78 -LRB- emergency -RRB- women are epidemics .
My dear countrymen, you must have heard me saying that Boke Not Book.
In welcome - welcome we pray to give books instead of flowers .
Such books are being given at many places .
In the meanwhile, I had given a book "Prem Chand Ke Lock Private Kahania".
It was good for me .
I did not get much time , while staying in Pravas I got the opportunity to read many stories again .
In his stories, the feelings of the entire India reflect.
When he reads the story Nasha, my vision has changed towards the economic inequalities of the society.
When I was young then I remembered how many nights were spent in the churches .
We know that when Ishwari, the son of Jamindar, the Veer of the poor family, is not aware of this story, then we know that when the effect of bad compassion takes place.
The second legend of my heart is 'Id Gah', a child's heartbeat, his love for his grandmother, his mature at a young age.
Taking a stroll from 4 . years Hamid Sanctuary to my mother , in reality human heart is considered to be the pride of heart .
The last part of this story is not so emotional , small Hamid is playing a Hamid party - old Amina , Amina has become small sin .
However, 'Puss Ki Rath' is a miraculous story.
In this stories a painting of a poor life is seen .
It is happy that if its fruit has been destroyed then it is not necessary to sleep like a coffee in the winters shivering itself .
In reality these stories are old for a century , today it seems appropriate to be appropriate .
After reading these I felt a special experience .
If we talk about reading , in some media I read about Akshayla Library of Kerala .
If you are in a village of dense forests of this library Idukki -LRB- Idukki -RRB- then you will not be surprised .
The primary school teacher P . .
K. .
Both of these library have been made unsuccessful for this library .
Once the buildings of books had to be taken on the shoulders .
Today this library is giving way to everyone along with the tribal children .
Vanche Gujarat (South Gujarat) is a successful experiment in Gujarat.
In lakhs of people of all ages participate in this park .
Everyone in Mann Ki Baat can know about the book that is read in the Narendra Modi App.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to note that the people of our country are not only present but also the future challenges.
When I read your descriptions in NarendraModi App, My Progress, many people are writing about the problem of water.
Several others have written about water related problems in Pavan Gaurai, Sitanshu Mohan Parida in Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf.
Water is very important in our culture .
It has been said about the water of suppressed in suppression . It is said about the suppression of hygiene , hygiene , hygiene , hygiene , hygiene , hygiene , hygiene , hygiene , hygiene , hygiene , hygiene , hygiene , hygiene , hygiene , hygiene .
Everyday the problem of water in many places of the country is lifting up .
Along with the rainy season we can hide only 8  water in the water of rainy season that you do not surprise .
Only 8  .
The time to find out the result of this problem has come .
Like the rest of the problems , with the participation of people , with the capacity of hundreds of crores of people , with the capacity of hundreds of crores of people , with the help of contribution this problem is also discovered .
The Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Dr.
Through this decisions can be taken fast in all matters related to water .
Some people have done a new task .
The survey of all the villages of the country has written Uttaranchal .
To fulfil the water of the villagers , to collect every drop of rain water , to make them a collection in the village , to discuss with the villagers .
In this work by participating with complete enthusiasm in this month crores of people have done trouble in 22 thousand Panchayatti .
People in villages have planned to provide water to every drop of water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat program, I will listen to you a sarpanch.
The Lung Panchayat Serpent of Katam Sandi Block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand is giving a message to all of us and my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
The people there were ready to play their part for water conservation once again .
Everybody has many luxuries for their activities .
People of the village seem to be competitioning to build water temple in their villages .
As soon as I am already , positive results are seen .
There is no one farm for the solution of the problem of water throughout the country .
Therefore in various areas of the country , efforts are being made in different ways .
Therefore water logging problem is stopped .
There has been a major change in the small ponds built in the fields of Kabir Dham in Rajasthan.
Twenty thousand women tried collectively to revive the Nag river in Vellure, Tamilnadu.
I also read that in the Garhwal, all women are working very hard on Rain Water Harvesting.
I am confident that if we all try hardly then we can also make it possible.
My first request was how the countrymen promoted cleanliness and also launched a mass movement for water conservation.
I am confident that the water is the prasad of Parmeshwar.
To save one drop of water a necessity park was done .
Talk about the problems of water , talk about water conservation methods .
I specially recommend that innovative campaigns have to be implemented for water conservation for the mainstream sectors.
Not only the films of films , but also the friends of media , but the people of social institutions , not only the people of cultural institutions , but also the prophets , everybody in their own ways .
Awake the society , do the society together with the society .
See , before our eyes we definitely see changes .
I am listening to all of you that the traditional methods of water conservation have to be shared.
If one of you has the opportunity to visit the birthplace of Porbandar, then there is a house behind the priest Bapu's house where there is a water storage tank of 200 years.
Therefore I always say that if someone goes to Kirti Mandir then definitely see that water tank.
Come , let us inspire people by making maximum suggestions related to water conservation .

The awakening for the Holistic Health Care has increased, which has increased the importance of Yoga Day.
Yoga is welcomed at the time of sunrise in all the corners of the world , sunset is done .
Wherever humans were worshipped yoga .
From the Himalayas to Hindu Mahasagar Varuku , Siachen Sab Marine Varuku , Air-Forest , Air-Craft Carriers , ACG gyms , the desert of the villages , wherever there is a chance of yoga , not only Yoga , but also a collective festival .
I have been shown in Twitter how many states, Prime Ministers, well-known people, ordinary citizens have performed Yoga in their countries.
On that day the whole world looked like a happy family .
Therefore the procedure of yoga is an important society .
Do not recognize the cost of this service .
In 2019, the Prime Minister's Awards preached to those who played an important role in Yoga promotion and development.
You cannot imagine how importantly Yoga has played in propagating it throughout the world.
For example, if Japan Yoga is taken by Niketan, it has propagated Yoga throughout Japan.
There are several instruments and training courses.
Later, Ms.
Antonietta Roy, a person who started the Sarvoyog International, started yoga throughout Europe.
All these are spectacular .
In the matter related to yoga there is no proposal behind Indians .
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya and Munger have also received this award for the past few decades.
Both of them have made this Yoga Day more important for the extensive celebrations of Yoga and the homecoming of Yoga.
My dear countrymen, our journey is starting today. New feelings, new feelings, new talents, new talents.

This memorial has been built near the heart of Delhi i . . in Delhi where India Gate , Amarvila Jyoti .
I believe that visiting this national soldiers memorial is equal to visiting a pilgrimage of the people of the country .
After coming to independence the soldiers given maximum sacrifices for the country are the symbol of this national soldiers memorial .
The shape of this memorial , our martyrs show unparalleled courage .
The National Army Memorial is based on four concentration circulations, in the first circulation, the entire journey from birth to sacrifice has been painted.
The jewellery of Amar Chakra is a symbol of Amarkantar .
The second circumstance is the Shaurya Chakra .
There are dense trees in this wheel .
If we look at the soil, to know about the great martyrs of our country, to give thanks to them, it has become a place to visit this national army memorial.
To stay with our lives , the country is safe , to increase their lives are here .
For the development of the country it is not possible to say in the words of our weapons , polices , military teams , military teams .

Filled with natural , peaceful personality Murarji Bhai is one of the most synonymous officers of India .
The name of Morarji Bhai Desai is Namoda as the highest budget entered in the independent India parlor.
During the difficult time situated in the risk of the democracy of the country , the country has been run with its expert Nakshay Kshetra .
In order to save the preservation of preservation the necessity of Muraji Bhai country has also ended in fighting against emergency .
Therefore in his old age also he had to pay heavy value .
Since then the government had also kept him in jail .
In 1977 he was prime minister when the victory of January was successful .
He brought the administration of 44th state in the eleventh century .
This is why it is important to reduce the power of the Supreme Court in the 42nd state of emergency -LRB- emergency -RRB- , and the remaining arrangements -LRB- emergency -RRB- are harmful to our democracy.
In this way in 1975 AD as democracy was murdered in the emergencies , in future without happening in future the arrangement of Morarji Bhai had been done .
In order to maintain the grandeur of Indian democracy the futures always remember his beauty .
I dedicate such a great leader once again .

Once I am offering my tribute to this Mahatma .
My beloved country Prajalara , 1950 , January 26 Our country came into practice .
On that day our country has turned into a nation .
We celebrated our Ganesha Festival with playing , pride .
But I want to speak anything .
Seeing how many arrangements are held in India it is surprising to see all the world .
You must have heard about Gujarat .
A polio shoe is put only for one Ooty in a beautiful place of Gir forest .
With the purpose of getting the opportunity to use his Ooty for each other , he sees how many accidents go to far off places .
This is the beauty of our country .

I am also impressing all the industries of all the states helping to participate in how many procedures , independent , unsuccessfully .
How much responsibility should be our responsibility .
It is believed that in large numbers our young Ootters do their names , with their participation I give more strength to our Ganesha .

With the point of view of starting a museum built in the memory of the Mahavirs giving their participation in the freedom struggle of India I got Netaji Jayanti .
Do you know that many rooms have been closed in the Red Fort of Independence .
Although all the rooms closed were fulfilled in how beautiful museums .
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Kyi, a museum for Indian National Army, and several more museums have been built with the names of India's First War of Independence, 1857-Eighteen Fifty Seven.
In every brick of the rooms situated in these museums our glorious history is full of Taluku .
At this very same place, the British Government has run on the Bharat Mata Veerpuras - Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurubhaksh Singh Delo, Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
While reflecting the memories related to Netaji in the Cranti Mandir of Red Fort, the family members of Netaji presented me a rare hat.
It is necessary to repeat again in different forms about the beauty of our officers , country devotions .
Last month on 30 December I went to Andaman Nicobar Island .
75 years Christian where Netaji had flyed Trivarnapatak , right at the same place again Trivarnapatak .
The people were surprised to see the tri-color flying in the Red Fort in October 2018, because there was only a habit of flying nationalism for fifteenth August.
As if Azad Hind Circle was built in 75 years completed .
Subhash Babu is always remembered as a soldier , an expert .
Many people wanted to make films related to Netaji .
It's funny to me that we're dead.
On coming to the entire Prime minister of the family of Netaji I remember even more .

While talking about Chitrakoot Guru Govindranath Tagore is considered to be the best pictures of the pictures .
Until now Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore has been known as a musician .
But Gurudev is also a picture .
The special thing is that Gurudev Tagore had not named any picture of his most pictures .
Those who see their pictures , understand that picture themselves , they want to understand the message situated in that picture from their point of view .
He was also exhibited in European countries, Russia and America.
I believe that you will definitely go to see his leopards in the Cranti temple .
My dear countrymen, the land of the saints of India.

The birthplace of Guru Ravidas Ji was done in Varanasi .
Saint Ravidas ji tried to tell the importance of hard work and other workers through his messages throughout his life.
It is not necessary to tell the importance of Talluku in reality of the world .
It is said that he is - i . . your mind , heart , if you are able to see that this goddess is in the heart .
The contribution of Santravidas has been impressed , all the people of the world . Chittor Maharaja , Rani , Meerabai first week .

We were asking in 2019 AD .
At such a time along with heading the seventh year Taluku Kumbar it is also common to discuss new year .
All of you are many luxuries of Gunnu for the year 2019 .
How to remember the year 2018 all you keep thinking .
In 2018 Ayushman Bharat has been started in the world 's largest health insurance scheme .

This is possible because of the construction of 130 crore people of the country .
My dear countrymen, we lost some extraordinary people in this December.

The help of helping mothers , brothers and sisters wearing pregnancy is to work easily .
Especially in the rare areas of Karnataka thousands of mothers , brothers and sisters have given their services .
Initially this year Padmasri was honored with the prize .
I am talking about healthcare, so I want to talk about the social efforts of doctors of Bij-Nor in Uttar Pradesh.
Some doctors of Patna have told me that some days Christian workers are treating the poors freely .
Apart from making such physician camps every month of heart , lungs cricket center , apart from testing various types of diseases they are also organised free treatment in those camps .
Hundreds of poor patients are benefitted from these camps every month .
In order to serve with unconscious feelings this doctor 's friends are really happy .
It is said that through social efforts the sanctuary was successful .

After that she kept her tail in a bag surrounded by an egg .
Why do you keep thinking about drinking a glass milk
She has done this for the sake of her father Jasmer Singh because she sells lassi in a stall in Panipat.
How much sacrificed his father to reach his father , how difficult was he , Rajjan .

After such problems also Baxing is learning without encouragement .
She also studied a piece in Serbia.

There are many luxuries for our brothers and sisters .
In diversity all our festivals are included in one India , one India .
We can see how close our festivals are drowned with nature .
In Indian culture all the society is not seen different from nature and here both the person and the society are one .
Calendar built on the basis of festivals is a good example of relation with nature .
In this the festivals coming from year to year are also included with songs , planets .
We know how old relation with natural , geographical incidents we have this traditional calendar .
Festivals, festivals, festivals are determined on the basis of sun moonlight calendars.

Now the gate of Akshay tree is opened for everyone .
When you come to the Kumbh fair, take photographs in different contexts and share with everyone in social media so that most people get inspiration to go to Kumbh Mela.

Mann Ki Baat, November, 2018
On 3rd October 2014, the Mann Ki Baat programme was organised on the occasion of Vijaydasamy.
Our Mann Ki Baat Dharawahik journey is completing fifty bags with this.
Therefore, it is a golden festival of Golden Jubilee Episode, which means the golden festival of Mann Ki Baat.
This time the phone calls , Uttaranchal coming from all of you have also proposed this golden festival .
Anshu Kumar of Delhi, Amar Kumar, Vikas Yadav from Patna
Every week asked that people tell you more latest technology , social media through social media , mobile apps are the person .
But why did you choose radio in order to meet people
Tell me a story.
It was done in 1998 .
I was working as an institutional member of the Bharatiya Janta Party in Himachal Pradesh.
The cost of ' Bharat ' is known as ' Bombay ' .
I do not understand .
Then he said , Behold , as soon as radio is listening , the same thing has been discussed in radio .
When our Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji came forward and told me that the atomic test was done that day, how much is this tea smitten in radio.
I kept estimating the strength of radio .
After becoming the prime minister it is natural to change my vision towards the most powerful medium .
Feed Back coming in this survey is very interesting .
How expansive church has also been done about puja .
This is an example of social point of view , positive feelings situated in the minds of all the people of our country .
Because of the program of Mann Ki Baat the feelings of volunteerism i . . cleanliness service has also increased some of their experiences .
People are moving forward at a very high pace for social service.
I am very happy to make radio more popular for people because of the program of Mann Ki Baat .
The north , online expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive exhibitions of all these .
Modi comes and goes but this country remains stable and our culture remains stable forever.
These small stories of 130 crore people of the country are always alive .
All these give new inspiration to this country , with new enthusiasm the highest peaks .
My experiences also participate with water .
After that, this thing gradually moves towards a change in households, social media and in Wattsup.
And whenever the Prime Minister in the phone calls is taught to keep his households as well, they are small as those who give it to him.
How can the government ever get the power to supplement the publicity of SelfieWithDaughter from the small village of Haryana, not only in the country but also abroad
Many times Mann Ki Baat is also a victim of ridicule but in my heart all the 130 crore people of the country are always there.
All of them are my heart .
Mann Ki Baat is not the word of the government , it is the word of the society .
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India, a positive India.
There is a kind of spirituality in your question .
The biggest glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious .
If you want to say peacefully to your question then there is nothing .
Absolutely Mann Ki Baat is a very easy task for me .
Every time the answers come in front of the people .
In MyGou and Narendra Modi mobile apps, people share their thoughts and a toll free number is 1800117800.
People who have photographed this number record their message with their throats.
Before the beginning of Mann Ki Baat my attempt is to read more north , more expansively .
I hear a lot of phone calls myself.
If I fall near the Mann Ki Baat program, how much will I read you in the thoughts that you sent during my journey.
Every moment, all the people of my country are in my mind, so whoever reads the north, their emotions become part of my thoughts.
This north is not just a piece of shield .
Actually I mouth the descriptions of the name of the village , person etc .
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who participated in the Mann Ki Baat, for example, emotional and inspiring my countrymen.
Their north , expansions are not able to read , but again the number of those who send north , traders is in lakhs .
I also try to showcase the unprecedented norms and information related to the departments in Mann Ki Baat.
I am also blessings to all my colleagues of radio , vision , remaining T . . Channels , social meditation .
Because of their hard work Manki Batt has reached many people .
All the programs of the sky Vrindra Vrindravan Vrindravan are published in many languages .
Some people are also listening to the voice near the throat of the motor , with the same voice .
In this way they are turning into Nrandra Modi for thirty minutes .
You all also want to listen to the Mann Ki Baat program in your languages.
It is believed that everybody has done less coverage -LRB- archaeological collection -RRB- about them , or the archaeological collection done about water is resistant to them .
But the media has changed many things in Mann Ki Baat to its own things.
The media has worked as a model for many things like cleanliness, road safety, drugs free India, selfie with dugter etc.
If you don't have your support then my Mann Ki Baat journey was incomplete.
"Thank you very much for your phone call, Ganu.
