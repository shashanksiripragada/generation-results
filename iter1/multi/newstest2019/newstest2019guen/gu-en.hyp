Did you shout at reading the shirshak
How can Sultan Mahmud Ghazni's court language be Sanskrit for the dishes of Somnath Temple and for the common Indian
In fact, the research conducted by the Historian of Delhi University, Prof. Shanta Pandey has made it clear that the official language of Ghazni was Sanskrit.
Now, when Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for the service of Sanskrit, Sanskrit was only a demographic language that was the language of so-called high-class Brahmins, such a simple question was natural.
Pundit Ghulam Dastiger of Mumbai recalled.
The 87-year-old Pandit Visitors who spoke in such a simple Sanskrit, who can also understand, are still finalizing the Sanskrit translation of the sacred uran.
The sacred uran is Sanskrit with their perception.
KU RAN i. e.
Not only did he read himself in the school of Solapur, but today he is among the greatest Sanskrit scholars of the country.
However, Panditji does not seek to lecture as a pundit of Sanskrit in the US or other countries for his marketing.
The princess of Thailand is the prince of Sanskrit.
Sanskrit sings itself there.
Entrepreneurs have to go to the Bone University of Germany to learn Sanskrit from America.
Besides the Banaras Hindu University in India, most of the universities also have the pride of the PhD of Sanskrit which is written in the language of that state.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught only in Gujarat, but it is remembered that education in Takshila and Nalanda University was done through Sanskrit.
Shri Shanta Pandey has said that the court language of Ghazni Sultan was not only Sanskrit but it has also recognised his coins in Sanskrit.
Pondicherry has also mentioned the signs of Mohammad Suratran in Sanskrit as well as being a resident of Shalapur in Afghanistan, the creator of Sanskrit interpretation.
Pandit Nehru said that a vast explanation in the vision of Maru Hind has descended from Afghan and Pushtu language Sanskrit in the capability and sustainable power of Sanskrit.
Today, everyone accepts that not only Indian languages but also Indian-European languages have come down from Sanskrit.
One more surprising thing is that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the Chief Guest of the Constitution, and some other Muslim and South Indian Constitution members had proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
On 13th September, 1949, when there was a discussion on the National Language in the Constituent Assembly against Hindi, Naib was the Foreign Minister Dr. B. V.
The day's discussion and the report published in the National Herald on 11th September, 1949, is estimated by the bulk of the Sanskrit language.
Even today, we have not been able to determine any national language.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit and Urdu, are the official languages in our Constitution, not one national language.
As per the counting of 2011, Sanskrit has now been the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Sanskrit Constituent Assembly in New Delhi.
Sir Williams Jones in Sal of Chhech 1874 said, God knows how old the Sanskrit language is, its creation is unique.
It is full of Greek languages, more vulnerable than Latin and more distinct than both.
Nehru adds: "I don't know how long Sanskrit has become a dead language, i. e.
Today, the Sanskrit language is praying that as a Member of Parliament, the Union Minister has been just a language to take a pledge for members like Smriti Irani.
We need to save the years of Sanskrit and make it alive and democratic.
If Israel's dead language can be revived then Sanskrit is still a living language.
It is a matter of great privilege to showcase it to make a Lok Sabha or to make serious efforts instead of political efforts.
