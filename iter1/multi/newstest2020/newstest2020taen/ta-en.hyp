There are revolutionary movements even before Bhagat Singh.
But there is no appreciation that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have provided a new dimension and clear ideal for revolutionary movements and through it to Indian politics.

'We say that if he had decided that he would have done the right path, if he had decided to fulfill his policies, he would have done it, and if he had not done so, we would have said that he would have been a fit man.
That's why we now call him a real man.
It is our strong impression that Bhagsingh policy is really necessary for India.
If Mr. Bhagad Singh is suppressed and does not resume his life, then this victory would not have been the basis for being so popular.
We say that if Bhagat Singh had not been suppressed, Gandhiji would have been more provocative.
The mother had to give her life to the people of India, who had to suffer from illness and illness, to show the path of real equality and peace to the people of the world.
We appreciate Bhagadsingh Manar, Vair and Kayar by saying that nobody else can get anymore

Our leader M.K. Stalin had expressed his concern over the responsibility of the opposition leader of the Tamil Nadu legislature that he had no such plan to prevent it from passing through Cauvery.
Assuming the answer to the chief minister, Edappadie Palanisamy said, 'Dimplementing us, DMK Winner has built a detention in Kaavari in his regime.'
'I want to tell him, we have built a hindrance in the legislative regime at Cauvery in the DMK regime.
Without knowing the details, will the Chief Minister Edappadie Palanisamy, who is responsible for the public service sector, speak against the truth
The blockade built in Mayanur increased the water source of the earth in that area.
That's why agriculture was destroyed.
Therefore, thousands of people of that region, which is still useful today, are happy to thank the League Government.
According to the requirements of the period, the Government of the Republic of Mayanur had constructed a vaccination.
There was no need to build more hurdles then.
If needed, then the artist who was the then Chief Minister would have given permission to him immediately, would have allocated funds and driven out the work.
So, it's not supposed to be supposed to have reduced the legislative state to Kaveri's welfare.
I'm asking you, how many restrictions have you built in Cauvery in the last eight years that the ADMK regime will take place
Otherwise, we have constructed more than 40 dams in Tamilnadu during the diverse regimes.
Can you point out a single dam that was built in the ADMK regime so far
Don't lie.
In response to the allegations made by the opposition leader, tell the evidence where we are building or planning to build a detention.
Instead of telling the truth that the DMK has not been banned in Kaveri's regime, it might have been beautiful for personal adultery, but for the post of chief minister, it is not a civilisational act, but a beautiful act.'
