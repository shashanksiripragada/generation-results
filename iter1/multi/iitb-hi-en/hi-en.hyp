Black box in your car
While America's road planners are battling the shortage of funds to improve the highway system, many people are looking at it in a small black box, which is fitted with cleanliness on your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every miles run by the motor-seller and transmits the information to the authorities, has now become an issue of controversial effort for Washington and State Planning Office to restore the old system to finance the major US roads.
Generally, booming work like highway planning has also suddenly become an issue of deep debate and vibrant coalitions.
You have met with liberaterian environmental groups to gather support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes to drive miles and possibly drive the location - and then to prepare the tax bill .
The tea party is a deception.
The American Civil Freedom Federation is also very worried while raising various types of confidential issues.
While the Congress could not agree whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They are searching how they can go to a system in the next decade, in which the driver pay for every miles fixed on the road.
Thousands of motor operators have already taken black boxes for test drive, some of which are GPS monitoring.
This is actually a compulsory thing for our country.
"This is not a matter of elected by us or not, it is to say that Hasan Ekrata, who is the Executive Director of the South California Government Association, who is planning to start tracking every miles set by motor-chellers in California by 2025.
We are going to change the way to pay taxes.
There is technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's Highway Trust Fund has become almost bankrupt, which is financed by the payment of taxes made by American citizens on gas pumps.
Americans do not buy gas as much as before.
Now the car runs more mile than before in a gallon gas.
Federal tax has not increased in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cent per gallon.
Due to high value of gas, politicians also avoid increasing one money in tax.
Li Munikh, a transport policy expert at Mensota University, says, "There is no dissemination at all.
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the long run it will work as the most logical option.
Vonx is called miles-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea is enjoying urban liberals, for example, taxes can be changed to transform the way the car runs, which can help in reducing jams and reducing greenhouse gas.
California's planners are eager for this system, while they are developing strategies to fulfill the target set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But Chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip Bill Shustar (A-PA) also considers black box as the most viable long term option.
In the Region Foundation, independent vendors are also in favor of paying per miles by the driver.
In the Region, the Deputy Chairman of the Policy, Adrien Mur said, "This is not just done which is going to the blind well."
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
This campaign has also been supported by two former US transport secretaries, who in their report in 2011, had gratitude to the Congress to move forward towards per-mile payment.
The US Senate had approved the testing project of  90 million last year, which included 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing those people who had to walk very long to work daily or to go to the city, the leadership of the House ended that proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving forward in this direction themselves.
It has the most interested Organ, which has listed 5,000 crews in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving forward in this direction.
Elinois is trying with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, which includes 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) with eastern Ceyboard, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support in all places.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers shortly before, the driver was very impatient to think that the government could monitor each of their steps.
Alauddin Khan, who directed strategic and performance management in the Navada Transport Department, says, "The concern about Big Brother and other things of the same kind was a major problem.
This is not something that people wanted.
As soon as the test proceeded, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "In turning the device into a complete tracking device will be very easy."
There is no need to develop a vast, unregulated technology framework, which has to be expanded in order to keep records of every person's daily visit.
Nevada is among many states which are making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get the details of how many miles per day the car is going on, but it is not where it is going on and what time it is going on.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to the small California Start-up called Tru Milez.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which the drivers had to pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the device which it is testing is good for highway planners, because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by Modem at fixed time.
Ryan Marison, Chief Executive of True Milej, said, "If you do not track the speed and location of people, they will be more interested in adopting this method."
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programs of the state.
There are also very few expensive and less interfering methods to do so.
In Oregon, planners are using to give different options to the drivers.
They can choose GPS device or without GPS.
Or you can not choose to take any device again, but can choose to pay fixed fees on the basis of average miles fixed by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this concept can be sold to the concerned citizens by providing more facilities than less in the device.
In New York city, transport officials are trying to develop such a taxis device, which will also have the facility to pay the parking meter fee, "Pension Insurance will be provided according to their drive, and other drivers will create a collection of real time speed data, which will be used to avoid motor-children traffic. "
It has been mentioned in the city planning document, "Motor-Challak will be attracted to participate due to the benefits received from it."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps all the discussion on payments according to miles is a major describing.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Gulf region has said that Congress can easily deal with the problem of the bankrupt highway trust firm by increasing gas tax.
The drivers of hybrids or other cars can also be charged at an extra time or annual fee, whose vehicles do not use much gas so that they pay their proper share.
Randy Rentscheller, director of the Commission's Legislative and Public Affairs, said, "When the Aspirin can work, what is the need for a precious surgery for him.
If we do this then millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, he died due to drowning.
Of course, his friend has been detained by the police for hiding the deceased belongings to him.
The police has submitted the final report of the death investigation in the court.
It is known that on August 26, the police had recovered the body of ahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Dariya.
His family had accused his friends of killing him because his mobile and other things were missing.
In the report, the police said that the phone and SIM of the deceased were examined and found that his phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman told in the interrogation that she has given this phone to her relative Ruhal Gauhar.
Ruhal also lives in Padshahi Bagh and he was a friend of late ahid.
Ruhal went to Jhelum with ahid after Namaz-e-umma on August 25.
ahid opened his clothes and kept all the things on the edge, while Ruhal went on the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, ahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhal searched ahid, but he did not get it.
On this, he picked up his mobile phone, watch and other items and kept it for his use.
He did not tell anyone that ahid was drowned.
Police told the court that ahid's death has happened due to drowning and it has also been confirmed in the post-mortem.
Of course, Ruhal has been detained under section 404 to hide the facts and the material of the deceased.

Asaram, who was lodged in jail for sexual harassment, was once again disappointed with the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being presented as a Dracula for children's blood, but the court rejected his demand for a ban on media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P. Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop the news about Asaram and said that he has seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason to interfere in it.
When they are getting information from the police and other people, how can we stop them

Department officials claim that this is the case of the biggest TDS theft so far.
The group operator of the mall cut TDS and paid it to the concerned financial institutions, but did not pay it in the government treasury.
By doing so, the amount of TDS was deposited with itself.
On October 17, the exploration team from Mumbai took action with the Jaipur Exploration Team.
In the investigation of this episode, it was found that this trader has cut TDS but did not deposit.
For this reason, the TDS team started the action of income tax survey on this group on Thursday.
About 15 days ago, the risk of sealing the account was raided and surveyed on the group of this mall operator.
Angered by this action, this businessman has clearly told the officials of the Income Tax Department that they are not ready to pay the amount of TDS to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is constantly doing the work by targeting them.
Officials investigating in this case have clarified that recovery will be taken by sealing the account in case of non-payment.

In view of this, sale of poor and fake cattle increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more bright, colourful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against fake mawa and chemical sweets.

Fear of action did not express any right to the move.
The department destroyed it as an unclaimed property.
The department raided the Jitendra Caterers located in uetta Colony and recovered about 5 thousand spoons.
Chemicals called Sodium Hydrosulphite were used to shine and stay for a long time.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
SS Deshmukh, co-operator of the department said that the campaign to arrest chemical sweets and poor and fake cattle will continue.
In the next few days, information about this campaign has been given by the department.

Selected 42 senior leaders of the state BJP received their warm welcome at the airport.
It is notable that Modi has come on a tour of Bihar for a consolation visit organized by the BJP.
The Sangathana Yatra is organized by the BJP to ruin the families of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is notable that during the Hunkar rally of Narendra Modi on October 27 in Patna, a total of seven blasts took place after one.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen militants involved in the blasts was to make a stampede during the rally so that more and more people were casualties and there was panic in the state.
That intention of terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
Party leaders have come out on a journey from Thursday by taking bones and bones from their village.
On November 5, all the bones will be flown simultaneously in the Ganges in Patna.
Satwana Yatra is organized as part of this journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the villages of those killed in the blasts from 7 am on Saturday morning and meet their families.
During this meeting, they will also provide a check of five to five rupees to the relatives of the dead.
The BJP has already announced this financial help.
When the Indian team, excited by the blasting victory in the last match, will come to the seventh and final forest against Australia at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday, its goal will be to capture the series with victory.
After washing two forest matches continuously due to the rain, India had to win the Nagpur forest in any case and its batsmen won the record while performing a bullying, causing the team to match 2-2 in the series.
Team India has achieved the goal of more than 350 runs twice in the series and once again the responsibility of crossing the team will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at the peak at this time and the biggest goal is also proving to be bouncing in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but the team will also have great expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Rana and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, the team has got such a salute couple as Rohit and Shikhar, which is easing the work of other batsmen with solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he gave a great partnership in opening and gave Virat an opportunity to play without any pressure.
Kohli has performed the third number so far, he is considered to be Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
Rather, many cricket pundits have termed him better than Sachin.
Virat, who is going to be 25 years old next week, has set 17 one-and-a-half century, out of which India has won 16.
Following the goal, their average is above 80.00 and has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can also be harmful to the team.
Rana and Yuvraj were floping badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even opened an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, good innings can work as 'Lifeline' for them in Bangalore forest.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have influenced everyone by their performance.
They are also demanding to be taken to the Test team for domestic Asia Series against England.
Australia has good batsmen up to number nine.
Besides Beli, Shen Watson, Glen Maxwell, Adam Vogues and James Focner have battled good in the series.
However, Fiel Hughes and Aeron Finch have not been able to leave any effect in the opening.
The lack of Michel Johnson in the bowling can be huge to Australia.
Johnson, who has performed spectacularly in the series so far, has been sent home for preparations for the Asia Series.
BJP National Executive member and Chief Spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of this prospective peace.
Referring to the reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing the heel to infiltrate terrorists around 2000 prepared in its training camps.
For this, he will never let peace on the border.
After the failure of separatists to spoil the situation on a large scale by provoking people in Kashmir, Pakistan has also spread.
Referring to the Pakistani visit of separatists last year, the BJP leader said that ISI Chief Lt Gen ahir-ul-Islam, Lashkar, Hizb's gangster Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be given air in 2014.
Pakistan is busy fulfilling this promise seriously.
The killing of soldiers on the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand to end the army's privileges in the state as fatal, the BJP leader said that such things are also anti-people till there is permanent peace in the state.
They get anti-country elements.
He emphasized that statements that demoralize the leaders' army, security forces should be banned.
Snow Den ready to collaborate with Germany on American square
American intelligence informer Edward Snow Den has declared that he is ready to visit Berlin to prove the Parliament in Germany if America's national security agency and its director Kitth Alexander fails to respond to his activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Stro Belle met Mr. Snow Den Segurwar in Russia, where he was given shelter to talk about testimony in Germany.
The MP said in a letter presented by Mr. Snow Den before the media in Berlin on Friday, "However the results of my efforts are positive, my government considers disagreement as a party-change, and does not provide any defense which is trying to commit a criminalization of political speech with allegations of revolt."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Den said that he believes that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to deny criminal charges against him.
The allegations filed by the US Department of Justice include secretaries and theft from the government's property.
Hans Peter Frederic, German Interior Affairs Minister, told Online Weeit: Mr. Snow Den is ready to talk to German officials, so we have to find ways to make it possible.
The relationship between the United States and Germany has come under pressure because the NSA has claimed that Chancellor Angela Markel's call has been bug.
Thomas Operman, MP, who is the chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, supervises intelligence.
A Green Party MP from Germany, Mr. Stro Belle, published a picture with Mr. Snow Den on Twitter feed.
He was on his trip to Russia with two German journalists.
Mr. Straw Belle said that according to former NSA contractor lawyer, if he left Russia, Snow Den is not able to return to Russia.
If Snow Den testified in the Germany, he'll be safe there who needs assurances, the MP said.
In his letter, Mr. Snow Den said, "He had to face a terrible and sustained campaign, he had to be forced to leave the house.
However, he said that he was happy and overwhelmed by the global widespread responses to his work of political expression.
The United States - including the World Citizens as well as the high officials have underscored the revelations of a irresponsible system of mass monitoring of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to collaborate with the German authorities , when problems of humanity have been solved .
Rontier Airlines will charge care - on baggage
There's a plan to charge  100 for the carry-on store for passengers on your plane board at Rantier Airlines.
Rantier Airlines plans to start a charge for a career on bag for 100 and it will charge 2 for coffee or soda, although it announced on Wednesday that passengers can keep the entire bag.
The new carry-on-duties are for the bag in overhead bin, so, the small bag below the seat will still be free.
Rontier said that if 25 charges are paid in advance, "100 will have to wait if travelers wait to pay until they are at the gate."
Rontier spokesman Kate O'Mally said that  100 fees have to be achieved to take care of the charge in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him, he said.
Airlines started charge for the first and second investigation bag in 2008.
Those travelers who are trying to avoid the fee, who can do as much as they can, which is stashed in the overhead box, means that this box often has less space.
There's a way to bring down to the passengers on the fee board.
O'Mally said that this new charge is not really about raising money.
It's the most loyal customers about the Rantier to find out instead of overhead bin has become very difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets in their website of the airline do not have to pay this.
This means that the next person in line may have to pay  100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in line at a frontier gate can get a bag free.
O'Mally said that the rantier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure that passengers know about the fees before getting the gate.
Rontier's new career-on-fee will not start until summer, although a date hasn't been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction with baggage charges and other charges, but airlines like them.
They argue that money is spent to handle the baggage, and those travelers who want service should pay for it.
Many of the baggage fees on Wall Street are looking as an indication that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them don't even touch the carry-on-bag fee.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the carie on duty three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
Along with such a fee, other airlines are Hangeri's i Air, which airline adviser J. Sorensen said, and who tracks ad-on-fee.
He said that the Carry on duty of Spirit brings 50 million in one year, which was estimated in the report of December 2011.
A former Midwest Airlines official, Sorensen, recently flew to Spirit and the passengers had to face a carry-on unusual bag fee at the gate, but surprised.
"The boreding process I saw in my airline career was easier, he said.
I hoped to pee the tooth and look out at a fight gate.
"and he said it was licketty-split."
Rontier is also following the 2 fee of 'Spirit' for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Rontier said that those travelers who take soda, or juice can keep the entire coach, and give it free coffee for just once.
It'll still give away the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinking substances in 2008, but after the complaint of the passengers, they retreated after seven months and followed any other main airline there.
If Rantier's passengers don't buy directly from the airline, this move of Rantier to charge the fee on Carey-On is his latest attempt to operate customers towards their own website.
Airlines pay online travel seller for such tickets sold from 10 to 25.
That's why all airlines have been encouraged to operate passengers to buy directly from those people instead of going through an online travel agency.
Dontier, however, has gone ahead in this area.
In September many often flights started paying half of the distance to those customers who had purchased from an online travel agency from these persons
On Wednesday, it reduced the Mileage Award up to 25 percent of the trip miles.
So, a 1000-mile rantier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a distance of 250 miles.
It's also that they allow the only passengers to choose their seat in advance when they buy directly from the Rantier website.
There's a loyal base of customers in the city of your house in Rantier's Denver, but its business is decreasing and it's losing money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and its flight capacity has decreased by 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial consequences released by the corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to fix Rantier's finance as part of the sale of the airline.
NSA accused "Internal Error" instead of hackers to crash the website
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that due to some technical deficiency, our website had closed for a few hours, not because of hackers, as some people claimed online.
Intelligence Agency said in an email statement, "Ton tonight the NSA.Gov was not reached for several hours, which was due to internal error occurring during the pre-determined update.
This problem will be resolved this evening.
This claim is not true that this obstacle came due to the distributed denial of service [DDOS].
In the evening, the online server trackers had found that NSA's website was closed for at least six hours, and the site for some users is still not reached.
NSA spokesman told ABC News that there was no compromise with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesman said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hectic group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting NSA's website by DDOS attack.
DDOS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such a large quantity until the site is closed due to the server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unfinished and the objective of the attacks is not to distinguish the internal network of the system.
The former most mysterious NSA, which had never been named as an agency, has become a subject of discussion and bitter criticism among the common people due to the presence of events of a large number of foreign and domestic espionage programs in the last months - which has been collectively dismantled by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the NSA files secreted from agency and after revelation.
Due to the growing controversy over the agency, speculation was made after the incident that this incident was a result of targeted cyber operation.
Beautiful expressions were presented in line with the 'One and Dronacharya' story showing reconciliation in the Dwapar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's perspective, a guru is forced to walk on the wrong path in which bars.
The drama was launched jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Cantonment Council Vice President Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh in the Auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College.
The drama showed the similarity of the Dwapar era's Dronacharya and presently the circumstances of a professor Arvind.
Anil Sharma directed Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bisan, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sammy, Shiva Gazala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. performed a magnificent presentation while doing the full justice with the characters.
In the play, the light system was designed by young painter Jitendra C. Raj and set by Hemant Kumar.
After this, various awards were given to the scholars contributing literary, culturally to Apta on behalf of Apta.
It was given to Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and painter Jitendra C. Raj, the Urdu Department of Charan Singh University.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc. contributed to the executive office bearers in making the event successful.
Declining profits of Bombardier as a delivery of aircraft, decline in orders
Canada's airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a decline of 15 percent in net profits on Thursday, in the third quarter of its train unit and lesser air orders and pressure by delivery on contract issues.
Montrically-based Bombardier has also not presented an update on the issues that will release any flight test data for his brand new Series aircraft or its ambitious program to go to commercial service from September next.
About another half months before the first flight of the test plane, it has just been blown three times, the question is whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result fell below forecast and sent to the share toronto stock exchange for more than 8 percent sliding.
Analyzer share with the National Bank Financial, Cameron Dorsen, had reduced its rating to the field demonstration on Thursday, the stock is limited over the next one or two quarters.
"Worker aircraft delivery was mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed with the marginal performance in transport, "Dorsen said in a client note."
We'll get a new order for Bombardier Series as the progress of the flight testing program.
However, if any new orders are not announce in the coming months, it is doubtful that the market schedule will be apprehensive.
BOMBARDIOR hopes the plane family can now suppress it at the short end of the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.

New research has shown that we work with full sincerity and dedication in the morning.
There is no thought of lying to anyone and stealing or cheating.
But as soon as the evening, our mind changes and we keep the ideal on one side and start walking against the rule.
Researchers have given many interesting facts in this research of Harvard University and David Eclus School of Business of Uto.
According to researchers, while not having the tension of work in the morning, we prefer moral values, but honesty decreases due to tiredness or more pressure as soon as possible.
Researchers used two experiments for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on computer screen.
For instance, people had to tell that the point is more on the left or on the right.
The participants were told that if they give false answers instead of the correct answer, they will be given money.
In this experiment it was seen that those who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
At the same time, during the use of people between 12 and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately responded misrepresented by keeping their ointments in mind.
With this, researchers managed to prove that the greed of money does not make any difference to our honesty in the morning, but at the time of evening, we stop paying attention to ethics.
This research has been published in the latest issue of psychological science.

Mr . Big is imprisoned by the lawyer of Cocaine who gives secret information about police investigations
42-year-old Basharat Ditta used to inform the infamous criminal Neil Scarboro
The advocate felt that people could know about the addiction of his confidential drugs .
He was sentenced to three years imprisonment by the Liverpool Crown Court .
The defendant's top lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid of his drug addiction, people would know about his secret addiction, three years of imprisonment.
42-year-old Barashat Ditta, after compromising due to his cocaine addiction, provided confidential information to the infamous criminal Neel Scarboro to investigate his drug trafficking activities.
This advocate, who was named "Bash" and was praised as "Top Brief" by the criminals, was arrested from his house in 2011 after police surveillance operation in Scarboro, which he represented in the last Narcotics trial.
Officials had seen 32-year-old Scarborough keeping three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lankashire, while he went out for Law Society dinner with his colleagues.
After getting cocaine particles in Ditta's hair, her buttock and her credit card, it was found in the investigation that Ditta was a "regular useer" of drugs of A category.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to get illegal information about the arrest of two people from Scarboro and his colleagues.
As part of the main investigation of the heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lankashire, Kumbriya, Mercede, Berkshire and West Yorkshire, all four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time.
There were 32 others, who were sent to jail after the police seized cash worth Rs 1.5 million and cocaine, and more than 200,000 pounds during several raids.
The 42-year-old Ditta used to provide information to the criminals, because he was afraid that people would not know about his cocaine addiction.
Ditta, working in the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackbnard, was facing trouble in the Liverpool Crown Court today after being found guilty in two cases of disrupting the path of justice after three weeks of trial.
He accepted the cocaine in the previous hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer began when the police came to know that he was in regular contact with Ditta on the phone from February 2011 while examining Scarboro.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and keeping more than 60 percent pure drug under the lawyer's bin in Black Golf Glove.
After keeping drugs, Scarboro Ditta was regularly in touch with the phone, which went out for dinner at Black Rovers football stadium, Evolution Park.
On reaching the house, the lawyer came to know that there was a drug and there was a nine-time dialogue between them.
It was heard in the court that after getting a clue of A category drug on Ditta's hair, buttock and credit cards, he was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the trial.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use the cocaine and said that he was talking to the suspect dealer, because he was his client and said that his discussion was a subject of "special privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove his buttock and remove many credit cards, but he was seized, and a sample of his hair was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run his office along with his workplace, and his client used to call him at his house for legal matters.
After telling the main persons arrested, what the detectives knew about them, the court hearing said that Ditta used to call the main people of the drug supply series, some of which he had presented the case earlier.
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said, "The criminal advocate should be well aware of not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his post as a criminal advocate, adding a lot to his particular client.
We are not talking about the common drug dealer, but about a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his talks must have been legal without any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his border of lawyer-client relationship.
As much as possible, he disrupted the investigation of the police so that he could continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was insulting his profession, not honoring his profession.
He made very close to some fixed clients, especially from Scarboro, and he allowed the agreement with his independence.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, whom I am not, and if I want to inform Mr. Scarboro, I do not wait for 15 hours, but I do this immediately."
But after the hearing, the Superintendent of the Lankashire Police Lee Helstead said: "When Mr. Ditta started receiving drugs from organized criminals, at the same time he converted himself into a criminal advocate.
Due to his cocaine addiction, he made excessive agreements and became very weak towards the objectives of the leading members of the organised crime groups who used it to get important information related to police investigations.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of integrity, and trust and self-confidence among people.
Shri Ditta has deceived this belief and tried to survive under his muscle guise.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire examined Shri Ditta, in which he was found guilty of three incidents of keeping cocaine and now interrupting the path of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring criminals to court.
This matter should be warned for criminals that no person is away from the access to the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and bhang.
Thirty-five other members involved in the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug abuses.
On his website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about him, in which he said that his fantasy job will be a lawyer for the death penalty client in the US, Mohammed Ali's dinner being a guest and inequality for his work.

The German media asked the BC to express hope to identify the presence of Licensing Antenna and indicated an exchanged action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
Jems Clepper , director of American national intelligence , emphasized that the United States uses its foreign intelligence capabilities  to steal trade secrets from foreign companies and to enhance American companies their international competitiveness or to enhance the line below them .
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has made a whistleblower, the secret treasury of his secrets started telling American monitoring, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether the director follows his promise or not.
The American National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers Google and Yahoo and Yahoo expressed their fear about state monitoring .
The last thing came when it came to know that Chancellor Angela Markel's phone was bug, probably a decade ago.
If the strongest person in Europe can be targeted, then surely the leaders of the business world are also making possible targets.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think these data will be viable to be used for mutual benefit .
"Germany should be awakened," says Oliver Grn, President of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published by the consultancy of German companies in July, the US has almost become a big risk now like China, when it comes to industrial spying and data theft.
In all the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden, there is no evidence that the US has known the business mysteries of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern over the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union , and they should try to reduce their dependence on the United States .
The leaders of the business world are doubting about this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Hasso Platner, President of the German Trade Software Company SAP, said, "This is no way."
If a strong European IT industry wanted, then he would not have to die 20 years ago.
Everything is concessional in Germany, from coal to cars, farmers.
But IT industry is everything.
Snowden ' s revelations on American technical definition and detective access have proved to be an injury to some companies that earlier believed that the biggest surveillance threat is China .
A major change is taking place in the Cloud Computing Centre where European officials are more aware that the data collected in America is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore has become possible sensitive .
According to a survey conducted by a business organization, Cloud Security Alliance, some 10 percent non-US members canceled the plan to use a US based cloud provider after revelations about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, the co-chairman of SAP, says, "We saw a new question which did not come to the customers a year ago - where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will be physically in that jurisdiction"
Many German officials argue that the latest report is just confirming whether they already knew: that the powerful state wants to steal their most precious mysteries and data and therefore they should be guarded at all costs.
It is not a surprise that there is economic espionage.
This has always happened.
"This is a topic for many years, and through the original discussion, nothing is changed, Kart Bock, Chief Executive of Chemical Producer BAS."
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we also do , because it is in national interest to defend our business .
Corporate leaders are usually not interested in the defense system and it is a benefit for the attacker.
For big companies, the message is being recorded for a long time, whether it is impossible to leave one in the business from home, with ausb stick, or a laptop is unexpected to leave in a hotel room, at least to say.
Members of the board of Frich Hackenberg, car manufacturer Audi, says that this is a one-year-old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings because they can not be used as remote hearing devices
Germany's FB executives advice to consider using simple prepaid mobile while smart phones are compromised on foreign tours due to risk.
Prepaid mobile phones were later thrown.
However, it is a matter of concern that small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, these companies are the best in the global market.
"Small and medium size companies often warn in a report to protect corporate mystery effectively against lack of experience, personnel and financial resources unauthorized access."
The United States has warned other countries about the economic spying of its own companies.
According to the French The Washington Post, the name of American national intelligence in February is named in another tire of criminals involved in hacking, which is behind China with Russia and Israel.
According to the board member of a German Blue Chip Company, when the matter comes to espionage, the French is the worst
In an interview, former head of the Bernard Surcini French Interior Intelligence Agency RI, explains: "Servicemen know well that even if they cooperate in the non-terrorist fight, they spy on their colleagues.
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we also do , because it is in national interest to defend our business .
No one made foolish.
"The parents of Georgia's teenager killed in an accident believe that their son was murdered"
A teenager from Georgia whose dead body was found wrapped in the restling match in his high school gym, believes that his son was murdered, this was stated by the family advocate on Thursday.
Valdosta, GA's Kendric Johnson was found trapped on January 11 in a straightforward match behind the bleachers inside his high school gym.
The investigators of Landes County Sheriff had concluded that Johnson was killed in a "good accident", but the 17-year-old boy's family denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Trump, who presented Kenneth and Jackleen Johnson, told Fox News.com, "He believes that his son has been murdered."
He does not believe in the death of Sheriff in the manner in which he is told.
The sequence said, "He believes that this thing is beyond the logic of physical rule and general intelligence."
They think that this conclusion is an excuse for the protection of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
He said, "He sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned to a body bag."
US Advocate General Michael Mulle said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation about Johnson's death, considering that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the reason for death
Did he kill because of any crime
Muray said this in a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they take us.
My purpose is to bring the truth out.
He said, "I think environmental reasons are present for a formal investigation."
Moore told the reporter that initial dead body tests indicate that Johnson's death was resulting from stable respiratory respiratory respiratory trauma.
According to Mure, there was a different reason for death in a second body test.
He said, "There are many questions which should be answered or confirmed."
Moore also said that if he finds enough evidence to summon a criminal or to investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to do it.
Representatives were not available for comments from the Londage County Sheriff's office when contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the judge of South Georgia ordered the authorities to issue all monitoring videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say that they expect some indications from the video footage that how he died.
CDC issues guidelines for Children for Electricity
On Wednesday, the Disease Control and Prevention Center issued guidelines for controlling children's food allergies in the school.
Such guidelines have been issued for the first time by the US government, as the number of children going to school is increasing due to food allergies.
Now one of the 20 children in the US has food allergies.
CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, cases of food allergies in children have increased by 18 percent.
In this guidelines, it has been reported to the schools how to inform teachers and employees about food allergies of children, and how to handle them in case of any allergic response.
Schools have also been suggested to keep the stock of Appenfrain to face fatal intensity (Anafilaxis) which is the auto-engineer of Appen Brand which is commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, so that the schools can keep the stock of epinephrine in large quantities easily.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It seems that something is kissing in my tongue, "I think there is hair on my tongue, or "My tongue is blurred."
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose sex of their children uncertain
Germany has become the first country of the European Union, which has given recognition to the third gender for children born with unexpected genitals.
Now the newborn children will not be specified in a male or female manner.
According to the new law, parents do not need to declare sex for such children, this law allows them to declare sex "unscheduled" or "unscheduled" on the birth certificate of the child.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on the parents who can take decisions related to gender-specification surgery for newborns and fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to BBC, an intersex person had said after years, "I am neither a man nor a woman.
I will remain wounded, stained pubs made by doctors.
According to estimates, one child out of 2,000 children every year is such that neither the boy nor the girl.
They are intersexes, a part of a group of about 60 conditions, which come under investigation of gender development disorders, is a collective word which is used for abnormal chromosome, genitals or abnormally developed gender.
Maybe Valis Sympsen Intersex.
Sex identification is still not understood properly, but most experts in United States believe that when sex can not be done, it is better to use the best information available for specification of sex and if such a job comes, inspect the psychological and physical development of the child before surgery.
Dr. Jack Dresher, psychologist of New York City, who is a specialist in gender-catching affairs, said that the new law of Germany seems to be "good".
Intersex children create moral confusion.
He said, "Some people are in a state of life and property, for which surgery is needed, but it does not happen with most children.
You can specify sex without surgery, and after that see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a gender will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No person can answer properly about why this happens.
It is a kind of puzzle that why people are gay.
In the report filed before the European Commission in 2011, intersex people have been described as transsexual or transgender people, because their position is not related to gender, but is related to its biological composition, which is neither obviously a man nor a woman but either a joint form of both or any of them is clearly defined.
These features can reflect themselves in secondary gender symptoms like weight of muscles, distributing hair, breast and length primary gender symptoms such as reproductive organs or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provides observations of discrimination in the field of jobs by Intersex and Transgender individuals as well as harassment, violence and biased crimes.
Now there are special camps for non-fair gender boys.
Australia and Nepal have already given permission to adult persons to mark men, women or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Nory became the world's first recognized sex-free person after winning the legal appeal made to keep an unspecified sex status throughout life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the German passport will also have the third specification as an  for interex individuals besides M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed a petition to withdraw gender theory from school books.
US website Catholic Online has also opposed this law of Germany saying, "When the world is going to a state where sex is an option to be chosen, but not sexual activity, we are taking two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction. "
In my land, the mother of the newborn baby also told the baby one that she would like to see the children specified sex at birth.
He said on the website about the upbringing, "In addition to the borders, the upbringing is very stressful, especially if you do not even know what your child's gender is.
Children need stability and determination.
Historically, the children born with both men and women were called hermaphroditis (Ubhilingi), which was in the name of a beautiful Greek god, which was doubling.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered the sex as a slate which could be erased and then written.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they understand that gender-catching is a complex task, and sometimes there may be a mistake by doctors, who do not know what the children will feel about their gender specification when they grow up.
Dresher says, "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called "Manorog Emergency".
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you used to call the surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with unexpected genitals was presented by Dr. John Money of John Hapkins University, who considered sex as unforgettable.
He composed a sex identity word and argued that social and environmental signs - how parents raise the child - interact with the child's genes and hormones and determine whether he should be identified as a man or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, which is known as John John, his principles became disputed.
He advised the parents of a child, who had accidentally gone to sex during the sex sex sex sex, to get the child completely bound and remove her ovary and treat her like a girl.
The dresser said, "Mani presented that case as a successful case of transfer, but it did not happen.
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back into a man and got married to a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
The dresser said that some doctors are still following "this pattern".
But with the arrival of the Internet in the years after the year 1990, the persons passing through these gender surgery started coming out "not happy with the result."
The same case was with 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce of Monatana, who was born with the -Y male chromosome, but his genitalia was unclear.
Doctors did not understand clearly that his penis was small, or his fugitive was big, but he was certain that he could never live a "sensitive life" as a man.
Therefore, after some time after her birth in 1976, the external organs of Bruce and ovary were removed by surgery and her upbringing was done like a girl.
He was given women hormones at the age of 12.
He told ABNews.com, "I knew I'm not a girl.
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, he was supposed to have vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and some disturbances, he demanded medical records.
This led to the horrific truth.
At the time of birth, I was bound - and no one told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, who prevented her body from making adequate testosterone, due to which her genitals could not be developed properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a man again, took the dose of testosterone and removed his breast.
Due to surgery, she became barren.
Today, he explains to people about intersex persons in an organization called Interface Project to normalize their perception.
However, Executive Director of the Legal Group Advocates for Informed Choice, California-based, Annie Tamar-Matis, points out that the law of Germany invites "Chippy and Column".
She says, "Effective people feel that the law of Germany will inspire parents to take quick decisions and specify the child."
We are afraid that it will encourage intervention.
We think it is a better process to specify men or women sex rather than wait.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only estimate.
Tamar-Matis said that his organization supports Australian law because it allows adults to be identified in the third gender.
He said, "The adults should be able to take their own decision regarding statutory gender.
The German law relates to specifying it at birth.
This is not the war fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can take decisions related to their body themselves.
But Pittsburg's breast radiologist Dr. Ellin Baratz, whose daughter has sexual development disorder, and who supports hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the law of Germany will give 'empowerment' to both parents and children.
Baratzi's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but she had a DSD named full Androgen insensitivity symptom.
Since her Androgen was a fault in the secret, the female symptoms were developed in the cat.
There is vagina in her body but there is no uterus or ovary.
Now 29-year-old Kati is married and is a resident in the Department of Pennsylvania University.
Although she is barren, she expects to be a mother through adoption or a guest house surrogacy.
Baratz said, "This law facilitates parents that they do not take any decision in haste.
It gives them time to understand and understand properly by some tests before writing men or women.
In this way, you are fine - raise the child, love the child.
You have a loved child and enjoy it.
We do not need to get such surgery done in haste which can not be returned.
He said, "It brings children in the process of taking decisions and frees the parents from the inspiration because they do not believe that they are recovering."
Finally, the child will determine which sex she is more easier - and it will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

Report: Consider Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times , close advisers of President Barack Obama quietly considered Hillary Clinton instead of Biden for the post of Vice President .
The most remarkable explosion in the revelations is that Mark Halperine and John Helemon share a huge anticipated 2012 campaign Tom, Duble Down: Sports Change 2012.
Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and told on Thursday evening that the top advisers of the president ' s ' business group-secretaries ' and in order to know the polling held in late 2011 , what dumping bidden can help in Obama ' s falling hope of the election again .
According to Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book gives full information in the campaign of the Chief Employees and put the leading bills of the former White House staff for the name, to know what effects the change poll from the Vice President of the former state.
Possible switch was a very safe mystery within the framework of the Chicago campaign and within the Oval Office .
The changes of former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, including just half a dozen President's close consultants, and former White House senior advisors David Oxalrod and David Palufouf - were under consideration.
Duble Down claims that Delle tried to change Biden , despite his personal synergy , alternately before the decision was made , the client ' s ticket would not improve Obama ' s situation .
In an interview with Martin, Dlay has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I kept the whole scene in view, and one of them, it was said to the newspaper.
You remember, when the President was in danger at that time, we were in such a situation, "Pawitzer Christ, what else would we do"
While Dlay told the research as a precaution, Martin had told Endurson Cooper of ENN that the election campaign again invested significantly, how much benefit would this claim find out when the poll was done.
 The campaign does not spend on polling and focused groups like money until they are seriously considering something, Martin said on AC360.
It is unclear, however, did Obama know that his team is looking for a change
Martin told CNN that he asked him to put him, did his boss know about the possible reshuffle
While Daley said that he did not think the president knew about possible changes , the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was possible that Obama knew it .
"Duble Down Definite: Will not answer if Obama reached the desk by doing a political investigation" Martin further said.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought that Obama did not know about Biden Dumping Ticket Research.
"Perhaps, Martin said.

George Caravan : Euro Dissolution gave the option to Scotts
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that as a condition of membership of EU, a free Scotland will be required to join Europe as an independent tourist destination.
Passport control on Barvik and stories about the border of blanket wire on the Hadrian walls.
It is true that the Streetchlide paper describes the potential economic benefits of free travel with the rest of Europe, although it has not been described in Headlines in the predictable manner.
Nor did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time in changing their formal rules as per their requirements.
Since Scotland is no longer a Shagen area, therefore, instead of obtaining whatever Brussels really wants from Scotland, continuous non-compulsion will be affordable exemption for Brussels.
So, then, A-Kahani.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long, it has been accumulated. First of all, I had heard the news of "Independence" about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point lost in repeating this interesting old story.
Anyway, why should the independent Scotland expect Europe's bidding
Why London's Yok should be purchased for Brussels, especially now
There is a real European news: The great plan to organise Europe, after the war, has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
The teams dedicated to oppose the EU in the entire EU or to close Euro as a uniform currency are getting strength.
Even in Germany, the Euroscapitol Alternative for Germany Party - which has been established this year - suddenly received about fifty lakh votes in the federal elections of September, and thus effectively excluded Free Democrats (Equivalent to our Lib Dames).
The plan to build federal Europe has always been domestic opposition.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be a radical changer.
With the strict rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people have to think that the project has gone far away because of the obstacles imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency.
There was not much role of Euro crisis in the high budget deficit of national governments - it was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the Euro system stabilised its members in favor of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency demolition, South Europe finds itself in a deteriorating condition of productivity compared to Germany.
The only way to reduce salaries and public expenditure is to be encouraged by Berlin.
There is deep European productivity sicker than the current budget and currency problems.
To give exemption to French and German energy firms on consumer expenditure - as a result of green energy policies made by Brussels, European Industries double electricity and four times for gas compared to the United Nations.
This pumping cost is a loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even freezing all the wages in the world, European Petrochemicals industry can not be saved from being affected by cheap US shell gas.
As a result, the feeling of rebellion is flaring in the people, especially in France, which was once the main admirer of the EU.
After the war, the top French politicians had seen the EU as a means to control Germany, and to provide Paris equal billing to Washington in the world.
But Berlin does not now need Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, due to which the French economy is staggering.
Results: The right wing of Marine Lee Pen, anti-EU National Front has won the third position by pushing the ruling socialist in the recent by-election.
At present, the Front is the most popular party with 24 percent votes in France - it is a timely warning for the British Labor that they can not believe that the disruption for the left will automatically benefit for the right.
Le Pen is doing with his new fame among the French horses, working class
This team wants to use the EU elections to be held next year in the European Parliament to create anti-EU, anti-currenciplinary factions.
If, as far as possible, anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, such a group can affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My perspective is: Soon the confluence of anti-EU and anti-currenciplinary sentiment in Europe will end Euro.
Euro will not be completely eliminated, but it will reach back to the states like Europe, which will be supported by General De Gaul.
Germany and some of its unique economies can maintain Euro, but France and South Europe will resume their currency.
I expect that the US will keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing close proximity to the US.
However, the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all this
We can choose to remain the area of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better work in the loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-communal nations to work together with other similar thinking countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider keeping our economic freedom following the path of Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland - in particular - has been the most successful anti-political campaign in Europe, which had won a surprising majority in 2011 on the basis of the Tory-Lib Dem Coalition to oppose the deductions proposed by Labor Chancellor Elister Darling.
Voting for independence at this time for Scotland will be a matter of utterance, because in that situation it will have to accept the rules of misuse imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Young people before time: grow faster
Research shows that African-American and hispanic girls get younger age compared to girls of their age.
Physical change doesn ' t mean that youth is near .
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed .
Experts believe that obesity outbreak can be a reason for young age
The case of youth before time is not so effective in boys .
CNN's former correspondent Pat Etherej is a specialist journalist in the health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be worried, if her daughter starts developing breasts and genitals at the age of 7 or 8
In the annual conference of the American Children's Medical Academy in Orlando, Florida this week, Dr Paul Caplovitz made it clear that this initial physical change is common in American girls, it shows a new trend.
Caplovitz says, "I spend many times in giving assurance to the parents - that it usually does not show immediate progress towards the whole youth.
Direct symptoms of development like breasts getting scratched, reproductive organs and hair and physical smell are seen in girls prematurely.
But in the last four decades, there has been a slight change in the age of Rajodarshan (first monthly-dharma).
In United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
When breasts begin to grow , it takes at least two to three years in the first radiation , Caplovitz explains , who are also the writers of the needy guide to deal with this common problem .
The most accurate test of the development of youth is time.
There is debate about what is the beginning of the youth, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8, two are called "ball-grown".
In most cases this process will slow down or stop - whose pediatricians can inspect nearby.
In the event of a faster progress, an endocrineologist may require an investigation so that serious problems like tumors or system can be overcome.
There are treatments to delay premature menstrual cycle and other consequences: premature aging of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and drama as adults.
Resolutions for drug or hormone treatment depend on child age, growth rate, growth rate and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovites are aware of medicines but accept, "Suppressing the youth can raise practical issues, and girls can feel different from their colleagues."
The second big problem can be understood: Parents do not just want their young age daughter to be menstrual-dharma.
Caplovitz said, "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain cleanliness."
A woman whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, recalls, "This was a shock."
Although there were symptoms of this and we talked about menstrual cycle, but it was not emotionally prepared.
He was scared of his school and returned to trouble that in his friends, he first started the monthly religion.
There are many well-known principles about the causes of untimely youth.
Yet, there is no continuous evidence that hormones, chemicals in the environment or sexual oriented messages in the media can be charged in milk or other food items.
boys are also getting young people from time to time like girls.
Caplovites decide the rule that the main reason for this is the outbreak of obesity.
He helped in conducting studies on girls from 6 to 9 years of age in 2001, which connects the fat of the body with the young age.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and hispanic girls have the tendency to get younger girls before their age.
There are many clarifications about this.
At the global level, the replication of premature youth, from economic conditions to weather and genes, seems to be affected by all things.
Other puzzle: Though the boys are getting the faces and the hair of the genitals at a young age, the trend of youth is not as clear as girls in them.
Other doctors attending the AAP Conference supported the complications of the subject.
Even in infants and children, seeing the hair of pimples and genitals has become common.
In Moristoun, New Jersey, child doctor Andocrinologist Dr. Lawrence Silverman says, "We need to be careful about how we identify the actual beginning of the youth."
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child doctor to take opinion about how to talk to their children.
Caplovitz advised, "It may mean talking before the expected time."
If you are calm then your child will usually respond properly.
The girls developing prematurely need to be assured that even though it is happening prematurely but it is part of normal life.

Big orders of jet manufacturers are at stake with controversy for seat width .
This month's Dubai Archeo has started a competition to establish a rhythm for the dispute, for the width of tourist-class seats for long distance flights, among leading aircraft manufacturers.
The dispute is focused on the width of the Economy Class seat in long flights, not always as given by airlines, but whose allotted location has been claimed by the latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company to be the key.
Erbas has hoped to give a detailed seat of at least 18 inches ( cms ) in Economy cobin this week but it should be decided by airlines its main opponent Boeing says .
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when the orders recorded after the 17-21 incident took place to sell to the big version of the twin engine of the long distance arcraft .
How the previous department of the aircraft has been created - especially whether the designs of Mini Jambo Jets are being prepared keeping in mind the claims of more capacity than 9 or 10.
Boeing says it is 777  , which will keep 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 in one line in anonymous department .
Airbus says that while competing with A350, it will take 350 people to the seat left 18 inches and 9 equally kept.
Vehicles often strike trade on technical matters through advertisements in the business press .
Now, Airbus is expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Dubai Archeo with 777 , so is appealing to the public further.
Recently it is being seen that whatever the beginning of the waking war has happened, will you accept it simultaneously in the restaurant showing it to Finsero
Airbus sales chief John Leh is also presenting a long distance flight from "Boeing Regional Turbo" in nectaries.
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way to sit in the plane has not changed.
According to American Health Department data, between the 1970s when Boeing 747 Jambonne defined a long journey, and the average 40-49-year-old American male ke weighed 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American man's waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says it ' s opponent is sticking to a seat concept of 1950 when the new name was the average periphery of Jet set .
Airbus says that he has established the Research Commission, which suggests improvement in sleep quality of an additional inch 53 per cent in the width of the seat.
Boeing disputed the airbus seat measure figures , and said it is not dependent on the manufacturer ' s decision how airlines maintain balance between rent and facilities .
It is also said that research shows that more than the width of one seat depends on the experience of cabin.
Boeing cabin specialist Kent Crawer said that in reality it tells the airlines what they need to do to succeed .
 They do not want to tell us who they have benefits.
They know better their business than anyone else.
This elbow is about the room for the flyers, but it is an issue for the suppliers that it can affect income.
Behind this dispute, the business of at least  700 billion is estimated to be sufficient in the coming decades to tip the scale of US and European exports.
The report of the writer told that for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually an issue of fighting between new jet planes.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that 20 per seat has been efficient in their new twin engine design, compared to 365-seat Boeing 777-300 arre.
The demonstration of Boeing depends on comparatively 10 , 777 , one , original 9 , 777 designs .
The comparison has now been utilised with 10 equal benefits in the unit cost.
Kevin Keinistan, head of Europe's Airbus Passengers Facilitation, says, "This Boeing's aircraft is doing to capture more seats to make our products more competitive."
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat-per row cabin is suggested for the current 777 SC that many passengers are in favor of the dancer layout, which can go along with cheap rent.
Cabin Interior expert My Karbi, founder and editor's runway girl network said that the eighteen-inch seat will be very good for the passengers, but the fact is that this business point of Airbus is operated by the threat of proposal 777.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list to the airlines to choose from the suppliers.
Jet vendors from all over the world also take precautionary measures to check this layouts competition.
While relaxing, all builders are also providing high density layouts for jet planes and low cost air services and regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10-party A350 but says it is not sold yet.
But recently, Airbus stressed on the widespread coffin seats on some of its jet planes to need more cabin facility.
Without the support of other manufacturers of modern jets, there is no possibility of flying on a new industry standard but it can deviate from the wave of 777  sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine can finish the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate the enjoyment of smoking.
The only dose of vaccine was able to keep the rat safe from the addiction of necotyte for the whole life.
Man needs further testing before starting the test, which may take many years, but Professor Ronald Christal of Well Cornell Medical College in New York said that initial signals are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We are very confident that this type of vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers, who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods present in the market in today's time, but they found that their addiction of nicotine is more powerful than these existing methods. "
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which has been prepared to deliver hereditary information for the purpose of creating anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus selectly infects the liver cell, which then starts creating a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies discover any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevents them from smoking in the smoker from summoning nicotine before reaching the brain.
In the test, the rats given vaccines that were later given nicotine, they continued their normal activity.
The researcher says that but the rat who was not given the vaccine was "good", it was an indication that Nicotin had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in a magazine called Science Translational Medicine.
The vaccines of the previous tobacco had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to give doses at regular intervals so that the antibodies level remained, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of new vaccine is expected to be very much, because the liver cell will make antibody factory.
Professor Christol said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe then it can be given to children before the greed of cigarettes, so that they can be saved from the addiction of nicotine.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
He said, "He will know that if he starts smoking again, he will not get any joy from smoking due to nicotine vaccine, which can help in redemption of his habit."
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned of the need to do very much research.

Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to denounce the policy of sea lease on the request of his political guru AD Obide, former South Wales patron AD Obide, who had hidden interest in the government-controlled three lands.
Against corruption, the Independent Commission (IA) on Friday detailed the investigation whether Shri Obid has violated the circulars of the lease policy of lobbying with several State Ministers, where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obid, without tender, were renewed in August 2005 after its expiry of time.
Lin Ashpole, after the evidence given by the former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, the allegation was known to be the hidden selfish interest of Shri Tripodi Shri Obide.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressurized the public tender to start the lease.
The leasewers were against it and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the circular enterprises for the lease, from which Obide earned  2.5 million annually, were renewed from the tender without lease.
Shri Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargah from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favor of the Public Tender.
But he refused to change Mr . Obide ' s request , Mr . Tripodi requested a change in the Government Lease Policy .

I can not remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obide.
Officials say Israeli fighter planes shook in Syria .
Israeli fighter planes targeted Latakia, Syria's port city on Thursday night, a senior administrative official confirmed Fox News.

Foreign employees on 457 visas can pass through " Authenticity Test "
A "Authenticity Test" is being considered by the government for foreign employees on 457 visas, as its aim is to expand a harsh action.
If adopted, this test will be implemented through a criteria created for the purpose of filling up unskilled posts in Australia or preventing 457 to be used for delivering family and friends in a crucial manner.
A government discussion paper was issued today, while condemning the government's words on foreign employees, former Labor MP Maxine Maxine today said that it could inspire Australian neighboring countries.
He told the US India Institute today that "Foreign people are reaching the end of the queue and "With strong rhetoric about the job before Australian people, there is a very unpleasant repetition at a time, while the unions have demanded a safe labor market. "
Historically, it meant that white labour should have been provided protection - and if some people in the area have seen the resounding of that historical evidence, then I would not be surprised.
The discussion letter shows the outline of 12 measures, which was first considered by former immigrant minister Chris Boven.
Immigration Minister Brendan Ocanner, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about smugglers, has implemented five recommended changes, while the remaining are under consideration.
If the "Authenticity Criteria" is adopted, then the visa applicant can be examined whether the nomination is true in such circumstances, in which the nominated person, the person, the person sponsored by the visa, is related to the owner or the person or the personal partner.
Businessmen may need to calculate the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessman who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees, employed hundreds of people.
During this, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of suspicious heart attack after a refugee boat on Christmas Iceland this week.
The nine-year-old son of that person had come to Australia on a trip with him, and after his father's death on Wednesday, his old cousin has tied a dhandhas, who was on the same ship.
Australian officials delivered the person to Christmas Iceland Hospital, where he died.
Studies have been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of Scotland from the US2 Rail Project.
Work by HS2 indicates high speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Barones Cremer said that this project will make Britain one.
Scotland Transport Minister Keeth Brown said that he is very excited by working with the UK government on this project.
The first phase will include the new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
Once the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leads.
In June, the Government revised the cost of construction of high speed link between London and North England from 32. 7 billion to 42.
The British government, which was interacting with Scotland Transport, directed US2 Limited to consider the possibility of improving the railway capacity and travel time for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours or less.
According to Barones Christmas: Our goal for LS2 is a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.
We are moving forward with FS2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities of Britain, including Glassgo and Edinburgh, which will be well connected due to LS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Elister Carmichil: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
For the Scottish government, Keat Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael to return to Scotland in the US2 network.
Shri Brown said, "The high speed rail is likely to have huge economic benefits from Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the entire UK high speed rail.
Therefore, we are enthusiastic to work in the participation of the British Government so that we can examine the options for bringing high speed rail in Scotland, creating profits for all and fulfiling the Glassgo-Adinburg line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I am ready to review the inquiry report with the Ministers of the British Government next year and take a decision together on further action.
Air Electricity Devices Rules will remain effective in Australia
In spite of the steps being taken softly in equipment regulations in the US, Australian air travelers will have to continue to shut down their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the US Air Force companies open to change their processes so that during the important phases of flight, passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their equipment, provided they remain in the climate mode.
Passengers can do this during many flights, but many people do not like to be able to fly and reach their e-book etc. while landing.
Australian Air Force Services Companies are considering this decision, according to which US Air Force Services Companies will have to work very much to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they do not have any immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Security Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but emphasized that restrictions on the use of power equipment in important phases of flight in Australia are still effective.
At present, LASA does not have any specific regulation controlling the use of power equipment in the aircraft, the Authority said, "This issue comes under regulations, according to which the airline service operations companies have to ensure that the security system is always fully maintained, and the passengers have to follow the security instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who is already negotiating with LASA about expanding the use of his in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but he asked to take further action on the instructions of the regulator.
The spokesman said, "We will welcome the review by LASA in the matter of allowing the use of power equipment, because we really think it will give better experience to the customers, because now we (wireless in-flight entertainment) is in our planes. "
uantas said that it will follow the current rules now.
He said, "According to our current policy, electricity equipment can not be used while flying and landing, and we do not have any immediate plan to change it."
LDA decisions apply to American allergies.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit the passengers and we will definitely consider the decisions of the LAAA and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different on each US Aircraft Service Company and depend on the age of their aircraft.
Air Services Companies will need to prove that their aircraft can afford radio dissemination from mobile devices, as well as to amend their rules books, training materials, carey-on-baggage programs and brief details to the passengers.
LDA said that after the verification of the bearing of their aircraft by the airlines, they will allow passengers to use all the heights, light weight electrical equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will direct the passengers to stop their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment under the seat safely or in the upper coaches while flying and landing.
Ponbrokers silver due to the hardships felt by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga is taking cash by giving her gold bangles, rings and bowls to pay her daughter's school fees in Ponshop at Bendemier Shopping Center in Singapore.
Mrs. Amirthalinga said, "My husband and I have recently purchased the house, so all our money is trapped in it.
She says, although she earns  3,000 Singapore dollars (US2,400) as an administrator, her husband also works, but the monthly income of the family remains insufficient.
In fact, there is a demand in parts of South-East Asia where domestic credit is increasing - Valumex, where they are doing their transactions, became the third ponshop to be listed on Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pledge of jewelery is not the only way to get cash - 1,300 Singapore Dollars in case of Ms. Amirthalinga - but almost as cheap as the unsafe bank loan.
Generally, Ponbroker in Singapore takes 17 per cent interest per year, which is slightly higher than 15.4 per cent introduced by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local borrower who has a branch in the same shopping center.
However, the Ponbrokers have the benefit of checking credit or not required proof of salary, and can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people are turning to the ponshop in this area due to the increasing livelihood expenses by the families and the difficulty faced by the domestic and consumer credit growth.
After a strong growth of five years after the global financial disaster, and after cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, families with low and medium income are approaching the ponshop to meet their requirements.
This week, Rating Agency, Standards and Pearls, primarily due to increasing hostage (Mortgage), described domestic profit as a risk factor for Asian banks' credit.
He said that in Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in proportion to GDP.
Malaysia is the highest in this list with 80 percent of GDP, while it was 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged lightly from technology recession this week.
On Thursday, the data has shown a continuous reduction in export recession and consumer demand.
In the Malaysian Bank, CIMB, economist Sang Seng Woon said, "The point of deciding is that people coming from the middle to the lower class will try to increase their income in every possible way.
In the last two years, historically high prices have motivated people to keep personal wealth undermined because they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the values of their family ornaments.
70 percent of the items dropped in 200 pioneer outlets of city-state in Singapore are gold.
People are saying, "The sense of gold is good, let's keep the grandmother's sleeping chain, and take it back next month."
The largest ponshop operator of Thailand, Ezimani, has seen 20 increase in the number of customers using their outlets in recent months.
There is so much increase in the mortgage business that 15 others like this in Valumex and Singapore are planning to expand in their neighborhood, Malaysia, where it has four shops, but are planning to expand outside Asia, Valumex executive director Yah Lee Ching says.
The company will financing it, using 60 percent of Singapore's  66 million in the listing this week at Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount launders (lenders) have been criticized due to high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that not only gets affordable rate compared to other creditors, but it does not directly increase the loan.
She says, the customer keeps the things that they already have, and redeeming personal assets does not increase domestic debt.
Social acceptance of ponbroking is increasing to get short-term and safe financial assistance.
It is not that only financially weak people use ponbrokers.
In Singapore, wealthy persons also use Valumex outlet, they keep the gold bar or rollex watches, which can get cash payment up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers from all sections of society.
Ms. Yah says, "This includes rich persons who need loans for a short time for business enterprise or investment, or small business who need to meet their cash flow requirements.
Sometimes they need money only in a very short time.

325 million rescue package for TAG's health
The Union Government has stressed that strict conditions are also associated with the defense package of  325 million for the health system of Tasmania becoming sick, which will ensure that the state government can not destroy the fund.
Union Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth, the old population of the island state, high rates of genetic diseases and the system's borders are taking immediate action to solve the current crisis.
The decision to financing during four years was taken after consultation with the Government with Andrew Wilki, independent MP of Tasmania.
Ms Plibersek today said, "The government has brought emergency rescue packages, which we believe it will solve the special challenges faced by the state.
325 million dollar packages include  31 million alternate surgery schemes.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving the previous collected cases.
It also includes funds for better care after walk-in clinic, hospitalization, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of individual electronic health recording system in local hospitals.
Ms Plibersek said, "This investment is in line with the best ways I have been told to improve the health system of Tasmania by leading doctors.
The Minister emphasized that the Government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability governance.
To achieve Commonwealth Fund, the state will have to maintain the current financing level, and report every month where extra fund is being spent.
The Commission of three members will be constituted to ensure effective and efficient service delivery by the State.
Shri Wilki said that 325 million will not be very high until actual improvements are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more statutory level.
Yet, he praised the government for reacting to his request for immediate assistance, which he brought to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
Shri Wilki said, "I hope the federal aid package will prove to be very helpful in separating the State Re-Public Health System from a crisis-affected list.
According to the state government, these additional alternate procedures will prefer the recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement is "Band-Ed solution".
He told ABCTV, "We are here because the Labor State Government has taken  430 million in its health system."
You cannot believe that the State Government has taken about half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth has given 300 million dollars as good news day.
Shri Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibersek be guaranteed that one of the defence packages will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.

The surveillance group said that Syria has destroyed its ability to create chemical weapons
On Thursday, the group monitoring said that Syria has destroyed important tools to create chemical weapons and poisonous gas war materials, while a fierce conflict emerged in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the place where toxic agents are considered.
At the same time, on Thursday, the Syrian movement group has said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian civil war started almost three years ago.
This announcement of the Chemical Weapons Prohibition Organization has taken place one day before the last date of November 1 .
Which the Heg-based organization had fixed Dumscus to destroy all chemical weapons manufacturing units and toxic gases and to destroy or make the machinery used to fill the war material.
Mainly the initial stage of destruction is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious event, aimed at destroying all chemical weapons of Dumscus by the middle of 2014.
Deleting the device means Syria can not now create new chemical weapons.
However, Dumscus still has to destroy the weapons and collections present.
It is believed that Syria currently has 1000 metric tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including muscle gas and nerve agent surine.
Britain's Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that this announcement took place when the struggle in Safira city increased on Thursday, about which experts believe that it is the chemical weapons production unit and the collection center.
The movement group, which has detailed the number of dead through the movement network in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He has said that 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children, are included.
On behalf of the government, it has been said that 29,954 President Bashar Assad is a member of the army, 18,678 fighters fighting in favor of the government and 187 Lebanese Hizbullah is an extremist.
It also said that there are 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters in the dead, many of which are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN expressed the estimate that about 100,000 people have died in the ongoing struggle since March 2011.
It has not updated data since then.
Due to this struggle, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Asad's military team continued to war with rebels for several weeks in Safira, many of whom were related to al-aeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observer said that people have been casualties on both sides, but did not say anything clearly.
This war reflects the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have a mission to end toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in very short time.
In a statement to the OPCW working with the United Nations, it was said that its party is now satisfied and has confirmed - and all the declared important production and mixing equipment of Syria have been seen in destructive form.
It also said, "There is no plan for inspection activity.
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said that they had completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 out of 23 centres declared by Dumscus.
Inspectors said that they were not able to go to two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers have been sacrificed and ... the chemical weapons products kept there were delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira was one of the two centres where OPCW inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has presented a plan for the overall destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of OPCW next month.
In a comment issued by OPCW, Director General of the Group, Mahit Ujumku said, "I salute the determination and courage shown by you in fulfilling the most challenging mission made by this organization so far.
This three-year-old civil war is mainly the struggle between Asad's government and its security forces, which include members of Shia Islam, besides the group, and the rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, Abservatory chief Rami Abdurrahman said that there was a strong explosion in the air defense center in Latakia, the coastal area of Syria.
He said that the reason for this explosion is not known yet.
Police have recovered photos of fake registry, fake stamps, laptops and fake registry from the possession of the accused.

After this the accused used to sell land on fake papers for crores of rupees.
At the same time, these fake papers used to take loans.
After this, the real owner of the land used to keep the police and administration dashed.
The accused who made the fake registry kept a special eye on the land of NRIG.
Because there is no one to look after NRIG's land.

Police Commissioner Gill told that the accused told in the interrogation that they have so far prepared fake registry around 150.
According to the police, cases of fraud and theft are registered against gangster Rajiv before.
Angered on the conviction of the bomb blast in Bali
Families and relatives of 202 people killed in the bomb blast in 2002, expressing resentment over the punishment given to the plotter of the bomb blast, said that Omar Patek should face the firing team.
Patek, who ran as one of the most wanted persons in South-East Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years for his role in building explosive devices used in the bomb blast.
If parole is given, it can be released in 15 years.
45-year-old Umar was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many were injured.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bomb blasts in the church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, although they could also demand that the master who made the bomb was the death penalty of this person called the infamous "destructive person".
This decision renewed the painful memories of the woman living in Parth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter in a devastating attack by Patech and her co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his tears, he said that Patek should have been given a death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Courtin told the AAP, "He should be put in front of the firing team."
I have to live every day without my grandparents and my daughters.
After 11 o'clock in the night on October 12, 2002, the club's nomination was deleted after the bomb blast loaded in the van standing outside the entire club.
Peter Hughes was in the padies bar just 20 seconds before the blast of the bagpack filled with explosive material by suicide attackers.
As a result of the bomb blast, he went to a month-long coma and died three times while living on life-saving equipment.
Shri Hughes says that Patek should have been given the same sentence, which was responsible for the massacre, three other members of the Jemmah Islamiah terrorist group - Amroji, Mukhalas and Imam Samudra - who were awarded four years ago.
In fact, this person should be given death penalty before anyone else.
Look, there is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding innumerable people, it is not enough to get a 20-year sentence.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of Bali bomb blasts.
He was saved from being caught for nearly a decade, but in January 2011, Pakistan was arrested in Abbottabad, where the US army had killed former al-aeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had presented the evidence that the report showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet the bill transaction in an attempt to re-establish contact between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al aeda.
Ms. Courtin says, "He did not surrender.
Even today, it is not really sad to hurt so many people.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by functions in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Courtin said, "This year there will be lots of tears.
Still, Patek can appeal against his sentence.
FAA: Aviation Travelers can now use Gazettes in the aircraft (but can not call cell phones)
The air travelers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, movies, music, but will not be able to talk to their cell phones - this is subject to highly predicted new guidelines issued by the federal aviation administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, FAA administrator Michael Hurta said that how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
The airlines will have to show how their aircraft fulfil new guidelines and update the rules for collecting training books and devices of their crew members to show the guidelines.
FAA has said that it has already received schemes from some airlines to expand the use of Portable Electronic Device on the aircraft.
Delta and Jetblue are among those airlines who have already submitted the schemes.
FAA said in a statement, "Based on the status of the plan, we can soon accept the extensive use of electronic device.
At present, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft is closed.
They are expected to reach the height of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and do not start them until the captain is allowed.
Passengers are expected to stop their device again while landing on the plane, and do not start it until the aircraft is completely landed.
The FAA said, under the new guidelines, such airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic interruption can allow their passengers to fly by planes, landing by planes and use the device at the time of taxising.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft which have been revised in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at a higher height are expected to fulfill these norms.
Laura Glading, President of Association of Professional Flight Attendant, welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work together with airline companies to do so - then it will be a win for both sides."
When this issue comes, we have been bored while feeling like "Hal Monitors".
The agency said that but surfing by connecting Internet at a height below 10,000 feet, email exchange, sending or receiving messages or downloading data will still be restricted.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in the airplane mode.
So there will still be no talks with friends, the online scrabble-like game, which is related to the famous incident is that when the actor Alex Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while staying at the door in 2011, and when he refused to stop the device, the American airlines dropped them off the plane.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still be collected because their boom will cause the other person to be hurt in the cabin.
Cellphone calls will continue to be banned during the flight.
The regulatory right related to the phone call is with the federal communication commission, not with the FAA.
While flying and landing the aircraft, FAA can remove restrictions on some electronic devices.
Last month, Mark Rosenkan, National Transport Security Specialist of National Transport Security Board, CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered to be risky.
Rosenkar said, "Sell phones are actually a serious issue, but not because they can create obstructions in navigation related devices, but also because they can create obstruction in cell phone towers when they are in the air. "
In order to investigate this issue, the Industry Advisory Committee constituted by FAA has recommended last month that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has been increasing in recent years to reduce the ban from their use.
Analysts like Sen Claire MacCaeskilk, D-M have said that there is no valid security reason for prohibition.
It is becoming even more difficult to enforce these restrictions because the use of the device is omnipresent.
Some studies also indicate that about three-thirds of the passengers forget or ignore the instructions to close their device.
FAA started restricting the use of electronic devices by travelers in 1996, when the report of interruption in navigation and communication equipment was received by travelers due to carrying FM radio and high-tech gadgets at that time.
The new airlines are more dependent on the electrical system than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by FAA to resist electronic intervention.
Airlines have been proposing use of Wi-Fi at cruise altitude from passengers for many years.
The aircraft revised for Wi-Fi system is also more resistant to interruption.
Hurta said that most airlines companies should meet the eligibility norms for more use of electronic devices under new guidelines.
Today's electronic device emits very little power radio transmission compared to the previous generation electronic device.
For example, e-readers, there is absolutely nominal transmission during the page reversal.
But the transmission is strong while downloading or sending the data by the device.
Amazon.com is also among those who favor the passengers to reduce the restriction on the use of the device.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their entire kindle e-readers in the airlines and blown them up to test problems but there was no such problem.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed similar feelings about the risk of using the device.
The Dugals Kid of the National Aviation Passenger Association said that he believes that the disruption from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that there are reports described by the pilot only in support of disruption by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, members of the committee recommended that the FAA pilot should allow that they order passengers to stop the device while landing in less visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and has called them a common knowledge facility for those travelling in the latest round of technology.
The CEO Roger Do of the US Travel Association said that we are happy that FAA has recognized that passengers traveling with joy, are not incompatible with rescue and security.

The bird was left back to the jungle by air transport to protect from the North C rig
The bird found on the North C Oil Ring has been released back from the coast by air transport.
The bird named Water Rail was sent to Abardin by helicopter before the Scottish SPLA returned to his rescue center in Aloa.

Before leaving, the water rail was healthy and tendered.
Are the upper class of Europe ready to do business with Britain
In April, the Business for Britain was launched and it was agreed to bring the business together and determine what we want to see in our relationship with UK employment and prosperity manufacturer EU.
For this, we organized the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders and asked them what their ideas are about Britain's business with the EU.
U-Gov took into consideration 1000 business leaders, representatives of UK's business size, regions and locations.
The conclusions of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We found that a large part of the businessmen now want to export outside Europe, and focus on those countries which are becoming modern and increasing, while the EU member countries are becoming dynamic.
They want the government to give priority to new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, and not in the long-term and evil process of improving the mysterious institutions of the EU.
When asked about their views from monopoly regulations to product laws such as specific policy areas, most business leaders believed that control of these decisive qualifications should come back to the Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, the businessmen say that the price of the regulation of Brussels is far more than the profits of becoming part of Europe's business sector - even the huge businessmen who traditionally favored European companies, 40 percent of them agreed on this.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that a large part clearly seeks to move forward on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with Britain, EU.
The conclusion, which was seen at the levels of the leading business groups, showed that the businessmen are inspiring a "sufficient transformation" which will refund its lost power to the UK.
Its price is very high - Treaty Transformation for Britain and the issue of getting a better deal has changed 16 percent of the vote in favor of sustaining the EU.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: This survey tends to support his plan to negotiate the terms of UK membership in UK, EU.
It also demonstrated that the businessmen expect to revive a meaningful change in the current power balance in favor of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming compulsory at a very fast pace, because it is moving forward towards Eurozone, affiliated economy and the Fiscal Union.
Priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the conclusions of our survey show that it means a new focus on business and a fundamental change in the regulation of Brussels.
Gazprom's Alexie Miller launches a new round of pipeline in Bulgaria
The head of the Gazprom said that the start of the construction of South Strim Gas Pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the beginning of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today is a historic event: Construction started on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gas Pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe, which was stated in a statement on Thursday by Gejprome Chairman Alexie Miller.
This project is a major element of energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will provide diversity in Russia's export routes in Europe.
Officials said that a dispute related to the contract between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas is for Europe, provides a risk for traditional routes.
Miller said that a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geo-political risks associated with the transit countries are eliminated forever.
After the operation of this entire project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at the rates relaxed from the South Stream.
Gajprom said that construction should be started in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
This pipeline has been designed for the annual capacity of 2. 2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Prior to allegations against Jonathan Lord, two employees of YMCA accused of sexual crimes, Royal Commission hearing
Prior to the charges against the Kairingbah Child Care Employee Jonathan Lord in 2011, two employees of YMCANSW have been accused of sexual crimes.
But in his statement before the commission, he said that "It has never come to the notice of child sexual harassment within its organization, it was told to the commission."
Chief Executive Officer Philip Green was asked about the matter, in which an employee of YMCA was accused of child pornography crimes, and another case in which YMCA Carringbah Jim Instructor was accused of sexual crime against children living in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare, who helped the commission, said that he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also acknowledged that the statement of YMCA before the Commission has been done that the outer investigation of the YMCA has been done and he has found the YMCA at the forefront of child safety.
The evidence before the Commission is that the YMCA was notified and received the second best rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community (DoT) quality audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the management, including me, has failed due to appointing the Lord, and failed to ensure that the employees are clearly aware of their obligations related to informing child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted for sexual crimes with 12 children during a two-year tenure in YMCA.
He was given a prison sentence for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare refused to suggest that there was a cultural problem in YMCA, due to which the employees did not inform the Lord of child safety violation.
Employees gave the evidence that saw about the violation, in which Lord spent time alone with the children, personally observing them, sitting in their lap, saying that he loves them and play them on his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the supervision of the Lord, had said for child safety training, because he was worried about his behavior, testified that YMCA, who supervised the Lord, was very threatening and difficult to meet most of the time.
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that he was not easier to give information above his managing.
He said that, but his friendship with Lord misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his perspective to the YMCA NSW Mandal that "Jonathan Lord was about not giving the text to the organization".
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the privacy agreement by the employees immediately after the charges were brought out was done by Lt Gen Lum Whitele, General Manager, WMCA.
He said that its purpose was to avoid the combination of evidence, but it was not "excited and executed correctly."
Stephen Smallbon, Special Professor of Child Sexual Exploitation of Griffith University, said that during the work of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011, YMCA NSW was not a safe organization.
He said that there were "worst problems" in the appointment, analysis, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been postponed till December 20.
Blair says they want to return to Britain
Tony Blair said that he would like to be the Prime Minister of Britain again - but he believes that there is no possibility of returning.
In an interview on the occasion of his fifth anniversary of farewell from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving the post in June 2007 as a leader, Mr. Blair refrained most of his comments from discussing British politics to a great extent, keeping foreign affairs and representatives of the Middle East Region.
Asked whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair was presented by the Evenging Standard newspaper in London saying, "Yes, of course, but it is not likely to happen, so ...
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When a crowd of experts who performed the horse for the best horse in Cardif was gathered, they knew that it would be a challenging competition.
But no person was ready for three-year-old Fanton Kirkland.
Just a few months away from taking up his first step, this young child and his son-in-law, Tattu Tafi of Shetland, easily completed three phases and won the top award - he left behind his 30 adult rivals.
In the annual competition organized by the Suniback Equatorium Centre at Rudri near Cardiff, a pair of undivided pairs that have been lengthy - were very much appreciated for the show, behavior and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful ballar hats, she shook her flat hat on Alhar angle and made her two-year toffee a ring.
The decision makers praised Fenton for their natural skills to control which are far ahead of his age.
And Toffee gets the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Toffee was given to Fenton in his third birthday as a gift in March last year, and since then he has practiced with this Tattu of Shatland daily.
Her 30-year-old mother Dona said: "Fanton and Toffee are a magnificent couple.
He had to face challenges from all the candidates, but both of them won gold cups and roses.
This was the second time when he participated in a competition with Toffee, and we all are very happy about his victory.
The most different in this colorful land, he all felt so amazing that they wanted to photograph with him.
This young child of Nantiglo village near Ab Well, South Well, is walking on footprints of his Anti-Sharron Havelis, who has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Smt. Havels said: The entire location was full of enthusiasm, and every person was celebrating happiness and playing the plate.
He was running on the sand in the entire colorland, and despite looking so small, he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is crazy of animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens whom he cares.
The way he has started, he will be in the best horse exhibition of the year long ago and I am confident that he will perform very well.
An annual horse exhibition spokesman said, "Fanton's age is only three years, but he has to control his tattu.
They are very good pairs.
The decision makers gave marks in view of the methods of performing Fenton and Toffee and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw a good team work between Tattu and his rider - the best in Fenton and Toffee Ring in this case.
I am confident that Fenton's dear clothes have helped him, he was actually looking very different.
Chinese newspaper arguing will be revived
A Chinese newspaper, which had appealed an appeal on the face page to leave a reporter convicted of defamation, will be restored, a press regulator said this.
Gwangjo's newspaper New Express had given a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yangjou.
But thereafter, Mr. Chain accepted the television that he had taken a bribe to write a sort of news about partially owned company of the state.
The regulator said that now the new express has to go through complete improvement.
"Sudhar's order came from Gwangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A primary investigation showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a lot of false news about the listed company umlayan during the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "Editorial Management of New Express was unorganized."
He said that it had decided to set up an administrative punctuation by canceling the license of "Chen Yongjau" reporter.
It had instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete improvement of the New Express, to investigate the responsible people responsible for it in the New Express and to immediately amend the New Express leadership team.
Mr. Chain had written several articles in New Express, which blamed financial irregularities in a construction-building company called umloyen.
After being prohibited, his newspaper published two page appeals for his release, and said that he supports Mr. Chain's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chain came to the state television and accepted writing and publishing false stories for money.
He told the state circulator CCTV that "I have damaged Jumalian as well as the entire news muia industry and its ability to win people's trust in this matter."
I did this mainly because I was greed for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
After Mr. Chain's forgiveness, the New Express issued a page forgiveness in which he said that it had failed to examine his report properly.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have accepted the defects broadcast by TV.
Experts say that from time to time, the blame is strongly acknowledged, despite this, in the late of this year, a law had banned the authorities from binding them to blame themselves.

US-Maxico Drug Tunnel found its own railway
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between USA and Mexico has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
US officials have described the tunnel of four feet three feet as one of the most complex secret routes discovered so far.
The tunnel is equal to the twisted length of about six football pitch, which connects the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico and San Digo, USA.
This area is full of similar warehouses, which makes it easier to hide the truck being filled with drugs.
Officials said that it was closed before passing a drug from the tunnel.
According to the court's records, officials have seized eight and a half tons of Maryjuana and 327 pound cocaine in connection with the search of tunnel.
Three persons, whom officials told that they were working as drivers, were accused of being kept Marizuna and cocaine for the purpose of distributing them.
If convicted, they can be punished from 10 years imprisonment to life imprisonment.
Smugglers in Nogales, Erizona, take advantage of huge underground drainage canals.
This tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Digo since 2006.
After the Marijuana Crop of Central Mexico in October, some of the largest tunnels have been discovered, which presents the enabled challenge of drug mafia groups to speed up the products to consumers.
In 2010, officials found a route of about 700 yards decorated with the rail track, which was spread from a household chemistry in Tijuana to San Digo warehouses.

Tax on foreign assets will end London's artificial status
The Finance Department has made provisional calculations of CGT measures, but is waiting for the final decision from Mr. Osborne, who presented stamp duty at a rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than 2 million pounds in the budget of 2012, and those who prefer to keep houses in a company instead of a separate person.
The stamp duty received from residential assets in Westminster and Kensington and Chellesa cities in the year 2012 was 708 million, which is already more than the joint gain of Northern Ireland, Wells, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and Hambur.
Shri Kuk said, "After the increase in stamp duty of high value houses and the Associated Anti-Avoidance Legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is a fairly low tax on high value property, which has no relation with the effect of the old council tax system.
He added , But this step has made some foreign investors silent in buying wealth in London and can make it unwilling to sell existing owners .
Primary Property, wealthy South-West London has witnessed a growth of 11. 8 percent in the top 5 to 10 percent of the Housing Market, which is spread from Phulham to Vimbaldan last year.
According to Saviल्स's research, the prices of central London continued to grow 5.6 per cent per annum, but it seemed to be slightly lower than the growing "Gharelu Bazar", as the city's southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent).
Scientists have highlighted the subject that what is the relationship between the dog's tail movements and his mood.
Last research has shown that happy dogs move their dust more towards the right (with the dog), while restless dogs mainly move their tail to the left.
But now scientists say that companions can identify this micro difference of tail and express their reaction on it.
This study has been published in Journal Current Biology.
Neuroscientist Professor Georgia Vellertigura from the University of Trainto said, "In men, it all knows that the left and right part of the brain is involved in the excitement that creates positive or negative feelings."
Here we have tried to see it in other species too.
He told that in dogs like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the movements of the left hand and the opposite order, and two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To know more about how dogs respond to unilateral shaking by other dogs, researchers monitored animals watching other dogs' films.
He measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We will probably not take much time to understand why their dust moves on one side and sometimes on the other side.
Prof. Vellertigura said, "We presented dogs with dogs' films - in the shadow painting to deal with other issues in the realistic version or confusing, and we could see the tail movement and present the tail more left or right. "
When the animals saw an emotional dog shaking their tail on the right (with the dog) they were completely comfortable.
But when he saw the tail turning towards the left (with the dog again) in the direction, his heartbeat increased and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellertigura, he does not think the dogs were deliberately interacting with each other through these movements.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their experiences that they should be worried about what action and not on whom.
He said, "If you have met many times with other dogs, and if they constantly shake their tail on one side, then it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you respond on the basis of that experience. "
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about animal sentiments to owners, veterinary doctors and trainers.
Fellow, guest of the University of Veterinary Sciences of the University of Bristol, John Breadshaw, specialist of dog behavior, told that this is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for dogs or not.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that when dogs look at an aggressive dog, they turn their heads on the left and rotate their heads on the right.
In other research of the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, "Unlike the Italian study - when the robot dog's tail was moved to the left, instead of being restless, it was more likely to reach it."
He said that this difference was because in different studies dogs were not fully aware of animals or robot dogs in films.
He clarified that the study of the way dogs respond to the real dogs can help in this.
"When there is a lot of evidence from different breasts that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still available - and dogs are not exceptions in this case, he said.
However, seeing the easily recorded behavior of them, it seems that we will probably not take much time to understand why their dust moves on one side and sometimes on the other side.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make the new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals, Catholic Church consists of supreme categories of priests, whose post is below the pop, and these people choose the pop, so French will finally represent the first group of their individuals who will ultimately help their successor.
There are currently a total of 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinals are not allowed to participate in the Pope elections - they come in the group of 120 cordial electors.
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lambardy said that before the celebration of promoting new cardinals, the meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, which is called Pope-Sabhi.
Lombardy said, "Pop Francis has decided to announce its decision to organize the Pope-Parliament in February so that it is easier to plan other meetings with the participation of Cardinales from different countries of the world."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February there was a possibility of reduction in the number of cardinal electors.
He said that in general, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, the more cardinals, and according to their wishes, announce the name of cardinals over 80 years of age.
Valero said that the next year's Pope-Sabhi will be important, because this will be the first Pope-Sabhi after Francis was elected in March this year.
At present, there is a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
He said, "It will be interesting to see if the new pops are nominated from the rest of the world to reorganize the balance."
Forty percent Roman Catholics in South America, but their number in Cardinals is very low.
Cardinal Council by Frances - which is a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose work is to find ways to improve the church, will also be the first cardinals selected after being formed.
Prior to this, the pop used to decide all things on its own.
Valero said, "Now France has chosen these eight cardinals to help him."
He said that "It is possible to ask for advice from Francis Cardinals."
But we have not been in this situation before - it is absolutely new.
Valero said that usually Pope gives the post of cardinal to Bishop of big places, but France was surprisingly surprising - so we do not know whose names they will declare.
GM calls back pickup trucks in US to correct the seatback
According to an information from US auto security regulators on Friday, General Motors Company, its entire new 2014 Sheverley Silverado and GMC Sera pickup trucks, about 19,000 trucks have been called back to correct a reduction in the seatback.
There may be a reduction in the system of moving the front seat in some trucks.
As a result, the Sangh failed to comply with the auto security standards about seatback, head restraint.
According to an information posted on the National Highway Traffic Security Administration's website, "If the vehicle is trapped from the back, it is possible that the head resistant can not protect the driver properly, which will increase the risk of injury."
The models called back were built between August 1 and September 10.
GM trucks were launched in June and after the insolvency renewal of 2009, it reflects the most important vehicle launch for the top US automaker.
GM had told the truck owners about this defect in the late October.
The NSTMA could not review the notification letter due to the 16-day government prison, which had disrupted the increase in auto sales in October.
GM said on Friday that the sale of silver and sera trucks which were redesigned for the year 2014 model year increased by 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 silver and 16,503 sera pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, the share of GM in the New York stock exchange was 1.4 percent.
Obama's voters scream
I voted twice over Obama
They say that Obama's great efforts have been interrupted due to the policy of blockade of GOP.
The preventive policy can not excuse Obamacare website's problems, drone attacks
Obama reminds the 2008 campaign of what could have happened .
Nathaniel P. Moris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
Nowadays I am reading very sad books.
This is a book about which I feel that this second year will enhance my zeal during the medical school depression and woke up the rays of hope in me.
Its name is the courage to win, and it is a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I get rid of my patients' slips at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a period in which politics motivated millions of people and speeches could stop your breath.
Elections proved unilateral, and news speakers had stopped to show the historic significance of that time.
My classmates were blessed with joy, and my parents saved every news paper.
A team of young visionary persons was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
During Obama's becoming President in 2008, he had 82 percent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of hope - they feel a distant remembrance, a sad remembrance of the lost opportunities.
After the voting was done for the first time by me, there was real change.
Simply, none of these could imagine.
I credit Obama with many achievements, from the Fordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our army from Iraq, "Do not ask "Do not ask" until Osama bin Laden is killed."
Apart from this, I believe that the policy of anti-partisan opposition has prevented many efforts to move forward in our country: including immigrant reforms, public options for healthcare, shutting down the base on Gwantamo Be.
But innumerable times in which I take the side of the Obama administration before my colleagues and colleagues, the answer ends to me, which I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
The protest policy of Republicans is not the answer to the spying of foreign leaders, nor is the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It can not respond to the National Security Agency collecting data about the private life of ordinary American citizens nor can it respond to the prosecution of people who expose the wrongdoings of the government.
It can not tell the reason for the murder of Anwar L Avalaki without trial, nor the public funds and expenditure limits that are reduced during the President Campen.
It can not answer the findings of the report, which says that efforts by the White House to silence the media have been the most aggressive since the nixon administration.
And most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website even after three years of the signing of the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know whether I had hoped for it.
If at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the governance system could constitute a political campaign to bring it forward.
It is evident that the elected office is not an ancient route, because anti-political parties and memorable incidents such as the New Town massacre will shape our public discussion.
Still, the examples I have given above, they mostly appear to be elected by the administration.
This thing troubles you most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was thrilled by his candidature.
Mitt Romany presented a confusing and uncertain option, which did not seem like deciding his policies or his post.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which will be free from the pressure of future elections, will fulfill those hopes about which we have been hearing for a long time.
Yet, while Obama's transmission rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return in 2008 through that book.
Seeing him, I remember their missing promises.
In this week, a part of the book was reading, which describes how Clinton was suffering a major loss due to Obama in the Pennsylvania Primary.
In a Post-Martum Camppone Meeting, he spoke to his subordinate staff that they need to return to the track and remain verified on their objectives.
He said, "I want to get my mosao back.
We should remember who we are.
Today, after five years, I cannot even agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are from Nathaniel Moris.

It is true that our work can not be done without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for living, but it is not in our interest to accept everything.
We celebrate Krishna Triodshi of Kartik month Dhanteras.
Dhanteras is worshiped by the god of wealth Kuber and death god Yamraj.
Wealth is an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good.
Good sense is our feeling towards money.
The money that has been used for the welfare of humanity can not be more valuable than that, but the money that has become the cause of egoism has no meaning.
We earn money with sacred purpose and spend it with sacred purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the family's maintenance.
Some part of it should also be the spirit of spending on society, but the instinct of unnecessary collection or earning money destroys our discretion, personality.
The feeling of donation should always be in mind.
One part of the money given by you can also be the basis for the livelihood of someone.
We all should think for many people living in the society in a terrible absence.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the menstruation of life.
All people wish for wealth and yes and they also get wealth and yes according to their Purusharth.
The same wealth and wealth are sustainable with which respect is connected.
No matter how rich a criminal can be, he can neither consume it properly nor can any other benefit.
If someone else has money then do not insist on it.
The true wealthy is the same which makes way to flow in innumerable hands of money.
There can be no other use of money from creation of employment for others.
Another thing, money is not only in the form of money.
It is also in the form of love for your health, character and others.
Try that you become the owner of this money.

After the general elections, if the new government continued the policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through ration, then kerosene will not be available at these shops in half a dozen states.
The states where kerosene sales are to be closed include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from this, some states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and North-East are also preparing to stop the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the petroleum ministry, it will be decided to stop sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two grounds.
The first base is to create electricity connections in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in the states where most rural families have been given LPG connections.
The Petroleum Ministry has made strong preparations about this.
Since October 2013, the sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already been closed.
According to sources, under this policy, kerosene quota has been reduced considerably to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
Punjab's quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kg liters to one lakh kg.
In the allocation of Uttarakhand, 70 percent of Haryana's kerosene quota was reduced by about 40 percent.
Despite this cut, news of the shortage of kerosene has not come from these states.
The Ministry believes that it is clear from this that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
The price of PDS kerosene and diesel is currently a difference of 37 rupees.
This encourages adulterers.
In the states where sales will be closed through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at full cost in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per liter on kerosene.
In the year 2013-14, the burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around 31 thousand crore rupees.

On this occasion, Modi said, "The coalition government was formed in many states and centers of the country, sometimes the Congress, sometimes the government of communists and sometimes the BJP government.
You have seen the rule of many parties.
Call the political pundits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be decided in the country.
Which party did
If its comparative result comes, then the question will not come in front of the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
Attempts have been made to fulfill the public aspirations whenever the BJP government has been formed.
This country is witness to the inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man got food for two times.
But when the Congress or its support government formed, it was not fortunate to fill the poor man.
One leader of the Congress, one leader of UPA, is not responding to what happened in nine and a half years.
The media of our country also can not reach them.
The Congress has become arrogant.
They also do not respond to media persons.
Elections are from the Lok Sabha, you answer the public.
Modi attacked Congress leader Kapil Sibal and said, "There are questions being asked by Modi today. When the people bless the BJP in 2014, then every year they will present their work in front of the public.

There can not be any orphan in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Congress friends leave balloons on the day they come.
Congress friends, we have already given exams 10 months ago.
In democracy, the people take tests.

He believed in the first elected president in Egypt .
Mohammed Morsi has sworn in as his post, but his victory day hardly ended political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised "New Egypt" while taking oath as the first independently elected President of the country, who replaced Hosni Mubarak, who was removed 16 months ago.
On his formal constituency before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi has become the fifth President of Egypt after the freely elected first Islamist President of the Arab world, and almost 60 years ago, after the removal of the monarchy.
He took oath in front of 18 judges of the court's black lobbying on his chair on the banks of the river Neel, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
During the formal ceremony shown in the live broadcast on national television, Morsi said, "We are aspirations of better future, new Egypt and other Republics."
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, who has spent 84 years as an illegal organization since its establishment, and who has been targeted for the previous governments, 60-year-old trained engineer in the US of the party, Morsi said, "Today the people of Egypt have laid the foundation of a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and police defended the building and according to local time, Morasi came to the small convoy of cars after some time at 11 o'clock in the morning.
From the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to greet the new President, the traffic was stopped for a while so that their motor convoy could leave the normally busy road, which connects the city's center to its south suburbs.
Morasi's personal talent, which was ridiculed as Brotherhood's non-chemical Khali Tyre, grew a lot after his victory and on Friday, his speech presented him not only as an Islamist but as a candidate of all those who want to fulfill the 2011 revolution against dictator Mubarak.
Morasi, wearing blue business suit and red tie, took oath before the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber and said, "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."
After that, Morasi went to Cairo University, where he had to give his inaugural speech.
The military band was officially welcomed by playing national tune, while they were standing in the careful posture.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi was also present.
On his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university welcomed with this slogan that "Sena and people are one hand."
In 1908, established as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University later became the stronghold of Islamist students groups in the year 1970.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic swearing in Tehri Square, which is the original place of the revolution, which ended the dictatorial rule of Mubarak last year, and took oath to withdraw the Presidential powers dropped from his post from the leader removed last year.
But instead of taking the competent oath of Parliament, instead of agreeing to take an official oath before the court, they bowed before the will of the army, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tehrier Square was full of dramatic popular currency.

Meanwhile, an important committee of the American Parliament has approved a bill limiting the monitoring activities of the National Security Agency [NSA].
Its purpose is to make monitoring more transparent and restore the faith in the people who have been hurt by the disclosure of the phone tape on a large scale.
This move of Senate has been welcomed by six American companies including Google, Yahoo.
NSA has also seduced the data centers of these companies.

In this bill, many restrictions have been mentioned in the US Patriot Act, including prohibiting lump sum phone tapes.
Under the FISA, deliberately unauthorized data will be collected and its use will be considered as a crime and for this, a ten-year jail sentence has been made.
After passing the House of Representatives and Senate in both the Houses of Congress, this bill will become law.
Committee Chairman and Senator Dianae Festin said that the program to record NSA's phone is under the law and I believe it has contributed significantly to the security of the country.
But in spite of this, more transparency should be brought in.
Not only this, the safety of public privacy should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, angry Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have supported this bill due to disclosure of NSA's Internet Monitoring program.
In a letter to the senators, these companies have said that we welcome this proposal of MPs who curb the recording of NSA on a large scale.

Schools undertake more focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the courses of English literature, students must read a play of at least Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poem and contemporary British story after 1914.
In order to encourage more and more reading , the examination will also include the ' not seen text ' .
A joint English literature and language course will be terminated.
Since 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE in language, and will be very inspired to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new course for English and Mathematics tomorrow - both of them will be the first subjects in which revolutionary changes will take place.
It will also change the other major topics next year.
In a separate step, the Exam Regulatory Officers will showcase the changes in the structure of the GCSE along with the new grading system and the lesser course.
Speaking in summer, Education Secretary Michael Gov had said, "There was a lot of disagreement about this, to restore the belief of the people, we need to improve our examination system, he said that "GCSE" will be more challenging, more ambitious and more harsh."
Studies have found that English schools dedicate less time in mathematics - 116 hours in a year or 3 hours less during a week compared to most countries.
According to the comparison, Australian school provides students an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.

If they were made witnesses in the case, would they have been made only after the entire investigation

According to this report, during the last four years, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Rather, in contrast to Modi's claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004), during the stay of Atal Vihari Bajpai's PM, a period came when there was no advertisement issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
On Thursday, keeping the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182-meter tall Statue of Unity statue in Kevadia, Gujarat, Modi said, "After this there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's Jayantis.
While DAVP's record shows that UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari was asked about Modi's claims, he said that BJP's PM Candidate does not talk on the basis of facts.
UPA was unable to bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
About which Tiwari said that this happened due to economic recession that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on the Jayantis and the death anniversary of the members of the Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
DAVP spent 33 crores for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and death anniversary, 21 crores for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crores for Indira Gandhi and 9.38 crores for Print advertisements for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When Manish Tiwari asked about this difference, he said, "It should not be seen from the perspective of spending on advertisement.
Because the price of advertisement depends on many things, including the size of advertisement or the rate of advertisement for that year etc.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, whose protesters are trying to handle the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.

Move through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Well, providing free health care to the rural areas of Cameron.
Well and their team look at hundreds of patients every weekend .
West African countries don ' t have very much physicians , there is only a doctor for 5000 people .
Give your vote here or give it through mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or any other top 10 to make the CNN year's hero.
The winner will receive  250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen her sick father in consciousness and unconsciousness, going to the hospital, which was not well equipped to assist her.
Jamel Well, in the year 1981, the car crash near Cameron's capital Yonde was wounded.
Initially, his only hand was broken, but an infection increased which spread to his mind, and he built a blood-blood, which affected his remaining life.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgeon in the camera.
If we had money, we would take our father out of the camera.
Instead, Vel continued to walk around the very crowded clinics and hospitals with his father and he could get any treatment.
Well said, "This is not easy.
You come out of the house at 5 in the morning with the hope that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but this does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can wait while waiting in the mouth of death.
Since the death of Vell's father in 2002, there was not much change in the situation.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5000 person in the camera.
If compared, then United States has a doctor for every 413 persons.
And even if there are physicians, many residents of Cameron can not afford his expenses.
Two out of five people in the country have won below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in health care in the country belong to the private sector.
Well says, "His only problem is poverty.
Being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the sufferings of his father and his countrymen, Well took the determination to solve something.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have done 700 free surgery last year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon in Yonde's Central Hospital.
And he started an NGO Eskovium, which goes to rural areas on weekend to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped around 32,000 people.
On almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the van, tied medical supply to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes luck is not even with them.
They have to move forward more than once by pushing the vehicle from rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they really get respect for the heroes: the best place to be presented by the feast, singing and dance, and the community.
In these villages, the free medical service is actually the reason for celebrating, and Well, along with its big smile and endless energy, enjoys joyously.
Next morning their team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We are meeting 500 people in every journey.
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get bacakhi, donated glasses or free birth certificates - this document is required in the school but many poor families can not afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local description.
Operations are usually done at school buildings, town halls or houses, after the process, the patient walks to the recovery place and makes a place for the next person.
The generator of the group publishes in the operation room and the sanitizing equipment, and Well and their volunteers work on Sunday morning and evening.
This is a lot of speed, but the musicians of the village usually help in keeping the party motivated.
Well said, "They keep playing drums all night to keep us alive and continue their work."
On Sunday, their team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - including Cameron doctors and foreign medical students - has done 700 free surgery last year, and they know that their assistance can change the world of those whom they help.
A person told that due to free hernia surgery, he will be able to go back to work.
The person said, "This will change the future of my and my family."
In addition to running weekend clinics and working as surgeons in the hospital, Well also work in private medical clinics around Yonde at night.
He said that this is his second job which funds 60 of his non-profit work, the rest of the remaining part is fulfilled with personal donations.
In Philadelphia, the second year medical student of Draxal University and NGO in Vell's group, Catty O'Mally said, "I do not know when they sleep.
They are always in the hospital, or are trying to earn money for their organization so that they continue to run these campaigns.
Students of medical and nursing like O'Mally who come from United States and Europe to join Vell's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity for them, which they can never achieve in their country.
O'Mally said, "We have been able to get experimental experience in the surgical treatment tools for Dr. Well or clean blood vessels."
You will never get the opportunity to do this as a second year medical student in America.
Volunteer students usually spend from themselves to reach Cameron, and they often come with donation medical supply.
But after reaching the youth, their stay comes and goes and raises the expenses of instructions.
O'Mally says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameron is never going to end.
For Well, almost the same work is not a burden, difficulty.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are those things that give them great pleasure.
Well says, "I am very happy while doing this work."
And I think about my father.
I hope they're looking at what I'm doing.
I'm laughing at people, to reduce their pain.
See the Escovium website and find out how to help.

New politics has started to make board changes in municipalities.
Recently, the team of Congress leadership board councilors in Saithia municipality of Virbhum district turned into Trinamool board due to change.
This change took place due to the involvement of most Congress councilors including the municipal chairman in the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress but some councilors of CPI (M), CPI and Forward Bloc have also suppressed the Trinamool here.
Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Rai considers it a good sign for the party.
He says that 10 Congress councilors including Sanithia Municipal Corporation Chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta joined the Trinamool.
Some councilors of the Left Front, including the CPI (M), have also taken the Trinamool flag.
Everyone has written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the Trinamool and according to the number force, the Sanithia Municipal Corporation Board has also come under the control of Trinamool.
Shri Rai also claims that all agree with the blueprint of Bengal's development under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties including Congress, CPI (M), CPI and Forward Bloc are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
The qualified leaders of any party are welcome to the Trinamool.
Prior to the elections of five municipalities to be held on November 22, due to the change of party of Congress councilors in the Sanithia municipality, the occupation of Trinamool on the municipal board is being considered as important in political circles.
Earlier, there is an example of Trinamool occupying the Congress-ruled municipal board in the Left-ruled Haldia and the river.
When Trinamool is occupying the party due to change in the municipality board in the districts, those who join the party receive a grand reception in the Trinamool Bhawan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Rai is excited about the leaders joining Trinamool by breaking from other parties.
They say that those who break from any party are welcome to Trinamool.
He claims that people's faith under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing, the result of which people want to join the Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party CPI (M) says that the lower level leaders of other parties are being scared and beaten.
People are joining it fearing Trinamool Congress's terror.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is considered to be an injury to CPI (M) democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its base, but it is imperative to question the justification to make changes in the matter of power.
Australian woman appeals against Thai Prison period
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney has been sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in the booket to make false allegations of attack on the taxi driver, she has appealed against this decision and she has got bail.
On June 15, the Fuket Provincial Court found Steve Rassel Bombford guilty of making false allegations against the Thai Police, alleging that on Sunday morning, a local taxi driver tried to stop him with two other persons.
But later CCTV footage revealed that he had returned to the hotel safely after being separated from his Australian boyfriend.
When the Fuket police interrogated the Bamfort for two days, he accepted to make a story.
Prior to the hearing in the court, he was kept in the local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in the lower security prevention center in the outskirts of the phuket instead of adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tunks, who has requested the Foreign Affairs Department to help her daughter in Canberra.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family is very worried about the care of his daughter and they want to call her back to Australia.
Tunks said, "It has been a worrying time for us, but we hope it will be at home as soon as possible."
Bamfod has appealed against the order, and bail has been granted on 50,000 exits.
During this, the report in Australia said that he was celebrating holidays at the place of Crabby's holiday in southern Thailand.
Legal sources located in Thailand said that the case of the Bamford was being fought by a local advocate in the Fuket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court can increase its bond order for two years and force it to stay in adult prison.
However, after the murder of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in the recent Fuket, Thailand can also blame the efforts to improve its bad tourist image.
