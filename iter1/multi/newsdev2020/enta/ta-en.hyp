Don't say that.
This was stated by Novi Great City chief Miroslav Derelljaka.
We must fight for our lifestyle and our resolve.

Parents signed a study before children were admitted to school.
Parents are normally bringing food to their children every day, and they also know about their status.
We were surprised when the police came and pulled out the children before the school and removed the food for the children brought by the parents.
This is unreasonable because we have parents to testify whether their children were in bad condition as the police say.
Earlier, the police commissioner Abdurraguman said that there was no complaint when he came to school to see how children are guarded.
Children have not read anything other than Kuran.
But the police's Public Relations Officer, Jacob Sabo, said that children will be re-elected to their parents after being handed over to the state government.
'They are kept in a manifestationless environment in the name of the uran.
Many of them have stains on their backs, showing them falling.
So we are in the school to find out who the school owner is.'

In Vijay's speech, there has been a lot of denouncements on behalf of the opposite.
At the same time, Kamal Hassan, President of the People's Judiciary, has supported Vijay's speech.
In this case, Vijay's father S.A. Chandrasekhar had visited Tutichun Airport from Chennai today to attend a function in Nagar Mandir, Kanyakumari district.
There, the reporters presented questions to him about the criticisms of Vijay.
He replied, 'When Banner was going to the bike on the road, Subashree died in the accident.
Everyone talks about this incident.
Vijay spoke only about one thing that everyone talks.
The court has asked why it has not yet arrested those involved in Subashri's case.
But only after Vijay spoke, it is not known why the ministers and the audience are protesting.
If Vijay is so hostile, it means he will grow.
If you talk, will there be such a protest or not
If Vijay is opposed, then he will develop.
In view of Vijay's maiden discussions, the experts questioned whether he would come to politics.
'I don't know anything like that,' said S.A. Chandrasekhar.
We asked the top classes about this.
They said, 'There is no alternative to the falling of Sufsree Pen and the sacrifice is unfortunate.
But why was Vijay and Pilgrim music waiting for the release function
As Vijay acted, the audience who had a cut off for one film fell down from the top and died.
That video was also released.
But he has to say that he should not keep his films out of his films.'
A news has been spreading in the WTO over the past few days in the headline 'need for the dogs'.
It was said that if the dog bites or their nails get scratched, they would have to inform their parents immediately.
At the same time, a video also added that a young man had more than 90 percent of the rabis virus.
The young man who is being treated at the hospital is a smiling sight of a dog.
We asked the cattle doctor Anandapathamanaban whether he would walk like a dog and whether the news spreading in the WTSAP is true.
If the rabis virus succumbs to the infected dog, then it will certainly affect those virus succumbers.
But the rabies don't spread because the nails are scratched in the body.
If the nails of the rabies are damaged then the disease can spread.
The disease spreads even when the wounds and wounds are in the body of the bite, when the rabis hits the nose.
Therefore, it is beneficial to vaccinate rabis in the home-to-house vaccine carefully.
As the dogs need to be treated, cattle doctors are also vaccinated once a year.

Casey Federal, a Republican of the Republican Party, told intelligence officials that he had helped them in prosecuting.
There is no charge against him.
During a conversation with Lindfurke and Casey, a Lyndfurke partner told Haise to send 250,000 to Casey's re-election campaign.
Heyce, who initially refused to claim that it would be noticed by sending such a larger amount, was accused of reducing denouncement at the end of the conversation.

The MoU covers the number of desires as a test attempt to improve the lives of the beneficiaries.

On the contrary, these options will be personal and only those who replaced it following the investigation conducted by Instagram in Australia in July.
The trial of Mohanul, which starts on Friday, will also start Australia.
Australian Music Policy Director Mia Carlick said that this change is based on the opinion of psychiatrists that the number of goodwill research and the number of desires is compared to each other in the society.
'The anti-terrorist groups and mental institutions working with us have really received negative comments from many.'
This is to remove the significance of the number, actually focus on the counting of desires or resistance, to focus on the quality of their interaction and quality of their registers.
He said that people are expected to feel more comfortable to share this base, not to consider it as a competition.
Carlic pledged to continue the same scales as before, and the same inner perspective they had already approached.
He said that the testing in Instagram Australia, Canada, Brazil, New ealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland cannot be done in other countries as well.
As it is in Mohanul, the owner of Instagram, there is no mention of whether this test can be done or whether this change will be made permanent.
We have received some initial comments from the public about this experience, but in this situation we are still learning and keeping in mind.
Speaking of the world's exploration grounds, Karlik said Australia has the most active 'industrial-explored' beneficiaries in Music and Instagram.
We believe that it will be the best country to really get the best ideas about whether it is a valuable experience for the people using our services.
Every person is grateful to the parents who have developed themselves.

The Chennai High Court questioned the Tamil Nadu government about why not give separate reservations in government medical colleges for those who are studying in government schools.
Without filling up of 207 seats for overseas Indians in Private Medical Colleges in Tamilnadu, they have been awarded to the colleges associated with management.
Tiran from Kovali, who was filled with proper analysis, had filed a case in the Chennai High Court.
The trial took place at a meeting with Justices Kribakaran and Velmurugan.
When VP Raman argues that the priest's lawyer at the Indian Medical Council Cell level will be sent to the college on the basis of 10 students at one place, if there are holidays for overseas Indians after a three-stage consultation.
The list should be filled in the footsteps of the college terms.
But I didn't know if the list was filled in the base force.
When Aurobindo Pandian argues on behalf of the Government of Tamilnadu, the list of black spots will be sent to the college related to Maddume.
It's merit that you should fill the empty spaces.
But I don't know how colleges are filled.
The Supreme Court has not produced any order in this regard.
Therefore, he argued that this righteousness should give a reasonable answer to the overseas Indians for filling up of desalination seats.
When lawyer Velmurugan argued at the Manufacturer's level, he said that 207 places that were empty were sold for less valued.
Why shouldn't the interned judges ask for medical colleges only for medical education, why shouldn't they be given a separate place in government medical colleges, if they send a list of posts related to the posts
Here the government doctors are paid less than the teachers, because they are more than my assistants.
We are injustice to the doctors.
We intend to include 10 private medical colleges in Tamilnadu as candidates in this case.
The colleges have been asked to submit the details of the values of the students who have been collected at the exclusive exclusion sites for foreign nationals by October 15.
Brothers and sisters were sentenced to life in the cruel assassination of Guanteel Baloch, popularly known as the social media of Pakistan.
Famous by his social media photographs, Gwandil Baloch was assassinated in July 2016.
The country's high-level 'Gauravak Killing' in Analysis last Friday was sentenced to life imprisonment by his brothers for the murder of Pakistan's social media popular Kuvindal Baloch.
Baloch, popularly known for his charming cells in Pakistan, which was attracted by the Western civilization, was killed in a throat in the month of July.
His brother Mohammad Wasim was arrested.
He was not sorry about what he did and said, "Yes, I killed my sister, and the sister's act was a great provocation".
In a long-awaited ruling, his lawyer Sardar Mohammed AFP said that the court in the eastern city of Multan proved guilty of life imprisonment.
He will be released to the High Court in Gaulle's Asia, he said.
Earlier, AFP said Baloch's mother Anwar My believed her son would be released.
"He's grandfather.
She's my daughter, she's my son," he said.
Baloch's assassination, internationally, began to resume the voices of action against the infection of a woman-slaughtered 'slaughtering' to break the social controls of the Analytics society.
Women have been burnt, shot, buried and necked in order to humiliate their family with crimes such as selecting their husbands or selecting their own husbands.
The murders are usually carried out by close relatives.
They can apologize to the relatives of the victims, according to Pakistan's uisas (dead money) and Diyadh (revolution) law.
Three months after Baloch was murdered, the Parliament passed a new legislation by forceing life imprisonment for the killings.
However, the judge's self-confirmation of whether a murder is believed to be a honourable murder, leading to other reasons for the murder and obtaining forgiveness.
In Baloch's murder, his parents initially insisted that their son should not be forgiven and released.
But they persuaded that we would lose their son, and they changed their minds and apologized to him.
However, because of the international hatred of the murder, the Pakistani government took an incomplete step to declare itself a cleric with the parents and improved the case.
Scarletting for the Pakistani cricket team and wearing an attractive Scarlet daily is one of the most well-known works of Baloch.
This raised his denouncements and threats, but it was seen in a country that was seen as a bold and political act of women's empowerment, including young socialists.
The roots of the 'Gaurav' killings are in tribal social controls, which are spread throughout South Asia, but may be affected by men, but they indicate women's activity.

The West Bengal elephant who died in adultery
Speaking about this, the animal welfare enthusiasts said, 'In 2004 it was turned into a Broad Gazza.
Thereafter, more trains are being run on this route.
Elephants have been killed since the increase in number of trains.
This area is the way of elephants.
We took care of the fact that due to the rapid movement of trains in this area, elephants are casually killed in the accident.
After that, the railways were ordered to move in this area at a lower speed.
Due to this, the risks also decreased.
Now the railways are moving faster in this region.
In other areas, we are calling for the formation of plasters.'
Speaking about this, the North-Eastern Railway officials said, "The railway line is 15 km in the area.
While crossing this area, the railways have been instructed to move slowly.
The order to move the trains slowly for 24 hours is in force.

Similarly, during pregnancy, nutrients containing iron tonics, dry raw materials, protein piscots, ghee, alpentasol pills, cucumber pieces are provided.
The scheme was implemented by pregnant women to enhance their children with health.
The scheme was very beneficial for mid-term and poor pregnant women.
Over the past one year, the pregnancy subsidies to pregnant women have been stopped without regular payment.
In this context, social enthusiasts said, 'In the last 13 months, 18,000 pensions paid to the pregnant women on behalf of people's welfare and family welfare have not been granted.
This has affected maternal and child health during childbirth.
There has been a situation of buying loans for child maintenance.
As only nutrients have been provided, the subsidies have not been kept in bank accounts till date.
Asked by the Government Health Department officials about this, the central government has not yet given the first penalties.
It is reported that the central government has given the first guarantee of Rs. 2,000 and the remaining Rs. 16,000 will be guaranteed in bank accounts.
However, it is said that the Tamil Nadu government has regularly registered applications for pregnant women seeking a feedback.
Therefore, the government has to take a drive to provide immediate delivery of non-availability of maternal aid for more than a year.'

The UN refugee agency said that this assassination has created a 'new humanitarian emergency,' which requires an attempt to fund 35.5 million within the age of this year.

He denied the crime.
On July 16, the police reported that 29-year-old Rosiebeth Flores-Rotrix and her 11-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son were shot dead.
The court documents show that January 27, the new trial, will give more time to the two-party lawyers to prepare.

Ministers rebellion against Poris Johnson to reduce frexidant demands and compromise with Brussels.
While the European leaders have only three weeks of the summit for multiparty, fear is increasing among the top officials around the prime minister that the time for major concessions is decreasing.
The ministers rebelled against Poris Johnson to reduce their frexidant demands and compromise with the European Union.
While Brussels said Mr. Jansen's alternative arrangements were 'inadequate', there has been a hurdle in talks on a new customs system in turn to the Irish Baxtop.
Germany's Angela Merkel's leading European Union Power Procedures, the senior ministers, who have avoided the final time compromise on Bextop, will be given to Tory's leader preparing for the fight.
Three different cabinet ministers, The Sun, are preparing to oppose him next week after the Dori party's annual conference in Manchester.
With the threat of no agreement, they will call for abandonment of the 'controllable' war planned by senior assistant Dominique Commings, and insist on accepting the EU's final time concession.
One minister said Tuesday that the Supreme Court's decision to abolish the deployment of parliament was 'the time to abolish', adding: 'It is the only way to make a deal now on October 31.
At the bottom we can never get the number, and they are against us.
Now the Prime Minister has to shrink and take advantage of his ability.
It will not be irrational, but the Comings plan has clearly emerged.
We can't fight everywhere.
Otherwise, the second cabinet minister has convinced Mr. Jansen to try to implement the agreement of former Prime Minister Teresa May.
The senior minister further said, 'If you find out, I will tell Poris to put Teresa's contract under pressure.'
Now there is enough number, everybody is trying to finish it.
If we were insisted on sustaining this, the whole thing was completed by Poris and everything was done by us all.
Sir John Major accused the police of not giving importance to talks.
In a conversation with Parikasi, the former Tory leader said, 'The Prime Minister wants us to make a deal with Europe.
But we couldn't see the creation of a contract by sitting with Brussels.
On the contrary, we see in Scotland bites with wings, examining eggs in Wales and negotiating with the public on the streets - the election campaign is already going on in full swing.'
The Prime Minister's press conference confessed that we have to move further far away from the agreement, 'No one can imagine, no one can imagine.
When there is no agreement, the Pen Act, which imposes three months' delays, in Brussels, said, 'It reduces our negotiating situation sharply.'
'There is no doubt that it prevents our negotiating situation, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are constantly trying to improve due to this legislation.'
Frexid Secretary Stephen Bargley is returning to Brussels today for further talks with EU's Michael Persian.
They will suggest a document on how all the Ireland regions are possible for food and cattle.

Lawrion Kelly: I was told that I can never enter the television with a clasco height.
The television owners expressed their appreciation for the clasco superiority as a programme composer.
Recalling 35 years back in the broadcasting sector, Kelly recalled the sight of the film 'Micha and Film' before the first emergence of the screen.
"I was very filmmaker at the age of 25," he said.
I worked as a researcher in BBC Scotland, saying my employer could never enter the television because of my Clasco highlight.
Before I took charge at Clasco office, I went to London to see all the TV teams and the broadcast.
At that time, I don't forget that both on-time and Mike Moris were taking interviews with the famous Pete Davis.
I couldn't believe that I was in the same room as one of the most popular ones.
I realized that this is the place I wanted to be.
Kelly, who started his life as a local newspaper in East Kilbird in Scotland, became a Scotland reporter of AM television in 1984.
GMDV, IDV Breakfast and Tefferek began to summon the programs and then launched Lauren in the morning after which he was named.
He will celebrate his 35th anniversary with a special event to recall his unforgettable occasions and interviews.
He said, "Pervam, Encouraging" and "Arvatism" are the secrets to stay on television and "You should pay the necessary work."
You must be honest and honest.
Prepare ahead and be interested in you, he added.
Recalling the critical news collections, Kelly said that the announcement of Tonblen's assassination was very difficult.
I don't know how many families of the children who were killed or wounded were watching the event on the next day after sixteen children and their teachers were brutally murdered.
One of those mothers, who killed her five-year-old daughter Johnna, had to meet me personally, and we spoke at her house for hours.
As our relationship continues, I went to Jonnah's last corner, since then, I and Bam continue to be friends.
As soon as your daughter disappeared in 2007, Gate and Kerry McCain shared their compassion and actually congratulated them.
The pain that they knew not what was for their sinful daughters, and the thoughts that were wounded in the online.
I'm sorry for them.
The 35th anniversary of Lauren is scheduled to be broadcast from 8.30 am to IDV on Monday morning.

imbabwe: Sivenga was afraid of picking up.
A senior government official said that Tunnan-Administrator Constantino Sievenga refused the opportunity to become a chancellor at the time of the revolution, fearing that it would be an engineer to suppress itself to power the army to seize the regime in November 2017.
Last week, imbabwe told the Independent that Mugabe had to accept the presidential post following talks between him and the army during the revolution.
In a social media senior government official, however, said that Sievenga could not deny the opportunity because of fear and really understood Mugabe's plan to use himself to prove his position to world leaders and the African Union (AU) leaders.
Jimbabwe's 37-year-old ruler was ready to hand over power to Sievanga, but a tower recommended by government officials that President Emerson was the senior government official of the office and cabinet office that he was not with Nanga.
Government officials said that Mukhabe had approached Sevenga by one of his angels, who felt that he was empowered by his hands.
According to the senior government official, there were three people in the middle of the military bureaucracy between the head and the former president.
The official said that the negotiators included President's spokesman George Saramba, Aaron Nefera, the then head of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Roman Catholic Bishop Claric Fitles Mounori.
Sievenga, who was commander of the imbabwe Security Force (ICTF), was sent alone by the former Governor of the imbabwe Reserve Bank, idiot Gono Mugabe, who was negotiated.
Describeing Africa's identity after the death of a living period, he sought the intervention of other African leaders, while attempting to ensure that the African Union does not accept the operation of the military.
The late (Mugabe), the then CDF (Secretary General of Defence Forces, Sievenga), was not elected to the presidential post.
'It was an unbelievable attempt to cure the rapidly growing situation, which made it tired of a part of the late Chancellor's family,' the official (Jamwanda) wrote.
But there was a little political frustration, but the hiding chancellor believed that it would correct the situation at least in the diplomatic system.
Remembering the commander's pledge not to deteriorate the constitutional order, the change would have confronted them with the standpoint of the African Union over revolutions.
The late President (Mugabe) believed that the current CDF (Seevanga) would drag into the trap, so that the words of the commanders would not deteriorate the constitution.
Mugabe (thinked) believes that the African Union would have called it a revolution without any means to see how to take it on the basis of its theoretical concept of revolutions, so that there was a need for military intervention.
The opportunity was given to calculate.
Officials said that Mukhabe had taken the action when he realised that the security forces were not ready to defend themselves.
They said that Mukhabe was forced to write a resignation letter because the army warned him of the danger of being killed like Kadafi.
Military officials told him that if citizens march to his Flu Rupee settlement, we would not defend him from them.
At that time, he had two wishes to defend his family and prove that the army was holding the regime.'
The CDF and the General (the) were well aware of the views.
The senior government official said that the angel (Kono) who brought the unbelievable comments - through a powerful pole - Isu Tiri Vemakvapa-Makwapa (the armyman whom we have not defended), we have no politicians or political contests.
Government officials say that the army leaders in the area have not been able to remove their intentions by their sheep in imbabwe, but the military has explained that they should take care of the 'criminals' around him.
Mugabe tried to use the same war to repeat Nangagua, which had been sneaking for some time in South Africa, to advise the continuing revolution and regime.
Apart from negotiating with the army, Mugabe demanded help from the region.
South Africa, which was the key to this practice - not only because of its economic and regional strength, but because the then President Jacob uma was the SADC president, made it clear that if the army had entered the house of Mugabe, the Southern forces would have come to Harare immediately.
'It doesn't happen because the new and the African leaders don't want it,' the news source told the Independent.

China requires a strong leadership, otherwise a policy reference.
The government has stated in a policy note published Friday on the 70th anniversary of the people's Republic of China, if China does not need a strong, unified leadership.
In a White report, China's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting stated that since the communist regime took place 70 years ago, the success of the country was the party's leadership.
China's largest, its national conditions are complicated and its administrative difficulties are found to be rice.
Without a united and strong leadership, China will move towards separation, break and give a catastrophe to the world.'
In 1989, Chinese officials have been justifying the need for national stability to suppress problems like suppressing supporters of democracy.
On Tuesday, the strong leader of the world's second largest economy, i Jinping, has further strengthened the party's regime and has regulated those challenging his power since his assumption in late 2012.
The Army Modern Modernization Programme, which is under the supervision of G, has created tension in the region.
China is not expecting to export its model for development or import any other foreign model, but this day is not just peace, but a prosperity.'
The invasion of others and domination of the world is not in the gene of Chinese.
China is blew up with the great powers of modern times and has deepened the impact of war and tensions, which China will never experience the sufferings that it has experienced.
China celebrates this year as witnesses the challenges faced by the falling economy and anti-government demonstrations in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, as it is fighting with the US in a draconian trade war.
The reference pointed out that the country would never 'delete' China's interests and not compromise its security and sovereignty.
'The threats of the World War and the continuous rising taxes are not sufficient to solve the problem,' he said of business problems with Washington.
China is an aggravated economy with the entire industrial system, full industrial ties, extensive market and strong economic power.
'World wars will never weaken it,' he added.
China is confident that it will be able to confront the rifts and transform the barriers into lessons and create a new world.
It further stated that the United States had to see China's progress with wisdom because China had no intention of challenging the US or to turn into the US.
The US cannot control China, and there is no chance to prevent China's growth.
The prevention and suppression of other countries will not strengthen the US to carry domestic problems abroad.

The neo-ratri protest will be expected till the 7th day.
Those who live in the neo-ratri for nine days, who have been worshipped as a serpent, should lie down on the ground without lying down on the furnace and the bed.

Those who are unable to eat one hour in the first day and only milk can take fruit on the last day.
Puranics say there are no other verses that are simple and enjoyable like a neo-navratri versat.
And the neo-ratri destruction that gives to a man, Danna, Dhanan, Sustainable Enjoyment, Long Life, Health, Heaven and Moksha.
Those who do not have childhood will certainly be sick.
Those who are depressed in the study can achieve a higher level by following this virginity.
If those who are not worshipped for nine days had guided the fortress on the occasion of Ashtami and woke up the night, the Durgadevi had saved their lives.

But we stopped it in 2015, but the UN Human Rights Council's charge is baseless.'

Tourist places are seen to be very dirty .
The biggest contribution to the Sydney tourism sector to the Australian economy is 21.9 billion a year, surrounded by Obera House, Circular ue, Luna Parks and a port bridge that is a signature.
But below that bridge is a surprising fact.
Chidney's famous port is one of the most dirty waterways in the country, of which 15 Olympic swimming ponds are collected every year.
This stagnant figure makes the most attractive tourist destination one of our places.
According to a new video called Sydney Port and below, the most popular city of Australia is covered with cigarette pieces, plastic bags and bottles, descending clothing and clothing and dead animals - all of which reach the port via rainwater.
But the plastic plays a major role in shutting down our waterways.
As Assistant Director of the Citizenship Port Research Program, Dr. Cather's Daffron said, 'I am a monkey.'
It looks beautiful, but it is one of the most transformed and unclean toilets on our beaches.
Every hour about 1560 kilometres of plastics come under our waterways, most of which come under the port through rainwater.
'This port is... extremely serious,' Dr. Daffron said.
One-third of these wastes are coming through rainwater.
However, while 70 percent of the plastics inside the sea have reached the seashore, the problem of the Chidney port is greater below the surface like a ice sheet.
He and his team personally made an exit of 500 kilos of plastic every year, saying, 'In reality, you can only know what is there if you spend time under the water,' the owner of the Manali Divyu Center, Richard Nichols said.
If most people know this, they will be surprised to know what is in water.
Maximum... half of the plastic bags we've seen.
The remaining 50 percent will be made of at least plastic.
When you look at the port, it looks very beautiful, but people don't believe that all this plastic and garbage is from below its surface.
Ocean Protect Sub-Conductor and Management Director Germany Prin also said that local and tourist are the only ways to reduce the level of plastics and pipelines that reach our waterways.
It should be started from the basement, he added.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic that we use and recycle, and we need to be more aware that the movement within our circulations reaches the sea in the end.
If we destroy the sea, we are going to destroy ourselves because 50 percent of our breathing oxygen comes from the sea.
It accumulates 30 percent carbon dioxide and food source.
But we can correct this port and bring it to an old age, it is very easier.

Tosmenian tablets can lead to cure cancer .
The dosmanian telescopes can guide cancer - a turning point that has revolutionized the treatment of patients.
Scientists have found out how some cancer cells hide themselves .
Researchers have found out that this process is happening to Dasmanian tables and humans .
This invention is expected to give new methods of treatment to cancer patients .
Do you generally have Dasmanian tables and humans
Cancer cells that don't seem to be inspired.
Researchers, including those from the Melbourne Peter Meccallum Cancer Centre, have invented an invention that would help in achieving a revolution in their treatment if certain types of cancers did not respond to the preventive treatment system.
The main part of the destructive Dasmanian television's future could be to repair the dangerous faces that threaten the future.
This study found a group of proteins, BRC2, hiding themselves and preventing the preventive region from acting as a target to attack cancer, and hiding itself from some cancer cells in humans and those organisms.
It can be a major testimony in the treatment of small lung cancer, neuroplastoma and mercel cells.
Peter Mac Researcher Mark Dason told the AB firm, 'It is the greatest advantage of this programme that we can get back to the patients who are opposed to the preventive treatment system at some time.'
Cancer cells in the disease resistance zone can be detected by transforming the targets of the existing treatments to enable the MHP proteins to function.
'This is possible for those with cancer of lungs,' said Professor Dason.
'This is one of the world's worst diseases.
We can provide better treatment for this.
Researchers believe that this invention can ultimately be used in the tissues of dosmenian tables that prevent cancer cells from detecting.
Accurately the same procedure (Ministers and Dosmenian Table Cancer) is noteworthy,' said Professor Dason.
Till date, it was very difficult to treat cancerous tumors in the Dasmanian table.
But if the dosmanian telescopes can also be used for man-acturing medicines, it is possible to control the disease.'

Scientists are crying about the surroundings of the smallest planet .
Scientists are surprised to find a solar family, 30 years away from the Earth, surrounding a very small star called Red Tworf, which challenges the current understanding of the creation of a planet.
The art format of GJ 3512B, the largest gas volume around its shortest nutrient Red Tworf, released on 26th September, 2019.
Normally the stars are greater than the greatest planets around them.
But in this event, researchers said that the star and the glove were not very different on Thursday.
The star, GJ 3512, is 12 in the quantity of our Sun, while the cold stream around it is at least half of the total live storage capacity of our solar family.
He was headed by a research published in a science journal, said Air Scientist Carlos Morales, at Kedelonia Space Research Institute, Spain, "Yes, this is a surprising thing."
This invention was surprising as the models of the theoretical creation of small planets, which are generally low-level stars like Earth and small Neptunes.
In this, we have discovered the surrounding of a small star like a wildlife,' Morals added.
Like a wildlife, this volume, which is highly gas-made, was discovered using a vision in Spain's Caller Alto Astronomical Survey.
It is roaming its star on its long track for 204 days.
Red Tworfs are small and low temperatures in the surface.
JJ 3512 is not only very small than our sun, but it is only 35 more than the sickness that is comparable to a larger scale.
They reflect less energy than the sun, and their surface temperature is slightly colder than 3800 (Digree) Kelvin (6,380 degree Fahrenheit 3,527 Celsius).
That's why they are red.'
Morals said that the third planet might have been swallowed from the star family in the past, while the second planet has the source of roaming around the second planet, explaining the lengthy path of that planet like Viazan.
The planets are also formed from the same layer of gas and dust in the midst of the stars they surround.
In the beginning, a substance is produced from the solid pieces of the layer, which leads to a climate from the gas surrounding the geographical power.
This can be explained as an unprecedented geographical system.
'In this event, the protoplannery layer around the younger age star can be slightly greater and cooler than expected,' Morals said.
This makes the layer uninterrupted, leading to some dense areas.
These poles can grow up to the roots, which creates a planet.
In Tripura, the order issued by the High Court of the mother to prohibit the sacrifice of sheep and goats has become a major church.
The state government has stated in the court that the promise made to Tripura to join India in 1949 is to be released.
1355 years and 184 Kings signed the Agreement on 15th October, 1949 with India.
The then Tripura ueen Kanjan Prabha Devi and the Governor General of India signed the agreement.
The main component of the Agreement is that the Tripura Government will continue financial assistance for traditional worship of 14 temples including the famous Tripura Sundari Temple.
It is common to sacrifice the sheep in Tripura Sundari temple.
The government is also helping finance.
The key objective of the Connectivity Agreement with India is that it should not be changed.
On the contrary, Subhas Patel continued the general public welfare case in Tripura High Court, saying that the sacrifice of sheep and goats with the government's financial assistance is enhancing the minds of Hindus.
The Division Bench Judges asked the case, Sanjay Karol and Rice and Loth, who opposed the practice, prohibited the killing of sheep at the religious places in Tripura.
The court also ordered the government not to help such sheep sacrifices.
The court has also sent notices to all the District Magistrates and Police Auditors to respond to the matter.
At the same time, the court has ordered the CCDV cameras to be monitored in all the temples, not to be sacrificed in addition to slaughtering sheep and goats.
At present, the state government has to appeal to the Supreme Court against this order of the Tripura High Court.
In 1949, the state government has been appealing to the Supreme Court, pointing out that the Tripura High Court has rejected its argument that it should not violate the promise made when it joins India.

Tropical hotels have kept alcoholic drunkards in spite of complaints about the activity .

The chairman of the committee, Mr. Frank Davis, questioned the insertion and said he was not happy.
In an interview to GNA Sport, he said that he feared whether the chairman of the committee would walk justly because he could benefit from the results of the study system.
The Analysis Committee should have intermediate persons coming from outside without connecting with a member and remain unsuccessful.
For example, Mr. Davis, who was a lawyer to write to Ossei Vau Paulmar about 10 percent of the fees.
He is a well-known Olympic supporter.
He should not allow him to continue in the research commission for these two reasons,' he argued.

As Rupa Guru Nath, head of the Tamil Nadu cricket union, is said to have tried the post as the son of former minister Fonumy.
Several reforms have been undertaken in the Indian Cricket Board and the Lodha Committee Recommendation in the State Cricket Associations.
One of the cricket unions cannot remain in office for more than two times, including those over 70 years of age, are the recommendations of the Lodha Committee.
Accordingly, those who had already been posted at the Tamilnadu Cricket Association were unable to come to power.
There was an atmosphere to choose new ones.

He is the younger son of Fonamous.
Asok Sikamani is very interested in the cricket since schooling.
At one stage, he tried to take part in the Indian team.
India Simonds Cheneywasan is the reason for the election of the Tamil Nadu cricket association without contesting the candidates and executives.

The Tamil craftsmen from Mysore circumnavigation have been handed over to the Archaeological Survey of Tamilnadu.
On Wednesday, the High Court of Madurai issued a reply to the Central Toll Legal Department on the ongoing steps taken to protect and renew the ancient sculptures from the 27th Tamilnadu clause.
The manufacturing of Madurai Manufactured Manufacturing is under the control of the Central Archaeological Survey at Mysore, 1978.
The ancient wallets and historical ruins of India are being protected.
The text document, which includes Tamil inscriptions, is based on scientific confirmation of the history of Tamils.
The Tamilnadu cinematography has been circulated.
In such a situation, most of the old Tamil edicts have been damaged while shifting the craftsmen office in Mysore from the old building to a new building.
The inscriptions and historical documents should be regularly preserved and equivalent to the book.
But the documents related to Tamilnadu, which were kept in Mysore, were not regularly defended.
That is why the history and tradition of Tamils are unaware of the future generations.
Thus, he suggested that the Tamil inscriptions from the Mysore Sculpture Department should be handed over to the Tamilnadu Tol Lyllics Department.
Visa came to Ramayana on Wednesday at a function with Sivaganam and R.Tharani.
According to the Judges from the Tamilnadu edicts, the Central Toll Legal Department responded to the renewed walking hand to protect the daughters and the ancient texts on October 22.
In the race against Australia, one more demands for deployment
Justin Dpuri said that the time has come to show the sweetness in the race against the Australian Federation, which determines the Vels team's dictatorship across the world.
The Australian mobilisation victory will ensure that they are the most possible mobilisation of victory in the T-RI, and the possibility of a fight with France or Argentina.
But if the Australian Federal Wells team was ruined for the 14th time in its last 15 meetings, it would have forced the Depuri and the marines to fight with the UK for the last eight seats.
'It's nothing to hide, both the teams won and tried to take the first place in the part,' the Wales team's neighbour Dipuri said.
Some of the decisions were difficult in the past, but a victory against them (Australia) in the past period was sweet.
I think they will be intense thinking of killing us again, while we want to ensure another victory.
We know that it is going to be an important competition before coming here.
Now we have come here and it is time to showcase the talent.
The World Bank has won only one victory against Australia, New ealand or South African armies in history - which won Australians in the third position 32 years ago.
A total of 7 successes have been achieved in 41 attempts against three Southern Gambians under Chief Teacher Warren Gateland.
Vels stopped the defeat in the 13-state competition against Australia in November last year, one of those who were left in the 9-6 victory on Sunday in the Tokyo Stadium.
When asked if there was a mental obstacle before that success, he added, 'It is difficult to say that,' he added.
Those competitions were very difficult, perhaps... people could think there was a problem, I do not know.
At the end of the last race, we left about 15 points, so it would be harder to see statistics than really.'
If Wels wins, the struggle for Diprus with Australia's famous post-class duals Michael Hubber and David Boccak will be important.
The 67-time audience Dipuri has played these two soldiers in the last several competitions, so he knows exactly what is going to happen.
The seven are completely worldwide, he added.
You all know that competition will be difficult while fighting with world-class Backward Wheelers.
Both of them are sustained to be the best lords in the world.
You know what kind of competition you are going to face.
Boccak, one of the world's best virgins to save the flock, is a slightly attacking mickeleton, who knows Rakbi at the right time.
You have to challenge yourselves, fighting with the world's leading fighters, rather than fighting with the backbone fighters who do not play well.
You would like to play against the best virgins, and when you play against these two soldiers, you should be with the best.
I don't say the contest to be finalised on Sunday, but this is our main competition in this world's anger.
The inspiration of the team is an important part of it.
It would be difficult to kill you if you are constantly playing specially and expressing a special performance.
Due to the increase in sea level, the danger of melting in the sea of Chennai
The IBCC has warned that 4 Indian coastal cities like Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Chennai have been incremental in the sea due to increased sea level of 27.
IBCC has published a survey conducted on the Monthly Change of AINA.
In this, at the end of this century, the marine waterway will rapidly deploy the Himalayas.
This will possibly possibly possibly possibly possibly possibly possibly possibly possibly possibly possibly possibly possibly possibilize the sea.
At the same time, many parts of North India will face severe water shortages.
The sea level is increasing rapidly as compared to earlier.
This will affect 1.4 billion people worldwide in the year 2100.
There is not only 4 coastal cities in India but also 45 port cities in the world, 50 cm of sea levels, and there is a possibility of flooding.
Due to the increased risk situation every year, the lower coastal nails and small islands are at a grave risk.
Moreover, if the urgent action is not taken to reduce global warming, the sea temperature will increase and the destruction of marine life will occur.
World-class marine foods will not be lost.
There is also a possibility of occurrence of wound marks.
The climate of the sea has doubled from 1982 to 2016.
This has been targeted in the survey.
Estententers Spilers: After Witney's shock, Pen kisses Kalam.
The tension between Witney Dean (Shona McCarthy) and her earrings has erupted once again in Estenders.
But will they both come about the relationship between them or the wrathful atmosphere
While he and Pen were gradually involved with the idea of going to Dateg, he recently called for Pen to show his weak and soft side, when he came forward to help Baby Bial to defend Pen's life.
Today, Vidney is returning from the holiday in a better mood than he left.
It is clear that after he knew that he was distracted by his wife and his husband, he had been away from the war, the best beneficiary.
When he comes home, his heart is connected with the footpath.
But quickly, the truth that he reveals is absurd.
JM Mitchell (Jemmy Portwick) is worried that he started drinking again at the ueen Wick Pap because he walks badly.
When he was drunk and sentimental, Paulam went to Pen and blamed him for all that happened to him.
Pen maintains peace and accepts the passion and disappears, and when they snatched a long time back, the disappointment of Kalam turns into uncontrollable sentiment.
But what will they go after that
The couple will go to Tetting next week, but Pen's intense thinking of his previous relationship is threatening to do everything that he has done.
But after the Homophobic appearance to his father, he wants a new self-confidence call, and he is determined to fight for a suitable one.
The shutdown is scheduled to be held on 27 September 8.30 in the Estonders sequence at the BBC on.
The white palace is very nervous because it is irritated to know what is under the circumstances of the post .
On Thursday, White House officials are defying how to confront the renewed efforts of the Democrats for the dismissal of the post, and one knows about the situation that the 'moorth fear' has come in the past week because there is no solution to this new problem.
An individual close to the White House said that the allegations made by secret reports could seriously affect the Chancellor and his surroundings, as it appeared to have increased 'difference, inconvenience and concern' in the West.
"There is no unbelievable situation here," the person said.
The White House officials are surely unaware of what to do, not because there is no clear plan for that environment, but because the presidential usual methods used in the past are not useful to avoid the disputes: 'It doesn't appear to be a disappearance when the next news comes.'
Another person, who knows about the suggestions, said that the White Houses have been shocked, and if the postponement continues, the President replied, "The possibility of going to uncontrollable" is increasing concern.
As the President is expected to increase pressure every day during the proceedings of the post, he expressed the same concern that some people around the Chancellor will continue to walk in sensitivity.
It provokes anxiety that the trend of trophy can not be calculated, and that it can be opposed in unprecedented ways - to worry both at the presidential and political levels in the election year.
As he faces an unprecedented threat to his presidential post, Robert Miller's revived the war that he was capable of during the Russian intelligence, turned into a defensive defence from the Trump attack.
Refraining from the actions of the Democrats and presidential candidate Joe Pitten, the secret publisher tried to suppress his demand to help the Ukraine Chancellor to investigate his political enemies.
But as many people in the White House have experienced Mullar Guinea, helpers and advisors said this time began to feel differently.
One known about the situation that he had lost his appearance on Wednesday's press conference, as it was believed to be strong as the president.
They said that the trump was unhappy with questions on Russian intelligence, as if they were not in the mood to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the Chancellor's allies believe that if they argue that this will reduce his credibility, they are not directly aware of the problem-based phone call between Tromb and Ukraine President Volodimir Chelenski.
Moreover, as often as possible, the Chancellor has been inclined to the end, the fact that his reality inspires the believers to defend him.
But one of the closest technicians to the White House said that the president's basic recognition points are already very high and the recognition of the new ones is not easily available.
'In the next four months, there is no benefit in paying attention to the President's post, particularly if it breaks his legislative proceedings and translates into a negotiated news.
Another party claims that those arguing that he could help the chancellor, who did not fully know how his response would be.
Disturbed White House officials are looking for advisors to help how to replace the post.
As efforts were still in the initial stages, the person said that the attempts like the war chamber would be more obvious or how it would be.
The person said that the obviously obtained priority was to oppose the public support against the release of the secret report and the release of the statement required integrated legislative and information statutory wars as a result of the rapidity of the Democrats' deployment attempts.
Foreign Minister Mike Pambyo and Finance Minister Steve Lunchin, who told the Ukraine chancellor that they were not going to release the invitation to the Trophy, said that there was no other way but to release the document after 48 hours, and the long-term vision showed that there was no war.
The man, who is expected to be more pressure than Robert Mulle's trial, is now being investigated by his allegations, said that a person who is expected to be inspired to create a replies for the post, who is supposed to be outside Troph Bull and former campaign manager, Gore Levandoski.
But in such an attempt, it was not true that he was heading.' Ansi News - Levandoski.
"I have done everything that I have done for the past five years to support each other and his plan, but I have not made any suggestions with the President about joining a team to resist the inadequate post.
J Chekulo, who is an external lawyer of Tropy from Mullar's investigation, is also involved in the attempts to swear.
When NIC News spoke about his remarks, Chekulo said, 'We can handle matters whenever possible.'
As Emmut Float, guided by the end of the Muller trial, worked at Clinton's post, the current legal advisors of the White House did not have the same experience, the lawyer who experienced the dismissal trial is no longer in the White House.
A deliberate person told the White House's war that none of the officers were close to coordinating or constructing wartime rooms - but the coordinated and all-connected response and the need to carry forward a political struggle.

For those who want to live in water, the swimming pond changed with imaginary capacity has played a game with a part of the Caribbean Rest House.
There are two modern waterfalls for adventure lovers in the ship while the swimming ponds and day beds around the islands are favourable to rest in the sunlight.
In accordance with all age groups, there is a variety of activities to spend time during the shipping journey.
For the children, the Sahab Samudra gives a chance to remember the children of the family, while the sports and musical portion designed for the fifteen-year-old.
If it doesn't go, the entire family can also participate in the dark-light laser reference sports with gratitude in the studio B of the ship and the place is also useful for the ice covering ring.
During the visit to the central coastal region, the enthusiasts have the opportunity to discover tasty food from all over the world through a wide range of foodgrains in the ship.
Recent Asian food items are available in the ship's Isumi restaurants, which Kyovanni's Buddhist Buddha can get the most satisfactory food in the ordinary organisation by eating traditional Italian food in New Italy Kishan.
The other restaurants in the ship include Sabs Crill American Steakhouse, Pholeros Latin Pear, Scunner Pear and Jani Rockets Expros.
With the selection of seven and nine nights of journey, this voyage vessel has emerged from Rome City in May, 2020.
As the second European ship of Royal Caribbean, it will recently collaborate with Alure of the Cice, which is a transformation of the mouth.
After the maximum spending of 165 million in the 58-day manufacturing, the previously registered residents were given a 300-valuable loan in the ship.
"The fourth vessel Explorer of the Pass, which has been transformed into a wizard in the modernisation of Rail Amplified Ships," the Director said.
The project, which has invested more than 1 billion in 10 ships in four years, has every part of the experience of the guests and provides a variety of silky foods and dinner life experiences with nowhere.
Tevin News blames Democrats for asking for 'Trump's Nirvana films.
It is obvious that the trial of President Donald Trump could not be done by Parliamentary Constituent David News (R-Calif).
On Thursday, he accused the Democrats of attempting to get the presidential nominations to defend him.
In the initial statement, News, chairman of the parliamentary intelligence committee, accused the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Pitten and his son of trampling Ukraine's help to investigate.
Previously, the Democrats wanted to see the presidential outstanding photographs, he said Ukraine Moscow was a 'strategic appearance' made by the leftists and their 'structural assets.
'The Democrats in this group have negotiated with those who thought they belonged to Ukraine to get the Trophic release films,' News said.
People can justify why they are determined to dismiss the Chancellor as they have a chance in another year.
After News concluded his speech, Hafbost senior political analyst Jennifer Pentry decided to find out whether the Democratic politicians want to deeply know the matter.
So far, the Connectivity Representative Jim Hayms (D) has just responded, but we suspect that many of his colleagues will believe his word is true.
Mediate.com is suspecting that the News comments on the Arrangements are describing more and more detailed and unsolved in the Circumstantial Steel documents.
It is a combination of explosive charges against the drums collected by former British trooper Christopher Steel, in which he says that it is possible to see sex workers in a hotel room in Moscow to 'strike water'.
It has been stunned that the description of student Udhi Suraya, who has been arrested in the neutral election, has been changed from the vote of Honey Medical College Chief Minister Rajendran to the CBCIT police.
Doctor Venkateson from Chennai's Tandiyaar settlement.
He is a doctor at Stanley Hospital in Chennai.
Her son, Udhi Suriah, made a mistake in the election.
In the investigation, students Udit Surya and her father Dr. Venkatesana were arrested by the CBCIT police.
In the investigation, Udhi's father Venkateson paid Rs.20 lakhs and supplied another student and supplied the son to the medical college.
Uddhi Surya and her father were arrested in court.
In this case, the Chief Minister of the Honey Government Medical College, Rajendran, was questioned by the CPCIT police (prior to questioning Uddh Surya).
There is a difference between his detail and his vote by Udit Surya to the CBCIT police.
In an explanation by the Chief Minister of Honey Medical College, Rajendran, the person from Hollytechnics participated during the student's admission.
On that basis, it is said that the student was involved.
The college Chief Minister said that Udit Surya was attending the meeting of the neutral select person, consultation and student and attending the cluster class.
But Uddhi Surya said that she had directly participated in the meeting and student participation in the vote.
How did Uddhi Surya join the college by putting a handicapped handicapped person in the film
Why did not you notice during consultation and student inclusion
The questions have been raised.
During student Udhi Suraya's admission, it has been revealed in the medical college that she has given her photographed self-saving list.
The films and films in Hall are different.
The vote by student Uddhi Suraya and the vote by the chief minister of the Honey Government Medical College Rajendran to the CBCIT officials is different.
Hence, the CBCIT police have also initiated an inquiry into the top officials.
Only if the results come out, the illusions will exist.
Who knows what's related to.
Sarath Pahar said that the Department of Implementation will appear before the cooperative banking system, and expressed his condolences that I will not surrender to the Central Government.
The Government Treasury has lost Rs. 225 thousand crore due to the delays in Maharashtra Cooperation Bank in 2007.
It is reported that the loss occurred due to the violation of the provisions, including lending to sugar plants and hundreds of plants.
Last month, the Mumbai Police had prosecuted senior nationalist Congress leader and former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and 70.
These include political leaders, cooperative banks, former executives and officials.
In this case, suddenly, the police have filed a case based on Ajith Pawar and Nationalist Congress leader Sarath Pawar.
Sarath Pawar was a former Marathi chief minister and a Congress-led state minister.
This action of the Department of Implementation has created a stir during the March 21 election next month (October) to the Maratha Legislative Assembly.
In this situation, Nationalist Congress leader Sarathbawer presented an interview to reporters in Mumbai.
Thank you for the implementation of this case, even if I am not a member of the cooperative bank or a decision-making place.
I don't have to be surprised at this.
I am often out of Mumbai for the assembly election campaign.
Therefore, the Department of Implementation should not misunderstand me.
I'm about to go to the Implementation Department office on Friday (day).
And I will give them the information they want.
They have the right to question the case.
I believe in political synagogue.
So I will give full support to the investigation.
Marathi follows the theory of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
We don't know how to move ahead of the Delhi airport.
Maratha's chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has denied the charge that he had a political intervention in this matter.
He said:
In order to prosecute the police, the ICORT has ordered the police to investigate the case as a result of a fraud of Rs. 100 crores.
Similarly, the case has been taken in the hands of the Department of Implementation.
It is wrong to say that this action has been taken for political reasons.
Renewable biofuel research can help in reducing smoke outbreaks.
In recent years, while electric cars and Tesla Chemical Tracks have been published as headlines, the renewable energy seems to have floated as if one flies without coming under the renewable resumption:
But a professor at Alberta University has created a technology that uses renewable biofuel as aerial fuel.
Dr. David Freschler, Professor of Agriculture, Life and Environmental Science, at Alberta University, launched the program in 2003.
Hydrocarbon fuel is being produced from libid wastes such as food oil, animal residue and canola oil.
Unlike Ethanal and other biofuels, it will be able to use decreasing oil in its manufacturing, allowing about 85 percent of petrol-based fuels to reduce carbon emissions and wastes from other factories during the process.
The technology is working to reflect hydrocarbons in petroleum-based fuels.
"Our technology has been done in the first trilogies, creating the same hydrocarbons in diesel chemicals."
As it provides a new impression for the use of biofuels, the previously built biofuel techniques lose stability in less temperatures, which creates a serious problem for the higher flying aircraft.
'The problem of sort of fuel is similar to the unprovoked Gatech-2.'
In fact, its value is less than diesel, but it needs more.
The Brussels University is currently focusing on two choices to produce biofuels for air.
In the first place, their hydrocarbon biofuels are a less dangerous approach to insert hydrogen.
Second choice is to keep fuel stable even in low temperatures and continue a part-made practical work.
"We can play some games with the chemical in our reactor," the Brussels remarked.
There is a greater risk.
Forge Hydrocarbons, an Alberta University sub-production firm, has been working to commercialize it as both the airlines and the Canada and the US military are making more investments for renewable choices.
He said that in the future, someone is expected to impose carbon tax on them.
They are expecting a change.
Forge is currently operating a test factory near Edmanton's waste management center and recently received US4 million investment from the Lackheed Martin to help build a 25 million manufacturing plant in Sompra in Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce 19 million litres of biofuel every year.
Brussels mentions that if carbon emissions are estimated to be reduced by 85 percent, however, the fact that carbon emissions are not very low.
"A technology-based person,"
The Brussels stated that it was possible to create choices and create a number of opportunities to choose.
The High Court has decided yesterday to examine the basic rights recognition conducted by Dr. Sehu Shahafuddin Mohammad Shahbi, a maternal and female doctor of the Gurunakal Pothana Hospital.
The petition is scheduled to be taken by the High Court on January 24.
It is worth noting that doctors have defended Shabby's basic human rights motion by arresting and detaining them by the Intelligence Department under various charges, including illegal seizure of seizure of seizures and unregulated funds.
Under the request of the Prime Minister for peace, the Prime Minister cautions the people for peace, following the warnings of the coalitions of Poris Johnson that Britain could face problems like Los Angeles if Frexid was withdrawn.
A senior Cabinet Minister said that due to the change in the second curriculum of the real decision, there is a possibility of rapid and people-electrion in the country.
The prime minister's senior coalition parties warned that the UK would face unrest at home over the yellow slaughter struggles in France and the level of Las Angeles in 1992 over economic upheavals.

If the fishing farmers in the paddy kitchens choose the gene-developed telephia fish, they will be able to grow faster than other fishes.

The MoU has been signed to examine the human bones found below.
Tamil Nadu Archaeological Survey, Madurai Kamraj University and Harvard Medical School have jointly signed MoUs to conduct DNA testing of ancient human bones extracted from Gonda and Adichalur bases under Tamilnadu.
D. Udayachandran, Principal Secretary, Department of Archeology and Commissioner, said: -

A large number of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and paralysis.
A new study shows that working with a large number of pesticides may lead to heart diseases in the past .
This was the case with a group of Japanese Americans in Hawail, which has been over three decades later.
Researchers found that in comparison to those who didn't work with pesticides, the most infected people had 45 percent more risk for heart disease or paralysis.
The study insists on the importance of using individual defence equipment at the time of industrial insecticides and the use of pesticides in medical tests and the importance of regulating ordinary heart disease risk factors," the Vice-Assister Dr. Betris Rodrix said.
He is an adult medical officer at Hai University, Manoa.
These inventions have emerged from the data received from more than 6,000 people from Ohu, who participated in the Guakini Honolulu heart attack.
As only men from the Japanese clan participated, the inventions are not applicable to women and others.
Because the insecticides are getting a long half-year-old, they may have suffered many years after spending their lives.
In the event, the maximum damages were reported within 10 years.
'After 34 years, there was no connection between insecticides and heart diseases,' Rodricks reported in a press release.
As other factors related to age are important, the possible linkage between pesticides and heart diseases in lifetime is possible.
Researchers found that there was no significant connection between at least to moderate insecticides and heart disease or paralysis.
Jalenski-Trump phone call: Porousengo's comment
After the US President Donald Tropy's withdrawal of the post, Washington became one of the busy politics this week.
Volodimir Chelenski, a less political experience, would have wanted to avoid dragging into a political fraud.
But what we have known about the Celensqui-Trump connection, is it a long-term impact on Celensqui
At the outset of the call, the US told Selensky that Ukraine was doing more than any other European countries.
Although the White House's phone call is not worded, the German leader and other European leaders are just saying that they are not proposing strong plans - German leader Angela Merkel's drumming.
The Trump is not accepted by 100 percent, but is considered to be a problem in response to Chelenski's claim that it is 1000 percent.
Selensky further stated that France President McChron and Merkel did not work enough to help Ukraine.
This conversation has published politicians, particularly opposition parties within Ukraine, in the social media.
Ukraine's former president, PETRO POSHENCO, commented in Twitzer that the European Union's assistance was 'until now.'
Porchenko said he was thankful to the help of the European Union, including bans and economic assistance during the 'Russia Occupied' in other tweets.
Ukraine politician Victoria Wansiska said, 'How can we speak again to Germany and France'
Tropically describing military assistance, not only Joe Pitten's son Hunder, but also the Hacked DNC server, he has to inquire about one or two matters, which indicates Ukraine's intervention in hacking Republican emails during the 2016 election.
It doesn't know whether relations with Europe will be banned or whether France and German Chancellors will break their relationship.
I don't want to say anything wrong...
Following the telephone correspondence, Celestine said in New York, "We thank everyone for helping us."
Celensqui will meet Russia, Germany and France leaders at the four-minute Normandi in October.
A thought that was peaceful, suddenly smooth and swimming stars passing closer.
If such an idea turns into a brighter perception, it is called 'Kuwasar.'
Scientists have seen the brightness of six such cavalry at the US's Palomar television point.
It has been surprising for thousands of years, even after six months, scientists have been surprised.

However, Tamilnadu and Karnataka have not been able to use water conservation schemes.
There will be no water problem between Tamilnadu and Garnadaka, which prevents the mixing of Kaavari water into the sea.
There has been no improvement in the case of Kaavari.
Kadkari said so.

Marijuvana Walking Police Closed in San Capriral Valley - CPS Los Angeles
El Mande (CPSLA) - A illegal Marishuvana hunting police station in San Capriral Valley closed on Thursday
The police raided the weekend for suspecting that illegal wife Vep Pena was sold at around 4.37 p.m. at a office building in the 9600 blocks of Telster Avenue - in larger varieties of phyutensic honey oil and enriched glass oil.
The LD Christopher Cano, located in El Mande police, told officials that an apparatus used by Web Cartridges was discovered.
He said, "This is a very dangerous process."
In the process of harvesting oil for use in vegetarian products, he said that there is a possibility of fire.
"When it is enriched, the normal level of electricity in our dresses will create a stigma in it," he added.
If there are many species and similar objects, the layer may completely burst into the eruption without bursting after one ordinary fire.
A Hasmat team was called to the office that was empty to seize the object that was illegal and dangerous.
The value of the seized materials and equipment is not immediately known.
The experts said that when they went to search for an indecent information they received, they found out an illegal activity.
Investigators are still trying to find out who is behind the illegal hunting operation.
Because the place was empty, they believed that the person might have built the office there.
As the investigation continues, they preferred to ensure that illegal hunting materials are not available to all, particularly recent reports on hunting.
'This is, in fact, what they don't know is what they want.'
It can be mixed with other bad chemicals.
This is very bad for our society and children, so we always warn that it should be avoided from these activities.
The dress of the first Elizabeth is to be displayed in the Hampton Court palace .
It has been embroidered in a magnificent bag full of plants, animals and peacocks, by the best cellblet.
Eleri Lenn, who is responsible for garment collection in the historical royal family palaces, is only one.
A hundred years ago, a small rural Paris was hanging in the wall of the church, which he saw, could be the first dress of Elizabeth's dress that was far away from Alamari.
Three years later, in the Hyerfordshire, Lyn's magnificent dress used as a altar in the church in Beckton, the Dutch ueen will be put to the scene next month in the Hampton court complex, in the same rooms that the Dutch queen wore it 450 years ago.
The 16th century clothing in the entire royal dragon will be the only significance of this invention.
Three years of research indicates that this clothing had to be part of the royal family's dress, despite no sworn testimony that Elizabeth had been worn by the queen in a time.
The price of clothed cloth is highly excellent, lawfully allocated to the most eminent members of the royal family, and the simplicity of the embraced plants and flowers, the high quality of elephants and dogs, buffaloes, fishers and a bear, showcases the high value of the former owner.
When this cow was built, it might have an equal value to the duty mansion.
Moreover, in the late 1950s, the other women in the state would not accept that their opponents had worn such a magnificent dress as they increased to compete with him.
This is a big thing, so many commentators came and went to see it.
When they saw it, they were astonished, and when they saw it out, it was always comfortable to see that it was only one of the dresses of the royal family.
It cannot be assumed that the second long life of the male hunter was cut back to be the altar of St. Faith Church in Beckton, which was unexpectedly found.
Beckton is the closest village of Blanch Perry, who has served him throughout the long life of Elizabeth Rani, and the local stories have long been associated with Perry.
Experts believe that the cloth was in the aftermath of his death in 1590s, but Elizabeth might have given it to Blanch's family or to the Paris church before his death in 1603.
After more than 1000 hours of preservation, more than 400 hours will be demonstrated by the very well-known utensils of the utensil, Elizabeth's comprehensive art paintings, which shows the wearing of such a couch in which Hatfeld House has been credited during the ongoing exhibition.
Liby Thomson, head of defence, said, 'When you work with vast dresses, is really respected for those who created them,' said that most of its security took place in the changed Green Tribals in Hampton Court grounds - even a larger place to place some of Arabic's precious scenes.
On seeing the front and posterior Embroidery, I had great respect for those who created it.
I have never worked in such a rich dress.
Elizabeth's dress is scheduled on October 12 at the Hampton court palace.
After the neat election, the incident of student Udhi Suriya, a student of Honey Medical College, came to light.
He has been arrested by the CBCIT police with the family.
In addition to this, the size assessment work of students has been intensified in all medical colleges.
In this case, there was a difference between the old photographs and the present image of the girl Jyotika and student Shiva Ramchandran at the PSG Medical College.
The investigation was conducted on behalf of the Department of Medical College.
Medical College Director Narayan Babu told reporters in Chennai today:
On 23rd, we were informed that the photographs of both students were a little disturbed.
Thereafter, we set up a five-member inquiry committee.
We interrogated both students and their parents.
We collected their certificates, neutral examination hall tickets and identification cards and compared the documents we have.
At the end of this survey, both students are sure that they are not worthy.
Even if there is a slight difference in films, this kind of problem arises.
Therefore, the Health Minister has suggested that the biometric process should be brought to the students from next year.
Biometric and caravan registrations will be implemented in the coming days.
The details of the students concerned are Open only if the contract is registered during the period of application, selection and student admission.
That's why no one can do this.
In this context, the students who were interrogated, including Shiva Ramchandran and Jyotika, spoke to reporters.
Jyotika said, "I was like a double jump in the film I gave.
It took place in school.
Now I have turned my hair.
So, it's not like that now.
They gathered me to look after it.
It's only a hair cut that has become a problem now and nothing else.
Ramchandran said that there is a difference between the size and the old picture.
I had only one photo.
It's an old photo.
So there was confusion and the investigation took place.
The Pondi Plastic Association has called upon Prime Minister Modi to save livelihoods of millions of workers.
Sankaran and Secretary VK Balu have written in the news: -
In India, plastic wastes are collected and recycled in streets and potholes.
Now all the blocked plastic items in some states across India are recyclable.
Due to poor and unemployment, plastic wastes are recycled from 60 to 70 in India already.
The remaining wastes can also be used in a useful manner.
Plastic ther Road 2. Electricity manufacturing 3. PETROL, diesel manufacturing 4. Plastic wastes can be used in different ways.
Once used, carie bags, which are considered to be one of the most important items, are given freely in the name of civilization to baking the material while buying goods in public markets.
All the waterfalls seem to be a grave graveyard.
Due to the dense density of the carriages, all other wastes leave the plastic in the waters and go to the waters.
Unfortunately, the plastic only moves up.
There are 40 thousand plastic manufacturing industries across India.
98 percent of the total live storage capacity of these reservoirs.
Similarly, there are thousands of shops selling plastic items.
There are 2,000 companies exporting plastic products.
About 50 lakh people are getting job opportunities in combination with both production and sales.
5 lakh crore and 50 thousand crore rupees have been provided to the central and state governments.
As far as plastic industry is concerned, there is no environmental problem in its production or its products.
But fortunately, the environmental problem arises due to lack of adequate awareness about environmental health.
Therefore, on October 2, we call upon thousands of young, small and medium enterprises dependent on the workforce to release announcements in order to save livelihood and to ensure that they are dependent on the workforce, without prohibiting any plastic material.
Thus, it has been reported in the news.

One third of the US's drug addiction caused by the head to cross Mexico.
Shortly after the sunrise of Chicago, CBS News visited Chicago's western part of the morning meeting for drugs.
Brian McNoid, in the Drug Administrative Management (DEA), demonstrated the daylight.
Nearly 800 people died in Chicago last year due to drug addiction.
McNait said that the '90 percent' of drugs in Chicago is coming from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the summary so-called Nemasyo Cervix.
'He is the first explicit priority for the DEA and the Provincial Law Enforcement Department in the United States,' Matthew Donhag, the principal agent of the DEA in Mexico, said.
The reward for El Manchesovan is up to 10 million.
He helped find dozens of L Mancheso in the forest to find drug tests.
At least one third of the drugs entered into the US by sea and soil will be Jellisco Neva Generasian or CJNC, the hijacker of Elmonchso.
According to the Justice Department, the smuggler has snatched Koken, Methambedaman and Herain, who were slaughtered in the Penton.
El Manchso's head was declared a 10 million prize.
30 years ago, when he lived in California, he was arrested for drug abuse and finally smuggled to Mexico.
That's where he began to brutally smuggle.
He has the highest number of weapons, RBGs and 50 carpets.
He has found himself self-savat groups on the basis,' Donhag said.
El Mancheso defended his kingdom in a penalties until he killed six people from the military helicopter in Mexico, until many were suppressed in the summer.
Thousands of people have died in recent years due to the violence of the hijackers.
According to Mexico government figures, about 94 murders occur every day.
Mexico drugs captured in Chicago are very poisonous and cannot handle them without security cover.
In the checkpoint, the smugglers are printed in cocaine bakers.
More than a third of it can be seen as L. Manchso's posture.
'He is the reason for sending a murderous thing to parents and children,' Donhag said.
Thus, Donhag said that if someone dies of a child, those drugs would be 'expected' to come from the composition of L. Manchso.
More than 67,000 Americans died last year due to drug addiction.
Union Minister Shri Jitendra Singh has said that those who do not pride in calling Prime Minister Modi as the father of India should not call themselves Indians.
Everyone knows that the leaders of the synagogue have been misinterpreting Gandhi and yesterday.
A few hours before the Hawdi Modi event in Houston, USA, Union Minister Amitsha said that Pakistan's occupation was the reason for Kashmir.
A few days back, many musicians including Pragya Thakur have praised Gandhi and praised Kodsey.

Instead, US President Trump has praised Modi.
In his speech, he said that there were bitter divisions in Hindi, and as the father of this country, he removed the divisions and made it solidarity.
Generally, when Gandhiji became the father of India, it made many shocks.
Congress senior leader Anand Sharma said, 'Howdy Modi, who has joined him, is using the event to campaign for the drum.
This is a very wrong thing.
It is also wrong to replace Gandhiji as the father of India.'
Union Minister for Communications, Jitendra Singh said, 'US President Trump has praised our Prime Minister as the father of India.
Some people have opposed this.

Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Aryasingham pointed out the compilation of the Pandang principles in New York's meeting of the Parsera movement in New York because the global multilateral mechanisms were screwed up.
Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Aryan Singh's speech said:
Foreign Secretary Aryasinghe underscored the pattern of the Pandang principles as global multilateral mechanisms were screwed up.
As part of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Secretary Ravi Nath Aryan Singh underscored the implications of the Pandagu principles while the global multilateral mechanisms were lazy while addressing the Ministerial Meeting of Parsera movement in New York on September 26, 2019.
The movement includes 55 percent of the world's population, which is its religious obligation to voice the debts of the Southern world, particularly the growing smaller countries.
Sri Lanka reaffirmed its commitment to the efforts of the Parasera movement to confront current global challenges to national borders such as conflicts, migration, climate change and infectious diseases.
Traditional defence threats such as climate change are not only economic and social challenges, but also the defence threats affecting society and countries due to man-made disasters.
Secretary Aryazing expressed deep concern over the negative impacts of climate change in countries like Sri Lanka, while welcomed the summit for the UN General Secretary's climate-related actions at the United Nations headquarters on September 23, 2019.
The Foreign Secretary expressed hope that the COP25 in Chile would increase its efforts to counter climate change by fulfilling the obligations mentioned in the Paris Agreement.
Sri Lanka is particularly important in opposing all kinds of communal, hate and violent extremism, and it is necessary to pay attention to new threats that eastern day attacks in Sri Lanka.
Such a global threat threatens the security of all nations and calls for the Paradera movement to participate in a positive and optimistic way of contributing to this global defence threat, not a single country can handle it alone, but a joint effort.
Sri Lanka believes in an independent society that has been confirmed free of opinion, but the foreign secretary said that the hate speech should be awake about the threat of misuse of Internet and social media bases.
'Sustaining the principles of sovereignty and political freedom as a means of maintaining international peace and security and enhancing relations and cooperation between the nations,' the consequences of the meeting were accepted by a document.

The Harris County Sheriff officials reported that Stephen Stay, 39, Cathy Stay, 33, 13 and four-year-old two boys and 9 and 7-year-old girls were killed when Haskel shot.
Only one person from that family, when only 15-year-old KCT station survived.
After some time he was completely cured, officials said he was injured at that time.
The middlemen rejected Thursday's unanimous claims that Ronald Lee Haskell had been expelled.
The court was postponed until Monday for the sentence.
Kuvandam Internet encircles trumpets: Science daily
The decision of a US military research has brought Kovandam's Internet closer.
Such a network will provide unprecedented security, demonstration and time-long capacities to the army in common network approaches.
The Inspractic University researchers witnessed a record of transforming 50 kms of far-reaching Kuwait by using fiber optical cables between the US Army's resistance and capability development, the Center for information distributed by the Military Research Office of the University of Guantam, which will be managed and managed by the Military Research Office of the University.
Behind is an interaction between cubic metals like cubicts.
The connection between the two cubicts, the one being counted, the other will be affected by the end of the cubicide, even if the second cubicide is at the top.
'This [50 kilometres] is more likely than possible, the level of two orders in the town and the procedure to start the Kuwaitam network between the cities,' the research physician from the University of Insprak and his inventions have been published in the National German Kuwaitam Infermation.
The Kuwandam networks between the cities are built by the telephone tips of the Portuguese Cubetes, which are very far away, but will be irritable.
Researchers said that subsequent distribution is not necessary to establish the Kuwandam network.
"This is a key step to pursue a largely distributed background," said Sarah Kemble, Joint Chief of the Army Staff, who supported the research.
After traveling through fiber, the backdrop level on the reverse is also higher than the requirements of some of the most difficult Kuwaitam network uses.
The research team started the investigation by plus accumulated calcium in one of the iron textures.
Using laser lights, the researchers inspired a bubble on iron, while the bubble was inspired by the data collected.
Consequently, the climate of the nuclear and lights followed.
It is a challenge to send a fountain through fiber optical cables.
'Footton's network of calcium iron is 854 nanometers, which is quickly scratched by the optical fiber,' Lion said.
His teams, therefore, first sent the lights to the path of the nefarious reading that was published by the strong laser.
The network of Bhutan has been transformed into a long-term journey - the current standard network of far-reaching 1550-nanometer.
The researchers then dispatched the potato 50 kilometer long fiber optical cable.
Even after the wave change and a far-reaching journey, their estimates showed that the nuclear and light pieces were still in the background.
These decisions provide direct access to a long-term nuclear network to enable the use of calcium, as it can be combined with a high-level Cupid.
Military researcher Dr. Fretrick Fatemi, who is also the Vice-President of the scheme, said, is required to use a large number of background watch networks, precise conditions, guidance and direct uses.
