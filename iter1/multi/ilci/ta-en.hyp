This way every year the interest of tourists starts decreasing .

In the middle of all this there is no doubt in attracting the tourists on the pleasant palaces of RTDC i . . beautiful train .

Karsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Tea hotels are full of summer jungles .
Tea is famous for production of excellent type of tea .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then initially the tea gardens laughing and coming towards itself are welcomed .
For the first time going through the road between tea gardens charms the heart .
On the one side of the jungles covered with green mountains on the other side is deep dense dense .
There was a time when we had come to see tea gardens .
On all four sides is the Green Empire .
Once I am confused see these natural forests or these tea plants made by human beings .
Both are pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful the jungle the more beautiful the tea garden is spread far and wide .
If you go to the roads then the view is amazing .
The snakes are moving like a narrow and circular path .
The time was spent .
But forests and tea gardens keep on coming .
At places small - small settlements are found .
From a distance one mountain house - house etc . are very dense .
This was Karsiyang .
Staying at one place here we make programs for roaming throughout the day .
That is , by taking a car you can go out of Karsiyang .
First of all Dyer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by forests all around .
The train goes very down to reach from above .
Even though Karsiyang is full of beauty , there is no popularity of development in tourist spots .
Although the city is sufficient and clean .
It is a pleasant feeling of passing through the passion between the trees and the passion of reaching till the Deer Park without desert the road .
The next place was Islakhar .
This city is situated at the next height .
It is called sucous point ' .
It is said that in the days of the British angels snatched away from here .
Bhil hall , this is a garden and a restaurant .
There is a stairs of land here which has a beautiful view of viewing the entire city from its height .
In the tea garden nearby the women were throwing tea after shifting the tail behind the jungles at a fast speed .
There is a museum outside Karsiyang city but on that day we should not go out because according to the environment of tea gardens tourism is very important .
The next day was going to visit Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself but the biggest concern is that how to roam here rains .

Here tea gardens are not only greenery but forests , waterfalls are also found .
Kalimpong is the most popular picnic spot -LRB- Lava and Lolegaon -RRB- which is full of forest waterfalls .
Sometimes the damage occurred in Kalimpong this time is not possible .
We reached Darjeeling in the winters that tea plantation spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling built us .
I got more interested and thrilled with this small journey .
This journey is very near to Jaipur outside not only foreign but also outside Rajasthan .
Tourists enjoy one thing on their own in which when the journey draws towards itself then continuously there is a special place , water ship or a city like a railway or a Rose city or a Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people are being attracted .
This place has been built around four and a half years ago , in reality with this organization these places make the wilderness magnificent .
Not only to go there but also to stay there .
In my ears the words of my handicraft Rambabu Meena reflects that we could not even imagine before this that we lived in the wilderness .
50 percent workers are in this area .
Suddenly people coming here did not even work in heritage hotels .
Ajabgarh resident Rambabu had earlier worked in Jaipur and now this unique estimation is in the aman garden .
He gave a new shape while talking to himself .
Sakiba ' is an honor of aman garden .
There nobody calls you English .
Amn Garden is actually a peaceful place and a tourist place with all the best facilities .
This garden is its history and the best thing is that it introduces its nearby areas as well .
For spending holidays in the best statistics of Rajasthan how many people can go to the forests of the past , why can they go far , some people of Jaipur can often spend night in this area .
After opening the Amn Garden many people from within and outside come here .
I remember that night when Sapna Asmi called me very interestingly but I could not go .
If they had come to Bangadh after finding the way themselves then it would be different .
This time suddenly after the invitation of my foreign guests I felt that these people want to spend a good holiday in less time therefore they should definitely go to the aman garden .
This garden is a separate garden protected from those seven gardens where Alwar king had gone for hunting .
Its construction was done in 19 - 20th century .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
In the shadow of the dense and dense trees surrounded by mountains the Ammon Garden in the first part charms itself .
Just as you enter inside you will be welcomed in the same way , therefore it is said that you can experience the peaceful environment here .
Mangalore Mantra is lifted very fast along with making a slope in Manikarn .
We reached Dalhousie in the evening and tried to roam around that garden .
My guest Jaiki was adorned with a jewellery and immediately spoke so that it was interesting .
There is also a collection of luxury artists here .
Everything is beautiful .
There is no surprise in getting the award of Amman Garden because everything is modern artistic .
Manager gave us our program in the morning.
First of all we walked with Babu and then went to the jeep for Bangadh .
On reaching the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajbabad , in which gradually the sun light was spreading .
On looking at the dry lake the farmer was cropping in it .
This year we saw the forests of tobacco for the first time due to lack of rains .
The rural life of Jok was a unique experience of such an environment .
After that we went to Bangkok by jeep .
In the morning I saw Hollywood sitting very carefully at a tourist place .
In such a situation there is an invaluable moment of millions of dollars .
Alvida also told us that traditionally from the aman garden had given us jaggery and curd .
Tourists can know why they come here for so much money .
I am told that a tourist group is formed to show the life of the tribals .
Is it right
Indeed this is found in some states and tourism shows special interest in it .
This tourism is generally organised for 4 days to 2 weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this how to eat stay there .
In such an explanation attempt is made where there is not much development and there is no prejudice in the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time there are ancient tourist species too .
Besides this it is also taken care of the survey of the tridental cuisine .
In reality tourists like this can be seen directly in the lifestyle and tradition of that place .
Although it is a little difficult to think , but going to such a tourism gives interest and gives a different kind of experience .
Tourists are very enjoyable in the bus .
You can enjoy roaming in a different way even if you see a crowd of people here .
Not only this , in this journey you can take more time to read your favorite book .
Yes , along with spending less and every time giving peace to mind this journey also makes us feel satisfactory .
For celebrating this it is important to keep in mind some things at a particular time when you can see any foreign destination bus tourism .
Find the best deluxe before getting the ticket .
For students , military people , children etc . tickets are available here .
In such a way it is better to buy an advanced journey therefore it is better to arrange tourism in the last trains in the bus , then make arrangements beforehand .
Instead of traveling , tell them about round trips .
The cost of the morning is also less .
It is very important to carry things , therefore keep in mind the things of obesity and weight .
You lose some of your things by term or fill the electrical substances .
Along with this take the pleasure of insurance or destruction from the tourist group .
Take the fare on box comfortable .
Because it can be applied on the rock above the seat .
It should be kept in mind that during the tourism the responsibility of changing things from bus to bus is on its own .
If you have a bus then go ahead at that time and an hour before .
If it is time for bisi sustenance then you should keep this thing in the main stage .
In reality as soon as you go , the better suite arrangement will be done near you .
While selecting hair keep in mind the facilities .
Take the back position too much , but it is not possible to read in the front arms .
If you have to urinate again and again take a far-flung bed , if you do not want to make much trouble then the bed near the door is better for you .
Now there is a mesmerising thing .
If you are both sitting in the seat sitting in the seat then first sit in the seat on the edge of the edge and keep your back on the other side .
Therefore if there is no crowd in the bus then your arrangement will be successful .
Therefore while examining the seat if there is a washroom facility in the bus keep in mind this thing also that it is difficult to sit there after some time .
Introduce bus driver and contactor .
This way you will get enough information .
Everyone is told to come out while cleaning the child .
During this time do not put yourself on the seat because if it is lost then the people of the busy people will not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stands , go back to the time .
If you do not go on time then you can see a new passenger in your place and you have to wait for another bus .

Trans Maldives is the best in which there is a sea plane nearby .
If you want then you can roam around in an air for about 4000 rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- or complete blade can be left for you to travel throughout the day .
If you are going from Maldives to the roaming island then it is necessary to make a journey in C . Blain because it is common to travel amidst different islands .
This is a journey which is a danger because of which if there is fear in the mind then do not travel in it .
C . Blain travels from 12 kms to 183 kms on Maldives .
We were in the most artistic and sovenient markets of the capital of Ahmad Bazaar of Maldives .
All the cells are listening to the words given by the President of Maldives Mohammed Nasit a day before in the Cauvan Halls with great care .
I am confident that even a Hindustani has not heard the words of the President or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But when it is challenged in the base of an unparalleled army of this land then it is such a terrible thing .
Some people know the mantra of the people who go inside through the capitulation of Maldives in October very well because the world becomes so impoverished when they snatch the anger of nature from us .
Some of the beauty there are such specialities .
There is no such beautiful tomb in that small country .
After roaming around the market they return to the pocket to go to their guruj then surely while paying attention to the road there is food in sea water because the people here cross this beautiful border .
Fishes swimming in a few metres deep under the light of Lamp Bongt were sighting with all their colors .
It was a sea part which was connected with the city .
If you can clearly see a few centimetres of river or sea water connected with any city of India then you can enjoy yourself .
After returning to M . . Academy they keep on roaming in the jewellery for two hours in the evening .
Goraleriff -LRB- buffalo -RRB- is the life here .
Until now you will find stones and rocks carved on the roofs .
In order to listen to the words of President Nasik some governments were standing outside again .
We were ahead of the prestigious headquarters of a country and had no security for far and wide because we could not believe .
With joy we took photographs on the garden and roadways at a distance of approximately 50 metres .
Can you imagine this by bringing in the house of a common head in India .
It is said that the president had always come to his office ahead of two blocks passing through roads .
Everything is unforgettable in the matter of Maldives .
That is why I was expecting the next day indifference .
That day had to be important for good dress .
In the morning from Guruji a boat entered us till the airport Jalland .
From there we reached the place of Trans Maldives roaming around in the Ranvel .
After that when Guruji had come out of Maldives in the evening we immediately recognized C . Blain coming out .
We were watching his so many maps .
But then there was no doubt because the next day there was a chance to pay attention to it .
We had to go to Rangali Island at a distance of 500 kilometres from the Chilly Bridge of Trolls Maldives .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of restaurants and goral islands spread over the sea of Maldives from the cliff flying till about 1000 metres .
This beautiful water is not available anywhere .
This is a journey to stop breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But as soon as Hilton Hollon ' s Chin Gonrad resort goes to Ranki Island we feel that we have come to another world .
In such a world , there was no relation with any other world outside .
It was difficult to get out of the beauty or wealthy life there .
One can go on foot in Konarat or by train running in Petroleum .
While going from Jetty to the main island on both the sides of the bridge the shoe of life was amazing .
Now we have come to the unimaginable imagination that we could not be natural with the nearby nature .
We went to a glass room after getting down in the sea water several metres below the stairs which was inside the water .
This half was actually a food room .
Through glasses all around we can see marvellous types of small - big fishes , gorals , snow climbing and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating sitting on decorated tables keeps on thrilling in itself .
The fare of seeing and drinking food below the water is 47 thousand rupees per person .
There is no feeling of returning from there .
We were ready to swim in our passport water .
We know it's not going on.
We returned with the same belief in our hearts , then sometimes luck will definitely bring us back .
There was a plan to go to Wali from Delhi for a long time but because it had been done in work it was not possible .
Because of the desire of wild animals from the child we thought that why this time we should not go to Jim Corbett .
After skiing till Yekong lake a little more distance from Kardukula in Ladakh in 2006 it was another picnic .
In the morning of 27th December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but the bustle with which we left our speed decreased .
The journey between Hapur and Kaziranga was really tired .
The snow and the thick road ahead from the top .
Many times it appeared that when we were going to fall .
One way we reached Karzorola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett National Park is at a little distance of 20 kilometres from Ramnagar .
We had already registered the deluxe near our resort park .
Because of no major event today we went to roam the shore of Kochi first after getting cold .
After two - three hours we went out to the Corbett Museum , which was very difficult at a distance of 2 kilometres near Thangdi Gun .
From there we went to Ramnagar for a few days .
It took a long time to return .
We went out after deciding from Delhi that if we saw a tiger riding in the jungle then I could see a tiger in a dream overnight .
In the midst of a deep night suddenly I heard a strong sound , after which the dogs began to sneeze and did not stand for two hours .
Therefore first comes on the way to Kaldungi and Corbett falls .
There was a museum of Jim Corbett Aiya in Kaladungi where some familiar items related to personal life were kept .
The museum of Jim Carpet Aiya in Kaladungi .
There was a time when we had to come back .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett lived in this village only .
When we reached the hotel we were waiting for our visit to the Safari Gypsy .
He said that he had arranged to roam there in the Saint Fijrani .
When asked about the number one , the tigers come towards that direction because they are more than that .
As soon as we reached Bijrauli we found a guide , we bought a hundred fifty rupees for four hours touring .
We went out to go inside the forest .
There are many types of birds and many types of monkeys seen here .
Inside we saw two teeth of elephants , they had long teeth .
I picked up the film standing .
In the midst of this the guide started dragging the Fili .
The guide said that there are about 150 tigers in the park in which some tigers died in the same year .
At many places we saw their feet but because the tiger was not able to see it I am sorry .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my brain the deficiency of not seeing the tiger was running .
Then I remembered my old friend of Halduvani .
I contacted him on the phone.
I told him I'm coming to the carpet.
He asked if he had seen the tiger or not .
His word was like a peacock .
I wasn't slow.
There is no permission to take the bag to the park .
One told us that to go inside take a chewery .
