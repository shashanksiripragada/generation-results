Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch is Sind and on the other side Gujarat therefore there is a mixture of both in languages .
It is called ' Kachchi ' .
Although this is ' bolly ' its not its own script .
If you want to write Kachchi then you have to write in the Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj itself is that Anjar city where earthquake has occurred many times and the entire city has been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the monument of Jaisal - Toral .
The story of Jaisal - Toral is very interesting .
If we come from the same way that way we will have to take a whole month ' s lunch and on this side the schools will be opened in Mumbai .
So what to do  Now we will travel in the railways by comforting fast buses of Gujarat .
The small train of metre gauge from the arm will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of metro gauge will reach Ahmadabad and from Ahmadabad a big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
Tourist industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is passing through bad times these days .
Due to the increasing threat of global destiny and south Asia tourism business has been a big hit .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan included in the major states of the country has been recorded very less these days .
The latest statistics published recently by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased more than 10 percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics the number of national tourists has come down by 9 . percent and the number of foreign tourists by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 national and ten lakh 77 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried because of this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Holiday makers of Rajputa says that global destiny and terrorist incidents have completely affected tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we could not develop even the strong infrastructure of tourism there .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Of the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the highest .
After this the tourists of Germany , England , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism the recent years have been excellent for Rajasthan .
After 2002 this is the first time that the number of tourists has come down in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism nothing is happening .
Deserts , havelis , forts , forests everything is old to serve tourists .
In the tourism area the government talks about working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years incidents of abusiveness and humiliation have also made this royal image of international level .
Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry in the state years ago but it has remained consolidated only till papers .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Ltd . -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan Government towards tourism .
With the aim of encouraging tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic structure of tourism the Rajasthan government had constructed RTDC in 1987 .
This corporation provides facilities of residence , food , transportation , boating etc . to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 big , eight cattle , three travellers , one automobile accommodation and two train Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the situation of this corporation has also worsened for many years .
The deficiency of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in the year 2009 - 10 .
The situation of the hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years forty percent rooms of their hotels are also not filled .
Along with the hotels other groups of the corporation are also making it a big mistake .
Among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
This has not become the attraction of the tourists towards the railway .
Despite reducing the fare they could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair has also been seen to be less .
In the year 2007 - 08 where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC in this fair , this number decreased to 217 this year .
Among all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC has been that there is no dearth of tourists ' attraction towards Palace on Wheels i . . royal train .
This railway is continuously benefitting .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of Rs . 9 . 9 crore from this railway .
With this deficiency situated in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the mind of the person then he can make gold from the soil .

Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The eyes fall on the redness while standing in the sky on the horizon between the snow laden mountain range of the left hand .
There is good cold in the air .
Along with the coolness in the environment one also feels the feeling of moisture .
From the sound of garbage below the feet the skulls of snow covered on the surface of the wood are seen .
There is silence in the atmosphere and because of the darkness before sunrise being shadowed much was not visible .
The eyes become stable on the redness of the east .
There is consciousness of sitting on the stairs lying in the sky .
On touching hands the smooth skull of the glitter sticks with the sound of normal garbage and the hands get separated from the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending night coming in this small village situated amidst these hills covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third tour in Swiss .
Before this he spent a lot of time living or just around it .
On both the sides of the small flowing river and the dense population settled in the valley is spread far above the normal slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland Rhone , on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The narrow highway of the Ron river and the cars running on it start clearly visible .
Half a journey of 300 kms from the car and half an hour from the car along with the equivalent to the Geneva lake and half the Ron river coming from the eastern direction along with the Geneva lake which is called Lock Large in Fench .
100 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide this lake is situated Geneva city on the western part of the lake .
From there the lake again goes towards the west after becoming a river .
On the left side is Dhaval , Gaganchumbi Alps mountain ranges .
After crossing a beautiful small city named Luke we left this highway on the hilly path of the north .
Because of the slope of the mountain being southern , the sun of the afternoon is giving full sunlight to all the corners .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here - almost not like .
As we move towards height , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite being frozen on both the sides of the road there is no special coolness in the air because of clear sky and shining sun .
After completing a journey of about 20 kilometres on this circular hilly road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal .
Chalet slope is full of roofs , large large large bungalows made of wood .
There are rooms to control necessary services like electricity , water , Dhobi Ghats along with parking of vehicles in Bhoyara built with cement cockroach of three storied bungalows .
Valai is famous for grape farming in Switzerland .
This alcohol is the main center of making wine of grapes .
The farming of grapes is done on 37  of the entire canton terrain .
In villages situated on both the sides of the Ron Valley the grapes garden provide a unique area to its beauty .
To go to the grapes garden , taking dinner rest in the villages there and taking alcohol in the factory of wine is an integral part of the tourism business here .
There is a very big museum of grapes wine in a fort built in 12th century in a small village named Age , to see which foreign tourists have to register before .
Once again we come out from the same jungle that was embroiled from Dawanal .
By the questions coming to the children on the entire road for three - four kilometres the mind becomes very happy .
Suddenly on one side a dramatic and charming change comes from the scene .
Just in front of the road on the slope above the deep valley on the right side a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in snow on the clear slope from above the village .
The dense forest of Deodar is situated till the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope .
There is a lot of snow on all four sides .
The roofs of the houses of the village are shining due to the direct rays of the sun falling .
In five minutes we reach that village .
There is also peace here .
From the peaks of the mountains to the valleys all around the empire of white snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big golf course in the middle of that village .
The name of the town is Lukarabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Lukarabad is around 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here can be estimated from the fact that there are 1700 apartments with capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants to stay here .

On reaching the village one feels full heat .
In the blooming heat on the roof of houses the large layer of snow is shining .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one of the ' protected as national importance heritage ' in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can go only the taxis of Sikkim therefore there is no check up .
The journey is going on , the state is second , but the mountain is the same , the trees and plants are the same .
The moisture accumulated on the whole body is the same .
This is the same with blue colored glass in the environment of monsoon .
On the completion of the plan of Darjeeling journey it was decided to see Karsiyang first .
Carsyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of dust jungles .
Famous for the production of excellent tea .
When we moved towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then initially welcoming the tea gardens to come towards itself .
In the middle of the tea garden passing through the road charms the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with forests , on the other side deep green valley .
On this side sometimes wilderness and sometimes tea gardens are seen .
There was a kingdom of greenery all around .
Once I fell uncomfortable , see these natural forests that plants of tea planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The beautiful jungle was as beautiful as the tea gardens spread far and wide .
If you look at the roads of the road then the creation looks marvellous .
The circular and circular path of the snake was passing .
Time was also passing .
If we were not passing , then jungles and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance itself a hilly house - house etc . started looking very dense .
This was Kerseyang .
Staying here at one place we made a program of roaming throughout the day .
Therefore taking a car we went out on a tour of Kerseyang .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
To reach up to the climbing i . . deer park the vehicle had to be left very low .
Besides the beauty of Kerseyang the beauty of Kerseyang has not been developed in the form of a tourist destination .
Although the city is very beautiful and clean .
Despite being desolate the road the joy of reaching till the Deer Park surrounded by the jungles and climbing the road between the dust trees was giving us adventure .
The next place was Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that during the days of the British lovers used to give life by jumping from here .
Now , this is a park and a restaurant .
There is a stairsed dome here from whose height a beautiful view of the entire city is present .
In the tea garden nearby women were tired of breaking tea leaves running hands with a very swift speed on their backs .
There is a museum outside the Kerseyang city on which we could not go there that day because it felt very necessary to tour the exciting environment of this garden .
The next day it was decided to roam Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was a big concern that if such rains were coming then how would we roam .
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching Rock Garden we roamed while enjoying the bright sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place bathing with wide stones , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than that .
Going a little more down from here we found the Ganga Maa surrounded by hills .
The mirror of the waterfall amidst the wide rocks from here is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we saw that the waterfalls in the empire of the rocks - wide rocks are spectacular here then the view of the waterfalls in Gangamaya is decorated with the stones of the world .
These two places are very low amidst the hills of Darjeeling .
On climbing up with the help of vehicle we saw Batasia Loop in Darjeeling .
With the help of telescope the entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here .
The magnificence of the weather was still clean .
But where we moved towards Monastery , decreased as if from where we were present and started shining .
In the evening arrangement of roaming and shopping was done on the mall road .
Toy train increases the enjoyment of journey in the tour of Darjeeling .
The journey of Toy Train from Darjeeling to Dharamshala and Dhum to Darjeeling is special attraction for tourists .
Here some rest in boating and garden in Mirk lake .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where handmade sweaters of Nepali artisans are available .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is the only city of Darjeeling district , but its form - color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here but the commutation of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist places of Kalimpong are - Laua and Lolegaon which are full of forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to tour Darjeeling in the shadow of cold , but here the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling stopped me .
A small journey of my recent past was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither foreign nor outside Rajasthan but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is a interesting subject in itself in which sometimes travels towards itself , then sometimes there is a special place , water ship or a royal train or a city like a pink city or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come dragging .
The place where I am going to talk is ready just four and a half years ago , but the preparation that this place is situated there has actually made fun in the jungle .
Not only for people going there but also for those living there .
The words of my guide Ram Babu Meena echoes in my ears , Sahiba could not even think before that that we could live like this in the jungle .
50 percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not get work even in the heritage hotel .
The residents of Ajbgarh Rambabu used to work in Jaipur earlier and now this unique royal style in Aman Bagh .
They had put themselves in a new color to speak .
Sahiba ' is the estimate of Aman Bagh .
There no one calls you from English conversation .
Aman Bagh is really an incomplete peaceful and all comfortable tour .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also introduces you from nearby areas .
Some of the people spending holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have toured Bhawangarh of the past .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have gone there .
I remember that night also when Shaban Azmi had called me there with a thug but I could not go .
It is different that they had reached Bhangarh by forgetting the road themselves .
This time suddenly when I reached there on the invitation of my foreign guest then I felt that those who want to spend a grand holiday in less time , they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is a garden surviving from those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to stay for hunting .
Its construction was done in nineteen and twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of the park situated in the shade of dense trees surrounded by mountains charm you .
The way you come inside , the way you are welcomed , it seems that divine peace has been given attention here .
Live upgradation of the mantra of Mangalchar is done along with the Mauli Building in Kanda .
We had reached in the evening and we thought of hitting a cycle in front of that garden .
My guest who has been decorating a decorative , suddenly said , ' This is very interesting ' .
All the havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic .
The manager fixed our program for the morning .
First of all on foot journey with Ram Babu and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajbgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
The dry lake was seen in which the farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw tobacco farming .
For which such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning - morning I saw a tourist from Holland sitting in deep concentration .
This is an invaluable moment of million dollars .
The way to call Aman Bagh ' s gift was traditional , by feeding jaggery and curd they farewell us .
Now we came to know why travellers come here spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept to show people 's life .
Is this the right thing
Indeed this happens in many states and tourists also show a lot of juice in it .
This tour is generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It includes eating and drinking there .
In this way attempts are made to search places where there was not much development and there was no effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this where places worth visiting for ancient tourists are also available .
Besides this , traditional cuisines are also taken care of .
Actually the goal of such a tour is to make the tourists experience the life style and traditions of that place .
Although it looks a little difficult to think , but such a tour is really interesting and gives a different kind of experience .
Just tourism has its own joy .
Because of this despite being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time to stop without your favorite book .
Yes , it is necessary that along with giving a lot of time with less expensive and peace tourism keeps the demand for your courage .
This is the reason that to accept it some things have to be taken care of , especially then , some foreign places are going with the help of bus travel .
Check the best package before taking the ticket .
Students , learners , learners , children etc . get discourse on it , then there is also a discount arrangement for two people .
However , buying tickets beforehand has to be cheap , therefore in the last moment instead of fixing bus tour it is better to organise a little earlier .
Get information about circular journeys without tickets on both sides .
This is cheap .
Regular rules are very strict for goods , therefore ask about the height and weight of the goods .
Somewhere it does not happen that you have to leave your luggage at the station or you have to pay more fees .
Also know the rules of insurance or loss compensation from the tourist company .
Building bags are appropriate , walk with them .
Because it comes in the horse properly above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of the goods will be yourself .
From where you have to catch the bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the coming season you should take special care of this point .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will have the better seat choice .
While choosing the seat pay attention to the improvement .
If you feel a lot of shock at the last seat , then reading on the front seat will not be correct .
If you have to go to urinate again and again then take a seat with a corner and if you do not like to be very troubled then windowed seat will be good for you .
Now the matter of a walker .
If you are in a two-seat crack , then sit on a cornered seat beforehand and put your bag on the other .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then the plan will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus , then while choosing the seat keep in mind this thing as well because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Make identity with bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus everyone is called to go out .
During this do not keep your luggage in the seat because they do not take responsibility for the buses of their disappearance .
Wherever the bus stops , come back at the time .
If you do not come in time , then you can get a new place and you will have to wait for another bus at the station .

After this if you stay in Malay even then you can get hotels in less fare but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then it will be very small .
C cruise proves beneficial here .
In the first week of December Lui Cruise had started India ' s only C cruise for Maldives and Colombo from Kochi .
Lui Cruise is a European company and is very small in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some situations Lui Cruise has already stopped its services , but there is a possibility of recurring from October .
You can go on a trip to Maldives for a three-day cruise at the rate of at least 5850 rupees per person on the ship MV Aquarium of Lui Cruise .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are big then children below the age of 15 years are completely free .
What else should be needed
The rent of cruise includes tea - breakfast , food everything .
With the entertainment of every time .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainments , activities available in Maldives from the point of view of your interest - From the sea plane ride to the underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly a single plane is standing in front of you then you will feel like a sportsman .
But this twin Oter Plane with 12 - 15 seats is undisputedly excellent for touring the island group like Maldives .
Walking like a speed boat on the surface of the water when it flies in the air , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not feel the flight of normal airplanes .
Every time your eyes keep shining below the window , in the blue water of different shades of Maldives watching the resort islands and coral islands .
Everything looks clear .
There are two C Plane companies in Maldives .
Trace is one of the Maldives which has a C Plane .
If you want then you can tour air for about four thousand rupees -LRB- a person hired -RRB- or the entire C plane can take it on rent for your whole day tour . -LRB- really the buffalo is big -RRB- .
Although if you go to any island before the Male island then the journey of the sea plane will be necessary because this is the way of journey between different islands .
And this is such a journey which perhaps you will never have the desire to finish .
The sea plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- in the best -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the oldest and memorable shops of the capital in the Ahmad Bazar of Male .
All the sellers were listening very carefully to the speech given by the President Mohammed Nassad of Maldives in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before .
If I say honestly then I have not seen any Indian listening to the speeches of the President or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But when this is the question of the existence of an excellent creation of the earth then such seriousness was necessary .
Many people may have considered the meeting made inside the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but after going to Maldives it feels as if if the nature 's anger has snatched it from us then the world will be so marvellous .
Something in the beauty there is such a speciality .
It is not so beautiful in that small country as if .
When we went back to Jetty to go back to his cruise from that voyage of the market then we realized how far the people here understand the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that fish floating in many metres deep below in the light of lamppost was seen with all its colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected with the city .
If you can also see a few centimetres clearly in the sea or river water connected to any city of India then you will consider yourself lucky .
While returning to MV Aquamrin we were roaming in the brain for two hours in the evening spent in Male .
Koral Rif -LRB- stones of stone -RRB- is the life here .
So far you will also get stones of parallel on the stones laid on the tombs .
Just a few days before we heard President Nasheed ' s speech we were standing outside his government residence .
It was not believed that we were ahead of the residence of the best personality of any country , there was no security guard till far .
We were taking photographs of gardens and Agashi at a distance of approximately 50 metres by spreading hand inside the gates of their bungalows .
Can you think of the house of a common leader in India like this
It was also learned that the President sometimes crossing the road on foot two blocks reach their office ahead .
Everything was surprising about Maldives .
That is why I was waiting for the next day 's authority .
It was known that that day was to be special .
In the morning a boat from Cruise brought us to Airport Island .
From there we reached the Trans Maldives sitting on the sides of the runway .
Last evening when the cruise was approaching Malay then we immediately recognized the C plane passing through it .
He had so many photographs
But then it was not known that the next day there will be a chance of riding in it .
We had to go to Rangali island at a distance of one hundred and fifty kilometres from the C Plane of Traus Maldives .
Several resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying till a height of approximately thousand metres were unforgettable .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a flight to stop breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But after reaching the Conrad Resort of Hilton Hotels on Rangali Island we felt as if we had reached some other world .
In a world which had no relation with any outside world .
The relation was also not such that it was difficult to get out of the beauty or luxury there .
Tour can also be done on foot or by battery driven car .
The view of life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was amazing .
Now we were unable to hear even easily from the nature around , that reached such a place , was indecent .
On descending in the sea water several metres below the stairs we reached such rooms of glass which were inside the water .
That room was actually a food hall .
On all sides we could see small - big fishes , corals , snow climbing and scuba diving people .
The imagination of food sitting on the decorated table there was very thrilling in itself .
On coming to this island from Male to Sea Plane the fare of seeing and lunch underwater is only 47 thousand rupees for one person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to walk in the water of our mountains .
But we knew that it was not possible .
After returning with this desire with a heavy heart , sometimes , at some point , the luck will definitely be taken here .
For many days they were planning to go out of Delhi but because of the busyness of work this was not possible .
From childhood there was a fondness of wild life then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 after biking till Pegong lake ahead from Khardungla in Ladakh this was the second lick tour .
On the afternoon of 27 December we had to leave for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but those who had come out of Jorsore slowly lost our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
Dhumals from above and bad roads ahead .
Many times it seemed that now it has fallen .
After doing anything at 8 o'clock in the morning we reached Gajrola .
Whether we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Amara was in Dhikuli near the resort park , which we had already done .
On that day there was no special program but we came to tour the coast of Kosi before being cold .
After spending two - three hours there we went out to the Corbett museum , which was very difficult 2 kilometres away near Dhaangdi gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
On returning the evening got up .
We had set out from Delhi that if the lions roaming in the jungle would definitely see then I would see the lions all night in a dream .
Suddenly in the midst of a deep night I got a strong roar and after that the dogs who began to sneeze did not stop for two hours .
Therefore first information about visiting Kaladangi and Corbett waterfalls came .
Kaladhangi is thirty kilometres away , while Corbett falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kaladhangi where some important things related to his life are kept .
On coming and coming 12:30 pounded .
Kaladangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had stayed in this village only .
On reaching the resort the safari jeepsy was waiting for us .
It has been told that they have arranged for sighting in the number one side of Bijrani there .
Asked about number one it was said that there grasslands increase and tigers come here to prevent cold during this period .
On reaching Bijra we were given a guide which takes two and a half hundred rupees to roam around four hours .
We had to walk inside for the jungle .
We saw several species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusky elephants , whose long teeth were .
I just photographed .
The guide started chasing the tiger among them .
The guide said that there are tigers around 150 in the park , some of which have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws but I was sad because of not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to come to Delhi .
In my mind the past of tiger was morning .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I made it the same phone .
I told him that I am coming to Corbett .
He asked whether the tiger was seen or not .
His words were wounded like a wire .
I said slowly , No .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone advised us to take a ride inside .
