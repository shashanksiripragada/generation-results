Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , others .
On one side of Kutch is Sind and on the other side Gujarat therefore there is also two mixture in language .
It is called ' Kuchi ' .
Although there is a ' speaking language ' here , it has no script on its own .
If you want to write Kachhi then you will have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhund itself is that Anjar city where many earthquakes came and the entire city got destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal-Toral .
The story of Jaisal-Toral is very charming .
If we return back on that route only then we had to take a monthly holiday again and schools have been opened there in Mumbai .
But what did we do  Now we traveled by telling the taxi to the fast buses of Gujarat .
Small rail going to meter gauge from Bhoj reaches Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge reaches Ahmadabad and from Ahmadabad the big train of Broad gauge reaches Mumbai .
The tourism system considered to be the main source of the economy of Rajasthan is spending in a very desperate situation these days .
Due to the dangers of increasing rapidity in Vaishnav Mandi and South Asia tourism has become very less .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased very much these days .
A new report released by the Rajasthan government has revealed that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the year 2009 has come down more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to the figures the number of tourists in the country has come down 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists has come down 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 AD a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 nationals and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists participated today in 2009 only 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 national and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are present .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , the founder of Rajputana Holiday Mekers , says that due to the incidents of Vaishnav Mandir and rapidity the tourism system has completely affected .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not developed the tourism system here in a strong and baseless manner .
Because of this reason the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan France is the highest among the tourists .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism Rajasthan has spent a lot of time today .
After 2002 this was the first time that the number of tourists of Rajasthan decreased .
There is nothing new from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , buildings , forts , ponds , forests everything is the same ancient for the pleasure of the tourists .
In the area of tourism all the governments say to work with the name of rural tourism , medicinal tourism , adventure tourism are important but nothing has been done in this direction .
The facility of tourists coming to Rajasthan is also available very less .
At the same time with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years incidents of violence and humiliation have also taken the beauty of this state to international level .
The government of Rajasthan has given the status of tourism in Rajasthan a few years back but it has become limited to only papers .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government in tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation .
With the aim of increasing the number of tourists in Rajasthan and developing them based on tourism the Rajasthan government established the RTDC in 1979 AD .
This pocket provides the facility of residence , food , transportation , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 branches in this institute .
Of these 39 hotels , 22 motors , eight cascateria , three journeys , one unit journey and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan wheels , but the situation of this institute has also been lagging behind for many years .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC was 185 lakh , in this year there is a possibility of 632 lakh increase in 2009 - 10 .
The situation of hotels of this institute is such that in the last five years in these hotels forty percent rooms are also not filled .
Along with hotels other facilities of the institute also make it very harmful .
The main among these is Royal Rajasthan of Views .
Tourists are not attracted towards this train .
Even after reducing the fare it has not been able to attract tourists .
This way in the present times during Pushkar fair also the interest of the tourists has been seen less .
In 2007 - 08 this fair had stayed 398 foreign tourists in the tourist village built by RTDC , while this year this number was only 217 .
The joyful thing of all this is that there is no dearth of attracting tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . urban train .
This train is continuously benefitting .
Last year through this train RTDC has got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees .
Due to these deficiencies coming in the tourist area of Rajasthan it has become natural to see the loss of the tourist area .
Tourism is the most dependent on the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the mind of man then he can make gold from soil .
Subrata Roy made it true by making a modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahyadri mountain peak of Maharashtra .

The temple of Tamareshwari Devi found in these ruins is very popular .
The roof of it is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the description of the glory of the goddess Tamareshwari is found .
During the period of the kings of Chetia people consider this god in the north - eastern hills in remote areas .
The forest people here used to worship Goddess .
Here men were also sacrificed after which King Gaurinath Singh had decreed .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmaknagar which are situated in the middle of the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the stories present here this place is ancient Vidarbha , where at one time King Bhishmak used to reign .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river which is a famous place of Lohit district .
The tribes of Degaru , Mishami etc . are the guides of the tourists here .
These people themselves are also very concentrated on this homage .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the main Parashuram Homekunda .
On the day of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Apart from the remains mentioned above mentioned as the pilgrimage of Arunachal the ruins of Roiing in Diwang - Valley district are also very historical .
The ruins of the lake built of bricks near Roeing tell their story even today .
The remnants of bathing clay , stairs and other ponds all around which are made of mud walls and the remnants of roads on the width still keep their ancient grandeur silent .
We reach ero at four hours through jeep from the Shaharnath of Assam situated on the top of Lakhimpur .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subasiri district .
Located at a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place attracts all the hearts .
This is the same entertaining place where there is an extremely important situation .
It took several days to reach here before passing through roadways to go to Jeep .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful premirozes , volts , forest covert , strawberries and raceberries enjoy the visitors .
Apple and Aluch are found here a lot .

They have made it their heavens .
The fruits of rice are very much here .
This place is ' Van Bhandar ' .
This ten miles long plain is a testimony to their hard work and agricultural skill .
Because of Kali river their farming is available properly .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley in the moonlight .
In the middle of the snow laden mountain peak situated towards the left hand the elevation of sky falls on the colored red color .
There is extremely cold in the air .
Along with shivering cold in the environment one feels wetness as well .
One gets to see the layer of tied with a sound coming on foot .
The weather is quiet and it is not visible very well because it is thin before sunrise .
The sight stays on the red color situated in the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench situated in Balkani .
The thin layer covered with hand falls with a slight sound and the hand gets separated immediately from the cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this small village settled amidst these mountains covered with snow of Switzerland is the first experience of spending night here .
In Swiss it is my third tradition .
Before this we spent a long time just near or near Juniva .
On both the sides of the thin Balkhati river the majority of the people settled in the valleys are spread to a great extent by light rocks .
This is the main river of Switzerland Ron Valley on both sides of which are many small and big cities .
The national highway and the vehicles moving on it are clearly visible parallel to the Run river .
300 kms away and half an hour journey in car along with the waterfalls of Jinniva and half the Rone river coming from east along with Montro , the Geneva waterfall near the city which is called Lake Lama in French .
In the west of this 100 kms long and 10 kms wide lake is Geneva city .
From there the waterfall again turns into a river and flows towards the west .
On the right side flowing shining waterfalls are the peaks of Alps mountain touching the sky .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke we left this highway on the left side of the road and came to the mountainous path on the north .
Due to the southern side of the mountainous plains the sun gives sun to all the corners at the third time .
In comparison to the valleys snow condition can not be considered less here .
As the snow goes towards the height , the snow is increasing sharply .
On both the sides of the road despite being extremely snowy the weather is calm and because of the shining sun there is no cold in the air .
We reached a small village called Thal after deciding about 20 k . . journey on these trembling mountainous roads for half an hour .
There are large storied palaces made of wood with roofs of rocks and sloping roofs .
In this three storied building along with standing cars in the foundation made of cement concrete there is a part of controlling the necessary facilities like electricity , water , laundry .
Valai is famous for grapes in Switzerland .
This is the main center of making wine grapes drink .
In the entire canal area only grapes are found in 37 percent .
The grapes gardens of the villages situated on both the sides of the Roon Valley give importance to its unique beauty .
To walk on foot in the grapes garden , to roam them , to make night rest in the villages there and to show the taste of dacoity by taking them to the dacoity industry is a part of the tourism department here .
There is a very big museum of wine juice in a garden made in 12th century in a small business of Age to see which foreign tourists have to get an agricultural booking done .
Once again we went through that dense forest with Dawagni .
The mind of the children crossing three - four k . . has become even more unhappy with the questions asked .
Suddenly the scene of a desert makes a dramatic and charming change .
Just straight , on the left side of the road on a very deep valley a group of beautiful houses is established in the plains .
People are skiing in snow in the plains adjacent to the village bank .
On the skiing slope till the peak of Kond the dense forest of the gods is spread .
There is a dense snow all around .
The sun rays are shining on the houses of the village .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also the same peace is spread .
On all four sides from the mountain peaks to the valleys is the glittering empire of snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round wheel situated in the middle of that profession .
The name of profession is Lukarabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the number of people of Lukarabad is approximately 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and healthy people coming here can be estimated from the fact that there are 1700 apartments with the facility of 6900 beds and 28 hotels for staying in the style of 1500 , Tumbo camping site , 90 bed health centers are 50 restaurants .

After reaching the village one feels complete heat .
In the sunrise of the rising sun the snow on the roofs of the house is shining .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albeni village , one of the foundations of ' National Heritage Safety ' in Switzerland .
It is said in Darjeeling that only skiing taxis go so that checking is not done .
The journey is going on , the place is another , but the mountain is the same , the trees and plants , the sounding wind .
It makes the whole body shivering .
This is the light of blue color rising in the rainy season .
With the decision of the journey of Darjeeling the decision was taken to take the camps of Karsiyang first .
Karsiyang is a small city in Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , is covered with dust forests .
Good tea is famous for production .
On going towards Darjeeling from Siligudi the tea gardens initiate smiling and welcome the people coming towards themselves .
Going on the road from the middle of tea gardens attracts the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with forests , on the other side a dense trench .
Here only tea gardens were seen once in the jungle .
There was a empire of greenery all around .
Once I was afraid to see these natural forests or see the tea gardens planted by humans .
Both were drawing towards themselves .
The beauty of the forest , the more beautiful is the tea gardens spread .
If you look at the roads on the way then creation looks marvellous .
We kept on spending time with the barks going to Pamulla and on the way .
Time is also going on .
The forests and tea gardens are not finished .
Sometimes small settlements were seen .
From a distance on a hill houses and buildings etc . were seen very rarely .
This is Karsiyang .
Staying here at one place we made plans to roam throughout the day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we left for the journey of Karsiyang .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests .
Go up i . . to reach Deer Park the vehicle had to be left very low .
The beauty of Karsiyang is spread till the top even today the development of the tourist spot has not been known .
However , the city is very nice and very peaceful .
While the road was deserted , to reach the Deer Park full of forests the joy of climbing the road between Mohamma and Dhupi trees was bold to us .
The other place is Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated on the other side of the city at a height .
This is also called Suicide point .
It is said that during the British period lovers used to die from here .
However , there is a park and restaurant here .
There is a Sindhuma pillar here looking at it from a height a beautiful view of the entire city can be seen .
In the tea gardens nearby women are busy screaming tea leaves while playing hands very fast .
There is a museum outside the city of Kasiang , but on that day we could not go there because it seemed very necessary to roam the beautiful environment of tea garden .
The next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was very painful because of this how can we roam when rains fall .
But when we reached the Rock Garden the weather is very good then we roamed while enjoying the sun .
This garden is a beautiful place with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more entertaining than this .
The Ganga Maa flowing on some hills going a little below from here was seen .
The magnificence of waterfalls amidst rocks here is worth seeing .
We saw in the Rock Garden that if waterfalls melt in the empire of rocks and stones here then the magnificence of waterfalls in the Ganges is decorated with stones in the world .
These two places are situated in the middle of the hills of Darjeeling .
Going up with the help of vehicle we saw the smoke in Darjeeling .
With the help of telescope all the mountains and cities of Darjeeling can be seen from here .
The quantity of weather was very clear till now .
When we moved towards Monastery , we did not know from where the group of clouds came and clouds were roaming .
In the evening arrangements are made to stop shopping on the Mall road .
During the journey of Darjeeling the journey of Town Train gives a bright light like a pinnacle .
From Darjeeling to Guam and from Dhum to Darjeeling the journey of Toy Train is a special attraction for tourists .
There is a small break in boating and garden in Mirik lake here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where in Nepali industry swimming sweets etc . are available .
There is also facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district then its shape is different .
Here tea gardens are not only greenery , but there are sounds of forests - waterfalls .
The most popular tourist places of Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegaon which are full of forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to tour Darjeeling in the winter season , but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling have been bound by themselves .
A small journey of my condition was very thrilling and thrilling .
This journey is not outside of foreign countries but is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is a favorite thing in itself in which sometimes travels towards itself , sometimes a major place , water ship or a city full of train or a city full of pink or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some major attraction people are brought towards itself .
The place where I am talking is made just four and a half years ago , but with the construction which this place came here he really praised the jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for the residents there .
In my ears our guide Rambabu says my words , i . . before that we did not even think that we might be like this in the jungle .
Fifty percent Sibbadi is the same area .
Suddenly I felt that such people did not get work in the heritage hotels as well .
The resident of Ajabgarh Ramba had earlier worked in Jaipur and today this great royal grandeur was in the Amman garden .
He himself harassed his words and deeds a new way .
Aya ' is the estimation of Amman Bagh .
There no one will tell you in English language .
Amman Bagh is actually a peaceful and comfortable tourist place .
This garden also has a history in itself and the most important thing is that you will also introduce you to the nearby areas .
In the royal palaces of Rajasthan how many people have roamed in Bhangagarh of landslides , why should go far , even among the people of Jaipur , if Kuchek had spent the night at this very place .
After the construction of Amman Bagh big people from the country and abroad came here .
I remember that night as well when Shabana Azmi called me completely there but I could not go .
This is another thing that she had gone astray herself and reached Bhangadh .
This time suddenly I reached there for the invitation of our foreign brethren but it seemed as if those people who want to spend their holidays in less time they would definitely want to go to Amman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden in those seven gardens where the king of Alwar had built a camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in fifteen hundred twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
In the shadow of the mountainous and fragrant trees Amman Bagh the first glittering charm you .
As soon as you come inside you will be welcomed by which you will feel that you have to pay attention to great peace here .
Together with the construction of the Manikarn the life of the aarti mantras is done .
We reached there in the evening and we started putting it around in that garden .
Our guest Jokhi was decorating , immediately relaxed that it was very interesting to me .
All the buildings and forts are inspired .
The best is their lighting .
Yes , on all the new things , artistic .
Manejar had organised our program in the morning .
First of all roaming on foot with Rambab and then the journey of jeep in Bhangarh .
While walking on the small road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the sun rays are spreading gradually .
We saw the dried lake in which the rails are doing business .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw tobacco fruit .
This brightness of rural life is a unique experience for Jackie Kosam .
After that we reached Bhangarh through jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist from Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable fruit of million dollars .
The same way the habit of Amman Bagh is also hereditary , by feeding jaggery and curd we got rid of it .
Then it was known why tourists come here spending so much .
I heard that tour packages are also being put to show the triple life .
Is this true
There is no doubt and this happens not only in many states but tourists also show more interest in it .
This tour is generally decided for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this staying there , eating food etc . are also included .
This way an attempt is made to explore such a place where there has not been much development and there has not been a major impact on the amount of life of nature and people .
Along with this ancient tourist sites are also there .
Besides this , it is also paid attention to the survey of the Traditional Kucine .
In fact , the tourists with the goal of such journeys have to show straight the methods and traditions of dressing at that place .
Although it feels a little difficult to think , but such tour is really very interesting and one gets a different experience .
A lot of journey is enjoyable for us .
By this despite being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a long time free .
Yes , here it is so important that with expensive and long time we indicate that there is an obstacle in this journey .
That is why you must remember some things to enjoy them , especially whenever you are seeing the destination of any foreigner by a tour .
Find a good middleman before taking a ticket .
Students , seniors of the army , children etc . get stones in it , both of them also get the facility of stones .
Although it is less to take ticket beforehand therefore it is better to put bus tour plains for the last minute before planning .
Instead of a tour ticket know about the entire tour rate .
It is cheap .
There are some signs of material as well , therefore one should also know about the quantity and weight of the goods .
If this happens somewhere then you will have to leave some things in terminals or pay more debt .
Also know information about insurance or harmfulness in tour companies .
Take away the calorie on bags .
Because they get fit in the rock situated on the seat .
This thing should also be kept in mind that while changing the bus during the journey the responsibility of the goods will be yourself .
From wherever you go by bus reach there , one hour before time .
Keep an eye on this matter during the time of rigging .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will also have the chance of getting a good seat .
While choosing the seat also keep in mind your convenience .
There are many scratches in the back seat , but it is not appropriate to read in the front seat .
If you have to go to urinate again and again then take the last seat , and do not like it much then the seat near the window will be good for you .
Now it is an interesting thing .
If you are in the seat keeping your hands on both sides then sit on the last seat beforehand and put your cheek on it .
If there is no more people in bus then planning can be successful .
If you are comfortable for washing the bus then while choosing the seat keep in mind this thing as well because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get information of very important things from them .
Everyone is told to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not keep your stuff on the seat because if they go then the buses will not take responsibility for it .
If the bus stops anywhere then return to the time .
If you do not come on time then you can get a place for a new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus in the terminal .

After this if you stay in the fair then even then you can get hotels at a little less than that but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then money will be reduced in pocket .
Sikruz proves to be very useful here .
In the week before December Leukruz Maldives and Colombo started the only cruise of India from Kochi .
Louis Cruise has achieved a lot of popularity in the business of European companies and cruise hotels .
Although due to some problems Luickrudge has now reduced its services but it is believed that it will start again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a trip of three days per person of approximately 5850 rupees per night in the Emvi Equivalent of Lui Cruise ship .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
But if there are two elderly then the child in the age of 15 years is completely free .
Otherwise .
On rent of cruise only tea - typhoon , food everything is available .
Every moment is with timelessness .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the treasures , activities available in Maldives according to the number of your pockets - from Seplain Ride to Under Water Lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly a sepulchre comes in front of you and stops then you will feel like a sportsman .
But this 12 - 15 stairs -LRB- 12 - 15 stairs -RRB- television is the best for tour in Orchipelago like Oter Plain Maldives .
It is not known when it flies in the air while running like a speed boat on the water .
When you fly completely you will not feel like flying ordinary flights .
Every moment your eyesight will be seen below the window , the resort islands and the Koral islands are covered with blue colored water in the varieties of castles .
Everything looks so good .
There are two Siplen companies in Maldives .
Trace Maldives is one of which has twenty seplines .
If you want then around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- can be toured in an hourly flight or in the entire sepulchre you can take a fare to spend the whole day .
Although if you go from the island to another island then the journey of sea plane is necessary because this is the only way to travel between various islands .
And that is such a journey which you will never feel the desire to finish .
The journey of Seapline from 12 kms to 183 kms is done in Maldives .
We were in the biggest Antique and Sovenire shops of the capital of Ahmad Bazar of Male .
One day before by the president of Salemananda Maldives Mahmood Nasheed the conference given in the World Environmental Conference in Copenhagen is heard very carefully .
Actually I have not seen any Indian listening so carefully to the conversation of state governments or prime ministers .
But when questions of the stability of a new creation are there on this land then it is unparalleled for such seriousness .
Many people consider it unsuccessful in the museum happening inside the water by the combination of Maldives in October but if they go to Maldives then it feels as if if the nature ' s species are locked out of us then the world will get descended .
There are many such specialities in the beauty there .
As if the beauty of that small country is enshrined .
On returning to the cruise from that market tour when our eyes go towards the sea water while moving towards the road then it feels that the people here can understand the quality of these beauty at any level .
The water is so clear that the fish swimming in many metres deep below in the light of the lappost are seen with all its colors .
This is a part of the sea which is completely separated from the city .
If you can see a few centimetres of sea or water of river other than any city of India completely then you will be very fortunate .
On returning to Emvi Ekyamerine we were roaming in the jungle for two hours in the evening spent in Male .
Koral Reef is the life here .
As far as possible you will also get to see rocks of rocks on the tombs .
Just a few moments before listening to President Nasheed 's speech we were standing outside his government residence centres .
There is no belief that we were ahead of the building of the highest testimony of the other country and no one could save for some time .
We took photographs of Vasara and gardens situated at a distance of approximately fifty kilometres by going inside through the gate of their building very fun .
Can you think of any political house in India like this
Here it is also known that the president sometimes goes to his office ahead of two blankets crossing the road on foot .
Every word about Maldives is surprising .
That is why I was very waiting for the next day .
Devavani meaning that day some major incident is going to happen .
In the morning from cruise a ship brought us to Air Fort Island .
From there we reached Maldives by roaming around in Ranve .
The next evening when the cruise reached Male , we immediately remembered the syphilis passing on top .
The number of photographs they saw .
But the next day we could not lose the opportunity of traveling in it .
We had to go to Rangali Island of 100 kilometres through the sea plane of Traus Maldives .
It is unforgettable to see thousands of trees spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying up to a height of approximately a thousand kms .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
It is adventurous to fly with thrill and excitement .
But on reaching Konarad resort of Hillton Hotels in Rangali Island we felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , outside which there is no relation with any country .
Wasta is also not like this where it is difficult to get out such beauty or glasses .
Mountaineering can also be done on Konarad or by cars running with battery .
The view of the life style of the tribes on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island is unique .
Now in the nature around us we are not able to believe even naturally , we reached such a place , we were unimaginable .
With the help of stairs we reached the room with glass which was inside the water .
This room is normally a dining room .
On all the tops we can see all kinds of small - big fishes , corals , snow climbing and scuba diving humans .
The imagination of eating sitting on the decorated chairs there is very thrilling in itself .
On coming to this island from Male to Syplane the fare of seeing it and seeing underwater ranch is 47 thousand rupees per person .
I did n't feel like returning from there .
We all were also ready to disperse our passports in water .
But know , this is not so easy .
With this unwilling belief , once again , if there is any chance then fortunately takes it here .
I have been planning to go out of Delhi for several days but work is not possible to go anywhere because of stress .
Wildlife was liked from childhood but I thought that this serpent was going to Jim Corbett .
In 2006 after biking till Pegong lake situated before Khardugla in Ladakh this is the second bike tour .
In the month of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but whatever excitement we left , the smoke showed our speed .
The journey between Hafoot and Gajrola was really stunned .
The roads from above are smooth and unforgettable .
Many times we felt as if we had fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Right we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres away from Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near the park , which we had already booked .
That day there was a major program that we went to tour the coast of Kosi first while it was cold .
After spending two - three hours there we went out to the Corbett Museum , with great difficulty , at a distance of 2 kms is near the Dhangdi gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar situated below .
Returning is the right evening .
We went out to decide from Delhi to see the lion roaming around in the jungle , I was watching the lion all night .
I suddenly heard a very big sound in the midst of deep sleep at night and after that the dogs did not stop for two hours after starting .
Just before it was decided to visit Kaladungi and Karbot fall .
Kaladungi is thirty k . . away , then came on the road of Corbett Fall .
Kaladangi Jim Corbett Sahab museum , where some important things related to their real life have been kept .
After returning it was twelve and a half .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come to this village .
The journey to reach the resort is waiting for us .
He told us that he had provided a cycling facility in a Saint Bijrani there .
On asking one of the numbers it is said that where Greece is more and Tigers come here to save from cold at this time .
As soon as we reached Bijrani we gave a guide who took two hundred fifty for four hours to roam .
We went out to go inside the jungle .
We saw many types of animals and deer of different species there .
Inside we saw two tuscar elephants , which had big teeth .
I took photographs boldly .
In the meanwhile guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide says that the tigers around 150 in the park , some of which have died today .
At many places we also saw their claws , but because of not seeing the tigers I was disappointed .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind the terrace of tiger was hunted .
That is why I remembered my older son of Haldani .
And I called him Saradakeh .
I told him that I had come to Carbot .
He asked whether he saw the tiger or not .
His words are like a bow to me .
I said gradually , not .
There is no permission to take a bike in the park .
Some advice was given to us that you should take a ride inside .
