Their tongue looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side is Sind and on the other side Gujarat therefore there is a mixture of both in languages .
It is called ' Kachi ' .
Although this is ' Boli ' , it does not have its own writing .
If you want to write something then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhoj itself is that Anjar city where many times earthquakes have occurred and the entire city has been destroyed .

From there another small train of metro gauge will be delivered to Ahmadabad and a big train from Ahmadabad to Broad gauge will be delivered to Mumbai .
Tourist industry considered to be the main base of Rajasthan is passing through both these rare periods .
Due to the increasing threats of world temple and south Asia the muscle of tourism has been deeply shocked .
From the point of view of tourism a lot of deficiency has been recorded in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan to be counted among the major states of the country .
Recent figures issued by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 has come down more than 10 percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 thousand and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during the year 2009 only two crore 66 thousand 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these 2558691 national and 1073414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism sector are very worried about this situation .
The director of Rajputana Holidaymakers Sanjay Koshak says that the incidents of world destiny and terror have badly affected the tourism industry .
Compared to other countries of Asia we can not even prepare our strong infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decrease of 3 . 29 percent compared to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Of the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan tourists of France are the highest .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism the recent years have passed best for Rajasthan .
After 2002 this is the first time that the number of tourists has come down in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism nothing has happened .
Desert , havelis , forts , ponds , forests , everything is the same ancient to pull the tourists .
In the area of tourism all governments increase the talk of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done towards it .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
At the same time along with foreign national women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years the warriors of jewellery and jewellery have also stained the importance of this state internationally .
Years before Rajasthan government had given tourism the status of industry in the state but it remained confined to paper only .
The example of success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
With the aim of enhancing tourism in Rajasthan and developing the infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had constructed RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides the facility of settlement , dining , movement , boating etc .
There are total 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22  मोatals , eight Cafeteria , three Dharamshalas , one movement unit and two Train Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels , but the condition of this corporation has remained thin for many years .
The gap of RTDC in 2008 - 2009 was 185 lakh whose year 2009 - 2010 is expected to go to 632 lakh .
The condition of the hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years 40 percent rooms of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with the hotels other units of the corporation are also bringing it a big ghat .
Among these are the Royal Rajasthan of Wales .
The attraction of tourists towards this railway could not be made .
Despite reducing it could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair has also been seen to be less .
In the tourist village built by RTDC in this fair in 2007 - 2008 where 398 foreign tourists were staying there this year this number decreased to 217 .
It is a matter of patience for RTDC that there has been no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Royal Railways .
This rail is continuously benefitting .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of Rs . 9 . crore from this railway .
From this fall in the tourism sector of Rajasthan the pictures of worry in the field of tourism are natural to see .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economics of Rajasthan .
If you want to do something in the heart of the person then he can make sleep from soil .

There is a good cold in the air .
Along with the chilling cold one also feels moisture in the air .
Underneath the legs one gets to see the layer of the wooden plate wrapped on the floor of the wood with the sound of the garbage .

The eyes remain on the redness of the east .
There is a feeling of sitting on the beach lying in the balcony .

Thousands of miles away from our country , settled amidst these hills covered with snow of Switzerland this is the first experience of spending night in this small village .
This is my third residence in Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent Geneva or around it .
The dense population settled in the valley on both the sides of the thin-billing river is spread up to a great extent on the light slopes .
This is the valley of Honey the main river of Switzerland on both sides of which many small and big cities have settled .
The balanced highway of the Run river and the ringing vehicles have been clearly visible on it .

Geneva city is settled on the western end of this lake 300 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake again moves towards the west after becoming a river .
On the right side are mountain ranges of dust , sky touching -LRB- Alps -RRB- .
By crossing the city from a beautiful picnic named Leuk we come on the hilly path towards the north , leaving this highway from the left side .
Due to the slope of the mountain being towards the south the sun of the evening is giving full sunlight to the entire corner .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here , almost not equal .
As the height progresses , the quantity of snow starts increasing .
There is no special cold in the air because of clear sky and shining sun despite being accumulated well on both the sides of the road .
After finishing a journey of about 20 kilometres on this roaming hilly road in half an hour we reach a small village called Hel .
Shelley -LRB- challet -RRB- - There are large - big storied bungalows made of sloping roof , completely wood .
There are rooms to control necessary services like electricity , water , laundry along with parking of vehicles in the basement made from the cement contract of this three storied bungalow .

In the village settled on both the sides of the Roon Valley the gardens of grapes provide a unique gift to the beauty there .
Taking them to the gardens of grapes , making them roam at night in the villages there and taking them to the sugarcane factory is an integral part of Biopar .
In a small town named Aigle in 12th century there is a very big museum of ringry liquor , to see which foreign tourists have to get booking first .
Once again we pass through the same jungle descending from Dawanal .
Three - four kilometres away the mind gets worsened by the whispering questions of children throughout the road .
Suddenly there is a dramatic and charming change from the scene at a turn .
Just in front , on the slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are doing skiing in the snow on the slope from the top of the village .
The dense forest of Deodar is spread till the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope .
Cloud snow is lying all around .
The roofs of the houses of the city are shining due to the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach this village .
Here also the same peace is blossomed .
From the peak of the mountain all around till the valley is the rule of dust ice .
Within the next five minutes we reach in the middle of this town at a large round chakra -LRB- Oudabout -RRB- .
The name of the town is Leukerabad -LRB- eukerabad -RRB- .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Liukarabad is around 1500 AD .

Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenon village is one of the safest places in Switzerland in the form of a heritage of national importance .
It was told in Darjeeling that only taxis of Sarf Sikkim can be reached in Sikkim therefore there is no checking .
The journey is going on , the other of Uttar Pradesh is , but the hill is the same , the trees are the same , the crushing winds are the same .
The moisture stored on the whole body is the same .
During monsoon season Surmai Ujjala is the same .
As soon as the program of Darjeeling journey was picked , it was decided to take the sight of Kirsiang first .
Karsing is a small city of Darjeeling .
Filled with tea gardens , filled with sunshine jungles .
Famous for the production of high tea .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then initially the tea gardens of Muscrahhat welcome the growing people towards itself .
Moving through the road amidst tea gardens the heart beats the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with forests , on the other side deep greenery .
Here sometimes forests and sometimes tea gardens were seen .
All around was the rule of greenery .
At times I went to Haribada , see these natural forests or the tea plants planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful jungle , the more beautiful the tea gardens spread far and wide .
If you look at the roads of the road then the universe looks strange .
The walk of the snake was going tight and narrow paths .
Time was also passing .
If we were not passing , then forests and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance itself a hilly house - house etc . looked very close .
This was crying .
Staying here at one place we made a program of touring throughout the day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we went out on a tour of Kirseang .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests on all four sides .
Upper climbed i . . to reach Deer Park the vehicle had to leave very low .
Besides being enchanted with beauty Karsang has not yet been developed in the form of a tourist place .
Although the city is very high and clean .
Despite being deserted the way to reach the Deer park surrounded by forests the joy of climbing the road between the red and sunshine trees was giving us the joy .
The next place was Eggle Craig .
This is a point situated on the other side of the city at a height .
This is also called Swind point .
It is said that the lovers of the British used to know from here during the time .
At present , this is decorated with a park and restaurant .
There is a stairs like pillar here from whose height a beautiful view of the entire city is seen .
In the tea gardens nearby the women were busy breaking the tea leaf with a lot of speed on their backs .
There is a museum outside Karsang city , but on that day we could not go there because touring the pleasant atmosphere of tea gardens seemed more necessary .
The next day it was decided to roam Darjeeling .
It was a pleasant experience in itself , but there was a great concern that if it was raining then how would we roam around
But it was very unforgettable that reaching the Rock Garden we roamed around enjoying the sports sun .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
On moving a little further down from here we found Ghera Gangamaya from the hills .
Here the mirror of waterfalls amidst rocks is worth seeing .
We found in Rock Garden that in the regime of rocks and rocks there are waterfalls , then in Gangama the glimpse of waterfalls is decorated with stones .
Both these places are situated very low in the basket of the hills of Darjeeling .
Upstairs with the help of the vehicle we saw Batsia Loop in Darjeeling .
With the help of Durbin the entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here .
The nature of the weather was still clear .
But as soon as we moved towards the Monastery , from where to go down the rate came and started shrinking .
Build a program of walking and shopping in the evening on the Mall Road .
In the tour of Darjeeling Toy Trains put charm in journey .
The journey of Toy Train from Darjeeling to Gun and Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Here some rest in boating and garden in Mirk lake .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where sweaters made of hand of Nepali artisans etc . are found .
There is also the convenience of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is just a city of Darjeeling district but its form is different .
The greenery of tea gardens is not here but the flow of forests and waterfalls is done here .
The most popular picnic spot in Kalimpong is -LRB- Lava and Lolegaon -RRB- , which is full of forest waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalmpung this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to tour Darjeeling in the shadow of winter , but the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling tied me here .
My recent journey was very interesting and surprising .
This journey was neither of the country nor of Rajasthan but of Jaipur very close .
Tourism is an interesting topic in itself , in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , then sometimes there is a special place , water ship or any other city like Rajguar or Gulabi Nagar or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come here .
The place where I am going to talk is ready just four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place has come here he has actually made a mangrove in the jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those living there .
My guides in my ears resonate in the words of Ram Babumina , whose life we could not even think before that we could stay like this in the jungle .
50 per cent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not get work in heritage hotels as well .
Rambabu resident of Ajbalgarh used to work in Jaipur before this and now this wonderful royal style in Shanti Bagh .
He has slopped his speaking in a new color .
Jivan is a feeling of peace park .
There no one calls you English speaking .
Shanti Bagh is actually a peaceful and peaceful tourist place .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also introduces you from nearby areas .
How many of the people spending holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have toured Bhangad of the Bhutan , why do go far , some of the people of Jaipur may have spent a night in this area .
After the opening of peace park big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night as the Prime Minister Shabana had called me there with heart but I could not go .
It is a different matter that they had reached Mangadh by breaking the road themselves .
This time suddenly I reached there on the invitation of my foreign guests , then felt that those who want to spend a grand holiday in less time , they should definitely go to Shanti Bagh .
This garden is the only garden saved from these seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to stay for hunting .
Its construction took place in 1900 AD .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Shanti Bagh surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees attracts you .
As soon as you come inside the way your welcome is done , it feels that a lot of attention has been given here on spiritual peace .
Living pockets of Mangal Char Mantra are done along with tying radish in Kalai .
We had reached the slope in the evening and we decided to put a cycle of this garden .
My host JK , who is decorating a decorative , suddenly arose , it is interesting .
All havelis and palaces are affected .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but art . There is no surprise that Shanti Bagh has also got a reward recently .
The manager decided our program to do in the morning .
First of all on foot with Ram Babu and then the journey of the jeep of Bhangad .
Moving on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajbalgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading slowly .
Seeing the dry lake in which the farmers were harvesting .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw the farming of tobacco .
For JK such a glimpse of the life of the village was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangad from the jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep concentration .
This is an invaluable bridge of millen dollars .
The way to say goodbye to the peace garden is also traditional throttle and opening curd he made us leave .
Now we understand why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept to show tribe life .
What is this
Loss and this happens in many states and tourists show special interest in them .
These tours are generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying there , eating etc .
This way an attempt is made to make such places , where there has not been much progress and there has not been a special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this where old tourist sites etc are also available .
Apart from this attention is given only on doing tridental cousin .
Actually the goal of such a tour is to make the tourists aware of the life style and traditions of this place .
Although it looks a little difficult in thinking , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Just tour has its own joy .
Besides being with many people you can enjoy touring alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a lot of time without distracting .
Yes , it is sure that along with giving less expensive and peaceful time these tours definitely demand patience with you .
This is the reason that to enjoy them it is important to keep in mind some things , especially when you are watching through any foreign destination bus tour .
Find best deal before taking tickets .
Students , senior people of Military , children etc get discounts on them , then there is also an agent of discount for two people .
However , it is cheap to buy tickets in advances , therefore it is better to plan bus tours in the last moments that do planning a little earlier .
Instead of Tow Way ticket know about round trips .
This feels lazy .
Laws regarding bags are very strict , hence ask about the size and weight of the goods .
There should not be any such thing that you have to leave something on the tromal or you have to pay a different fee .
At the same time also know the law of compensating insurance or loss from tour company .
Carry on bags are right , go with them .
Because they come in the rake above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus during tour the responsibility of the goods will be yours .
From where you have to take bus , reach there one hour before time .
During adulterated season you should take special care of this point .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will have the better seat choice .
Keep in mind comfortable while choosing the seat .
If the shocks will start more on the last seat , then reading on the front seat is not comfortable .
If you have to take it again and again , then take the seat of which and if you do not like to be more disturbed then the window seat will be better for you .
Now a talk of walking .
If you are in front of both the palms , then sit on the corner seat and put your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in bus , then planning will be successful .
If there is comfort of washroom in bus then keep in mind this thing as well while selecting the seat because sitting there becomes difficult after a while .
Make identity from bus driver and contractor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of bus all are called to go out .
During this time do not leave your stuff on the seat because on its disappearance the buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then you can get a new passenger in your place and you will have to wait for another bus on the tromal .

The neighbouring state of Maharashtra is laden with its beautiful beaches and various water sports , which is like a heaven for the tourists , where from the tour of ancient churches the grandeur of ancient times gets an excellent view .
Situated in Panaji the capital of Goa , Janjar Hutle makes this journey of West Bank very excellent .
On the roads of Goa cycling , river cruise , cold sea winds and enjoying the enjoyment of world famous gon foods are the best options for spending comfortable days here .
If seen in today 's history then for Maldives the cheapest person returns to Delhi is 28 thousand rupees .
After this if you stay in the males then even then you can get a hotel in a small rent but if you go to some island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will fall short .
Secrose proves to be beneficial here itself .
In the first week of December Louis Cruise from Kochi started India 's single cruise for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Cruise is a European company and in Cruise and Hotel Biopar there is a village named Kapi .
Although due to some problems Louis Cruise has closed its services right now , but from October it is expected to start their recovery .
One can go to Maldives for a cruise of three days at the cost of at least Rs . 5850 per person at the cost of the at least at the cost of the at least 5850 rupees at the Luiquicrose vessel Emview .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are old then children less than the age of 15 years are completely free .
What else should be done .
The rent of cruise includes tea breakfast , food everything .
Enjoyment of every time together .
On reaching the capital Malay you can enjoy the entertainments , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from Siplin Raiding to Indo-Water Lunch .
While roaming around in big airplanes suddenly if a syphilis stands before you then you will feel like a toy .
But this Town Outtropical Maldives with 12 - 15 seats is undoubtedly excellent for touring orchipelago -LRB- miraculous reserve -RRB- .
While running like a speed boat on the surface of water when it gets up in the air , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not realize the flight of ordinary airplanes .
Every time your eyes keep looking at the windows - the blue water of different sheets of Maldives seeing the resort islands and coral islands .
Everything looks so clear .
There are only two sepline companies in Maldives .
Transmal Deven is one of them with which there are 20 seplines .
If you want then you can roam around Hazra -LRB- a person per hour -RRB- or you can take the entire syphilis on rent for the entertainment of your entire day -LRB- if the pocket is deep -RRB- .
If you go to any island away from the island then the journey of Celean would be necessary because this is the only way of journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey whose desire to end is probably not to you .
Siplin travels from 12 k . . to 183 k . . -LRB- Mavelivaro -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and swineer shops of the capital in Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
All the sailsmans were listening to the speech given by the chief Mohammad Nasad of Maldives a day earlier in the Kupine Hague with great care .
With sincerity I did not see any Indian speaking to the President or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is only a question of the existence of a rare creation of this land then such seriousness was necessary .
Many people may have understood the sitting inside the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but by going to Maldives it feels that if the natural disaster takes it away from us then the world will be so bad .
There is something special in the beauty of that place .
In this small country as if the beauty does not end .
To go back to his cruise from this market roaming around the gate , when the eyes suddenly went to the sea water along the road then it was felt that the people here understand the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that under the light of lamphost many metres deep fish were swimming with all its colors .
This was the part of the sea which was completely connected with the city .
If you can also see a few centimetres in the sea or water of the river situated in any city of India then you will find yourself happy .
While returning to EMVE AMEREN we were roaming in the mind for two hours in the evening spent in Male .
Coral Rif -LRB- Monga Chattis -RRB- is the life here .
So far you will also get mung rocks on stones attached to tombs .
Just a while before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not believed that we had no security worker far and wide ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country .
Enjoying we were pulling the gardens and the fountains of extracts just 50 metres away by putting hand inside the gate of its bungalow .
Can you think about the house of an advanced leader of India
It was also known that sometimes the chief reaches his office ahead of two blocks while crossing the road on foot .
Everything about Maldives was thrilling .
That is why I was waiting for the next day unconsciously .
Allahabad was that day was going to be special .
From morning cruise a boat brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the Trans Maldives by cutting the rope of the Ranve .
Last evening when Cruise was approaching Malay then we immediately recognized the sepline passing through it .
Such pictures which were seen , are of that .
But then there was no destination that the next day it would get the opportunity to ride .
We were going to Rangali Island one hundred and five kilometres away from the Siplin of Transmal Diu .
It was unforgettable to see the hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread over the sea of Maldives from the Siplin flying up to a height of approximately a thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
He was a breathing flight with joy and emotion .
But after reaching the Konarder Resort of Halton Hutles on Rangli Island it seemed as if we had reached any other world .
In such a world which had no relation with any outside world .
The relation was not so much that it was difficult to get outside the beauty around it .
The journey on Konarad can also be on foot or from the battery to the moving vehicle as well .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to special island was unique .
Now we had not even been able to take care of ourselves from the nature around , that reached such a place , was incomplete .
While descending in the water of the sea several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all the sides of the glass we could see strange types of small fishes , corals , snow climbing and scuba diving .
The thought of eating while sitting on the decorated tables there was very charming in itself .
The fare of seeing and interval lunch coming to this island from Malay is 47 thousand rupees for a person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to flow in our passport water .
But we knew it was not possible .
Returned with this hope with a heavy heart that sometimes , sometimes the destiny will definitely come here .
For many days plans were being made to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
Since childhood there was a fondness of wild life then thought why this time junk carpet should be done .
In 2006 after biking up till the treegung lake ahead of Khardungla pass in Ladakh this was the second bike tour .
On the morning of 27th December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the joy and joy that we had emerged , Kathera had reached our speed .
The journey between Happy and Gajraula was really tired .
From uproot to khera and bad road ahead .
Many times it seemed that now it has fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett National Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
We were in Dhikkili near our restaurant park , whose booking we had already done .
There was no special program this day but despite being cold we went to roam the shore of Kosi before .
After spending two - three hours there we went out to Corbett museum , which was near Dhangdi Gate , two kilometres away from difficult .
From there we went to roam Ramnagar below .
Returning late evening .
It was clear from Delhi that if the lions roaming in the jungle would definitely see then the lions would be watching me all night in dreams .
Suddenly in the midst of the depths of the night I heard a loud noise and after that those dogs who began to roam , then did not stop for two hours .
Therefore first a suggestion came to visit Kala Dhangi and Carbet Fall .
Kaladangi is 30 kms away , while carpet falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett National Park in Kala Dhangi , where some important things related to their life are kept .
After returning we got twelve and a half .
Kaladangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett settled on coming in this village itself .
On reaching the resort the ride gipsi was hosting us .
It was told that he had arranged a site site in Barraani there .
On asking about number one the Grasland is more there and the tigers come on that side to escape from cold during this period .
As soon as we reached Bajraani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half hundred rupees for roaming around four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw several species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two twisted elephants , whose long teeth were .
I gathered and photographed .
Meanwhile the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide told that there are tigers around 150 in the park , out of which some have died recently .
At some places we also saw the marks of their claws , but because of not being able to see the tiger I was excited .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind the fiber of tiger was adventurous .
Then came the memory of one of his old friends of Haldwani .
I called her such a phone .
I told her that I had come to Carbet .
He did not see the asked tiger .
Its words were swollen like a sword .
I said slowly , No .
There was no permission to take a bakery in the park .
Take the advice inside for the safari.
