The language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it ' s different .
On one side of Kutch , Sind and on the other , Gujarat , therefore , there is a mixture of both in language .
This is called ' Kutchi ' .
Well this is ' bid ' , it does not have its own script .
Kachchi has to be written in the Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj itself is that Anjar city where earthquakes have occurred many times and the entire city has been destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisal-Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jessel - Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the way we had come then we will have to take a complete one month ' s holiday and the school will be opened in Bombay .
So what to do  Now you will travel in the train by calling fast buses of Gujarat to T . .
The small train of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
A meter gauge from there and a small train will reach Ahmadabad and a big train from Ahmedabad to Broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is passing through bad times these days .
Due to the increasing terrorist threats in global recession and South Asia tourism business has been deeply shocked .
From the point of view of tourism a lot of deficit has been recorded in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the major states of the country .
The latest figures released by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent compared to 2008.
According to statistics the number of national tourists has come down 9 . percent and the number of foreign tourists has come down 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 native and one million 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana Holiday makers says that world recession and terrorist incidents have badly affected tourism business .
Compared to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop a strong infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also declined by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Of the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan tourists of France are the highest .
After this the tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism recent years have passed for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that the number of tourists has come down in Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism nothing has happened .
Desert , havelis , forts , ponds , forests everything is the same ancient .
In the tourism area all governments talk of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
At the same time incidents of rape and tampering in Rajasthan along with foreign women tourists have also stained the image of this state internationally .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given tourism the status of industry in the state but it has remained confined to paper only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited ( RTDC ) is an example of the success of Rajasthan Government towards tourism .
With the aim of promoting tourism in Rajasthan and developing the infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides facilities of housing , food , traffic , boating etc . to the tourists .
The Corporation has a total of 75 units .
In which 39 hotels , 22 mottles , eight cavatories , three vehicle , one traffic unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation has remained thin for many years .
The RTDC deficit in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh , which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years forty percent rooms of its hotels could not be filled .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also making it a big loss .
Among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not get attracted towards this rail .
Despite reducing fare it could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years also the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair has been seen to be less .
In the year 2007 - 08 in the tourist village built by RTDC in this fair where 398 foreign tourists stayed , this year this number decreased to 217 .
Among all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC has been that there has been no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Royal Railways .
This rail has been continuously benefitting .
Last year RTDC benefited Rs 9. 9 crore from this train .
Due to this decline in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If man ' s heart wants to do something , he can manufacture gold from soil .
Subrata Roy has made it true by establishing modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain range of Sahyadri of Maharashtra .
Seeing the dream he had seen , he glittered in his eyes .
His happiness was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
Ambe Valley ' s work started and today Ambe Valley has succeeded in making its place as an excellent city .
In this city spread over more than 10 thousand acres only 9 percent of the ground hotels , houses and other facilities have been built .
Trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available on 91 per cent of the ground .
Many industrialists came forward to build their own houses in this city built for millionaires and today about 800 families are living in this city .
Initially industrialists and royalists bought their shops here as Hollyday Home but now they have made it their first house and from here they travel to Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambe Valley itself is Koyarigarh Fort which provides beauty to this area .
In the western Siang district the ruins of Likawali are very important .
In the excavation remains of a large temple are found .
On the pillars of stones of this temple the excavation of statues of lotus and gods - goddesses has been achieved which are mostly in the ruined state .
Malini Than is an important place in this very region .
At this place a Dashabhuja statue of Devi Durga has been found .
Behind the naming of this statue and place many sweet stories and old stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still singing the glorious story of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshvari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories a description of the glory of Tamreshvari Devi is found .
During the time of Chetia kings in the north - eastern hills this goddess was recognised far and wide .
The people of the tribe here used to worship Goddess .
The sacrifice of humans was also offered here which was later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak city which are situated in the middle of the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the stories present here this place is ancient Vidarbha , where once King Bhishmak used to rule .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
Digaru , Mishmi etc . tribes here guide the travellers .
These people themselves also have great faith in this well .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kunda .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins as pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in Divang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The remains of brick ponds near Roing are still telling their story .
To encircle the ghats of bathing , narrow stairs and surroundings of the pond and the remains of the wide roads are still singing silently of its ancient grand legend .
We reach ero from the city of Upper Assam by jeep from North Lakhimpur for four hours .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotises the visitors .
This is the charming place where Emergency lives .
Before becoming the road of the jeep it took several days to reach here .
On reaching here the views of high goddess trees , beautiful premeros , vollet , wild curtains , strawberries and raceberries enjoy the visitors .
Apple and potatoes are produced here very much .
There is a valley spread till 26 kilometres at a height of about 1524 metres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the emergency people .
With its tireless hard work the emergencies have made it their heaven .
Here the farming of rice is very good .
This place is  Rice reserve  .
Ten miles long this plateau is a living example of their hard work and cultivation skill .
The Kali river meets the need for irrigation .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley four moons .
The eyes fall on the light redness emerging in the sky on the horizon between the snow laden mountain range of the left hand .
It is very cold in the air .
Along with the chilling cold one also feels moisture in the environment .
With the sound of garbage below the legs the layer of the wooden board is seen on the floor .
The atmosphere is humid and there is nothing more visible due to the shadow of the mist before sunrise .
The eyes remain on the redness of the east .
It feels like sitting on the bench lying in the balcony .
As soon as the hand is put , the smooth layer of the eyelid slides with the sound of a tiny kurch and the hand separates from the shock with the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from your country , this is the first experience in the life of spending nights coming in this small village settled amidst these hills covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent geneba or around it .
The dense population settled in the valley on both sides of the thin - like Balkhati river is spread far above the light slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland Rhone , on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The parallel highway of the Ron river and the raging trains on it have begun to express .
The journey of 300 kms from the car and half an hour from the car is similar to the Geneva lake and along with half the Ron river coming from the eastern direction near the city named Montreu which is found in the Geneva lake which is called Lock Lama .
100 kms long and 10 kms wide the western end of this lake Jeneva city is settled .
From there the lake again goes towards the west after becoming a river .
On the right side of the lake are mountain ranges of rice , alps .
By crossing a beautiful small city named Leuke we come on the hilly path of the north , leaving this highway from the exit -LRB- it -RRB- on the left .
Due to the slope of the mountain being southward , the sun of Aparahan is giving plenty of sunshine to all the eyes .
The quantity of snow here is less than the valley - almost not equal .
As the height progresses , the intensity of snow has started increasing .
Despite being frozen on both sides of the road , there is no special coolness in the air due to clear sky and bright sun .
After finishing a journey of approximately 20 k . . on this rotating hilly road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal .
Shailet - There are large multi-storeyed bungalows made of wood with sloping roofs .
This three storied bungalow has rooms to control necessary services like electricity , water and ladder along with parking of trains in the basement made of cement concrete .
Valai is famous for its cultivation in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of grapes .
Grapes are cultivated on the terrain of 37  of the entire canton .
In villages settled on both the sides of the Roon Valley gardens of grapes provide a unique dimension to its beauty .
Taking them to the bottom of the grapes gardens of grapes , touring them are an integral part of the tourism business here by taking night rest in their villages and taking them to the grapes of wine testing .
In a small town named Aigle there is a very big museum of grapes in a garden built in 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to get agrim booking .
Once again we pass through the same jungle , which was destroyed by the Christians .
Throughout the road till three - four kms the mind becomes even more distressed by the shouting questions of children .
Suddenly a turn comes from the scene , dramatic and charming changes .
Just in front , on the slope above the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
On the flat slope above the village people are doing skiing in the snow .
The dense forest of Deodar is spread up to the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining due to the falling rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also the same silence is spread .
From the peak of the mountain to the valley the empire of Dhaul Him .
Within the next five minutes we reach a huge round round clock in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Leukerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Lukerabad is approximately 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here can be estimated from this fact that for staying of 1700 apartments and hallets with capacity of 6900 beds there are 28 hotels , camping sites of tents , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants .
65 sleeps of hot water have been found so far in Lukarbad .
4 million liters ( daily ) heat ( up to 51  ) from them is transported to nearly 30 thirmal pools made at places in the entire town of water , some pools are within five star hotels and others are according to pockets of different income groups .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of warmth .
In the blooming sun the thick layer of snow is shining above the roof of houses .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one of the ' preserved places ' in Switzerland ' as a heritage of national importance .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can go only the taxis of Sikkim therefore there is no checking .
The journey is going on , the state is second , but the mountain is the same , the trees are the same , the crazy winds are there .
The moisture smelling on the whole body is the same .
The sunrise is the same in the rainy season .
As soon as the plan for Darjeeling journey was confirmed , it was spread to take a look at Karsyang first .
Karsyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
full of tea gardens , full of sunshine jungles .
The best tea is famous for production .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then initially tea gardens welcome those who move towards themselves smilingly .
Moving through the road between tea gardens hypnotise the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains full of forests , on the other side deep greenery .
Sometimes forests and tea gardens were seen here .
The kingdom of greenery was all around .
Once again , I was stirred up , see these natural forests or the tea plants planted by man .
Both were drawing towards themselves .
The beautiful jungle was as beautiful as the tea gardens spread far and wide .
If one gets to see the roads then the creation appears amazing .
The snake ' s move was swollen , twisted and curved .
The time was also going on .
The jungles and tea gardens were not going on .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance , a hilly house , etc . looked very dense .
It was Karsiyag .
Staying in one place here we made a program of roaming throughout the day .
Therefore taking a car we left on a tour of Karsyang .
First of all diar park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests .
The climb was up i . . to reach the Deer Park one had to leave the car very below .
Despite being decorated with beauty Karsyang has not yet emerged as a tourist destination .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite being desolate the path the joy of reaching till the Deer Park surrounded by forests and climbing the path between sunshine trees was giving us the joy .
The next place was Eagle Craig .
This is a point situated on the other side of the city at a height .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that in the era of the British lovers used to jump here and give life .
At present , it is equipped with a park and restaurant .
There is a stairs like dome here whose beautiful view is present on observing the entire city from the height .
In the tea garden surroundings , the women were busy breaking the tea - plate with a swift handloom on the back .
Karsyang is a museum outside the city , but on that day we could not go there because it was more necessary to tour the free environment of tea gardens .
The next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was a big concern how would we roam if there was rain .
But the coincidence was very good that by reaching the Rock Garden we roamed enjoying the sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming .
On going a little further below from here we found Gangamaya surrounded by hills .
Here the shade of waterfalls amidst rocks is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we found that waterfalls are charming in the empire of stones and rocks here then the magnificent world of waterfalls in the Ganga Maya is decorated with stones .
Both of these places are situated very low amidst the hills of Darjeeling .
Walking up with the help of the car we saw the Tessia Loop in Darjeeling .
With the help of telescope the entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here .
The weather was so clear .
But as soon as we moved towards Monastery , from where to decreasing , we began to glimpse .
In the evening there was a plan to walk on the mall road and shopping .
In the tour of Darjeeling twin trains take four moons in the journey .
Travelling from Darjeeling to Dhume to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Here boating and luxury in the garden in Mirik lake .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where handmade sweaters of Nepali artisans are available .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its shape is different .
Here not only the greenery of tea gardens but also the movement of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist places in Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegaon , which are full of forests and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to tour Darjeeling in the shadow of cold , but the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling tied me here .
My recent visit was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither foreign nor outside Rajasthan but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting topic in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes a special place , a ship of water or a royal train or a city like Gulabi city or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people are pulled out .
The place where I am going to talk is ready just four and a half years ago , but the preparation with which this place has come there has really destroyed the jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who stay there .
In my ears , my guide , Ram Babu Meena ' s words ,  Sahiba , before that we couldn ' t even think we could live in the forest .
Fifty per cent staff belongs to this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not get work even at the heritage hotel .
Ram Babu resident of Ajbgarh used to work in Jaipur earlier and now this unique royal style in Aman Bagh .
He has drained his own speech into a new color .
Sahiba ' is the estimation of Aman Bagh .
No one invites you there with English education .
Aman Bagh is actually a tourist destination with peaceful and comfortable facilities .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also introduces you to the nearby areas .
How many of the people who spent holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have traveled to Bhangarh of the past , why should go away , some of the people of Jaipur would have probably spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night when Shabana Azmi had called me there , but I couldn ' t go .
It is different that they had gone astray and reached Bhangarh .
This time suddenly I reached there at the feast of my foreign guests , then I felt that those who want to spend a grand holiday in less time , they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden of those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to stay for hunting .
It was built in nineteen and a hundred twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Bagh surrounded by hills and in the shadow of dense trees charms you .
As soon as you come inside the way you are welcomed it feels that divine peace has been taken into consideration here .
As soon as Mauli is built in Kalai , Mangalachar ' s mantra is enshrined alive .
We reached the slope in the evening and we intended to settle the garden around .
My host , Jackie , who was a glorious man , suddenly said , It ' s interesting .
All are inspired by palaces and palaces .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
It is not surprising that everything is new but artistic  it has not been surprised that Aman Bagh has also received the award recently .
The manager fixed our programme for the morning .
First of all on foot with Ram Babu and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Ajbgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
The dry lake was seen in which the farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw tobacco cultivation .
Jekey had such a glimpse of rural life .
After that we reached Bhangarh from the jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep concentration .
These are invaluable moments .
The way to say goodbye to Aman Bagh was also conventional , by feeding jaggery and curd he left us .
Now we realized why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept to show the tribe life .
What this is right .
Of course it happens in many states and tourists also show great interest in it .
These tours are generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying there , eating etc .
This way an attempt is made to explore places where there has not been much development and there has not been a special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time old tourist sites etc . are also present here .
Besides this , it is also taken care of serving the Traditional Kusin .
In fact , the purpose of such tours is to make the tourists aware of the ways and traditions of that place .
Although it seems a little difficult to think , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Just tour has its own fun .
Despite being with many people you can enjoy touring alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a lot of time without destruction .
Yes , it is of course that along with giving less expensive and comfortable time these tours definitely keep the demand of patience with you .
This is the reason that to enjoy them it is important to take care of some things , especially when you are watching any foreign destination through bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking the ticket .
Students , senior people of the military , children etc . get discounts on them , then there is also a discount arrangement for two people .
By the way , it is cheap to buy tickets in advance , therefore in the last moments it is better to plan just a little before planning .
Let them know about the round trip instead of the ticket .
They are cheaper .
Regulations about baggage are very strict , therefore inquire about the size and weight of the goods .
It may not be that you have to leave some goods on the terminal or pay extra fees .
Also know the rules of compensating insurance or losses from the tour company .
Take care of the bags .
Because they get fit in the rake above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the luggage during the tour you will have your own responsibility .
From where you have to take bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the bizarre season you should take special care of this .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will have the better seat option .
Keep in mind the confirt while choosing the seat .
If there are more shocks in the last seat , it is not conferable to read in the following seats .
If you have to go to Lu again and again then take a corner seat and if you do not like to be more disturbed then the window seat will be better for you .
Now it is a tricky thing .
If both of you are in a position to grab , then sit on the corner seat already and put your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus , planning will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus then keep in mind this thing as well while kissing the seat because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Make identity from bus driver and conductor .
So you will get very important information from them .
Everyone is asked to go out during the cleaning of the bus .
During this time do not leave your belongings in the seat because the buses do not take responsibility for it on its disappearance .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time , you can get a new passenger in your place and you have to wait for another bus on the terminal .

In the first week of December , the Louis cruise from Kochi started India ' s only cruise for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very popular in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems the Louis cruise has just postponed its services , but it is expected to start again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a cruise of three days at the rate of at least 5850 rupees per person at the Lui Cruise ship MV Equiamirin .
That is for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are older , children below the age of 15 are completely free .
And what to do .
The rent of cruise includes tea - breakfast , food all .
Enjoyment of every time together .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainments , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from C plane ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly if a plane is standing in front of you then you will feel like toys .
But this town with 12 - 15 seats is undisputedly excellent for touring the Oter Plane Maldives like Archipelago -LRB- Island Group -RRB- .
When it gets up in the air running like a speed boat on the surface of the water , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not feel the flight of common airplanes .
At every time your eyes remain stronger below the window - watching the resort islands and coral islands in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
Everything looks so clear .
There are only two plane companies in Maldives .
Traus Maldives is one of these which has twenty C Plane .
If you want then you can tour air for an hour in about four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- or the whole of the plane can be rented for your whole day -LRB- provided pocket is deep -RRB- .
By the way if you go to any island beyond Male Island then the journey of C plane will be necessary because this is the way of journey between different islands .
And it ' s a journey that you ' d never want to end .
C plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Mavilavaru in the best -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and sovenire shop of the capital in Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
All the salesmen were listening to the speeches given by the President Mohammed Nasheed of Maldives in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day earlier very carefully .
If we talk honestly then I did not see any Indian listening to the speeches of the presidents or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of a strange creation of the earth , it was so serious .
Many people may have considered the meeting in the water by the Maldives cabinet in October , but after visiting Maldives it seems that if the nature ' s wrath snatched it from us then the world will be so impoverished .
Something similar in the beauty there is .
In that small country , as if it was not so beautiful .
While returning to the jetty to go back to his cruise from that journey of the market , when eyes went to the sea water along with the busy road then realized how much the people here understand the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that under the light of lamppost many metres deep floating fish were visible with all its colors .
It was the part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can also see a few centimeters in the sea or river water adjacent to any city of India then you will find yourself lucky .
While returning to MV Aquamirin , he was roaming in his heart for two hours in the evening spent in the neck .
Koral Rif -LRB- Muga rock -RRB- is the life here .
So far you will also get muga stones on stones on tombs .
Just a while before listening to President Nasheed ' s speech we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not believed that we were ahead of the residence of the highest person of any country , there was no security worker far and wide .
With fun we were taking photographs of gardens and verandah just fifty miles away by increasing hand inside the gate of his bungalow .
Can you think of the leader ' s house at any time in India
It was also known that the president sometimes crossing the roads on foot two blocks reach their office ahead .
Everything about the Maldives was enchanting .
So I was eagerly waiting for the next day .
It was an excuse that the day was going to be special .
A boat from the morning cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the base of Traus Maldives roaming around the runway .
Last evening when the cruise was approaching the mall we immediately recognized the C plane passing through it .
The pictures that he had seen .
But then there was no thought that the next day he would get a chance to ride .
We were about to go to Rangali island a hundred and fifty kilometres away from the C Plane of Traus Maldives .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread over the sea of Maldives from a plane flying up to a height of about thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a thrilling and thrilling flight .
But after reaching Konarad resort of Hillton Hotels on Rangali island we felt as if we had reached some other world .
In a world that had no access to any outside world .
It was not even like that it was difficult to get out the beauty or luxury like that .
The journey on Konarad can also be on foot or by battery driven car as well .
On both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island the view of water life was amazing .
Now we could not even make ourselves comfortable with the nature around , that reached such a place , was unimaginable .
Several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
The room was actually a dining room .
On all sides we could see spectacular types of small - big fish , corals , snorkeling and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating sitting on decorated tables there was very thrilling in itself .
The fare of seeing and underwater lunch coming to this island from Male to C Plane is only 47 thousand rupees for a person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to shed our passports in water .
But I knew it was not possible .
We returned with the hope that sometimes , at some point , we will definitely bring the treachery here .
He had been planning to go out of Delhi for several days , but this was not possible due to the busyness of work .
Since childhood there was a love of wild life then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
This was the second bike tour after biking from Khardungla pass in Ladakh in 2006 till Pegong lake .
On the morning of December 27 , we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the zeal that was out of the fog made our speed reflective .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
Fog from top and bad roads in front .
Many times it seemed that it fell now .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near the park , which we had already booked .
On that day there was no special programme , we went to roam the coast of Kosi in spite of being cold .
After spending two - three hours there we left the Carbet Museum , which was very difficult at a distance of 2 kms near the Dhangi gate .
From there we went to roam Ramnagar below .
It was late in the evening .
It was clear from Delhi that if I see a lion roaming freely in the jungle then I kept looking at lions all night .
Suddenly , in the midst of the depths of the night , I heard a tremendous thunderstorm , and after that the dogs who began to scream , did not stop for two hours .
So there was a suggestion of roaming around Kaladungi and Carbet Fall first .
Kaladungi is 30 km away while carbet falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi , where some important things related to his personal life are kept .
On returning we got twelve and a half .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had settled in this very village .
On reaching the resort Safari Gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they had arranged for site site Bijrani in number one there .
On asking about number one it was told that there is more Grassland and Tigers come on the same side to avoid cold during this period .
On reaching Bijarani we were given a guide which takes two and a half hundred rupees to roam around four hours .
We left for the jungle .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusks of elephants , whose long teeth were .
I did photography very well .
Meanwhile the guide started tracking the tiger .
The guide told that there are tigers around 150 in the park , some of which have died recently .
In many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was unhappy with not seeing the Tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
I had a tiger ' s peacock ride in my mind .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I called him like this .
I told her that I have come to the carbet .
He asked if he saw the tiger or not .
His words were sounded like arrows .
I said slowly , No .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone advised us to take a ride inside .
