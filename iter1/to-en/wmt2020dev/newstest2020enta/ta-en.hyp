Bosnians protest against the Croatian nuclear program
Hundreds of people gathered in Northeast Posnia on Friday protesting against saving a portion of the waste from the only nuclear reactor in Bosnia, the neighbourhood of Bosnia, near the famous river of its border and natural beauty with Bosnia.
Demonstrators at the Bosnian Town Novicret insisted on Croatia to abandon plans for savings at the old military settlement in Tkoska Cora and pledged to fight the plan.
The waste of the Krsko nuclear reactor will be placed at that place.
The Bosnians who came with tablets of "I need a healthy future" and "Nit-Una River, we need" and said that you will comfort nuclear waste and risk 250,000 people residing in that area.
Don't say that.
This was stated by Mr. Miroslav Dyreljaka, President of the Novie Credit Corps.
We must fight to protect our lifestyle and ourselves.
Croatia owns this factory in the 1980s in Slovenia.
Officials of both countries will meet next week to discuss additional waste collections.
Croatia's national HRD television announced on Friday that it was not yet decided whether Croatia would provide its own storage facility or whether it would be payable on the savings that Slovenia has produced.
Croatian Environment Protection and Energy Minister Domislav Goric told the broadcaster that Croatia has a problem in eliminating corporate waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and is seeking a complete settlement.
Activists, officials and residents from all parts of Bosnia, from different races, insisted on choosing another area near the nuclear plant.
Why was Tgoska Kora chosen as a part of Bosnia from all parts of Groschia

Parents are usually feeding their children every day, and they know about their condition.
We were surprised when the police came and drove the children out before the school was closed and removed the food for children brought by the parents of the children.
This is unjust because we have parents to testify that their children have been kept in a bad condition as police say.

They have been kept in an unmanned environment in the name of Guru Nanak.

But rabies do not spread because of swelling in the body of the tongue .
Perhaps the disease can spread if the rabies are damaged at the place where the tongue is damaged.
If there is wound and injury in the body of the victim, the disease spreads even if there is a rabies-affected tongue.
Therefore, it is good to put rabies vaccination in the households as a precaution.

Pope warning to technicians to use artificial intelligence for common benefit
Pope Francis cautioned technicians, diplomats and financiers on Friday that there should be a competitive evaluation of public good with a competition for artificial intelligence and other forms of digital advances, otherwise it would lead to the risk of rising social inequality.
Pope addressed a Vatican meeting involving diplomats and embassies of the Government along with the philosophers, scholars and regulators.
The rest of the participants, academicians and artistic philanthropists were present at the gathering titled 'Public Good in Digital Era'.
The three-day meeting was a recent example of artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence as well as a place to discuss the dangers.
The discussion included the future of the work as the enhanced dependence on technical advances and machinery in the war system, and the decisions taken by the social media after the New ealand Christian assassination and the bogus spread of the massacre.
Speaking at the gathering, he complimented the potential potential of technological advances by describing the machines as safeguarding workers from dangerous and slackening jobs at the beginning of the industrial revolution.
He warned, however, that the higher dependence on robotics would be the risk of ending the honour of working people.
"If technology improves due to open inequality, it will not be real and honest," he warned.
If the so-called technological advance of mankind is an opponent of the common interest, the strong will lead to a tragic recession of barbarism as law.
The organizers of the meeting said that in technological matters, the Church wanted to get the expertise of the participants to explore future consultations.

The pressure was culminated after Paris-Chind German (PSG) appeared humiliating in the Champions League.

Such a hero, who can be a star of real matrix in the future by Vincius Junior, is currently in the team.
Martin Odekart, another Norwegian who was borrowed on the real sustained team, has been furious with the fascinating aid of the La Leega competition.
While playing for a real suitcase team against the Allowance team, Martin's aid was split for Mr. Mr. Oyergeb's first column, the real supplier who won 3-0 in his own field.
After getting the market on the right, the opponent kissed one of the opponents and kissed him and helped him to smash his collaborator with a very luxurious market between the two.
The second goal of William Joseph and the third goal of the benty shot this time was a simple victory for the Immanol team, and Manu Garcia, a temporary of the Allows team, was expelled for five minutes in advance.
Martin Ottackert joined the real matrix in 2015 at just 16, but could not meet the expectations.
Now the 20-year-old Norwegian youth seems to be playing well.

The independent office for police behaviour is now estimated that the prime minister should be questioned for misrepresenting criminal offenses in government office at the time of London's mayor.
The Greater London Athariti (GLA) surveillance officer has registered a case related to conduct in a report on the accusation that he was prioritized by his friendship with the Prime Minister.
When there is a report showing that a criminal offense could have happened, it said, "There is a matter of behaviour."
It does not mean that this was proven in any way.
The IOPC will now consider whether the matter should be investigated.
The matter has now been recommended to the IOBC, which deals with complaints against the police in the UK and Wales.
At that time, it was recommended to the surveillance organisation by Mr. Janson, who was equal to the Police and Criminal Commissioner.
Mr. Jaanson has denied any misunderstandings regarding his friendship with Ms. Arguri.
He asserted that he had committed a crime against a person, and said that he had agreed to the order of the London Legislature to give details of his links with Smt.
Seven years ago, Ms. Arguri, immigrant to London, was given 126,000 from public funds, and after a statement issued by the Sunday Times after Mr. Janson was granted permission on concession to three foreign business trips led by him.
After that, the government has put an end to the decision to grant 100,000 subsidies to Ms. Arguri's company, Haker House.
It confronts the questionnaire on the pre-monetary verification processes.
Digital Minister Mat Varman said that his department had done such routine procedures and that the company had a British phone number.
However, there are several reports that the phone calls have been transferred to Ms. Arguri, 34, a California office at present.
English rendering of Prime Ministers Friendship with WCD Minister
The GLA's move, which recommends the Prime Minister to the Freedom Office for Police Act, has caused 10 anger.
This is a politically provocative attack and a senior government report on the occasion of the Conservative Party Convention.
There was no evidence provided by the monitoring officer regarding any charges, and no opportunity was given to the Prime Minister to respond to the surveillance officer on Friday night.
The public and the media are well aware that this was openly confused with political perspective.
With the help of London Tourism Development Agency, a close link with the California businessman, Mr. Janson, was earlier described as a secret to all its employees.
The former officials of the London Partners (LP) agency recalled how Ms.

Las Angeles (AB) - Last year, a person was arrested and charged with drugs for the third time involving drug addiction.
In September, the court documents suggest that Stephen Walter was selling illicit oxygodon pills placed in Fenton, which Miller had previously succumbed to the excessive death of Cocaine, alcohol and the illness caused by thousands of lives in the US.
Walter has been charged that another person, Cameron Petit, had given Miller pills.
The court documents issued Tuesday claimed that they had obtained petty drugs from the Walter since August.
Earlier this week, Ryan Reviews, who was arrested in Lake Hawas City in Arizona, was charged with being a 'Runner' who carried pills to the box.
None of them were directly charged with Miller's death, nor made any appeal.
Walter, who was released in a 2005 drug case for supervision, has already been ordered to enjoy a five-month imprisonment for breach of the terms of his release.
On Thursday, well-known Internet TMESAT first revealed that the lawyers dealing with the case have asked Walter to stay in prison until the trial.
None of the telephone reports sent to his lawyer immediately.
On September 4, the Federal court was charged with the petition and his attorney refused to comment.
Miller's response is an open talk on his stress and drug usage, which has made some of the greatest people in the hip-hap as fans.
Malcolm James Myers McCormick, a real-named Pittsburg, had a two-year relationship with the singer Aryana Grand, which was concluded in early 2018.
After his death, the singer shared a lovely video of him to his Instagram and published a song "Tangk You Next", in which he was dearly referred to.
Miller's death is also one of the deaths of musicians associated with the use of Obide in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, a artist in the 3 Dorce Town team, died in 2016, having Fenton and Hydrocotone in his body.
The article has been revised to show that Walter's first name is Steven or Stephen.
The Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Shri Trivendra Singh Rawat has said that 650 Gram Parasitamal pills of people suffering from dengue fever are sufficient and there is no need to take it seriously.
This irresponsible talk of the Chief Minister has created a major controversy in the state.
So far, more than a thousand people have been treated with dengue fever in the state of Uttarakhand.
The opposition parties, including the Congress, are accusing the government of not taking appropriate precautionary measures.
In such a situation, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand said that due to the government taking appropriate precautionary measures, the Chief Minister visited the hospitals directly and asked for the benefit of those suffering from dengue.
He had asked for good, and had he come, he wouldn't have said anything, but he had argued.
In response to 500 grams of paracetamol pill, 650 grams of paracetamol pills were taken and even if they relaxed, the dengue fever would run away.
Health officials have said that those suffering from dengue fever should not take pills on their own.
Just a few months ago, the same Chief Minister had expressed his view that a respiratory cycle would be cured by standing there in the air from Pacific.
9-year-old Nigerian boy makes more than 30 cell phone games
The 9-year-old boy is using the Scratch 2 free processing app to create a blind sport.
Scratch 2 permits users to make sports, animations and stories online or apple.
So far, he has used it in hunger to create more than 30 mobile phones.
The boy has refused to disappear in this game.
The player gets a point when he catches the vault emanating from his hiding place.
I learnt how to make sports.
"Now, while fighting me, I am fooled by creating sports," said the hungry CNN.
In March, his father included him in a 5-day shooting camp for children between 5 and 15 years.
The Camp, organised by the Codpest International, was made to provide access to emerging technologies like Pacific, Robotics and Authorities.
In his father's hungry, Okbara Cheneyer said he had played a lot of mobile games in the hungry season.
When he was four years old, I bought a tablet.
He played a very high number of candicrosses and template runs," said his father to CNN.
But after his father plans to spend all the time in sports, he was hungry at the age of seven.
"As usual, he was playing a peacock in his tablet, so I was angry," his father said.
I told him, 'You've always been playing and others are thinking about making a game to play your game'
I was angry when he said it, but I don't know he took it seriously.
Since then, he was very enthusiastic about learning how to make sports, so his parents took him a bowl and taught him the basis for making sports.
The hunger he wants to become a scientist in the future is based on what his sports are about.
One of his sports 'Maskedo Mash' is available in the Cuckle Blair store.
Africa has the largest number of youngsters in the world, and when it comes to innovation, those like hunger in the continent are at the forefront.
Two of the 12-year-old Nigerian boys were recently felicitated for creating roles for the Robos to do their homework.
In the month of May, Team Akropat, all women high school in Canada, created a framework for laying robot boxes and won the 2019 Robofest competition.
With huge technicians like Cuhil and Myrosoft increasing their investments in Africa, hunger and his colleagues are becoming future targets.
The former president of the North Carolina Republican Party is going to confess the crime for lying in the investigation.
The court documents filed on Friday reported that Carolina would confess to the former Republican court that she had lied to the Federal authorities who conducted a false investigation into the main political donor.
The Federal Court reports that Rabin Hayes is going to admit the crime next Wednesday.
Hayes was aware of the fact that the FBI agents, who had conducted a false investigation in 2018, had made a part of the Criminal Procurement Agreement and signed by the lawyer of Hayes.
The Criminal Procurement Agreement has been branded and does not really mention any allegations he admits.
He was initially charged with allegations of conspiracy, bribery and genuine information.
The state's chief insurance regulation organisation, which contributed to the election campaign, was charged by lawyers for the involvement of former MP Heys in the insurance officer's plan to get special concessions.
The officer, Krek Lindberg and his colleagues, have been charged with attempting to bribe State Insurance Commissioner Mike Kaze.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment company, who has been one of the state's leading political donors in recent years, who has contributed more than 5 million in 2016 to the state and federal candidates.
While he was blaming Republican policies and its politicians, he also conveyed to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to the email sent on Friday in response to the comments.
Kernes Davis, a lawyer for Hayes, did not respond to any further email sent to him on Friday.
In August 2018, the FBI agents reported that Hayes lied on Friday that he had never spoken to Cases about the worker in the State Insurance sector.
Heys actually spoke to the Insurance Commissioner about Lindberg's demand to replace workers inside the organisation's agency.
According to lawyers, when Lindberg asked for a meeting with Kaze, Hayes helped, and Hayes directly consulted the Regulator about bribes.
The accusation issued in April indicates that Lindberg wanted special concessions to his insurance industry and that he had given up to 2 million to Kaze's 2020 re-election campaign.
The accusation is that there was a demand for the transfer of a department official who is investigating a Lindberg company.
Representative Kaze Federal told intelligence officials about his attempt to bribe him and helped him to prosecute him.
There is no charge against him.
During a conversation between Lindberg and Czech, Lindberg's ally told Hayes to send 250,000 to Kaze's reelection campaign.
Hayes initially denied that it would be taken into consideration if he sends such a large amount, but at the end of the conversation, it has also been accused of reducing criticism.
Heis said, "We will do what you all want, and we will do it."
"Yes, I'll do this to him."
The Information Officer of the Federal Lawyer's Office has not responded to further emails to the Criminal Procurement Agreement.
Memorandum of Intent to conceal the number of aspirations in a search effort to improve the well-being of the beneficiaries
As the world's first testing effort to improve the well-being of the beneficiaries, there will be no longer beneficiaries of other booking options, responses and video concepts.
On the contrary, these desires will be individual and only retaliated after Instagram's inspection in Australia in July.
The trial will also start in Australia on Friday.
Mia Carlic, Director of Australian Accessories Policy, said that this transformation is based on the viewpoint of psychologists that the number of desires compares to one another in the society.
"There are really positive opinions from many anti-corruption groups and psychiatrists working with us," Karlik said.
This is to remove the significance of the number, in fact to focus on the mindset of desires or responsibilities, to pay attention to the quality of their transition and the quality of their records.
He said that it is expected that people will feel more comfortable, not as a competition.
Carlic asserted that the industry based on minerals would continue to receive the same standards as they had previously approached.
Instagrams, like in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New ealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland, cannot be tested in other countries.
As in Mohunul, who is the owner of Instagram, nothing has been pointed out when this test can be done or whether this change will be made permanent.
"This experience (Instagram), we have just received some initial ideas from the public, but in this situation we are still learning and caring," he said.
Carlic said that Australia has the most active "entrepreneurs-renowned beneficiaries in Mukhmukh and Instagram.
We believe that this will be a very excellent country to get the best ideas about whether it is a valuable experience for the people who use our services.
Every person is grateful to the parents who have developed themselves.
There is no measure of the sacrifice made by the parents to develop a child.
It is a testimony to observe this gratitude even after their lives as much as they need to do all the necessary help.
That's why Pitharagan was created.
This is mentioned in a number of names, namely Tarpana, Piturkaratam and Peergadan.
With gratitude, they will call it 'synthesis' because it is necessary to do with pain on the day of the late month.
The goddess is Thiruvananthapuram, and the South Buddha is the guest of God, and he is the head of an eighteenth o'clock,' he said in Thirukurai.
The so-called 'Tenbulator' is a reflection of the hidden perspective.
As the world of ancestors is in the southern direction, they call the world of living 'thenbulum'.
However, it is necessary to visit Amavasai every month, even though it has been mentioned for several days to visit.
Some people give only tea and audio amazes.
Perhaps if Pithura had not performed his penance till now, then it would have been very special if he began on the great Amavas.
This is the epic that our forefathers will come to the Earth all along.
During the pilgrimage sesame, water, pindam, rice, garlic and food will be used.
It is a testimony that afterwards the angels will be brought to the fore.
Idea is that the ancestors who came to see their children in the world will return to Pitthurlog today.
This day it will help the family to live in the shores of Tirthankaras, to worship the Pithurs, to guide them, to live prosperously and to live in their lives.

The Chennai High Court asked the Tamilnadu government why there should be no separate reservation in government medical colleges for those studying in government schools.
In Tamil Nadu, 207 seats have not been filled up in private medical colleges for overseas Indians, they have been distributed to colleges involving private medical colleges.
The case was filed in the Chennai High Court by Deeran of Kowai, who was asked to fill these places with formal collusion.
The case came to light in a meeting of judges Kribakaran and Velmurugan.
When Shri V. P. Raman argued for a case filed by the Indian Medical Council, a list of overseas Indians would be sent to the college on the basis of 10 students in one place if they had evacuated their homes after a three-stage consultation.
The list should be filled in a sub-scheme of the appropriate rules of the college.
But I don't know if the list was filled in the army.
On behalf of the Government of Tamilnadu, Additional Chief Prosecutor Arvind Pandian will argue that the list of elephants will be sent to the college attached to Mad Dume.
Only after merit should the empty space be filled.
But it is not known how colleges are filling up.
The Supreme Court has not issued any order in this regard.
Therefore, he argued that the Judiciary should issue a definite order regarding filling up of allotment sites for overseas Indians.
Velmurugan Dattatun, a lawyer on the petitioner's side, said that 207 empty seats have been sold to the lowest index.
The intermediaries should not provide separate seats in government medical colleges to those studying in government schools, to those who go to school to private schools, to seek government medical colleges only for medical education.
Here the government doctors are paid less than my assistants than teachers.
This is an injustice to the doctors.
We order 10 individual medical colleges in Tamil Nadu to be contestants in this case.
Students enrolled in Connectivity Accounts for overseas Indians have ordered that these colleges be submitted as reports by October 15.
Pakistan's social media punishes brothers in the assassination of Guanteel Baloch
Guanteele Baloch, popularly known by his social media photographs, was murdered in July 2016.
Last Friday, the Pakistani social media had been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Guindul in the country's highest-profile 'Koravak murder'.
Famous for its attractive cells in Pakistan, which are attracted by Western civilization, but deeply disgusted by women, Baloch was slaughtered and killed in July.
His brother Mohammad Wasim was arrested.
He said, "Yes, I have killed my sister and provoked the behaviour of my sister "very provocative" a few days later.
His lawyer Sardar Mohammad AFP said that the court in the eastern city of Multan had been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in a long-standing judgment.
He will be released to the High Court in Asia last year, he added.
Earlier, Baloch's mother Anwar Mai believed that his son would be released.
"He's innocent.
She's my daughter, she's my son," he said.
The voices of Baloch's assassination internationally began to resume action against the infection of a woman who was ordinarily murdered to breach the social regulations of the deserted society.
Women have been burnt, burnt, dumped, dumped and necked for committing crimes such as selecting their husbands or selecting their own husbands.
One of the closest relatives has usually committed the killings.
They can apologize to the relatives of the victims, according to Pakistan's uizas (death money) and Diad (revenge) law.
After three months of Baloch's assassination, the Parliament passed a new legislation compulsoryly imprisoned for life imprisonment for honour killings.
The judge's own decision, however, is that a murder would be regarded as a honourable murder, so that the killers could be forgiven and forgiven.
At Balochin's assassination, his parents initially insisted that their son should not be forgiven and released.
But when they were reluctant to lose their son, they changed their minds and asked him to apologize.
However, due to international hostility to the murder, the Pakistani government has taken a rare step to declare itself a preference with the parents and made progress in this case.
The tiredness of the Pakistani cricket team and the dressing of a glamourous Scarlet on the day of the lover is one of the most well-known functions of Baloch.
This led to his protests and threats, but his betrayal as idols like Kim Kartashian was a brave and political activity for women, including the youngest.
The roots of cow slaughter are in tribal social regulations, widespread throughout South Asia, and may be affected by men, but they swear to behave with women.

Thereafter, more trains are being run on this route.
Elephant casualties have also increased since the number of trains increased.
This region is the path of elephants.

The scheme has been implemented in order to make the pregnant women healthy.
The scheme was extremely beneficial for middle and impoverished pregnant women.
Over the past one year, the maternal aid to pregnant women has been stopped without properly disbursed.
According to social enthusiastics, 'Over the last 13 months, 18,000 pregnant subsidies provided by the People's Welfare and Family Welfare Department for pregnant women have not been provided.
This has affected the safety of mother and child during pregnancy.
Borrowing and spending on maintenance of the child.
Only the nutritional plant has been provided, so far the subsidy has not been paid to the bank accounts.
In this regard, the Central Government has not yet paid the first sum of money to inquire about the government health officials.
It is reported that after payment of Rs. 2,000 from the Central Government, a balance of Rs. 16,000 will be deposited in the next two years.
But the Tamilnadu government is questioning whether the Tamil Nadu government has regularly registered the requests for pregnant women.
Therefore, the government will have to take a decree to provide immediate aid to non-subsidized maternal aid for more than a year.'

Ministry of Defence Insurgency Ministers Resistance to Paris Johnson for a Memorandum of Understanding with Brazil
Fear of top officials around the Prime Minister is increasing that the summit of European leaders remains short of just three weeks, while the time for major concessions is decreasing.
Ministers protested against Boris Johnson's demand for a compromise agreement with the European Union, reducing its Frexit demands.
While Brassels has said that Mr. Janson's alternative arrangements cannot be coincided, a new tariff talks have been stalled in exchange for the Irish box.
Senior ministers, who avoided European power procedures led by Germany's Angela Merkel, have given the last time compromise on Baxtaff for a three-year term to the Tory leader preparing for the fight.
Three different cabinet ministers who spoke on the occasion of the Annual Convention of the Tories to be held in Manchester next week are preparing to oppose him.
Conflicting with the EU with the threat of no agreement, senior aide Dominique Cammingz will call upon him to abandon the planned 'provocative' strategy and acknowledge the last time concession of the EU.
A minister said, "Time to abolish the Supreme Court verdict passed on Tuesday to finish the postponement of parliament. "On October 31, we have only one way to make a contract.
We can never get the number of people underneath and they are against us.
Now the prime minister has to push and take what he can get.
The ruthlessness does not take place, the communication's plan has clearly emerged.
We cannot fight everywhere.
The second cabinet minister has pledged to tell Mr. Janson that the former Prime Minister Teresa should try to implement the May Agreement if everything else is lost.
The senior minister added: "If this is done, I would like to tell the police to put forward the Teresa Agreement on the ground.
Now there is a sufficient number, and everybody is trying to finish it.
If we insist on this forever, all of us were finished and all of us were finished.
Sir John Major accused the police of not giving importance to the talks.
In a sympathetic conversation, the former Tory leader said: "The Prime Minister wants us to negotiate with Europe.
But we couldn't see a settlement with Brazil.
On the contrary, we see Malluk with bullocks in Scotland, analyzing eggs in Wales and voting with the public on the streets - the election campaign will appear to all the world as it is already in full swing.'
The Prime Minister acknowledged that no one should imagine, we have to go farther to reach the agreement, the Prime Minister acknowledged.
When there is no agreement, the Ben law, which enforces a three-month deadline, 'intensifys our negotiating position in Brussels.'
There is no doubt that it is blocking our negotiating situation, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues continue to make progress because of that law, he added.
Frexit Secretary Stephen Barkley is going back to Brussels today for further talks with the EU's Michael Barney.
They will advise on a document on how all Irelands are possible for food and animals.

I worked as a researcher in BBC Scotland, saying that my employer can never enter the television because of my clause.
Before I was in charge of the Clasco office, I went to London to see all the television teams and broadcast the programme.
I don't forget that in the morning, both the Timond and Mike Moris were interviewing the famous Bat Davis.
I couldn't believe that I was in the same room as one of the greatest figures.
I realized that this is the place I wanted to be.
Kelly, a local daily journalist in East Kilfrid in Scotland, became the Scotland reporter of AM TV in 1984.
He launched the GMTV, IDV Brackfast and DBREC programme and then launched the morning programme Lauryan.
He will commemorate his 35th anniversary with a special occasion to recall his unforgettable moments and interviews.

imbabwe: Singa feared to be caught
He said a senior government official feared that Tunnan-President Constantino Sivenga had refused to give the opportunity to become Chancellor at the time of the revolution, which might be a trap for the military to give power to seize power in November 2017.
Last week, imbabwe Independent told Singa to accept Chancellorship after talks with him and the army during the revolution.
A senior government official told the social media, however, that he was unable to deny this opportunity by the fear of Singa, and that he was able to understand Mugabe's plan to utilize himself to demonstrate to the leaders of the world and the African Union (AU) that he actually took office in the revolution.
imbabwe's 37-year-old ruler was prepared to hand over power to Singa, but was confirmed by government officials that Chancellor Emmerson Nangawa was no longer in office and cabinet office.
Recognizing that he was dragging power from his hands, the government officials said that Mugabe had approached Singa through an angel.
According to the senior government official, there were three persons in the middle class between the head of the military authority and the late chancellor.
The official said that the negotiators would include the chancellor's spokesman George Saramba, the then head of the Central Intelligence Agency, Aaron Neberra and Roman Catholic Fischeric Fidelis Mokonori.
imbabwe Defence Force (ISTF) commander, Singa, was separately dispatched by the former Governor of the imbabwe Reserve Bank, idian Cono Campbe, and was another member of the negotiations.
While describing Africa as a symbol of death after a lifetime, he sought the intervention of other African leaders, he sought to make the African Union unrecognised for the operation of the military.
The former (Mugabe) did not select the then CDF (General of Defence Forces) to the post of chancellor.
"It was an unbelievable attempt to rectify the most dangerous situation, and it tired a part of the late chancellor's family," wrote Jamwanda.
But there was little political manoeuvre, the late chancellor hoped that it would correct the situation at least in the diplomatic system.
Recalling the General's pledge not to deteriorate the constitutional order, this shift would have confronted them with the standpoint of the African Union on revolutions.
The late chancellor (Mugabe) hoped that the words of the generals would be confirmed that the CDF (Sivanga) would intervene, thereby disrupting the constitution.
Considering the entire situation, the African Union, which was very ruthless about how to take it on the basis of its theory of revolutions, was sure that it would have been a revolution without any other means, and that the need for military intervention would have been sure.
Thus, it was given the opportunity to calculate.
Authorities said the operation was carried out when they realized that the security forces were not prepared to defend themselves.
They said the camp was forced to write a resignation letter because the army warned him of the danger of being killed like Kadabi.
Military chiefs told him that if the citizens marched to his Flu Rub residence, we would not protect him from them.
At that time, he had two desires to defend his family and prove that the army was holding the regime.'
The then CDF and commanders correctly understood the impression.
The senior government official said that the embassy who brought the unbelievable information - through a powerful drive - Visu Tri Vemakwapa-makwapa (we are not represented by anyone, i.e., soldiers), we are not politicians or politicians.
Government officials say that the army's leaders in the area have no intention of eliminating the Campbe by their guerrillas in imbabwe, but the military has shown that they should take care of the 'gimen' surrounding him.
Campbe sought to use the same strategy to recall Nangagua, who had been slightly asylum-seekers in South Africa, considering the continuation of revolution and regime.
Besides negotiating with the military, Mugabe called for assistance from the region.
South Africa, which was the key to this process - not only because of their economic and regional strength, but also because of the then chancellor Jacob uma SADC president - refused to intervene, but as the subsequent intimidation, the military had entered the camp's house, made it clear that the South African forces would immediately come to Harare.
The New and African leaders didn't like it because it didn't want it, the news source told the Independent.

China needs a strong leadership, otherwise the policy of 'silence' suggests.
If China does not need a strong and united leadership of the Communist Party, the government issued Friday's policy note on the 70th anniversary of the people's republican republic.
The Chinese cabinet newspaper reported in a white report that the victory of the country was the party's leadership since the communist regime took 70 years ago.
The largest in China, its national conditions are complex and its administrative difficulties are rarely seen.
Without a united and powerful leadership, China would go to partition, break down and cause a catastrophe to the world.'
Chinese officials have long been justifying the need for national stability to suppress the problems with iron as they suppressed protestors supporting democracy in 1989.
On Tuesday, Jinping, the powerful leader of the world's second largest economy's anniversary celebrations, has further strengthened the party's regime and has restricted those who challenge his power since he took office in the latter part of 2012.
The Military Modernization Programme of G-Security has created tension in the region.
China does not expect China to export its model of development or import any other foreign model, but this is not just peace, the policy indicates.
The Chinese gene is not the invasion and domination of the world.
China is intimidated by the great powers of modern times, and the impact of war and turmoil has deepened, and China will never enjoy the difficulties she has experienced.
In confronting the challenges of the falling economy and the anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong, the Chinese territory, China celebrates this year's celebrations as it is confronting the US in a drastic trade war.
The country will never 'divide' China's interests and will not compromise on its security and sovereignty.
'The threats of war and the continued increase in taxes are not suitable to solve the problem,' it said on trade issues with Washington.
China is an old economy, with full industrial bonds, comprehensive market and powerful economic power.
This will never weaken the world's wars, he added.
China is confident that it will be able to confront difficulties, transform barriers into steps, create a new world.
It added that the US had to see China's progress with wisdom because China had no intention of challenging the US.
The US cannot control China, and there is no chance of preventing China's growth.
The prevention and suppression of other countries does not make the US stronger to carry out domestic problems abroad.

Tourist places are very polluted .
Sydney port covered with 21.9 billion each year for the Australian economy and a major contribution to Sydney tourism is the Oberoi House, Circular ue, Luna Pers and the port bridge, which is a symbol.
But below the bridge is a harsh fact.
Sydney's famous port is one of the most dirty waterways in the country, of which 15 Olympic swimming pools are spread every year.
This intense statistic makes this place the most attractive tourist destination for ourselves.
According to a new video called Sydney Port and Lower, cigarette pieces, plastic bags and bottles, loose shoes and clothing and dead animals are filled with water surrounding the most famous city of Australia.
But plastic plays a vital role in stopping our waterways.
Dr. Ketherin Defran, Deputy Director, Sydney Port Research Programme, said, I am an opposite person in the video released on the World Tourism Day of September 27.
It looks beautiful to see, but this is one of the most transformed and dirty toilets on our coasts.
Every hour, about 1560 kilometres of plastic is coming under our waterways, most of which are coming to the port through rain waterways.
Dr. Daffran said that the port is in a very bad condition following a series of incidents of heavy rains.
One third of these wastes are coming through rainwater.
However, with 70 percent of the plastics coming from the sea reaching the seashore, the problem of the port of Sydney is large below the surface as a iceberg.
Richard Nichols, the owner of the Men's Division Centre, pointed out that he and his team had personally taken out 500 kg of plastics every year, saying, 'If you really spend time under water, you can only know what is there.'
If most people know this (what is inside water) they will be shocked.
The greatest... we found half of the plastic bags.
The remaining 50 will be done at least by plastic.
When you look at the port, it looks very beautiful, but people don't believe that the plastic and dust are all below its surface.
Ossan Protocol Vice-Chancellor and Managing Director Germany Broadcast said that both local and tourist are the only ways to reduce the volume of plastic and waste to reach our waterways.
"It should start from the source," he said.
We need to reduce the volume of plastics, especially recycle, and be very cautious that the descent into our walls finally reaches the ocean.
If we make the sea desolate, we are going to destroy ourselves because 50 percent of our breathing oxygen comes from the sea.
It sucks 30 percent of carbon dioxide and food sources.
But it is very easy that we can correct this port and bring it to its old position.
If we destroy the sea, we destroy ourselves.
The video, funded by TOMRA as part of its comprehensive efforts to awaken Australians to protect the environment and reduce the impact of consumption of natural beverages, will coincide with a study on plastic and mental health released this month.
A poll conducted with 546 children aged 12 to 18 showed that 82 percent of the population was relieved of plastic waste and 25 percent accused the elderly of a single-use plastic issue.
While 93 percent of the 551 parents who were asked to comment, the study also highlighted the fact that the number of plastics in the ocean is increasing.

Dasmine develops the guidance for curing cancer .
Researchers have discovered a turning point in the treatment of patients that can guide the Dasmine Devils to cure cancer.
Doctors have discovered how many cancer cells hide themselves .
Researchers have discovered that this procedure is being done with the Dasmine Devils and humans .
This discovery is expected to give new ways of treatment to cancer patients .
What's common with Dasmine Devils and humans
Cancer cells that do not have eyes .
Researchers, including those from Melbourne Peter McCallum Cancer Centre, have conducted an innovation to help revolutionize the treatment of certain cancers, if they do not respond to the preventive treatment system.
It may be a key factor in resolving the dangerous contents that threaten the future of the devastating Dasmine Davids.
The study discovered that some cancer cells in humans and animals were concealing themselves by concealing a group of proteins called PRC2, preventing the disease prevention area from warning of cancer.
It may be a major challenge in treating small cell lung cancer, neuroplastoma and mercel cells.
He told Peter Make Researcher Mark Dasson AAP, "It is a great advantage of this programme that we might be able to revert the process to patients who have resistance to the preventive treatment system in some cases.
Cancer cells can be diagnosed by transforming the aims of the existing treatments to carry out the proteins of MMH indicators.
Prof. Dason said that it is possible for those with neural cancer to have long-term benefits.
This is one of the world's largest diseases.
We will be able to get better treatment for this.
Researchers believe that this discovery will ultimately be used in the tumors of the Dasmanian television that prevents the discovery of cancer cells in a similar way.
Accurately, the same process (in humans and in Dasmanian Devin Cancer) will take place, said Professor Dason.
Till now, it was very difficult to treat the tissues of Dasmine Devil cancer.
However, if the drugs used by humans can also be used by the Dasmanian Devils, it can help in controlling the disease.

Scientists have pierced the biggest planet to roam around the smallest star .
Scientists are surprised to find a solar family 30 light years away from Earth, which is surrounding a small star called Red Tower, which challenges the current understanding of the planet building.
On September 26, 2019, the art form of JJ 3512B, the largest airplane surrounding its shortest nutritional star Red Dwarf.
Normally stars will be greater than the greatest planets around them.
But the researchers said on Thursday that the star and the spell did not have a big difference in the event.
While that star JJ 3512 is 12 per cent of our Sun, the surrounding coal will be at least half of the amount of our Sunrise's huge dimension.
Carlos Morales, an aeronautical expert at the Catalonia Space Research Institute, Spain, who presided over the research released in the science journal, said this is a surprising thing.
The discovery was surprising when the theoretical patterns showcasing the usually small planets of low stars like Earth and small neptunes.
We have discovered a small star surrounding a bigger gas like Thursday,' Morales added.
Like Thursday, a vision was discovered using a vision at Caller Altogether Laboratory, Spain.
It is surrounding its star in its length for 204 days.
The Red Twords are small and low temperatures in the surface.
JJ 3512 is not only very small than our Sun, but also about 35 per cent bigger than Thursday, which is comparatively comparison with a huge potato.
They will be less refreshing than the Sun and their surface temperature will be 3800 (degree) for Kelvin (6,380 degree Fahrenheit 3,527 celcius).
That's why they have red colors," said Morales.
While there is evidence to roam the star in a second planet, a third planet may have been driven from a star family in the past, explaining the lengthy path of a coal like Thursday, Morales said.
The planets emerge from the same edge of gas and dust in the lids that make the star around them.
As a predominant example of the so-called "strong growth" model, initially one thing emerges from the strong pieces on the edge, a cyclone emerges from the air surrounding the geography of the cyclone.
The system can be explained in contrast to this habit like unstable geography.
"In this event, the protocol surrounding the young star may be a little larger and colder than expected," Morales said.
This makes the layer intact, which can lead to some dense areas.
This will enable them to grow up to disintegrate and create a planet.

During the 'Rail Air Secrets' programme, he highlighted the frequent presence of guests along with the ex-aircraft and family of Rani.
Some important royal family dogs, along with our important royal family members, may also be travelling sometimes, said Baby Shelles.

It is said that Elizabeth Rani loved four legs from a young age and had more than 30 caricature dogs since his queen was burnt to death.
It is believed that he had five caricature dogs Mandi, Emma, Linnett, Willo and Holly in 2007.
They included five cocker sponnial dogs, including Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spic and Spin, and four additional dogs, including Cider, Berry, Walkan and Candy.

However, Rani is not the only person who is attracted to clothes.
Cambridge Gomas reportedly had individual choices to carry their modern clothes - there is a rumour that every one of his clothes would have a seat.

Despite complaints related to behaviour , the trauma hotel has the right to drink alcohol .
Washington (AP) - the Washington Pollution Control Board rejected the demand for a revision of its alcoholic gains due to the behavior of the local Trump International Hotel owner.
On Wednesday, the organisation rejected the charge of the three ministers, two working judges and two Rabbis, because they had no property in the province or in the province.
According to the Washington Post, this is the second time the complainants claim that those applying for liability must abrogate the alcoholic licence of the hotel under the provincial law of 'good conduct'.

The second complaint was issued after the revival of the licence.
In Tamil Nadu, 207 seats are not filled up for overseas Indians who are not filled up in private medical colleges, which are provided to colleges involving administrative discounts.
The case was filed in the Chennai High Court by Deeran of Coimbatore to fill these places with a formal collusion.
The case was re-examined by judges Kribakaran and Well Murugan.

The corrupt police have been branded by researchers as Britain's worst police.
A report estimated that Gleveland police were incapable of all matters.
Film Komley, a researcher at HM-in constable, says that the police have been deteriorated in a very smooth manner.
Now there are new appeals for the dismantling of this force, which has seen five chief guards in six years.
The report claims that it has failed in attempts to prevent crime, arrest suspects and defend victims.
After our previous analysis, there is a significant deterioration," says HM's constable Film Komle.
The Chief Guard in Microvell left for January within a year in confronting unexpected allegations of 'extremely' but unexpected conduct.
Adrian Roberts, Assistant Chief Guardian, was sacked after being arrested on suspicion of the worst behavior.

In this regard, the telephone call contradicted Selensky's tramp to work with Bar and his personal lawyer Rudy Guliani.
Trump denied that he had done nothing wrong.
The CNN reported Thursday that the judicial national security lawyers were first warned of a complaint issued by a week before formal recommendation.
After receiving the charge as a recommendation from intelligence officials, the Judiciary decided that there was no need to conduct a propaganda financial criminal inquiry for Tramph's phone call.
Fellowsy said on Friday that the intelligence team would decide who to call for witnesses.
But he added that he believes that Pokri has become a Pokri.
He has been doing this for a long time.
Fellows said that Ukraine had trampled on his Attorney General in July's call with the leader, and that's why all of them were mentioned.
He is keen to take decisions on how to deal with the complaint.
Fellowsy said he was very concerned about the sources of secret information. He attacked them as swords on Thursday and proposed that the swords were performed in different ways at that time.
The President said that responsibility has violated the need, and I think it is dangerous.
Pelosi said, "There is an important role for those who publish secrets in expressing the misunderstandings in our government. "It is a serious doubt of the government's honesty that the chancellor has given information to the publisher.
On Tuesday, Fellows carried out a historic act to declare a formal post-mortem inquiry into the allegations that he sought to put pressure on a foreign leader for political gain.
In a letter issued to the public on Thursday, the phone was incorporated, one of whom had secretly accused of misusing his authority in the forthcoming elections of 2020.
He also accused the White House attorneys of secretly sending them out of the computer that stores the telephone papers for the officials at the cabinet level and putting them in private for information.

Concerned about the formation of the forthcoming Canadian Association (GFA) Electoral Survey Committee, Mr.
The Chairman of the Committee, Shri Frank Davis, questioned the inclusion of David and said he was not happy to be included.
In an interview with GNA Spart, he said he had doubts whether the Chairman of the Committee would be justified as the decisions of the study process could benefit him.
The Survey Committee must have neutral personalities coming from outside without any contact with any member and must be unemployed.
For instance, Mr. Davis was made the prosecutor for writing to Osai Wahu Balmar about a fee of 10.
He is a well-known Olympic supporter.
He should not be allowed to continue in the study for these two reasons because of his advantage, he argued.
Mr. Manu, a Director of Olympics, Mr. Fred Papo, said that if he appeared before the Club, there would be a discriminatory and discrimination if he appeared before the committee.

Several reforms are underway in the Cricket Board of India and State Cricket Associations under the recommendation of the Lotha Committee.
The recommendations of the Lotha Committee include that one of the Cricket Associations cannot continue in office for more than two consecutive terms and those over 70 cannot come to power.

The Tamilnadu architecture department has to hand over the Tamilnadu architecture to Mysore.
On Wednesday, the Chennai High Court ordered Madurai to respond to the action taken by the Central Department of Literacy to protect and revive the steps taken from Tamilnadu slums.
Mani Maran from Madurai: The Ministry of Archaeological Survey is controlled by the Central Archaeological Survey at Mysuru, Thiruvananthapuram.
There are conservations of the oldest clusters and historical moments in India.
The underlying text documents of the Tamil scriptures are a source of scientific confirmation of the history of Tamils.
Further, there is a documentary of Tamilnadu Malaysia (Income Capital).
In such a situation, most of the old Tamil scriptures were damaged when they shifted Mysore's office from the old building to the new building.
It has to be maintained in a systematic manner to preserve and publish the records and historical documents there.
But the documents related to Tamilnadu were not properly preserved in Mysore.
Thus, the history and tradition of Tamils remain unaware of the future generations.
Thus, Mysore told the Department of Petroleum that Tamilnadu has to be handed over to the Literature Department of Tamil Nadu.
Visa came to the court on Wednesday at a sitting with Sivaganam and R Tarani.
At that time, the judges ordered the Central Department of Literacy to respond to the action taken in order to protect and revive the archaeological symbols from Tamilnadu, on 22nd October.
Integrated Difference appeal against Australia
Justin Divrich says that the time has come to show gratitude against the Australian team that can determine the fate of the Wells City in the World Cup.
The victory against the Australian march will make them the most likely march to succeed in the decree, asserting the possibility of a conflict with France or Argentina.
But if the Australian team wins the Wells team for the 14th time in their last 15 meetings, it will collide with the UK for the last eight seats of the defence and teams.
"There is nothing to hide, the two teams will succeed and try to capture the first in the category," said Vels Correspondent Partner Difficult.
In the past few decisions were difficult, but in the past autumn, a victory against them (Australia) was sweet.
I think they will be intensely thinking about winning us again, while we want to ensure that another victory is achieved.
We know that this is going to be an important competition before coming here.
Now we have come here and the time has come to show real talent.
In the history of the world, the Wells team has won only one victory against Australia, New ealand or South African teams - winning Australians for the third place 32 years ago.
Overall, under the Chief Trainee Warren Gateland, only 7 successes have been achieved in 41 attempts against three Southern Jambs.
Wells stalled the 13-test contest against Australia last November, which remains in the 9-6 victory and is one of the most participants in the Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
When asked if there was a mental obstacle before that victory, it was difficult to say that, he added.
Those competitions were very difficult, perhaps... and I don't know.
In the last race, we left about 15 points, so if we look at the points, it would be more difficult than real.
If Wales is to win, the struggle for Divrich with Michael Hooper and David Bocca will be important for Australia's renowned regime.
He knows exactly what is going on because of the 67-year-old Divrich who has opposed these two soldiers in the previous elections.
He said that the seven are entirely global heroes.
You will always be aware that the competition will be difficult when conflicting with the world's backward voters.
Both of them are constantly the best in the world.
You know what kind of competition you will face.
One of the best men in the world to save the market is Bokaq, Michael, who is a slightly aggressive man, who has the right knowledge of Rakbi at the right time.
You have to challenge yourself with the best soldiers in the world, rather than fighting with the backbones who do not play properly.
You would like to play against the very best of the heroes, and when you play against these two heroes, you should be with the best laughter.
I cannot say that the competition to be held on Sunday is a final match, but this is an important competition for us in this world cup.
The inspiration of the society is an important part of it.
It will be difficult to win you if you continue to play well and express your vitality.
Ministry of Water Resources, Risk Reduction in Chennai Sea
As 27 seawater levels rise, four Indian coastal cities of Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Chennai have been at risk of climate change (IPCC) warnings.
The AIBC has released a study on the climate change initiative of AINA.
At the end of this century, the melting of the plains will rapidly increase the water level.
This will lead to the worst drowning in four cities of Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Chennai.
At the same time, many parts of North India will face extremely severe water conservation.
The sea level is growing faster than before.
This will affect the world's 1.4 billion people in the 2100s.
In India, not only 4 coastal cities but 45 port cities worldwide, up to 50 cm of sea level, there is a danger of floods.
With this increasing risk every year, low-coasted cargo and small islands are in bad shape.
Moreover, if there is no urgent action to reduce global warming, the climate of the sea will increase and marine life will be destroyed.
There will be no seafood worldwide.
There is a greater possibility of cyclones.
The climate of the sea has doubled from 1982 to 2016.
The Survey aims at this.

Because of the difficulty of the White House to know as to what is the nature of the post-mortem , there is complete fear ' .
On Thursday, the White House officials are blocking the decision to confront the renewed efforts of the Democrats for the post-mortem, a man who knew about the situation that 'complete fear' has been prevailing over the past week due to lack of a solution to this new problem.
The White House is close to the White House, he said, as the secret charges could seriously affect the chancellor and his surroundings, there appears to be an increase in 'discrimination, inauspiciousness and anxiety' in the West.
There is an unbelievable situation where there is nothing, the person said.
The White House officials are uncertain about what to do, not because there is no open plan for the situation, but because the usual methods used by the chancellor in the past to avoid disputes are not useful: 'It doesn't appear to be a matter of disappearance after the next news has arrived.'
Another person who knew about these suggestions said that the White House has been shocked, and if the scrutiny continues, the chances of going to the 'unresolved' position are increasing.
Another expressed the same concern that some people around the Chancellor are expected to be educated as the President is expected to exert pressure on the President every day during the enquiry examination.
It provokes anxiety that the behaviour of treachery cannot be further calculated and can be counter-attacked in unexpected ways - both at the presidential and political levels in the election year.
In confronting the unprecedented threat to his presidency, Robert Muller's revival of the war he had capable of inquiring into Russian intelligence has turned from the trauma attack to self-defense.
The Democrats and presidential candidate Joe Feden, who issued a secret, attempted to lose their credentials to the Ukraine chancellor for his political opponents by suppressing his confidence in him.
However, as many people in the White House have experienced Muller's investigation, aids and advisers have said that this time has begun to feel differently.
A person knew about the situation that he was defeated by a press conference on Wednesday when he was regarded as President.
Happy with questions on Russian intelligence, they said there was no mentality to answer Ukraine's questions.
Some of the chancellor's colleagues believe that this can only be averted by arguing that it will reduce his credibility, and that it is not known directly about the issue of telephone calls between Tramp and Ukraine Chancellor Woladimir Selenski.
Moreover, as often happens, the fact that the chancellor has been in a hurry is provoking his true loyalists to protect him.
But one of the closest nucleus to the White House said that the principal's basic recognition figures are already far above, and the recognition of the new will not be easily available to the post.
"In the next four months, there is no good in paying attention to the appointment of the chancellor, especially if it dismantles his legislature programmes and makes a headline.
Those arguing that the postal chancellor was able to assist him, the other side said that he was not fully aware of what his response would be.
Worried White House officials are looking for advisors to help in retaliation.
While efforts are still in the initial stages, the individual pointed out the plans that the effort like the war room would be beneficial or in what form it would be.
The apparent preference was that the coordinated legal and communications wars were required, in response to the protest of public support against the publication of a secret report and the rapid response to the Democrats' deployment efforts.
Foreign Minister Mike Pampio and Finance Minister Steve Nuchin noted that Ukraine would not issue a memorandum of trauma with the chancellor, and one of them knew that there was no longer a long-term warfare, except after 48 hours of publishing the document.
Robert Muller, who spoke only through his accusations, is now expected to be more pressure than during the trial, and a person who is expected to be involved in creating a response to the detention, said Core Lewandosky, a former propaganda manager, Pit Bulle, who is on the outskirts.
But for such an effort, Lewandosky said it was not true that he was heading.
"I have done everything that I have done for the last five years to support myself and his programme, but I have not consulted the chancellor about joining a team to oppose the bogus drive," he said.
Je Chekulo, who is a lawyer of treachery from Muller's trial, is also unconnected in the process of detention.
When NC News spoke about his views, he said, "We will deal with matters at a time."
As Emmad Floot, who worked during the Clinton jurisdiction and guided Muller until the end of the trial, the White House's current legal adviser has no such experience in the White House, the attorney who has experienced the jurisdiction.
A sympathetic individual told the White House's war that there was no authorities near the integration of all or the construction of war rooms - but agreed that the coordinated response and the need for a political struggle to take forward.

The Explorer of the Seas, a part of the Royal Caribbean International Family, is travelling with a new image in this summer.
After the revival of 110 million (89 million), the vessel is supposed to play all over the family with global food creations.
In this summer, the Explorer ship stands in some of the finest ports of Italy and Greece, and provides the travelers a taste of Europe.
However, after the completion of the climate of the land, it is pledged to provide a memorable experience to the sea.
The new 10m or approximately 89,00,000 reconstruction of this Explorer has transformed the ship into one of the best ways to go out with the family.
With the help of modern surf stimulators, you can swim on the ship with the help of modern surf stimulators or you can enjoy the weather in the external theatre.
However, the most modern element in all these mixtures is the mixture of a cylindrical balcony, which provides the opportunity to see sea scenes as well as passengers in the interior rooms.
For those who want to live in water, the swimming pool, converted with imagination, has the role of sports places with the essence of the Caribbean Retirement.
The surrounding island-style hatches and day-to-day beds enable the swimming pond to rest in the sunlight, while there are two modern reservoirs for the adventurous lovers in the ship.
In accordance with all ages, there is a variety of activities to spend time during the shipping period.
Children and children have an opportunity to remember the smallest of the family, while the private place for the fifteen is a part of the sports and music designed for over 12 years.
If it is not sufficient, you can participate in the ship's Studio P with the admiration of the entire darkness in the light laser sports.
While travelling on the Mediterranean, the guests also have the opportunity to discover tasty food from all over the world through widespread shipping diversities.
Recent Asian food varieties are available in the ship's Ilsumi restaurants, and Giovanni's Buddha can be obtained in the ordinary organisation by feeding traditional Italian food in the new Italian cuisine.
Other ships include Saps Crill, American Steakhouse, Boleros Latin Bar, Skunner Bar and Jani Rockets Express.
With the selection of seven and nine nights of travel, the ship has moved from Rome in May 2020.
The second European vessel of the Royal Caribbean will recently join the Aluro of the Seas, a change to split the mouth.
After a total cost of 165 million in 58 days of production, the pre-registered guests were given a bonus to spend 300 on the ship.
The fourth vessel, Explorer of the Seas, which was converted into a voluntary attempt to modernize the Royal Employees, said the ship director.
The project, which has invested more than 1 billion in 10 ships over the past four years, has every aspect of the experience of the guests and offers a variety of chilli-food adventures and food and dinner.
David New Jerusalem blames Democrats for hearing 'Nirvana Pictures of Trauma'
It is obvious that Parliamentarian David News (R-Calif) was unable to enquire into President Donald Trump.
On Thursday, he accused the Democrats of trying to get the chancellor's nirvana films to protect him.
Newans, chairman of the parliamentary intelligence committee, made the charge in an initial statement on Ukraine's allegations that he had trampled Ukraine's help in conducting an inquiry into the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Fideen and his son.
Predicting that the Democrats wanted to see the neutral photographs of the chancellor, he said that Ukraine's fraud was a 'destructive image' created by leftists and their 'sex wealth'.
The Democrats in this group, they held talks with those who thought Ukraine belonged to the country to obtain nirvana films of trekking, said New York.
People can justify why they are determined to remove the chancellor in the next one year.
After finishing his speech, the Haffpost senior political correspondent, Geneffer Pentry, decided to find out whether Democratic politicians want to know the matter deeply.
Till now, Connecticut representative Jim Haims (D) has responded only, but we doubt that many of his colleagues will believe that his word is true.
Mediate.com doubts that News comments on adjournment refer to the 'unprecedented and unsubstantiated extraordinary details' found in disputed steel documents.
It is a compilation of charges against the former British artisan Christopher Steel who claims that it is likely to be a 'clean water' for sex workers in a hotel room in Moscow.
There has been an uproar over the change in the explanation given by Honey Medical College Chief Minister Rajendran to the CBCIT police from Udit Surya, a student who has been arrested in the NEET examination for fraud.
Dr. Venkatesan from Chennai's Taddarai Peeth.
He is a doctor at Stanley Hospital in Chennai.
There was a complaint that his son Udhith Surya had done a rubbish in the NEET examination.
The CBCIT police arrested student Udit Surya and his father Dr. Venkatesen during the interrogation.
In the investigation, Udhi's father Venkatesan paid Rs.20 lakhs and cheated another student and got him admitted to the medical college.
Udit Suryah and his father were jailed in court and imprisoned.
In this regard, CBCIT police conducted an inquiry before the Honey Govt. Medical College Chief Minister Rajendran in connection with the NEET Examination.
There is a difference between his explanation and Udhi Surya's statement to the CBCIT police.
The Chief Minister of Honey Medical College, Rajendran explained that during the course of student admission, a person from Haldiquite was present.
It is reported that the student gathering was conducted on the basis of that.
The College Chief Minister said that NEET has participated in the syllabus and student syllabus and Udhi Surya was involved only in the college.
But Udhid Surya said that he was directly involved in the collusion and student gathering.
How did Udhith go to Surya's college with the Haldiket where the photo of the person who had done her day
Why didn't you fail to notice during the interaction and student gathering
The questions have arisen.
During the course of student Uday Suryah, it is now known that the list of self-proclaimed persons with photographs has been given at the medical college.
The photo and the film in the Halt Ticket are different.
In addition, the statements made by the student Udhi Surya and the Chief Minister of the Honey Government Medical College, Rajendran, to the CBCIT officials are different.
Hence, the CBCIT police have also started investigations with top officials.
If the results come to light, there will be no fault in it.
I know who is connected to.
SarathBawar said he was in the forefront of the implementation of the Cooperative Bank Abuse case tomorrow and said that I will not subscribe to the Central Government.
The Government has suffered a loss of Rs. 225 thousand crore for the Treasury due to misbehavior in Maharashtra Cooperative Bank in 2007.
The loss was reported due to breach of the regulations and loans to sugar plants and hundreds of factories.
Last month, the Mumbai Police had filed a lawsuit against the senior leader of the Nationalist Congress, former deputy chief minister Ajith Pawar and 70 people on the orders of the Mumbai High Court for the abuses.
This includes political leaders, former cooperative bank executives and officials.
In this case, the accused have been prosecuting Ajit Pawar and Nationalist Congress leader Sarathbawar on the basis of a case registered by the police.
SarathBawar was the former Chief Minister of Marathi and the Congress-led government minister.
With the election scheduled for next month (October 21) next month for the Marathi legislature, the activity of the Implementation Department has stirred up.
In this context, SarathBawar, Nationalist Congress leader in Mumbai, spoke to the reporters.
Thanks to the Department of Implementation, who included me in this case, even if I am not a member of the Cooperative Bank or anywhere to decide.
I have nothing to be surprised in this action.
I'm almost out of Mumbai for the legislative campaign.
Therefore, the Department of Implementation should not misunderstood me.
I'm going to the office of the Income Tax Department on Friday.
And I will give them the information they want.
It is their right to investigate the case.
I am the one who trusts the Constitution.
Therefore, I will fully cooperate with the inquiry.
Marathi is following the ideologies of Satharapathy Sivaji Maharaj.
We don't know how to bow before the Delhi order.
Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has denied the accusation that there is a political intervention in this matter.
Speaking about this, he said:
IGORT has ordered the police to file a case in this case and the court will prosecute the case when a fraud of more than Rs 100 crore occurs.
In such a way, the case has been taken up in the hands of the Income Tax Department.
It is wrong to say that this action has been taken for political reasons.
Renewable bio-fuel research can help reduce smoke emissions
In the recent years, electric cars and desla semi-tracks have been deploying headlines, it appears as if they are flying without a renewable energy limit: planes
However, a professor at Alberta University has developed a technology that facilitates the use of renewable biofuels as aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, Director of Agriculture, Life and Environmental Sciences at Alberta University, launched the project in 2003.
His laboratory is developing hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as edible oil, animal shoes and canola oil.
The technology is capable of using low-cost oil not just ethanol and other biofuels but also allows reduction in carbon emissions by about 85 percent from petrol-based fuels and to use waste from other factories during the process.
The technology is working to reflect hydrocarbons in petroleum based fuels.
"Our technology has been done in the first generation, to create the same hydrocarbons in diesel casoline," said Bresler.
While providing a new dimension to biofuel utilisation, the earlier biofuel technologies lose stability in low temperatures, which creates a serious problem for high-altitude flights.
"It's like the unprecedented GATH-22 problem that cannot be avoided," said Bresler.
In fact, its value is less than the diesel, but its requirement is high.
French laboratory is currently focusing on two choices to produce biofuel for the aircraft.
In the first instance, their hydrocarbon biofuel is another refinery and a less dangerous approach to hydrogen.
The second election will stabilise fuel even in less temperatures and continue to work in part-produced literature.
We will be able to play some games with the sportspersons in our reactor," said Bresler on the second election.
The risk is high.
Feroze Hydrocarbons, a sub-producer of Alberta University, is acting as a commercial manufacturer because both airlines and Canada and the US military are making more investments for renewable choices.
He said that in the future, someone can impose a carbon tax on them.
They are expecting a change in that situation.
Forge is currently running a laboratory near Edmandan's Waste Management Center and recently received US 4 million investment from Lakhid Martin, helping to build a 25 million manufacturing plant in Sompra in Andario.
The factory is expected to produce 19 million litres of biofuel every year.
While Carbon diplomacy is expected to be reduced by 85 percent, French mentions the reasons for lack of carbon dioxide in factories like fuel carrying out and producing.
"A technological person,"
Bresler said that it is also a way of taking informed decisions to create and create a variety of opportunities to select.
The High Court yesterday decided to consider the fundamental right petition filed by Sekhu Shihabdin Mohammad Shahab, a doctor on the birth and genital disease of Guru Nanak Pothana Hospital.
The petition will be taken by the High Court on January 24.
It is notable that the doctor has filed a basic humanitarian petition, challenging his detention by the criminals under various charges, including illegal observation, indefinitely collecting funds.
In the midst of the Prime Minister's request for peace, the Porris Johnson's allies are calling for peace following warning that Britain might confront riots such as Los Angeles, if Frexit is withdrawn.
A senior cabinet minister last night said that there is a danger of a drastic and mass upheaval in the country due to the change in the second ballot to the real decision.
The Prime Minister's senior coalition parties warned that Yuke would face unrest at home at the level of the turmeric slap in France over economic inequality and the Las Angeles riots in 1992.
Shri Jansen said that there should be a reduction in anger in the political language, but I will not stop the use of the word "Sanardhana".
Though he appealed for peace, a cabinet minister told the Times: 'We have not seen in this country such as the Klets Johns [Manjal Cut] struggle or the Los Angeles riots [in 1992].
People don't think this is possible in this country because it wasn't happening before.
Now they have a model of yellow shuttle struggle and modern phones to coordinate it, and only two prominent leaders need to encourage the people.
The riot broke out in Los Angeles in 1992 following the release of four white police officers in the case of black auto driver Rodney King.
At the beginning of this year, the well-known turmeric shuttles - the French revolutionaries against the Glet Johns-worn state - have caused catastrophe and devastation on the streets of Paris for over six weeks.
The Minister said that if Britain fails to quit the EU, the hopes of our political establishment will be greatly shattered.
The Minister said that if 66 percent of us say that 30 million people might be involved in the vote, 10 million people are still not satisfied.
While 99 percent of them ignored, more than 100,000 people are really angry, writing to their parliamentarians and preventing them.
There is no greater need for it, and soon thousands of people will be on the streets.
A senior cabinet minister further said that if the second referendum is changed to the end of the first referendum, there is a danger of a drastic and mass upheaval in the country.
Mr. Janson has called for a general election to resolve the Frexit issue.
He is reportedly confronted with the rebellion of ministers to cut down his Frexit demands and make a compromise agreement with the European Union.
Life sentence for his brother who killed Kaurav, a social media person in Pakistan
Woman rights experts say that justice is not largely imposed on denouncement, while the procedures are interpreted sometimes, the murderers who are charged with bail and have been subjected to suppression of cases.
Farzan Bari, a woman rights fighter and founder of Pakistan's first gender research department at a university, said that it took three years to resolve even in a very valuable Baloch case.
While claiming that it is difficult to establish credible data, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has faced at least 300 cases of deaths in the year 2018.
Many attorneys claim that the actual figure would be high in Pakistan, as the gentle-based Violence Awareness Network estimates that one fifth of the world's 5,000 honorary killings take place every year.
Sustainable Climate has caused floods and confusion in many parts of India
Indias climate has grown nearly a month, with unprecedented rains, devastating buildings, and many crops have started to decay.
Normally, at the beginning of September, monsoon will start declining in North India, but the average rainfall this month is 37 higher than usual.
The Indian Meteorological Department has said that this will be the case in the last few decades, if the same situation persists in the remaining days.
In many parts of the country, the unprecedented rainfall is still rising, the western city of India, which has recently received such rains, has destroyed the unprecedented rains on Wednesday and Thursday due to the collapse of buildings.
There was a flood in the houses and people walked through the knees on the streets, and usually such scenes were seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Rainfall occurred in Kolkata, Lucknow and other cities like Hyderabad.
Continuous rains have caused severe damage to the houses of Uttarakhand in the north.
This season started from time to time.
There was a shortage of water in many places, and the farmers were ready to wait for drought.
Farmers don't want to continue the monsoon.
It is not routine to rain so much during this year.
Prakash Mehra, a small peasant from Bhimtal in Uttarakhand, said, "My vegetables are dumping eggs, beans, peanuts and tomatoes."
The price of Indian food has increased due to delayed and sustainable climate prices for consumers.
Normally, for a kilo of 20 rupees (23) and for cities like Onkayam, Delhi and Mumbai, 80 rupees (about 1) is sold.
Festivals are also at risk.
The next big festival, Dussehra, will arrive on October 8, when the Hindus will establish the treasure of Ramayana, a very brutally laughing smile with great smiles.
The burning of the night marks the victory of good against evil.
But as these treasures are done by Kakhi, if the monsoon continues, it is likely to win in the last night.
What if a government hospital is used for various facilities such as bus stops, free vehicles, public accommodation and a public meeting of political parties
It is the state of government hospital in Uttangarai district of Thailand.
This is an important government hospital for treatment of 1000 to 1200 patients daily.
There should be no more hurricane in the surroundings of the hospital and the rules that are required to be followed in the hospitals should not be polluted.
The government hospital is suffering from sympathy as the surrounding people do not follow any of these.
Government and private buses are being stopped before the hospital's entrance.
Even if the bus stop is near the hospital, the entrance has already been stopped.
The hurricane of the feasts is sound.
Bus runners call for deficit.
Private ambulances have also been asylumned at the entrance to the government hospital.
This leads to irritation of vehicles any time before the hospital.
Revenue and Disaster Management Minister R. P.
P. Udayakumar, Minister for Commerce Industry, Government of India, was present on the occasion.
Southwest Season, Tamil Nadu and other states.
The North-Eastern Season continues for three months from October in Tamil Nadu.
During this period, there is a possibility of crossing the terrain due to weakening of low air conditions in the sea.
Tamil Nadu is ready to face the north-eastern monsoon in view of the impact of cyclones in the past.
4,393 locations are reported to be affected.
Out of this, 5 feet of water stagnant areas have been brought to the extremely dangerous list.
There is a possibility of cyclone damage in 12 coastal districts of the state.
In these districts, 121 special centers have been set up to protect the population.
Besides, it has been instructed to keep wedding halls, schools and societies ready in other districts.
1,148 crore has been allocated for rescue operations.
Moreover, the State Disaster Response Force is in operation in these districts.
A fisherman did not even die during the Gaja storm due to the government's precautionary measures.
On the contrary, the wall collapsed and electric deaths occurred.
Adequate warning measures have been taken to prevent such casualties this year.
Rehabilitation and restructuring are also underway to provide relief to the rescue operations.
Under this, action has also been taken to build houses for 1. 10 lakh people who lost their homes in the districts of Kaziranga, Thiruvananthapuram, Thiruvananthapuram and district affected by Gaja.
Thus, Minister Udayakumar said.
In revision, the temple pond is filled with a few days of dreams.
There is a Saravana liar pond in the hilly areas leading to the Amendment Mandir.
On this occasion, the devotees will walk through the mountains after taking a pilgrimage.
In addition to this, there is a three-day excitement during the audio release every year.
Thus, during the audio cycle last month, the temple administration, volunteers and devotees were brought water through a tractor due to lack of water in Tirkulam.
The Tepath Festival took place.
In such a situation, for a few days, due to the heavy rains in the city of Amendment, the water of Saravana Pongal is now flowing out.
Four years later, Thirukulam is now full.
The District Collector B. Gonnaiya has said that farmers can earn more profit by choosing and developing very fast-growing Tilpia fish.
Speaking on the occasion, he said:
Fishermen who are fishing in farm dollars will be able to generate more profit than other fishes if they choose genetically improved telescope fish.
In comparison to other fishes, Tilpia fish can be developed in lesser numbers.
Anti-sickness power is more prosperous than other fish.
Moreover, this is the kind of fish that consumers want more.
Therefore, farmers are being asked to increase the use of genetically improved fish in their farm yards.
The government is ready to sell fish farms around the year, near the Tilapia Fisheries Dam.
These can be used by farmers by buying them.
The farmers who develop these fishes should maintain a security fence around their fish farms and see them not to spread in the nearby waters.
Kanchipuram district should register fish farms in the fisheries development camp and then develop fish in their farms.
Further details can be accessed by the Director General of Fisheries (FSD) on the eastern coastal road, Nilankar, either directly on the face of Kanchipuram district or 044-24492719.
A three-month MoU has been set up to conduct DNA testing of human bones available underneath.
The MoU has been signed in collaboration with the Department of Archaeology, Madurai Kamaraj University and Harvard Medical School, Tamil Nadu for conducting DNA tests of ancient human bones that are being extracted from underground, wheat and acidic liquid bases in Tamil Nadu.
D. Udaychandran, Chief Secretary and Commissioner, Department of Archeology said:-
The MoU will be signed in collaboration with Department of Archaeology, Madurai Kamaraj Building University and David Research Institute of Harvard School.
We believe that in our future absorptions, we will discover more old human bones at places such as thorny, underprivileged and underprivileged.
These models will be sent to the DNA study.
This is a major expression of what kind of genes were there in the human bones digested in Tamil Nadu.
Amount of insecticides can increase the risk of heart disease and paralysis.
A new study suggests that working with large quantities of insecticides may become the cause of heart disease in the past.
This was the case with the Japanese Americans in Hawaii, which had been pursued for more than three decades.
Researchers found that the most vulnerable people had 45 percent more risk of heart disease or paralysis than individuals who did not work with pesticides.
The Survey emphasises the importance of the use of individual security apparatus at the time of industrial insecticides, documentation of insecticides and control of routine cardiovascular factors, he added.
He is an elderly medical officer at Hawaii University in Manoa.
These innovations have emerged from the data received from over 6,000 persons in Ohu, who participated in the Guagini Honlu heart programme.
The analysts said that these innovations do not apply to women and others as men from the Japanese family participated.
Since the pesticides have had a long semi-urban life, many of them may have been affected by their impact on health.
In the event, the maximum impact was seen within 10 years.
"After 34 years later, there was no link between heart disease and paralysis to insecticides in work," said Rodricks.
Other factors associated with old age are likely to conceal the possible link between pesticides and heart diseases in early life.
Researchers discovered that there was no significant connection between heart disease or paralysis, including insects from less to moderate levels.
Glenski-Trumph phone call: Toronchenko's comment
This week Washington became politically enormous after US President Donald Trouble began his anti-incumbency operations.
Less than political experience, Volodimer Selensky would have wanted to avoid being dragged into a political fraud.
But what we know so far about Selenski's trauma contact is whether it has long-term impacts on Selenski.
At the beginning of the phone call, Trumb told Selensky that the US is doing more to Ukraine than any other European country.
While the White House has no word for a telephone call, the German leader and other European leaders have said they are just talking about unsubstantiated plans - indicating that German leader Angela Merkel is trampling.
Selensky's response to the tramp not to accept 100 percent, but to accept 1,000 percent is considered a problem.
Selensky added that French President McCain and Merkel did not work enough to help Ukraine.
This conversation has put politicians, particularly the opposition parties within Ukraine, into the social media.
Ukraine's former chancellor, Petro Portsenko, commented on the dwarf that the EU's help is 'not yet'.
Toronchenko said he was grateful to the European Union's assistance, including sanctions and economic assistance during the 'Russian aggression' in other tents.
Ukraine politician Victoria Vassiska said, "How can we talk to Germany and France again" Others expressed concern.
Referring to military aid, Trump inquires not only about Joe Feden's son Hunter, but also about the hacked DNC chairman, but also to investigate two things, which indicates Ukraine's intervention in hacking Republican emails during the 2016 election.
Whether the relationship with Europe is a barrier or a break with France and German Chancellors.
I don't want to say anything wrong...
Following the telephone copy, Selsky said, "We thank all of us for helping us in the United Nations General Assembly in the west."
Selenski is scheduled to meet Russia, Germany and France leaders at a four-member Normandi meeting in October.
A quiet black pepper suddenly succumbs to the neighbouring stars.
And if such a blade turns into a bright atom, it is called 'Kwasar'.
Scientists have seen such six caves on the far-flung side of the US Palomer.
This has been happening within six months and has surprised the scientists.
To grow a lot of trees, they're inserting a carbon dioxide in the air and release an oxygen.
But the 'iose' 'bio reactor' instrument produced by the 'Hypergent Industries' involves a multiple carbon dioxide beyond 1 acre of carbon dioxide.
The carbon dioxide is a fascinating 'Thilla Walcaris' that grows inside the ions bio reactor like a cool breeze.

Recent restrictions have been imposed on e-cigarette chemicals.
There is not much awareness about this.
Young people have to stay away from e-cigarettes.
The e-cigarettes have misinterpreted that there is no danger.
Warming of nicotine liquids in e-cigarettes creates a variety of chemical smoke, rather than ordinary cigarettes, which will harm the health.

Police shut down illegally operating Marijuwana Wamping in San Capital Valley
L. Mande (CPSLA): Police closes an illegal marijuvana neighbourhood in San Capital Valley on Thursday
The police raided the weekend on the suspicion that illegal Marriage Web Pena was being sold, discovered at around 4.37 p.m. in an office building in Delstar Avenue's 9600 Block - Fitten honey oil-enriched ganja oil in the largest jackets.
The LT Christopher Cano in El Mande police said the authorities had found an instrument used to adjust the web cartridges.
Keno said this is a very dangerous process.
Cano, who worked in the drug sector, said that there is a possibility of fire in the process of drying oil for use in potatoes.
He said that as it is enriched, the sustainable energy in our garments will create a firecracker and cause an explosion.
If there are many jackets and such things, then the layer can be completely broken into the explosion without an ordinary fire.
A Hasmat group was invited to the empty office to capture the illegal and dangerous commodity.
The value of the captured goods and equipment is not immediately known.
Specialists have said that they have found illegal activity when they have received an unprecedented search order.
Investigators are still trying to find out who is behind the illegal vending operation.
They said that because the place was empty, they believed that the person could have built the office there.
While the trial continued, they wanted to ensure that the illegal vending material was not available to all, particularly the latest information regarding vending.
They don't even know what they really want, said Keno.
It can be mixed with other evil materials.
This is very bad for our society and children, so we always warn them to stay away from these activities.
First Elizabeth's disappearance at Hampton's court hall
It has been made by a very sweet samplet, strained with silver grams, embroidered in a sweet pong full of plants, animals and barley.
Eleri Lynne, who is responsible for garment collection in historical royal palaces, has only one claim.
Holding 100 years ago, he was lying on the wall of a small rural Parish temple, and seeing that he could be a dress far from Elizabeth's dress.
In Hierfordshire, Elizabeth's disappearance will be shown next month in the Hampton court premises, near the same rooms where Dudear Rani could wear it 450 years ago, after three years of his accident, the luxurious garment used in the altar in the temple in Bakton.
The dress of the 16th dress in the entire state dramatical cycle is the only one that will be the significance of the invention.
While there is no sword testimony that this garment was once worn by Elizabeth Rani, three years of research has been strengthened by experts that the garment must have been part of the royal family garment.
The value of White Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood, Wood Wood Wood Wood Wood Woods, Fisherman and a bear show the highest status of the former owner.
When this Council was formed, the tutor might have a similar value to the Mansion.
Moreover, in the 1950s, in the latter part of the Elizabeth regime, he would not have accepted that his opponents had wore such a fair dress as the other women in the state competing with him.
That's a big thing, so many colleagues came and looked at it.
When they were surprised to see it, it was always satisfactory to see that the royal family was one of the clothes when they came out.
The second long life in the slaughterhouse was slaughtered to garment the altar of the dark Saint Faith temple in Backton, which could not be considered unexpected.
Bakton is the hometown of Blanch Bari, who has served him throughout the long life of Elizabeth Rani, and has long linked local stories to the textiles sector.
Experts believe that Elizabeth may have given the blanch before he died in the year 1603 to the family or Parish temple, even though the dress had reached the preceding period of his death in 1590.
After more than 1000 hours of defence, more than 400 bells, the furniture of the furniture that was spent spending a very smooth hand with specifically furious slabs and fine slabs, are to be placed next in Elizabeth's contemporary paintings, showing that he has worn a couch in which he was paid the Hotfild House loan during the exhibition.
Liby Thomson, who presided over the defence, said, "When you work with valuable clothes, there is real respect for those who created them, most of its security took place in the Hampton court grounds in the greenhouses that have been converted into valuable screenplays of the building.
On seeing the earlier and later embryo, I had great respect for those who created it.
I have never worked in such a rich dragon.
Elizabeth's disappearance will be staged on October 12 at the Hampton court palace.
The incident in Honey Medical College, Udhith Surya, was brought to light in the NEET examination.
He was then arrested by the CBCIT police with his family.
In addition to this, students' identification work has been intensified in all medical colleges.
In this situation, there is a difference between the old photographs and the present figures of Jotika and student Siva Ramachandran, a student at Kovalam PSG Medical College.
This was followed by an inquiry by the Department of Medical College.
Narayan Babu, Director of Medical College, Chennai, told reporters about this today:
On 23rd, we received a complaint that the photographs of both the students were slightly difficult.
We set up a five-member inquiry committee.
Both students and their parents were also questioned.
We have compared their certificates, their NEET Selection Hall tickets, identity cards and documents from us.
At the end of this survey, it is certain that both students are not falsified.
Even though there is a small difference in photographs, this kind of problem arises.
Hence, the Health Minister has ordered that the biometric process be brought into the student's admission from next year.
The biometric and cargo registration will be implemented in the coming days.
The details of the students involved are only on record during the period of application, examination and student admission.
So no one can blame it.
Following this, the students who were questioned were Shiva Ramachandran and Jyotika, who spoke to the press.
Jyotika said, I was in the image of a double turmeric in my photo.
It was taken in school.
Now I've changed my hair.
So, it's not like that now.
And they gathered me, saying, Everything is surprising.
The problem is now that the hair is cut, and there is nothing else.
According to Ramchandran, there is a difference between the image and the old photo.
I had only one photo at that time.
It's old.
So there was confusion, the inquiry took place.
The Pandi Plastic Association has called on Prime Minister Modi to save lakhs of workers livelihood.
Sankaran and Secretary V. K. Balu said:
In India, plastic wastes are collected and recycled on the streets and on the dustbins.
Currently, all the plastic items banned in some states across India will be recycled.
Due to poverty and unemployment, plastic wastes are already recycled from 60 to 70 in India.
The remaining wastes can be used in a useful manner.
1. Plastic liquid road 2. Electricity generation can be utilized using plastic wastes in various ways, namely, 3. Petrol and diesel production 4.
Once used, carriage bags, which are considered to be important in extracting goods, are provided freely in the name of civilizational obligation to pack the goods in public shops.
Plastic carriage bags have been distributed in all the water bodies.
Because of the deficiency of grocery bags, all other wastes go into the waterways by avoiding plastic in wastes.
Unfortunately, plastic floats up.
There are 40 thousand plastic manufacturing units across India.
98 of these are small and marginal.
Thus, there are tens of thousands of shops buying plastics.
There are 2 thousand companies exporting plastic products.
Nearly 50 lakh people, including manufacturing and sales, are getting job opportunities.
5 lakh crore has been disbursed by the Plastics Department to the Central and State Governments.
There is no environmental problem for plastic industry, its production or its productivity.
Unfortunately, however, the environmental problem arises due to lack of adequate awareness about environmental health for the public.
Therefore, on October 2, we urge the Prime Minister to release several thousand small and marginal entrepreneurs dependent on the industry and several lakh workers dependent on them for saving livelihood by putting strict restrictions on plastic waste in a systematic manner.
That's how they said.

The villagers informed the police about this.
The police rushed to the scene and rescued the injured car.
One-third of the US is the head of Mexico kidnapping for drugs
CPS News saw a meeting in the west of Chicago in the morning for drugs after the sun rose shortly.
Brian McNeid, in the Drug Manufacturing Administration (DEA), showed the daylight.
Last year, about 800 people died in Chicago due to excessive drug addiction.
McNet said that 90 of the drugs in Chicago are from Mexico.
The TEA focuses on the so-called namesio servotes called LMSo.
"He was the first open priority to the DEA and provincial law enforcement in the US," said Mexico Chief Enterprise Madu Donhak.
The prize for El Menchov is up to 10 million.
He has helped find dozens of El Mancheso drug testing units in the jungle.
Elmancho's hijacker, Jellisco, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs entered into the US through sea and land.
According to the Judiciary, the kidnapper has kidnapped Koken, Methambedaman and Herain, who was hanged in the Pentagon.
El Mencho's head has been declared a 10 million prize.
He lived in California 30 years ago, where he was arrested on drug charges, and finally deported to Mexico.
That's where he started a terrible abduction.
He has a large number of weapons, Arbygis and 50 empty-weapons.
He obtained self-sufficient SWAT groups on his basis," said Donhak.
Since the shooting of the Mexico military helicopter, killing six people, and throwing many people in front of this summer, El Mencho has defended his empire without punishment.
Thousands of people have died in recent years due to the violence of the abductors.
According to Mexico government figures, there are about 94 murders per day.
The Mexico drugs captured in Chicago are very special and cannot be handled without a security shield.
In the checkpoint, the kidnappers are stamped in the boxes of Cocaine.
More than one third of them can be seen as L. Mencho's stamp.
"He is the reason for sending innocent women and children to actually kill them," says Donhak.
So, if a child dies, it is an opportunity to come from L Mancheso's organisation.
More than 67,000 Americans died last year due to excessive drug addiction.
The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Jitendra Singh has said that those who are not proud of calling Prime Minister Modi as the Father of India should not call themselves Indians.
Everyone knows that the BJP leaders continue to misrepresent Gandhi and Nehru.
A few hours before the presence of Howdy Modi in Houston, USA, Union Minister Amitsha has claimed that Pakistan's occupation is due to Kashmir.
A few days back, several BJP leaders, including Pragya Thakur, have confronted Gandhi and praised Kotse.
In the 'Howdy Modi' event in Houston, Prime Minister Modi said US President Trump was backing the chancellor.
Instead, US President Trump praised Modi very much.
In his speech, he said that there were serious divisions in Hindi and as the father of this country, he was united by removing those divisions.
It was a shock to many when Gandhiji was the father of India.
Congress senior leader Anand Sharma said, "Prime Minister Modi has used the Havdi Modi as his participant to campaign for the train.
This is a very wrong thing.
It is also wrong that Gandhiji's response to him has made himself India's father.'
Union Minister of State Jitendra Singh said, "American President Trump has praised our Prime Minister as the Father of India.
Some have protested.
Thus, those who do not have the pride of calling Prime Minister Modi as India's father should not call themselves Indians.'
The relevance of the Bundelkhand principles is due to the austerity of global multilateral mechanisms.
Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Aryasinghe pointed to the meeting of ministers of the Non-Proliferation Movement in New York, relevant to the Bundang theory due to the austerity of global multilateral mechanisms.
Speech by Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Aryasingh said:
Secretary of State Arya Singh underscores the relevance of Bundang theories as global multilateral mechanisms are austere
Foreign Secretary Ravinatha Aryasingh underscored the relevance of the Bundang theories when the global multilateral mechanisms were austere while addressing the level meeting of Ministers of the Non-Proliferation Movement held in New York on September 26, 2019, as a page of the 74th UN General Assembly.
Its moral obligation is to give voice to the concerns of the Southern world, particularly the growing smaller nations, as the unleashed movement consists of 55 percent of the global population.
Sri Lanka reaffirmed its commitment to the efforts of the Non-Proliferation Movement to meet the current global challenges to breach national borders such as conflicts, migration, climate change and infectious diseases.
Unconventional security threats such as climate change have emerged not only as economic and social challenges, but also as a threat of security that can affect society and countries due to the devastation created by man.
While welcoming the UN General Secretarys Climate Action Summit on 23rd September 2019 at the UN Headquarters, Secretary Ariasinghe expressed his deep concern over the negative impacts of climate change in islands like Sri Lanka.
The Secretary of State hoped that the COP25 to be held in Chile would enhance efforts to counter climate change by fulfilling the obligations specified in the Paris Agreement.
Foreign Secretary Ariasinghe said that Sri Lanka has the significance of opposing all forms of racism, hatred and violent extremism and the need to focus on the new threats demonstrated by the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka.
Such a global threat threat threatens the security of all countries, noting that it cannot be handled by one country alone, but that joint efforts are necessary and called for an unilateral movement to contribute in a positive and synergy to this global security threat.
Sri Lanka believes in an independent society that has been guaranteed freedom of opinion, however, the Foreign Secretary said that the threat to abuse Internet and social media bases should be alert.

In order to improve the livelihood of the poor in Tamil Nadu, former Chief Minister Jayalalitha announced the 'Amma Cement' programme at a very low price.
Cements are sold for 190 rupees.
In order to achieve this, the Aadhar Card, Family Card, Housing Benefit and Recognised Building Map or Grameen Governance Officers Approval Certificate shall be provided to the seller of Mother Cement in Tamil Nadu Nukur Material Warehouse.
The 'DD' should also be linked to the application for how much cement we buy.
After filing 'DD' oil on the Internet, cement bundles will be provided within a week.
This is the process.
This is not followed properly in many places.
There are complaints all over Tamilnadu that the abusers are getting money and selling their mother's cement bullocks on the black market.
The beneficiaries are supposed to avoid the wave, and see the cement bowls very quickly.

Sri Lanka is experiencing strong bilateral ties with Shamti, which is one of the closest neighbouring countries and South Asian countries, and is happy that one of the major initiatives taken by the new administration of the Peace Peace Prize in the past year has shown its intention to reunite public welfare.'
In particular, in January 2019, a comprehensive assessment work carried out by the Secretary of State in the evening led to a direct resolution and pointed out that any hurdles against its re-entrance should be regarded as mere deficiencies that affect all countries at times.
He insisted that more restrictions should not be placed on their way, leading to less incentives.
The Foreign Secretary also attended a meeting of 77 (G77) External Affairs Ministers in New York on Friday, September 27, 2019.
It was noted that G77 has been established specifically in order to call for global actions to meet various requirements of countries in special circumstances such as low-country countries, land surrounding countries and developing small island countries.
These problems damage economic and social development and affect their potential for achieving sustainable development goals.
The organisation must act as a joint voice to demand greater international aid and support for the affected and marginalized countries, particularly financial and skill development.
In a statement published during the Asian Cooperation Dialogue of the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministers Meeting as Co-President of the Peninsula on Scientific, Technology and Innovation, Secretary of State Ariasinghe said that the Asia Cooperation Dialogue is playing a key role in sustainable socio-cultural and economic growth in the region.

Ronald Lee Haskell: In Texas, a man who killed his former wife's family was punished.
Ronald Lee Haskel was punished for killing Stephen and Keti Stein in spring 39, 2014 and four of their five children.
On July 9, 2019, his wife, Melani Haskell, entered Stein's house to pick up a room.
He wasn't there, but his sister Keit Stay and his family were there.
The Harris County Sheriff office claimed that Stephen Stay, 39, Keti Stay, 33, 13 and 4-year-old two boys, and 9 and 7-year-old boys were killed when they were shot with a Haskel gun.
Only one person from that family lived in a 15 year old cassette stadium.
Officials said that he was completely cured after some time, but at that time he was injured.
Middlemen on Thursday unanimously rejected the claim that Ronald Lee Haschel had been buried.
The court was postponed till Monday for the punishment.
uantum Web Site Closes Truth
The decision of a US military research has brought the Guantam Internet closer to one point.
Such a website will provide the Army with unprecedented security, search and timely capabilities in the usual network approach.
The Centre for Distributed Guantine Information of the Military Research Institute of the Counter-Protecting Capacity Development of the US Army, which will be funded and managed by the Military Research Office of the laboratory, has seen an achievement by the Insprac University researchers to utilize the 50 kilometres of fiber-optic cables using fiber-optic cables.
The recession is an intermediary that can be generated between quantum products such as cubets.
The link between the two cubits, if one is measured, will affect the decision to be measured, even if the second cubit is too early.
"This is a practical distance to start two more orders and town-to-urban networks than [50 kilometres] earlier possible," said the researcher from the Insprac University and the chief analyst for the project, whose innovations have been published in the Nature Journal uantum Information.
The inter-city cave networks have been built by the fertilizers of the Puddhist cubes, which are far away, but unrestless.
Researchers said that this recession is unnecessary for setting up of a quantum internet.
This is an important step forward to make a massive distributed recession, said Sara Campbe, co-master of the Armed Forces Programme which supports this research.
After travelling by fiber, the recession level is also a high level of meeting the requirements of some of the hardstanding uses of the uantum Network.
The research team started testing the absorbed calcium at a library.
While the researchers used laser blankets to create a cave on the library, they provoked a boot collected from the cave information.
As a result, the bubbles of the atomic and illuminated vessels were retreating.
It is a challenge to send a photon via fiber-optic cables.
"Footton's channel, which is driven by Calcium, is driven by 854 nanometers, which are quickly driven by optical fiber," said Lanyan.
Hence, his team first sent the lighting vessels through a straightforward study highlighted by a strong laser.
The length of POTONE has been transformed into a long-range journey - 1550 nanometres of the current length of telecommunications.
After that the researchers sent this potato through a 50 kilometre long fiber-optic cable.
Their measurements showed that atomic and illuminated vessels were still lagging behind even after the wave-change and far-reaching journey.
These decisions provide a direct line to enable the use of calcium as it is capable of adjusting the calcium in collaboration with the High Level Cadre Cubid.
Military researcher Dr. Fretrick Fatami, who is also the Deputy Manager of the Programme, said the Army is very much needed for the largely dismantled diamond networks, precision, guidance and timely applications.
