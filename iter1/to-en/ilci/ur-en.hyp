Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side on the other side there is a mixture of both in the English language of Sindh and Gujarat .
This is called ' knife ' .
Well it 's a dialect , it does not have its own formalities .
If you have to write something then you have to write in the Gujarati fashion .
Near Bhoj only is that injection city where many times earthquakes have occurred and the entire city has been destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisalmer - Tural is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisalmer - Tural is very interesting .
The way we had come by that route if we return then we will have to take a holiday of one month and we will have to open schools here in Mumbai .
Do you , now , on calling the fast buses of Gujarat Tata you will travel in the train .
The small train from Bhoj will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and will reach Mumbai via Ahmedabad .
The tourism industry considered to be the main source of livelihood of Rajasthan is passing through these two climates .
Increasing dangers in world heritage and South Asia has deepened the profession of tourism .
From the point of view of tourism in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the major states of the country there has been a significant reduction in these days .
Fresh jungles issued by the Rajasthan government recently show that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased by more than 10 percent as compared to 2008 .
According to the estates the number of national tourists has decreased by 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of 2 . 98 crore 364 thousand 564 tourists came in Rajasthan out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 lakh 918 thousand country and 14 . 77 lakh 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these 25558691 national and 1073414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the area of tourism are very worried about this situation .
The director of Rajput Helicopter Sanjay Kushik says that the incidents of world peace and tranquility have affected the tourism profession badly .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we can not even prepare a strong basic structure of tourism here .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decrease of 3 . 29 percent as compared to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , UK , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
According to tourism for Rajasthan the present year is the best year .
This is the first time since 2002 that there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
There is nothing new from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , Havelia , Fort , Boats , Forests , All the rare are the same old for attracting tourists .
In the area of tourism if we talk of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism then all the governments do increase but nothing has been done on that side .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years the warriors of lizards and lizards have also lit up the importance of this state at international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to the tourism state but it remained confined to papers only .
Rajasthan is an example of the success of the government towards tourism . Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
With the aim of boosting tourism in Rajasthan and promoting the basic infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 AD .
This corporation provides facilities for setting up , roaming , boating etc . for tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 motorcycles , eight cafeteria , three dharamshalas , one dharamshala unit and two training palaces and one yawnings are made but the condition of this corporation has also become thin for many years .
In 2009 - 2009 the ghat of RTDC was 185 lakh , whose year 2009 - 2009 is expected to be 632 lakh .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years 40 percent rooms of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with hotels other units of corporation are also reaching this big ghat .
The main among these are the Royal Rajasthan of Hills .
Tourists do not become attractive towards this train .
Despite reducing it it did not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a decrease in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 to 2008 this fair in the tourist villages made by the Artificial Intelligence where 398 foreign tourists stayed this year the number decreased to 217 .
In the midst of this there is a saying that there is no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . Royal Garhwal .
This train is continuously benefiting .
Last year from this train RTDC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees .
In the tourist area of Rajasthan due to this ghost the worries of worries in the field of tourism are natural to be seen .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economics of Rajasthan .

The tribes here used to worship Goddess .
The sacrifice of humans was also given here since then King Gorinath Singh had stopped .
Some other ruins have been found in the Loht district of Arunachal .

The sight falls on the slightly reddened redness emerging in the sky on the top in the middle of the mountain ranges covered with snow of the left hand .
There is a lot of cold in air .
There is also a feeling of moisture along with the cold dried up in the air .
From the sound of raw raw raw raw on the wooden floor below the legs the layer of the scattered potato is visible .
There is moisture in the air and because of sun bathing before sunrise much is not visible .
Views are stored on the redness of the east .
There is a feeling of sitting on a bench in balcony .
As soon as the hand is applied the smooth layer of the palate gets rubbed with the sound of light wrinkles and the hand separates from the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from their country , this is the first experience of life spending night in this small village settled amidst these mountains buried with the snow of Switzerland .
This is my third place in Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent in Geneva or nearby .
The dense population settled on both the sides of the Khati river on the slight slopes is spread to a great extent .
This is the valley of Honey the main river of Switzerland on both the sides of which several small and big cities are settled .
The balance of the Ron river and the ringing vehicles have begun to be seen clearly on it .
The journey of half an hour from a distance of 300 kms and half an hour from the car with the balance of Geneva lake and half an hour coming from the eastern direction near the city named Rani river which is called Geneva lake in French is found .
300 km long and 10 km wide is settled on the western end of this lake in Geneva city .
From there the lake then forming a river moves towards the west .
On the right side across the lake are mountain ranges of dust , sky touching -LRB- Alps -RRB- .
Crossing the city from a beautiful footpath named Leuk we leave this highway on the left side , on the mountainous road towards the north .
Because of the slope of the mountain being towards the south the sun of the evening is giving full sunshine to the corner .
The quantity of snow in comparison to the valley is less here , almost not equal .
Jesus increases towards height , the quantity of snow starts increasing .
Despite the accumulation of good snow on both the sides of the road there is no special coldness in the air due to the clear sky and shining sun .
On this roaming hilly road after completing a journey of about 20 kms in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal .
Shillong - There are many big storied bungalows made of slopy roof , completely wood .
Three storeys are the rooms to control the necessary services like electricity , water , lunaries etc . along with the parking of vehicles in the basement made from the seminaret of this bungalow .
Wildlife Sanctuary is famous for sugarcane fields .
This is the main center of making wine grapes .
On 37 ' landmass part of the entire cantonment there is a field of grapes .
The gardens of Angor in the village settled on both the sides of the Ron Valley provide unique gifts to the beauty there .
Take the gardens of grapes , rest in the villages there by night and chewing the liquor stuff by taking it in the carpet of grapes is an integral part of the tourist beauty here .
In a small settlement named Aizawl there is a very big museum of Anguri liquor made in the 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to first book .
Once again we pass through the middle of the deserted jungle .
The mind becomes even worse by the pricking questions of children across the road till three - four kilometres .
Suddenly from a glance at one turn a dazzling and charming change comes .
Right in front , on the left side of the road on the slope of the deep valley a beautiful flag of houses is settled .
People are skiing in the snow on the slopes sloping from above the village .
The dense forest of deodar is spread till the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope .
Snow has fallen all around .
The roofs of the houses of the habitation are sparkling because of the direct sun rays .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also the same slaughter is spread .
All around from the peak of the mountain till Ghatti Dhaul is the rule of snow .
Inside the next five minutes we reach a large round chowk in the middle of this town .
The name of the town is Laukarabad -LRB- Yukerbad -RRB- .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Laukarabad is 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and doctors coming here can be estimated from the fact that there are 1700 apartments and shelters of 6900 beds -LRB- 28 hotels for staying in 1500 -RRB- , camping site of tobacco , 90 bed patients and 50 restaurants .

Reaching the village one feels complete warmth .
In scorching sun the thick breeze of snow is sparkling at the roof of the house .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Bahrain village is one of the protected places in the form of heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that in Sikkim the taxis of surf Sikkim can be done only hence there is no checking .
The journey is on , the other is the valley , but the same is the mountain , the same are the trees and plants , that is the circular atmosphere .
This is the sufficient moisture on the whole body .
Surmai Ujjala is the same in the rainy season .
As soon as the program of Darjeeling journey was completed the decision of taking permission from Krasingh first took place .
Crossing is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of jungles of sun .
Famous for production of high tea .
If you move towards Darjeeling from Silligudi then initially the tea garden Mussoorie welcomes the people moving towards itself .
In the middle of the tea gardens passing through the road wins the heart for the first time .
On one side the green mountain full of forests , on the other side deep greenery is eaten .
Sometimes the jungle here and sometimes tea gardens were visible .
On four sides was the rule of greenery .
Once upon a time greenery was done , these natural jungles were seen or the plant of tea planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful the jungle , the more beautiful the gardens of tea spread far and wide .
If we look at the roads of the way then we start feeling strange .
The movement of snakes was getting tired and narrow straight .
Time was also passing .
If it was not passing then jungle and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance only one hill house - house etc . have been seen very dense .
This was Krasing .
Staying here at one place we made a program to roam around the whole day .
After taking a vehicle for sure one has to come out on a tour of skiing .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden surrounded by large forests on all the four sides .
It was Opera that to reach till Deer Park the vehicle had to leave very low .
Despite being fascinated with the beauty of Crossing the development has not yet been found in the form of a tourist spot .
However , the city is quite unclear and clean .
Despite the passage being pleasant the joy of reaching till the Deer Park surrounded by forests and the joy of climbing the road between the trees of sun was providing us the joy .
The next place was England .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called psychoid point .
It is said that in the British times lovers used to know by jumping from here .
At present it is decorated with a park and restaurant .
There is a staircase here wherefrom on seeing the whole city from its height a beautiful sight comes to the fore .
In the nearby tea garden women were busy breaking the tea - leaves running at a very rapid pace with a typhoid on the back .
There is a museum outside Crossing city , but on that day we can not go there because touring the pleasant atmosphere of tea gardens is more important .
Next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was a charming experience in itself , but it was anxious that even if it was raining then how would we roam .
But the attack was very simple that on reaching Rock Garden we used to enjoy sports activity .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
On moving a little further down from here Gheera Gangamaya merged with the hills .
Here amidst the rocks the view of the waterfalls is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we found that there are waterfalls in the government of leopards and rocks , then the tunes of waterfalls in Gangamaya are decorated with stones in the world .
Both of these places are located very low on the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw Telasia loop in Darjeeling with the help of a vehicle .
From here the entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of Durban .
The natural beauty of the weather was till now .
But yes , we moved towards the monastery , from where did we come and swing .
In the evening the program of strolling and shopping on the road was made .
During the tour of Darjeeling , tourists enjoy boating in the journey .
The journey from Darjeeling to Darjeeling till Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Boating in Meerak lake and a little rest in Garden here .
From this route tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where sweaters made by the Nepali artisans etc . are found .
The facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city is also there .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its shape is different .
Here tea gardens are not the greenery of the gardens , but the flow of forests and waterfalls .
Kalimpong is the most popular picnic spot -LRB- Lava and Lole village -RRB- which is full of forest waterfalls .
But in lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We were coming from Kolkata to Darjeeling roaming Darjeeling in the shade of winters , here the tea garden spread from Saliguri to Darjeeling tied me with me .
A small journey of my recent times has been very interesting and unforgettable .
This journey was of no country and not of outside Rajasthan but of Jaipur very close .
Tourism is an interesting topic in itself , in which sometimes travels towards itself , sometimes there is a special place , ship of water or some royal train or a royal garden like a city or the Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Due to some special attraction people start pulling .
The place where it is going to talk is ready for about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation this place has come there , it has really made a Tuesday in the jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
In my ears the words of my guide Rambabumania , even before this we could not even think that we can live in such a way in the jungle .
50 procedure staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that even so local people did not get work in the heritage hotel .
Rambabu the resident of Junagarh used to work in Jaipur before this and now this unique royal style is in peace .
He has shaped his own words in a new color .
Peace is the style of peace .
There no one calls you English .
Shanti Baag is actually a tourist place with peace , peace , peace , peace and happiness .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it does your work from the nearby areas as well .
How many of the people spending holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have toured Bhangadh . Why should one of the people go away , some of them may have spent the night in this area .
After the opening of peace there big people of the country and abroad have reached .
I also remember that night when the prime minister had called me there with a loud heart , but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Mangad after breaking the road .
This time when suddenly I reached there on the invitation of my foreign guest , then it seemed as if those people who want to spend a grand holiday in less time , they should definitely go to Shantibagh .
This garden is the only garden protected from these seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to stay for hunting .
Its construction was done in sixteenth century .
Its old wall is witness of these days .
The first glimpse of peace in the shadow of dense trees surrounded by mountains draws you .
As soon as you come inside , the way you are welcomed , it feels as if a lot of attention has been paid to the spiritual peace here .
Along with binding the radish in the crown the mantra of Mangalachar is made alive .
We had reached the slope in the evening and we made an attempt to plant a circular garden .
My host J . . . who is an expert in a decoration , suddenly speaking , this is interesting .
All are affected by havelis and palaces .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . No surprise has happened that Shanti Baag has got the prize recently .
The manager did our program in the morning .
First of all a journey on foot with Rambabu and then a journey of the jeep of Bhangadh .
Walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Junagarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
The dry lake was seen in which the farmers were farming .
This year there was no rain but for the first time the field of tobacco was seen .
For JK such a glimpse of the life of the village was a unique experience .
After this we reached Bhangra from the jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable bridge of millions .
The way of saying peace loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving loving lovings .
Now it came to be understood that why does tourist come here spending so much .
I have heard that even tour packages are kept for showing tribe life .
Is this right
Speak and this is not one in many states and tourists show special interest in them as well .
These tours are usually prepared for four days to two weeks and during this tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying there , eating , etc .
In this way there is an attempt to accomplish such places where there has not been much development and the lifestyle of nature and people has not had any special effect on time .
At the same time old tourist sites etc . are also present .
Besides this attention is also given only on doing treading cosine .
Actually the aim of such tourism is to encourage tourists to stay at this place with the means of comfort and tradition .
Although it seems a bit difficult to think , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Just tour has its own fun .
Despite being with many people by this you can take the pleasure of roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give you a lot of time by making your favorite book .
Yes , it is sure that along with giving less expense and peaceful moments this tour will certainly request you to behave with you .
This is the reason that it is important to keep in mind some things for enjoying them , especially when you are watching through a foreign destination bus tour .
Find best deal before taking a ticket .
Scientists , seniors of malaria , children etc get discount on them , then for two people also there is arthritis .
However , it is cheap to buy tickets in advance , it is better to plan bus tours in the last bridges that you plan a little before .
Instead of taking a towel ticket you should know about the round trip .
It is cheap .
Taking bags the rules are very stringent , inquire about the shape and weight of these things .
There is no such thing that you have to leave your luggage on a terminal or have to pay a different fee .
Also know the laws for insurance or loss from tourism company .
Kerry onion bags stay right , lets go .
Because they come in the rake right above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of the goods will be yours .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the mixed season you should take special care of this point .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better seat you have .
Keep in mind the comfortable while selecting the seat .
However , if the attacks on the seat start more then the seat on the seats ahead will not be comfortable .
If you have to go to the toilet again and again , then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like to be more distressed then the seat of the window will be better for you .
Now we talk of a walk .
If you are in the clutches of both the clutches then sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other side .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then the planning will be successful .
If there is the facility of vasectomy in the bus then keep in mind that while enjoying the seat also because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make an identity of a bus driver and a conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus all are called to go out .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its occurrence the bus does not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops go back on time .
If you do not come at the time , then you can find a new traveller at your place and you have to wait for another bus on the terminal .

In the middle of the Pampri Industrial Area and in the place named Wakad situated on the Pune Bangalore Highway the Doono Hotel of Janjar is equipped with all the modern facilities .
The neighbouring state of Maharashtra Goa is laid with its beautiful sea shores and various water sports which is like a heaven for tourists where one gets a good view of ancient times from the tour of ancient churches .
The journal situated in the capital of Goa Punjabi makes this journey extremely excellent .
Skiing on the roads of Goa , River Cross , Cold Sea Wildlife and Ginger Hotel situated here is an excellent option for spending comfortable days enjoying enjoyment of world famous cuisines .
If we see in today 's history then for Maldives Delhi 's cheapest person returns is 28 thousand rupees .
After this if you stay in Malaysia then you can get hotels in a little bit but if you go to some island around to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then pocket will be small .
Securuz proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Loi Cross from Kochi started the unity secretariat of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Cross is a European company and is a very popular village in Cruise and Hotel Beopar .
Although due to some problems Louis Cross has stopped its services now , but from October to October it is expected that its tower will start .
Approximately 5850 rupees per person can go to Maldives for a cruise of three days at the price of a cruise on the ample amenorrhoea ship of Loi Cruise .
That is , for three days the fare of a person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are big then children less than 15 years of age are absolutely free .
And what should be done .
Tea , tea , food etc are included in the fare of cruise .
With the entertainment of every time .
Reaching the capital you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - up to the underworld from the seaplane riding .
While roaming around in the big airplanes suddenly a sepline will start appearing before you .
But this tincture with 12 - 15 seats is excellent for touring Archipelago -LRB- archaeologists -RRB- like Tunotriplane Maldives .
When it gets up in the air running like a speed boat on the surface of the water , it is not known .
In the whole of the flight you do not have the chance of the flight of ordinary aeroplanes .
Every time your sights keep on slipping through the windows - the blue water of different shades of Maldives seeing the reserve islands and coral islands .
How clean everything looks .
There are only two sepline companies in Maldives .
Transplant Devin is one of them which has 20 saplings .
If you want then you can roam around the journal -LRB- per person -RRB- for an hour or you can take the entire syphilis for the entertainment of your whole day on rent -LRB- without fear -RRB- .
If you go away from Malaysia island on some island then the journey of the sealine will be necessary because this is the only way of journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey whose ending mind may never do to you .
The journey from 12 k . . to 183 k . . -LRB- Mavelivarao in the best -RRB- takes place in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and swinear shop of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Mal .
All the Salesman Maldives were listening to the speech given by Mohammad Nasheed in Copenhagen World Conference in Copenhagen with great attention .
With honesty I did not see any Indian listening to the speech of President or Prime Minister in such a way .
But when there is a question of the existence of a rare creation of this land then it was equally important .
Many people have considered the water sitting inside the cabinet of Maldives brimmingly in October , but Maldives starts going to Maldives that if the natural disaster takes us away from us then how much will the world become poor .
This is something special in the beauty there .
No matter how much beauty is gathered in this small country .
To return from this market tour to its cruise the jetty was looted , when suddenly the eyes went in the water of the sea along with the road then it felt as if the people here understand the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that under the light of Lamp Post fish floating in depth of several metres were seen with all its colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely settled from the city .
If you can see some centimetres of sea or river water adjoining any city of India then you will find yourself happy .
The evening spent in Malaysia while returning to Amvi Aquarius was roaming in mind for two hours .
Coral Rif -LRB- Mungachattan -RRB- is the life here .
Till here you will also get to see mongoose strips on the stones fixed on the graves .
Just a while before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
It would not have been believed that till far ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country there was no security worker .
Within the gate of its bungalow we were pulling out the gardens and exports only 50 metres away by increasing our hands .
Can you think this about the house of any eminent leader of India
He also came to know that while crossing the road on foot he reached his office two blocks ahead .
Everything about Maldives was amazing .
That is why I was waiting for the next day unnecessarily .
Allahabad was that day was going to be special .
A boat from Sure Cross brought us to airport Island .
From there we reached the base of the Maldives by cutting the ropeway .
Last evening when it was reaching near Cruise Malays then we immediately recognized the sapling passing above .
So much that he had seen .
But then there was no guarantee that the next day there would be a chance of riding in it .
We were going to Rangali Island one hundred and five kilometres away from the sea plane of Transplant Devin .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying till a thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
He was a breathing club with thrill and emotion .
But on reaching the corners of Halt Hotels on the Rangli island we had reached some other world .
In such a world , outside which there was no doubt about any world .
It was not even like this that the beauty like that place was difficult to get out .
Touring on Konark can also be on foot or by a car running from a battery .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was unique .
Now we could not even take ourselves by the nature around us , that we reached such a place , that was unbearable .
While descending down in the sea water several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dinner room .
While crossing the glasses on all the sides we could see people doing wonderful kinds of charming fish , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving .
There the thought of eating while sitting on cooked meals was extremely conscientious in itself .
On coming to this island from Malaysia and doing underwater lunch only is 47 thousand rupees for a person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to float in our passport water .
But they knew it was not possible .
After returning with this expectation from a heavy heart that sometimes , sometimes at some point of time , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , some time or the other .
Many days plans were being made to go out of Delhi but due to the engagement of work this was not possible .
If you had the desire of a wildlife from childhood then why do not you think that you should go to Jamkarbeat this time .
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after the biking of Kalimpong lake ahead of Khurungla Pass in Laddakh .
In the morning of 27 December we left for Jamkarbet from Delhi , but the joy and joy that had come out , the joy filled us with speed .
The journey between Hopda and Gajraula was really tired .
The road from Upper to Kira and the road ahead .
Many times it was felt that now it has fallen .
Somehow reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett National Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Near our railway station was in Dhauli , which we had already got booking done .
This day there was no special program , despite being cold we went on roaming on the banks of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there we went out of the Corbett Museum , which was 2 kilometres away from difficulty near Dhangdi Gate .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It was late in the evening while returning .
Watching Delhi it was clear that if you would definitely see the lion roaming in the jungle then I kept watching the lion all night in a dream .
Amidst the depths of the night suddenly I was very fond of and after that the dogs who started buffaloes did not stop for two hours .
Therefore the advice of Kaladangi and Corbett Fall came first .
Kaladangi is 30 kilometres away , while Corbett falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jamkar Beat Saheb in Kaladangi where some important things related to his life are kept .
Twelve and a half budgets returned while returning .
Kaladangi is an extremely beautiful place , Jamkarbat was settled in this village .
On reaching the resort Safari Jupsi was waiting for us .
It was told that he had made an arrangement for skiing in the number one market there .
On asking about number one it was told that there is more grassland and tigers come towards us to escape from cold during this period .
On reaching Bijarani we were given a guide which takes hundred rupees for four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we had two tusked elephants , whose long teeth were .
I photographed Jamkar .
In this middle the guide started trekking the tiger .
Guide told that there are around 150 tigers in the park , out of which there have been a total of dead recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but in the absence of the vision of Tiger Udas was there .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind the tower of Tiger was riding .
Then I remembered Haldwani his old friend .
I put that same phone on him .
I told him that I had got carbohydrate .
He did n't see the tiger asked .
Its words became like a pilgrimage .
I said slowly , no .
There was no permission to take a ticket in the park .
Anybody gave us that advice inside for the safari.
