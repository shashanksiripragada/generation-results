The tourism department considered to be the main foundation of the economic situation of Rajasthan is passing through bad governance at this time .
Increasing dangers in Vaishali , Mandi and South Asia are adversely adversely affecting the private industry .
With the point of view of tourism the number of travellers coming to Rajasthan especially decreases during these days .
According to a recent survey done by the Rajasthan government the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year is less than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
The number of tourists in the country decreased by 98 . percent and the number of foreign travellers by 27 . 36 percent .

In this 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are included .
People associated with the tourist area think this situation very well .
Sanjay Kaushi , the director of the Rajput Holiday Mekers , has said that the terrible incidents like the Hashik Mandir affect the tourism industry badly .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we do not develop the strength and basic structure of our tourism here .
This is the reason that in comparison to last year foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . 29 percent .
Maximum number of foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
The attention of tourism keeps on improving in Rajasthan year after year .
This is the first time since 2002 that in Rajasthan the number of travellers decreased .
There is nothing new from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , large palaces , forts , wells , forests are all old , to surprise travellers .
In the area of tourism all the governments do the work of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism but do not do anything in this direction .
Travellers coming to Rajasthan get very little facilities .
At the same time along with the foreign tourists in Rajasthan in recent times the paintings of this country were depicted in the international level in the incidents of rape and provocation .
Years before the Rajasthan government there was a storm of tourism department in the country , but it was stuck in newspapers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of Rajasthan government in terms of tourism .
With the aim of increasing the tourism and developing the basic infrastructure of tourism in Rajasthan the Rajasthan government had established the RTDC in 1979 .
The facility of lodging , food , lodging , boating etc is available for the tourists .
The houses of this corporation are 75 lonely .
Out of these 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafteria , three cave temples , one pocket of pockets and two train bridges on hills , Royal Rajasthan on hills , but the situation of this museum has been deteriorating for many years .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC would be 185 lakh and next year in 2009 - 10 it would be 63 lakh .
The condition of the hotels of this school is this that in the last five years the rooms of its hotels are not filled with 40 square metres .
Along with the hotels other units of Thailand also make it a big loss .
The main among these is the Royal Rajasthan of Hils .
Travellers do not get attracted towards this train .
Because of less rent this does not attract tourists .
In such a situation on the occasion of Pushkar Fair the pleasure of the travellers also starts decreasing .
In 2007 - 08 in this fair there were 398 foreign tourists staying in the tourist spots made by the RTDC and this year its number decreased to 217 .
In the midst of all this the pleasant thing for arthritis is that there is no dearth of attraction of the travellers of Palace on Hills and Shahi train .
This train provides immense benefit .
Last year from this train a profit of Rs . 9 crores was made for RTDC .
It is natural to see the habits of doubt in the tourist spot from this day of Rajasthan tourist spot .

It is also the black color of the season of rains .
When the plan of Darjeeling journey was fixed then it was decided to see the sight of Karsingh first .
Carciang is a small town in Darjeeling.
The tea gardens are full of dense forests .
Excellent tea is famous for producing products .
On going to Darjeeling from Siligudi in the beginning tea gardens smile and welcome the people coming there .
While passing through the middle of the tea garden through the road the first time it hypnotises the mind , it is one of the places protecting itself in the form of wealth .
On one side the green mountain full of jungles on the other side is a deep greenery .
If there is a jungle here then tea gardens can be seen in between .
All around is the kingdom of greenery .
Once upon a time I was in a hustle-bustle , whether these natural jungles were seen or the tea plants drowned in humans .
Both are attracted to themselves .
The more beautiful the jungle the tea garden is spread so beautifully .
When eyes go on the roads on the roads then the creation starts miraculous .
Spread in a circular way we crossed a circular and circular path .
Time also passes .
Wild boars and tea gardens are not there .
Sometimes small huts are seen .
From a distance on a mountain a lot of humidity can be seen from houses and buildings .
This is Carciang .
Staying here at one place we prepared a program to roam around the whole day .
That is , taking a vehicle take a ride on a car .
First of all, the deer park.
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
One has to climb upstairs , the vehicle to reach the deer park is very low .
In the face of being filled with the beauty of Carcianic beauty it has not yet been developed in the form of a tourist spot .
Because the city is very clean .
The desire to reach Deer Park surrounded by jungles in the background of the road and the joy of passing through the middle of the sunrise gives us courage .
Next place is Egypt Craig .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
This is called suicidal point ' .
In the days of the British the priests used to stay here .
Hilhal is joined to a park and a restaurant .
There is a staircase here on the top of which beautiful scenes can be seen from all over the city .
In the nearby tea garden women drowned in the open courtyard and soon drowned in the tea leaves with their hands .
There is a museum outside the city of Karsiyong but that day we did not go there because it was more important to travel through the open environment of tea gardens .
Next day I decided to roam in Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience for me , but if it was raining then how we were thinking about it .
But the coincidence was very good that when we reached Rock Garden then we enjoyed the sunrise .
This garden is a beautiful place with rocks , streams and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more beautiful than this .
While descending a little from here we saw the Ganges surrounded by mountains .
Here in the middle of the rocks the wilderness of the waterfalls can be seen .
In the Rock Garden we can see the waterfalls blooming in the stones and rocky empire , then a marvellous collection of waterfalls in Gangamaya is spectacular .
Both these places are located very low in the middle of the mountains of Darjeeling .
On climbing upwards with the help of the vehicle we saw inadvertently in Darjeeling .
All the mountains of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of Darjeeling .
The condition of weather remains clear till today .
But when we climbed up the monastery we could see the clouds standing .
In the evening somewhere or the other one gets concentrated and shining .
During the journey of Darjeeling Tawai is also enjoyed by train .
Travellers from Darjeeling to Dhoom , Dhoom to Darjeeling are particularly attractive .
Here boating in the Mirik lake and some rest in the garden .
Through this route tourists also go to the Pashupatinath market , where sweaters and sweaters made by the hand of Nepali artists are found .
There is an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling , but its shape and color are different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here because there is residence of forests , waterfalls and waterfalls .
Kalimpong is the most popular tourist spot , Lava and Lolegram which is full of forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we did not go to Kalimpong this time .
We came to Darjeeling from Kolkata to tour Darjeeling in the shadow of winters but here from Siliguri to Darjeeling the tea gardens spread till Darjeeling connected me with them .
If I am in my condition then a small journey is very interesting and thrilling .
This journey is not of foreign countries but of Rajasthan because it is very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting thing for me , in which a journey is taken to me , but sometimes a special place is the ship of water or some Shahi train or any other tourist place like Gulabi Nagar or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people are attracted .
Whatever place he went to do , it was made about four and a half years ago , but with those preparations this place came here that they actually salute .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
In my ears the sound of my guide Ram Ram Gopal Meena was sounding , we did n't even think of the master before this how we lived in the jungle .
Eighty percent of the workers are from this land area .
Suddenly I felt that people of this place do not have to work at the heritage hotel .
The resident of Ajabagarh Ram Babu had worked in Jaipur before this , now this unique Amber garden is in the Amman garden .
He's telling himself that he changed it into a new color.
Master Aman is the dome of the garden .
There no one will call you in the power of English .
Aman Garden is actually a center of peace and comfort and comfort .
This garden has its own history , the biggest thing is that introducing it is through the nearby landscapes .
How many of the people spending holidays in Ambra Praveen of Rajasthan traveled to the dungeon of the messengers , why should they go away , some people from Jaipur residents sometimes spend the night in this area .
After the opening of the Amal Park a large number of people from the country and abroad come there .
Shabana Asmi called me there very lovingly but I didn't go that night.
Its work is different which on its own has reached Dangarh .
This time on an occasion of the visit of our foreign guests I reached there , but those people felt that in some time they had spent a precious holiday , where they must go to the Aman Garden .
This garden is the only garden saved from those seven gardens , where the king of Alavar got a shelter for hunting .
Its construction was done in 10th - 20th century .
Its old walls are witnesses of those days .
There is a witness of strong trees surrounded by mountains .
The way you are coming inside welcome you in such a way that it feels that you have taken care of the unparalleled peace here .
Along with the rubbing of the rubbish in the rubbish the spell of ashes should be kept active .
We reached Lake in the evening and made a plan to roam around in this garden .
My guest Jackie is a decorator and a watchman .
Everything is inspired by big buildings and palaces .
The most beautiful is its lighting .
Everything new and artistic has no wonder that Amal Park has been renovated in the present times .
The manager prepared our program for the morning .
First of all along with Raman Babu the journey of foot and then the jeep journey of Dangarh .
While walking on the streets of Sankari we saw the fort of Ajabagh in which the rays of the sun gradually spread .
On seeing the dry lake farmers are farming in it .
This year there was no rain but for the first time there was a crop of tobacco .
The beauty of the rural life of Jackal is a unique experience .
After that we reached Dangarh in Jeep .
In the morning I kept watching a tourist from Holland very carefully .
This is a very difficult moment to make a dollar of millennium .
The journey of Aman Garden is very popular and he told us to leave after giving shrine and curd .
Now we got to know why tourists come here spending so much of money .
I have heard that there are tourist spots to see the lives of tribals .
Is this right
There is no such thing in Bashek , there are many countries and tourists are specially interested in it .
This tourism usually starts preparing for four days to two weeks and during this tourist gets included in other places .
Wherever one stops one gets food and drinks from there .
This way we try to explore such places where there is not much development and there is no effect of time in the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time there are old tourist spots and places there .
Besides this it also keeps in mind the distribution of favorite kujin .
Actually the meaning of such tourism is to understand the ways and traditions of staying in that area .
But if you think it is a bit difficult but such tourism is a charming and different kind of experience .
It 's a fun to go on a bus .
Because of it being with many people you get the enjoyment of roaming alone .
Not only this , if you take a book of your choice in this journey then you will get more time on getting disturbed .
Yes , this is very important , along with giving less expensive and full of comfortable moments this tourism definitely asks you to take the pleasure of comfort .
For enjoying this keep in mind some things especially if you are seen by any foreign destination bus tour .
Before taking a ticket check whether it is a good deal .
Students , senior soldiers , children etc . get benefitted in this but they also get relief from other people .
However , there is arrangement of ticketing in advance , therefore in the last minute it is very beneficial to plan tourism in the bus but plan a little early .
However , there is arrangement of ticketing in advance , therefore in the last minute it is very beneficial to plan tourism in the bus but plan a little early .
This is less expensive .
Regularly it is very difficult to take the baggage , hence tell about the size and weight of the things .
Sometimes it does not happen that you have to leave some of your things in terminal or you have to pay more money later .
At the same time one should know the law of giving insurance or complete loss from the tour company .
The carriage on bags should be kept carefully and taken out .
Because there is a hustle-bustle on the surface of the seat .
Also keep in mind that while busy in the middle of the tower the responsibility of the goods is to be done .
From wherever you want to board the bus you can reach there an hour before .
At the time of smelling you should take special care of this point .
Actually the sooner you reach the better place than you choose .
Keep in mind if there is a cuffer while choosing the place .
There is more sneezing in the back side , but reading in the front seat is not a cafertil .
But if you want to warm up many times then take a seat on the sides but do not like to bother you , then the seat on the edge is very good for you .
Then one thing of intelligence .
But if you both think of gaining control then sit on the left side and keep a bag at the right place .
But if you both think of gaining control then sit on the left side and keep a bag at the right place .
But if the bus is too busy then the plan will be successful .
You should introduce bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get enough information from them .
Everybody wants to go out while cleaning the bus .
At this time do not leave your luggage on sitting , because if it is missing people do not take responsibility for it .
When the bus stops then come back on time .
But if you do not come in time then you will find a place for a new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus in the terminal .

In the first week of December the only ship from Kochi to Luis Cruise is Maldives Colombo .
Louis Cruise is not only a European institution but also an important name for cruise and hotel business .
But due to some difficulty the Louis Cruise has stopped its services but the chances of its starting from October to October remains .
You can go to Maldives from the lowest level of the ship of Louis Cruise at least 5850 rupees per person for three days including every night .
That is for three days the expenditure of a person is less than 18 , 000 rupees .
Besides this if you are two people then the whole of the child in the age of 15 years is the best .
What else
Tea and breakfast are included in the cost of cruise .
Then the whole of the time is fun .
If you reach the capital Malai then you can enjoy the activities and activities available on Maldives according to the right side of the pocket - from sea journey to lunch below the water .
You will be surprised to see a plane riding around on big planes .
But the television ride of 12 - 15 seats is excellent for roaming in an island group like Maldives .
When it flies in the air like a speedboat on the surface of the water then it can not be known .
In every flight you will not feel like an ordinary plane .
Your policies will always be below the windows - on the various sides of Maldives in blue water the resort islands and coral islands are watched .
Everything looks very clear .
There are two flight companies in Maldives .
Trams are one of them in Maldives , which has 20 planes .
If you want then you can take a flight of about 4 , 000 rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- for an hour or you can hire the entire plane for a whole day -LRB- if you have a pocket of money -RRB- .
Otherwise if you go from Maldives to any other island then it is a good way to travel through various islands .
This journey will never stop you .
C - aircraft runs 12 kms to 183 kms in Maldives .
We were in the most ancient and prosperous shop in the Ahmadi market of Mala .
All the people standing in the shop were very careful about the language done by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed during the World Heritage Conference held in Rapangan one day earlier .
If we talk honestly then I have not seen any Hindustani either the president or the prime minister listening to the language so carefully .
But it is better to embrace silence because it is a question of the bone element of a creation remaining incomplete of this earth .
Many people call Maldives Cabinetta water ride in October but when they go to Maldives then how impoverished will the earth be
There is such a speciality in the beauty there .
So much beauty can not be enjoyed in that small country .
To go back to your cruise from that end of the market you should turn towards the chatti , to know how much the beauty of this beauty is going on roaming in the sea water .
Because of the water being so clean the deep swimming fish in the light of the Kalka can be seen with all their colors .
This is a part of the sea connected with the city .
If you want to see a few kilometres fresh water in sea or river water related to any city of India then you will be cautious .
M . . . Aqua Marine was not clear for two hours in the evening spent in Mala .
Corals are the life here .
Here you will find coral on the rocks on the ceilings .
We stayed outside his office a little while before listening to the language of President Nasheed .
We could not believe that we were in front of the house of an excellent person of a country .
With utmost interest we took pictures of the garden and angle of 50 metres surrounding him by the door of his bungalow .
You can imagine such a thing before the residence of any leader in India .
It has been known by the President that at times on the road two blocks go to their office beyond the road .
Everything related to Maldives was going on one side .
Therefore I was waiting for the next day .
I knew it would be a special day.
In the morning cruise brought us to the airport .
From there we reached the place named Trams Maldives after walking on foot .
Last evening when the cruise reached Mala , the plane that went upwards quickly turned around .
Many of its pictures have been seen .
But the next time it was not known that it was possible to travel in it .
We had to go to Rangoli island at a distance of 105 kms through Trans Mall TV .
On seeing hundreds of resorts and islands spread in the sea of Maldives through the C - plane flying at a height of approximately 100 metres is a marvellous sight .
This beauty of water can not be seen anywhere else .
The journey of breathing stops with thrill and thrill .
But when the Hilton Hotel of Rangoli Island got into the Rangoli resort then it seemed as if we had come to another world .
Another world that has no relation with the outer world.
It was also anxiety that this kind of beauty , amazement would be found somewhere outside .
The journey in Karnad is possible on foot and in the car running in the battery .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going towards the main island from Jatti was marvellous .
Now we came to the place where we could bear ourselves from the natural beauty nearby , which was far beyond thinking .
A few metres below the sea with the help of stairs we reached a mirror beneath the water .
That room was actually a bouquet .
On all the sides small and big fishes , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving people were also seen .
Just as one thinks of eating while sitting on the decorated tablets there thrills us .
The cost of this island on a flight from Mala is Rs . 47 , 000 .
There was no desire to come back from there .
We were ready to waste our passport in water .
But I knew it wasn't possible.
If there is a destiny with a heavy heart then it is believed that something can come here again .
A few days back a plan was made to go out of Delhi but due to busyness it was not possible .
Since childhood wildlife was an excitement , why did n't Jim Corbett go to this time
In 2006 this is the second bike tour after a bike till Pegong Lake in front of Card and Galle Pass in Ladakh .
In the morning of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but what Joshkhat had left , the snow had stopped our journey .
The journey between Hapurd and Gajauda was spectacular .
The snow covered upstairs, the rod that bursts in front
Several times it feels like falling .
One way we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kms ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dikuli near Park and we had booked it earlier .
There was nothing special about it but despite being cold we went on walking in the lap of Kosi .
After spending 2 . hours there we went to Corbett Museum .
From there we went down to Ramnagar .
When we returned Ratri was very late .
While coming from Delhi it was decided that the lions roaming around in the jungle would definitely be seen and I had lions all around me in dreams .
In the middle of the depth of the night I suddenly heard a horrific pregnancy , after that till 2 o'clock in the night the dogs shut without stopping .
According to the first opinion Kalabhangi or Corbett waterfall was to be visited .
Kalbhangi is at a distance of 30 kms , but the Corbett waterfalls are on the way .
In the museum of  Corbett Saheb ' situated in Kalbhungi many things related to his life have been kept in mind .
It's 12.30 tonight when you come back.
Kalbhangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett started reaching this village .
When we arrived at the resort , afari gypsy was waiting for us .
He used to spend his holidays in the best season there .
Asked about the first number , because of the excessive landslides here the tiger had come here for protection from the cold .
When we came to Bijrani, we gave us a guide.
We prepared for the jungle inside .
We prepared for the jungle inside .
Inside, we saw two tusker elephants, their compounds were very big.
I took a lot of pictures.
The guide started to find the way to the tiger.
The guide said that there are only 150 tigers in the park , some of which have died recently .
At many places we saw the marks of their nails but we were sad because they could not be seen .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my thought the entire tiger was riding .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldani .
I just called him.
I told you I was coming to Corbett.
He asked me whether I could see the tiger or not .
These words of his fell on the ground like rubbish .
I said slowly, no
There was no permission to carry bikes in the park .
Someone advised me to take a ride in.
