Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yes, it's different.
On one side of Kutch is Sindh and on the other side there is a mixture of both in Gujarat and also in language .
This language is called Kochi .
However there is no writing in this language .
If you want to write it then you will have to write it in Gujarati literature .
Near Bhuj only is that Anjar city where several times the earthquake took place and the entire city was destroyed .
Near Anjar only is the tomb of Jaisal-Toral .
The story of Jaisalmer is very thrilling .
If we want to return by the way we had arrived then we will have to take another month 's holiday and there the school will be opened in Bombay .
So what can be done  Now we will take a journey of the train by extracting fast buses of Gujarat .
The small train from Bhutan reaches Rajkot .
One more train of meter gauge from there will reach Ahmedabad and will reach Broad gauge from Ahmedabad .
The tourism industry considered to be the main source of economy of Rajasthan is going through very bad conditions today .
Due to the dangers of dangers arising in Manda and South Asia there has been a deep impact on tourism business .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan running to count the major states of the country is very less .
According to the recent number of jewelleries from the point of view of Rajasthan government the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last 2001 is 10 percent less than that of 2008 .
According to the number the number of national tourists is 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists is 27 . 36 percent less .
A total of 2 crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists come to Rajasthan in 1960 , out of which 2 crore 83 lakh 85 thousand 918 foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were there , in comparison to that in 1970 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these 2 crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 690 indigenous and 73 lakh 414 foreign tourists were there .
People associated with tourism are very worried because of this situation .
The director of Rajputana Hollywood Mekers Sanjay Kaushik has said that due to the incidents of business and terror the business of tourism has been badly affected .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop and develop strong bases in our country .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India in comparison to last year is less than 3 . percent .
Among the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of tourists coming from France is maximum .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism this year has been very good .
This is the first time since 2001 that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has decreased .
Nothing has happened from the point of view of tourism .
For desert , palace , fort , pond , forest tourists everything has been kept in the old condition .
To work on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism in the area of tourism all the governments have said that nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less convenience .
Along with foreign tourists the incidents of rape and disturbances happening in Rajasthan in the last few years have also made the pictures of this state bad internationally .
The Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism in the state many years back but it was limited to papers only .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the base of tourism the Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1956 .
This nigam provides facilities like accommodation , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 757575 in this nigger .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motels , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one traveller and two trains , Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels , but the situation of this tunnel has been bad for many years .
In 1961 - 1990 the loss of RTDC was Rs . 185 lakh which was estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The hotel condition of this Nigam is such that in the last five years even forty percent of the houses of this hotel have not been completed .
Along with the hotel the other coins of Nigam have also faced greater losses than this .
The main among these is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
There is no attraction of tourists towards this railway .
It has not been able to attract tourists even after reducing the fare .
In such a situation the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair is less .
In this fair in 1962 - 08 the number of tourists staying in the tourist village made in the form of RTDC has reduced to 217 this year .
Among all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there has been some deficiency in the attraction of tourists towards the Palace on Wheels i . . the Royal Railways .
There is immense benefit by this rail route .
Last year RTDC got a profit of about Rs . 9 crore from this railway .
In the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to get anxious due to this loss .
Tourism is the biggest source of Rajasthan economy .
If a person has a desire to do something then he can make gold from the earth .
Subrata Roy has proved it by making modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
The dream he had dreamt of was a little successful everyday and he was happy with his eyes .
His happiness was seen during the inauguration of his own airport Ambo Valley .
The work of Ambo Valley started and today Ambe Valley has been successful in making its place in the form of a beautiful city .
Spread in more than 10 thousand acres this city has made hotels , houses and other facilities available on 9 percent land .
99 percent land has been provided with trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities .
In this city made for crores of people many entrepreneurs came forward to build their houses and today around 800 families are staying in this city .
Initially the entrepreneurs and the elders bought their homes here in the form of holidays but now they have made it their home and are coming to Mumbai for work from here itself .
Behind Ambe Valley is the Koyrigarh Fort which provides beauty to this region .
The ruins of Leekawali in Siang district in the west are very important .
Remains of a large temple were found after digging .
The statues of Padmasambhava and Goddess goddesses carved on the rocks of this temple are found which are found mostly in the depths .
Malini stay is an important place in this area .
At this very place Devi Durga Dussehra statues are found .
Behind the palaces of this idol and place many sweet stories and old stories are famous among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still presenting the glorious story of Arunachal today .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In the ancient literature and ancient legends the description of the memorial of Tamreshwari Devi is found .
During the period of the Chait kings in the north - east mountains this goddess was valid till far .
The people here worship Goddess .
Here Norbali used to be held which later King Gaurinath Singh stopped .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
This is called the ruins of Bhishma Nagar .
According to the famous scriptures here this place is also the old Virgin , where once the king was Bhishmak king .
Brahmakund is situated beneath the Lodhi river which is a famous place of Lodhi district .
Digru , Mishmi etc tribes here guide the travellers .
These people have their own respect for this pond .
There is a famous Parashuram Kund near the Brahmakund .
During Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above remains of the pilgrimages of Arunachal Pradesh the ruins of Rorang of Diwang - Baili district are also very historical .
The ruins of a brick pond near Roranga tell their story even today .
Recognizing the ruins of the bathing valley , narrow stairs and a wide road surrounded by packed crown on all four sides of another pond even today it feels its ancient grandeur .
We reach ero in four hours by jeeping from North Laxmipur the upper city of Assam .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subsiri district .
This charming mountainous place at a height of approximately 4500 feet hypnotises the hearts of the visitors .
This is that charming place where the apathys live .
It takes a long time to reach here before the road to Jeep .
Just as one reaches here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful pyramids , violets , wild cranes , strawberries and rabbits enjoy the tourists coming here .
Apple and potato are abundant here .
At a height of approximately 1542 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley resides in the apathy people .
By doing their tired work the parents made this place heaven .
Here rice is cultivated .
This place is called the reservoir of rice .
Ten miles long this landmass is the living example of their labour and cultivation .
Their needs are mixed with the Kali river .
The trees of pine increase the beauty of this valley .
In the midst of the snowy mountain ranges on the left side the sight also falls towards the light slope rising in the sky .
The air is very cold .
There is a feeling of humidity along with cold in the weather .
After listening to the crazy noise under the trees the sight of the fallen sand on the floor of the wood is seen .
There is not much to be seen in the weather due to sluggishness before sunrise and sunrise .
Eyes get stuck on the eastern slope .
One feels like sitting on the bench kept in the verandah .
On applying the hands the slightest sound of the circular layer of the saliva starts shineing and hands go away with the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country amidst these mountains covered with snow of Switzerland this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village .
This is my third migration in Swiss .
Before this more time was spent in Geneva or its surroundings .
Located in the valley on both the sides of the Saru river the dense population is spread to a great extent on the mild slope .
This is the main river of Switzerland , the valley of Ron , on both the sides of which is a very small and big city .
Cars are clearly visible on the highways and roads along the Ron river .
The journey of 300 kms and half an hour by car is halfway through Geneva lake and in the eastern direction Ron river coming from the eastern direction near Moto city Geneva lake which is called French Lake Lema .
Geneva city is located in the western part of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
The lake here again moves towards the west through the river .
The mountain ranges of Daily and Lake Dhabaal , Gaganchumbi Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke on the left side by exit we reach the mountainous road towards the north leaving the highway .
Due to the slope of the mountains being south - west the sun gives full sunshine in the afternoon .
In comparison to the valleys the quantity of snow is not less .
As much as the height goes the density of snow increases .
On both the sides of the road despite being accumulated good snow there is no special cold in the air due to the clear sky and shining sun .
After completing a journey of about 20 kms on this roaming hilly road in half an hour we reached a small village named Thal .
Shale - This is a big multicoloured bungalow made of wood with slopy roofs .
In the basement made of cement concrete of this bungalow of three storeys along with the arrangement of keeping cars there are also rooms for controlling essential services like carcinogens , water , laundry .
Switzerland is famous for the cultivation of fingers .
This is the main center of making wine - grapes .
37  of total cantonment is produced by grapes on the ground .
The garden of grapes in the village located on both the sides of the Ron Valley gives a marvellous look to the beauty there .
Taking in the gardens of grapes , roaming around , resting in the village there at night and making the grapes of grapes wine is an integral part of the tourism business here .
There is a large museum of grapes in a palanquin made in 12th century in a small town named earlier , to see which foreign tourists keep on booking prematurely .
Once again we are going through the deserted jungle .
The road till three and a half kms was getting worse on the question of children .
Only then does the dramatic and charming change come in a turn .
Right in front , on the left side of the road on the upper slope of the deep valley there are many houses .
People are skiing on the top of the village .
On the skiing slope till the head of the mountain the dense forest of deodar tree is spread .
There are dense snow all around .
The roofs of the house of the settlement are shining in the rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reached the village .
This silence is spread here also .
White snow empire from mountain ranges to valleys all around .
In the next five minutes we reached a big cycle in the middle of that cycle .
The name of Kasba is leukorabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Luckerabad is approximately 1500 .
1700 apartments and shawls with a capacity of 6900 beds , 28 hotels for staying in 1500 , camping site for tents , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants here we can estimate the number of tourists , sportspersons and climbers coming here .
Till now a total of 65 units of hot water have been found in Leukorabad .
Out of these 40 lakh litres -LRB- 150 feet -RRB- of hot water can be reached in the small and big 30 thermal bridges built at places in the whole week , some pockets of people of five star hotels and other income groups are also available .
It feels hot on reaching the village .
The thick level of snow is sparkling on the roofs of the house in the bright sun .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village , Switzerland ' is one of the main conserved places in the form of a national heritage .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to Sikkim 's taxi therefore there is no checking .
The journey is on , the region is different , but the mountains are the same , the trees are also the same , the air is also the same .
The moisture of the whole body is also one .
During rainy season brightness is also one .
Before the completion of the plan of Darjeeling journey the decision of taking a joke of Karsingh is taken .
Carsing is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens is full of dhoti jungles .
Excellent tea is famous for production .
Moving towards Darjeeling from Siliguri first tea garden welcomes you in a smile .
In the middle of the tea garden the heart was enchanted by going for the first time through the road .
On one side the green mountains full of jungles and on the other side deep greenery .
Sometimes the jungle here and sometimes tea gardens are seen .
The empire of greenery all around .
Once upon a time I had gone to Mushkal - see these natural jungles and this tea planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The beauty of the forest was as beautiful as the garden of tea .
It feels strange to look on the way .
Like snake rice , tails and ventilators were going on the way .
Time was also passing .
What was not cut is forest and tea garden .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance several hilly houses and houses etc . were seen .
It was Carsiang .
Standing at one place here we make the program of roaming all day .
So we left for a car with a car .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles all around .
It was in front that to reach till Deer Park the vehicle had to be left very low .
Despite being filled with the beauty of Karsing one has not yet been able to develop or become famous as a tourist spot .
Though Christianity is very clean .
Despite the desolate roads reaching till the Deer Park surrounded by the jungles the joy of walking in the middle of the iron and dhoti trees was gathering our courage .
The next place was Eagle Craig .
There is a point situated at a height on the other side of this city .
This is called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to commit suicide by jumping from here .
Nowadays it is connected with a park and restaurant .
There is a gumbaj here on the top of which a beautiful sight can be seen from all over the city .
Nearby in tea gardens women are capable of taking tea leaves by walking very fast with a toker on the back .
There is an exhibition outside the city of Karsing , but that day we could not go there because the climate of the tea garden was very important .
Next day it was decided to roam Darjeeling .
This place was very thrilling but it was very worried that how would we roam on such a rain .
But the connection was very good that on reaching till Rock Garden we could get the benefit of sun .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
If you go a little below from here then you will find Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst the rocks the rhythmic view of the waterfall is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we found that the waterfalls here in the empire of stone are engraved while the magnificence of waterfalls in Gangamaya is engraved on the stones of the world .
Both of these places are located very low amidst the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw air loops in Darjeeling climbing up by car .
From here through telescope the whole mountain and city of Darjeeling is seen .
The pleasure of the weather was good till now .
But who knows what we are moving towards monastery , from where the clouds came and started shining .
Walking and shopping in Malrod in the afternoon is planned .
During the journey of Darjeeling the tour of Toy Train makes it even more attractive .
Toy train journey from Darjeeling to Sleep and from Darjeeling to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
There is a very little break in boating and gardens in the Mirik lake .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazaar on this route , where sweaters etc . made in the hands of Nepali artisans are available .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is like a city of Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here but there is a sound of jungles and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots in Kalimpong are - Lofa and Lolehagaon , which are full of jungle waterfalls .
But due to lack of time I could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata for roaming Darjeeling in the winter but here the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling bind me on their own .
A journey of my recent times was very thrilling and charming .
This journey was not of foreign countries nor was it of Rajasthan very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is a thrilling thing in which sometimes the journey attracts us , then sometimes a special place , a ship of water or some royal train or some city like Pink City or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Due to some special attraction people get attracted .
The place where I am going to tell is made about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation this place has been made , it is really like enjoying the forest .
Only those who go there not only for them but also for those who live there .
In my ears still my guide Ram Babu believed that before Saheba we could not even think that I could live like this in my jungle .
Fifty percent of staff are in this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not get work in heritage hotels .
The residents of Azbagh used to work in Jaipur before Ram Babu and now this royal garden is such a garden .
He has made a new dimension on his own .
Sahiva is the pride of such a garden .
There nobody engages you in English .
Such bugyals are actually a peaceful and comfortable place .
This garden also has a history of its own and the biggest thing is that it is also known with the surrounding places .
Those who spend their holidays in the royal way of Rajasthan , how many of them have traveled through Bhungarh . There is no need to go away , even among the residents of Jaipur , very few people have spent the night in this area .
After opening such a garden many big people of the country and abroad have come here .
I remember that night when Shabana invited me there today but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Bhangarh by mistake .
This time suddenly I reached there to invite my foreign guests , it feels as if those who want to spend a good holiday in less time they should go to such a garden .
This garden is one of the seven gardens where the king of Albert used to rest for hunting .
It was constructed in Unish or Tudi .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
Surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees the first glimpse of such garden will hypnotise you .
The way you will be welcomed inside you will feel that attention is paid to divine peace here .
Manglachar 's mantra is called the ' Sajjiva ' by hand tied with mulethi .
We had reached in the afternoon and decided that we would put a circular fashion of the bugyal .
My majesty sister Jackie said with a sense of pride ' this is very charming .
Everyone is inspired by Habley and Mahal .
Beautiful is the light here .
It is not surprising that such a garden has been awarded in recent times .
The administrator fixed our program for morning .
At first Ram walked on foot with Babu and then roamed around in Vangarh jeep .
Walking on the way to Kankar we saw the fort of Ajbar on which the light of the sun was spread gradually .
We saw the Sukhi lake in which the farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rain but for the first time it was seen to be the cultivation of tobacco .
The opportunity to see rural life for jacket was very enjoyable .
After this we went to Vangarh by jeep .
In the morning we saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
It's a million dollars time.
While leaving such a garden they told us goodbye by eating jaggery and curd in traditional shape .
Now we got to know why tourists come here spending so much of money .
I have heard that tour packages are prepared to watch the lives of the tribals .
Is it right
Definitely this is not the only one in many states and tourists show special excitement in this tour .
This tour is usually made for four days to two weeks and at this time tourists are taken to different places .
Among these staying there , eating etc . are also included .
This way an attempt is made to travel such a place where there is not much development and the lifestyle of nature and humans has not had any special effect on time .
Along with this old tourist sites etc are also there .
Besides this attention is also paid on the consumption of sanitary food .
Actually , the aim of such tourism is to bring the tourists face to face with the tradition of living and eating at all these places .
Although it feels a bit difficult to think but such tours are really thrilling and a different kind of experience .
There is a different kind of fun to travel by bus .
Despite this you can enjoy yourself staying alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can read books without interruption for a long time .
Yes , it is true that along with spending a lot of time in less expense and peace this journey demands you all .
For enjoying this journey it is important to remember some things especially when you see some foreign place roaming around in a bus .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , elders of militia , children etc . get rid of this journey and there is also arrangement for leave for both .
However , buying tickets from before is a bit cheaper , therefore in the end it is better to do the bus journey beforehand .
Instead of taking tickets on both the sides take information about round trips .
It falls cheap .
The rules related to goods are done specially so inquire about the weight and weight of the goods .
It does not happen that you have to leave your things on the terminal or have to pay extra rent .
Along with this you should also know the rules of insurance or compensation from tourism company .
Carry on bags are appropriate for this journey .
Because it gets stuck on the top of the seat .
Keep in mind that while changing the buses during tour the responsibility of goods is yours .
From where you get up in the bus reach there one hour before the scheduled time .
In busy season you should keep in mind this thing specially .
Actually , as soon as you reach a better place to sit .
Keep in mind the comfort while roaming around the place of sitting .
There is more stiffness in the back , and one can not get better in the front .
If you go to the bathroom again and again then take a place towards the corner and if you do not like to get very tired then it will be better if you take a seat towards the window .
Now it's a clever thing.
If you are both trying to walk then first put your bag on the seat near the corner by sitting on the seat .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then this plan will be successful .
If there is facility of bathroom in the bus then keep in mind this point while sitting at the place because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Talk to the bus driver or conductor .
By this you will be able to find out many important information .
Everyone is asked to go out while cleaning the bus .
At this time you will not leave your place in your luggage because if it is lost the residents will not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops come back in the right time .
If you do not come in time then you can take some new passenger place and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .

By doing this mind gets full .

If he is both adults then he is free of cost to children of young age .
What else do I want .
The fare of cruise is inherent in tea - snacks , food .
Always with entertainment .
You can enjoy the entertainment , speed according to your pocket on reaching the capital . From sea plane ride to underwater launch .
If you suddenly get a sea plane standing in front of you to roam around the big aeroplane then you will find that toy .
But this Twin Ooty plane with a place of 12 - 15 sitting is excellent in the form of cruelty for roaming around the islands like Maldives .
One can not even know when suddenly he gets up in the air running like a speed boat on the water .
On the whole of the flight you will feel a stroll on the ordinary plane .
You will always be under your sight - in the water of different kinds of blue colors of Maldives see Resort island and Pearl island .
How clean is everything .
There are two plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of them which has 20 C planes .
If you want then you can travel by plane in about four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- in an hour or you can hire the entire sea plane for a day 's journey -LRB- if there is a need of a taxi for it -RRB- .
If you go to any other island from the island of Malaysia then the journey of sea plane will be necessary because this is the only way to travel through different islands .
And that is such a journey which you will never want to end .
The journey till 183 kilometres -LRB- Uttam Mavilevaru -RRB- from 12 kilometres to Suru is done on the island of Maldives .
We were in the shops of the biggest antique and sub-division of the capital in the Mughal market .
The speech given by the President of Maldives to the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before was heard very carefully .
As a matter of fact I did not see the speech of President or Prime Minister in any Hindustani so much .
But when there is a question of a new existence on this earth then it is necessary to be so serious .
Many people go to Maldives even after meeting the water boarded by Maldives ' cabinet on October and feel as if they take it away from us then how much will the world be .
There is a special thing in its beauty .
Such beauty is not felt in this small country .
While going towards Jetty to return back to that cruise of the market when the sight was going towards the sea water running on the way then we realized how much the people here understood the value of this beauty .
Water is so clear that in the light of Lamppost colorful fish can be seen in a few metres deep .
This is that part of the sea which was completely connected with the city .
You will be fortunate if you get to see some churches clearly in the water of sea or river connected with any city of India .
The evening spent in Malaysia for coming on Ambi aquamine has stopped for two hours .
Koral Rif -LRB- Munga Chattan -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will get success in crampons .
Shortly before the address of President Nashik we were standing outside his official residence .
It is not believed that we were in front of the highest personality of any country , till far no security personnel could be seen .
We were enjoying the photograph of the garden 50 metres away just by increasing the hand inside the door of his bungalow .
Can you think about the house of a leader in India like this
It was also known that the President had gone to his office two blocks before crossing the road while walking on foot .
Everything impresses us about Maldives .
That is why we were waiting for Brussels the next day .
It seemed as if this day would be special .
In the morning taking a boat from the cruise our airport was taken to Island .
From there we reached the base of Trans Maldives by cutting the cycle of the runway .
The next day in the afternoon when the cruise was reaching near the mall then we were able to recognize the plane going up .
I saw a lot of pictures .
But then did I know that the next day there would be a chance to fly on this plane .
We were going to Rangoli island five kilometres away on the sea plane of Trans Maldives .
It is unforgettable to see thousands of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives by flying on this plane at a height of approximately thousand metres .
This comfort of water can not be seen anywhere else .
In thrill and excitement there was a flight of breathing stoppage .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of the Hilton Hotel on Rangoli island it feels as if we have come to some other world .
In such a world which has no relation with the outside world .
There was no such relation that it was difficult to get the beauty and adventure found here out .
Can be toured on foot in Korade or in battery-driven cars .
From Jetty to the main island that on both sides of the bridge the view of water life was amazing .
Till now we could not get connected with the nature around , we reached such a place which was unimaginable .
We reached such a glass house descending into the sea water several metres below the stairs which was under the water .
This house was actually a meal house .
On the other side of the glass small and big fishes , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving people were seen .
The imagination of eating while sitting on the decorated floor there is a lot of thrill .
The fare of seeing it and lunching underwater on this island on a plane from Malaysia is 47 thousand rupees per person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to drive our passports in water .
But I knew it was not possible .
With a sad heart I came back with this hope that sometimes , sometimes , sometimes luck will definitely come here .
I was planning to get out of Delhi for a long time but it was not possible for the busyness of work .
In childhood there was a lot of wildlife hence I thought lets go to Jim Corbett this time .
Before Khardungla pass in Ladakh in 2006 this was the second bike journey after biking till Penang Lake .
On 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but the excitement that we got out of this fog had reduced our speed .
The road between Hapur and Gajrola was very tiring .
On that again the path of misery and misery .
Many times it was felt that it would fall .
Somehow we reached Gajrola at 8 in the morning .
As we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park was 20 kilometres before Ramnagar .
Near our resort park was in Tikuli , whose booking we had already done .
That day there were no special programs , despite being cold we went to roam around on the banks of Kosi .
After staying there for two - three hours we left for the Corbett Museum which was near the Ghanghri gate two kilometres away .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It was late to return .
From Delhi I came out firmly that I would definitely see the tigers roaming in the jungle but I saw the tiger all night in dreams .
Suddenly I heard loud noise in the depth of the night and then whatever dog starts to chew it keeps on running for two hours .
Initially Kaladungi and Corbett came to the advice of roaming fruits .
Kaladungi is at a distance of 30 kilometres , Corbett falls on the way .
There is an exhibition of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi where some special things related to his life are kept .
On returning it was twelve o'clock .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett used to live in this village itself .
After reaching Resort Safari Jeepsy was waiting for us .
It is said that they had made arrangements for switching in the number one site .
It is said about number one that the grass there is more and the tigers come here only to escape from cold at this time .
On reaching Bijarani we were given a guide that for roaming around for four hours one and a half rupees would be taken .
We were left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two teeth elephants which had long teeth .
I took photographs on the ground .
In the midst of this the guide started tracking the tiger .
The guide said that there are approximately 150 tigers in the park among which many have died within a few days .
In many places we got to see the footprints of the tiger , but the heart was restless on not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we were returning to Delhi .
A lion 's ghost was stuck in my head .
Only then do I remember an old friend of Haldwani .
I called him like that.
I told him I came to Corbett.
He asked if I had seen the tiger .
Her talk was tied like a shore .
I said slowly that I didn't see.
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
One of us said that taking safari for roaming inside .
