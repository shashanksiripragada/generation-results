This garden is protected in those seven gardens and is a separate garden where Alwar king had gone for hunting .
Its construction was done in the 19th - 20th century .

Tourists can now know why they are spending so much here .
I was told that a tourist group was formed to see the life of the tribals .
Is it right .
Certainly this is seen in some states of unparalleled states and tourism shows special interest in them .
For this tourism arrangements are made for four days to two weeks and at this time tourists are taken to different places .
How to stay there .
This way an attempt is made to do such explanations where there is no excessive development and there is no special precaution in the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time old tourist spots are also there .
Besides this , attention is also given on drying up of dry ginger .
In reality the lifestyle and lifestyle of that place is seen directly to the tourists who like such tourism .

To celebrate this it is important to keep in mind some things at the moment when you will be able to see some foreign destination bus through tourism .
Before taking the ticket injection in the best dial .
For people with studio , militia , children etc . tickets are available here which are available for both people as well .
Like this it is better to take the pre-delivery journey therefore if the arrangement of tourism in the last train is good then make arrangements beforehand .
Instead of traveling give information about round trips .
The cost of morning is less .
It is very important to take things , therefore keep in mind the matter of obesity and weight .
You leave some of your products with tarmac or you fill up electronic substances .
Immediately take the enjoyment of insurance or loss from the tourist group .
Take care of calorie on fax .
Because it can be applied in a rock above the seat .
Keep in mind that while changing the goods from bus to bus the responsibility of tourism is on its own .
Wherever you have a bus go by one hour before that time .
During busy season you should keep this thing in a special time .
Actually the sooner you go the better seat system is near you .
While choosing the seat keep in mind the convenience .
Take the back seat too much but it is not possible to study in the front chambers .
If you are often urinating then take a distant seat so that you do not want to face much trouble , then the sitting near the door will be better for you .
Now there is a tactical thing .
But if you are both sitting in the seat of the seat then first sitting in the corner seat keep your posture on the other side .
Therefore if there is not much crowd in the bus then your arrangement will be successful .
Therefore if you have the facility of vasectomy then keep in mind this thing while selecting the seat because it is difficult to sit there after some time .
Introduce bus driver and container .
In this way you will get enough information .
While cleaning the womb everyone is told to come out .
During this time do not keep you on a pillow because if it is lost then the people suffering from dysentery will not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stands go back to time .
But if you do n't go for time then you can see a new journey at your place and you have to wait for another bus .

If you want then you can roam around 4000 rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- in the air for hours or the entire plane is given a fare for you to travel all day long .
But if you go to the island of Maldives via Almora then it is necessary to travel in sea plane because it is common to travel between different islands .
And if this is a journey then do not travel in it if there is fear of danger from it .
The journey from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres is done in the islands of Maldives .
We had stayed in the most ancient and chauvinist shops of the capital of the contemporary market of Maldives .
All the selectrons are asking the lectures given by the king of Maldives , Mohammad Nath Tagore , one day before , in the Hall of Kaven , in the form of a world peace loving voice .
I am convinced that even a Hindustani has not heard so carefully about the words of Rashtrapati or Prime Minister .
But when there is a challenge in the condition of this earth 's ultimate creation then such fear is important .
Some people know Maldives well by going inside the water through the cabinet of Maldives because the wrath of nature is so impoverished as the world is .
In the beauty there some special kind of beauty is present .
There is no such beautiful temple in that small country .
After roaming around in the market they returned towards the jetty to go to their guruj , then compulsory sightseeing on the road because the people here enjoy this beautiful surprising border .
Beneath the light of Lamp Bond some metres deep swimming fish have been sightseeing with all its colors .
This was a part of the sea which was connected with the city .
If you are able to see some centimetres of the river or sea water connected with any city of India then you can enjoy yourself .
On returning to M . . Aquarius in Maldives roaming around in Jagannath for two hours in the evening .
Corbett National Park is spread in an area of 87 square kilometres in the east of the Himalayas .
Till now you will find stones and herbs told on the pink dogs .
In order to listen to the rhetoric of President Nasik we were standing outside after some government cave .
We were at the forefront of the greatest office of a country , but there was no security till far because we could not believe it .
It 's a pleasure that we were taking photographs on the garden and footpath at a distance of about 50 metres away after extending our hands inside his horrible gate .
Can you think this way by bringing some ordinary leader to your house in India .
It is said that the president had come to his office two blocks before crossing the road after walking on foot .
In the matter of Maldives every thing has been defeated .
Therefore the next day I had an expectation of patience .
For good luck that day was important .
In the morning a boat from Guruji entered us till Erfort Jalandhar .
From there we reached the place of Trans Maldives after roaming around in Ranvel .
Later in the evening when Guruji used to come out from Maldives then we immediately recognized the blanket moving above .
We were watching all his maps .
But then there was no doubt because the next day there was a chance of paying attention to it .
We had to go to Rangali Island at a distance of 500 kilometres from the sea plane of Trans Mall .
Kanbharata can not be forgotten by the hundreds of rice and coral islands spread in the coast of Maldives from Clane flying around 1000 metres .
This beautiful water is not available anywhere .
This is a thrilling and encouraging journey .
But as soon as Hilton Hotel Sink Resort goes to Rangai Island it feels as if we have come to a different world .
In such a world outside there was no connection with any other world .
It was difficult to get out of the beauty or hustle-bustle life .
Walking can be done in Konark or by a battery train .
While going to the main island from Jetti on both the sides of the bridge there was a marvellous glimpse of life-saving .
Now with the natural beauty present in our vicinity we were unable to imagine ourselves .
We reached a glass room while descending in the water several metres below the stairs which was in water .
That half was actually a meal room .
All around through glasses we could see marvellous types of small and big fishes , corals , snowclading and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating and drinking in the decorated tables keeps oneself thrilled .
The fare of seeing this island on the sea plane coming from Male and drinking food under water is 47 thousand rupees for a ruler .
One does not feel like returning from there .
We were ready to float our passport in water .
We know that this is not possible .
We returned with the same belief in mind , sometimes in a turn the luck would certainly have brought us back .
For a long time we were planning to go to Delhi for a long time but this was not possible due to being employed .
Because of being interested in wild animals we thought that Jim Corbett should not go to this place .
In 2006 after trekking from Karthukala near Laddakh and at a little distance from Yekong lake this was another picnic .
In the morning of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but the speed with which we got out we had reduced our speed .
The journey of Kaziranga from Haboot is really thrilling .
There is an extremely difficult road in the direction of snow from the top .
Several times it appears as if we are falling .
One way we reached Karjrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is at a distance of 20 kilometres from Ramnagar .
Near our resort park we were in Digu , which we had already registered before .
After getting cold we went to roam around on the banks of Kosi after getting cold .
After two - three hours we left for Corbett Museum , which was very difficult at a distance of 2 kilometres .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar the day below .
It was a long time to return .
After getting out of Delhi we decided that if we see the tiger reserved in the jungle then we will find a tiger in the whole night .
In the midst of a deep night suddenly I heard a loud sound , after that the dogs did not stand for two hours after shouting .
Therefore first Kaladungi and Corbett are on the way .
In Kaladungi there was a museum of Jim Corbett National Park , where some items related to personal life were kept .
Jim Corbett Museum in Kaladungi .
The work of returning was half past three .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett used to come to this village .
On reaching the hotel Safari Jeepsy was waiting for our arrival .
He told us that the arrangement of touring in the first seat pizzarani is done there .
On the one hand while examining the belief the tigers used to come to the other side to protect themselves from the cold .
After reaching Bijarali we were given a guide , for a walk of four hours we took a hundred and fifty rupees .
We went inside the jungle .
Several types of animals and birds of Mongol are seen there .
Inside we saw two twin elephants , which had long teeth .
I stabilized and took the film.
In the meantime the guide started trekking the fist .
There are about 150 tigers in the park among which some tigers have died in one year .
At many places we saw their footsteps , but I was sorry that I could not see the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind there was no dearth of seeing the tiger .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I contacted him on the phone.
I told him I had come to Corbett .
He asked if he had seen the tiger .
His words ran like arrows .
I wasn't slow.
There is no permission to take bicycles in the park .
One has to say that take a chopper to go inside .
