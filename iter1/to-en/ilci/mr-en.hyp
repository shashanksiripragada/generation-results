Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch there is a mixture of both Sind and on the other side in the language as Gujarat .
This is called kachhi .
As such this is a dialect , it is not his own script .
If Kutch is to be written then it has to be written in Gujarati script .
Anjar near Bhuj is a city where many times hungry and the whole city has emerged .
The tomb of Jaisalmer is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisalmer is very interesting .

The small rail from Bhuj to Meterage will reach Rajkot .
One more small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and a big train from Ahmedabad to Broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through bad situation these days .
Due to the threat of global slowdown and rising terror of South Asia the tourism business has become a serious blow .
Special reduction has been registered in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan counted among the major states of the country from the point of view of tourism .
According to the figures recorded by the Rajasthan government in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has been more than ten percent as compared to the year 2008 .
According to statistics the number of tourists in the country has decreased by 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists has decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 26 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which 2 crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas in 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 96 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 619 natives and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Rajput Holiday Mekers ' director Sanjay Kaushik has said that due to global slowness and terrorist incidents bad effects have been done on tourism business .
Compared to other countries of Asia we could not even develop the strong base of tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has decreased by 3 . 29 percent in the previous period .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the viewpoint of tourism the last few years have been good for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 when there has been a decrease in the number of tourists in Rajasthan .
There is nothing new in view of tourism .
Desert -LRB- desert -RRB- , Hawaii , Kumaun , Bawada forest all these are old to see the tourists .
In the area of tourism , rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism , all the governments do big things but nothing is done in this regard .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
Besides this this state has been marked internationally by these incidents of bravery and dispersal of foreign women tourists .
The Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in this state for a long time but it remained limited to papers only .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government regarding tourism is the Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
The Rajasthan government had established RTDC in 1979 with the aim of increasing tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic form of tourism .
This institute provides facilities like accommodation , food , lodging , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 departments of this institute .
In which 29 hotels , 22 motorcycles , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one connectivity and two train palaces on wheels and royal Rajasthan on wheels but for some years the situation of this institute has also worsened .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh which is likely to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The situation of the hotels of this fort is that in the last five years even 70 percent of its hotels have not filled the rooms .
Along with hotels other factors of the organization are also harming it .
The main among these is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists can not get attracted towards this train .
Even after reducing the fare it was not able to attract tourists .
In the same way in the present year tourists have been surprised about the Mughal fair .
In this fair in 2007 - 08 the tourist village constructed by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists had stopped , this year there has been a waistwatch and that is 217 .
One thing satisfying by this very RTDC was that there was no dearth in the attraction of tourists for Palace on Wheels i . . Royal Falls .
This train is beneficial .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees from this train .
It is natural to have an atmosphere of thought in this delicate tourist area coming in the area of tourism in Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the mind of man then he can take gold from the soil .

In the middle of the snow laden mountain ranges of the left hand the light emerging from the sky on the horizon falls on the redness .
There is a good coolness in the air .
Along with the cool breeze touching the atmosphere there is also a feeling of wetness .
The layer of leaves lying on the wooden board with the sound of garbage below the foundation is visible on the layer .
There is silence in the atmosphere and nothing was visible before sunrise because of the spread of sunset .
The vision remains soaked on the redness of the east .
The heart was resting on the benchmarks falling in Balkani .
As soon as the handles the layer of ice gets stuck with a slight sound and the feeling of cold starts slipping in moments .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience in the life of spending the night in this small village settled amidst the snow laden mountains of Switzerland .
This is my third journey in Swiss .
Before this a lot of time was spent in Geneba or around it .

This is the main river Rhone of Switzerland on both the sides of which several small towns are settled .
The parallel highway of the Ron river and the vehicles running on it are clearly visible .

Geneva city is settled on the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake again becomes a river and becomes western .
On the right side near the lake are Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps mountain ranges .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Leuk on the left side we came to the northern hilly road leaving this highway .
Because of the slope of the mountain being south - west the sun of the evening is giving a lot of fervor to all the birds .
The quantity of snow above the valley is less here .
As the height moves forward , the density of snow has started increasing .
On both the sides of the road despite a good ice accumulation there is no special cold in the air due to the clean sky and shining sun .
On the juice of this circular mountain we reached a small village named Thel by deciding about 20 km journey in half an hour .

In a small town named Aigle there is a very big museum of jewellery built in a small fort built in the 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to register a program .
Once again we went to the same jungle covered with Dawanal .
The mind becomes even more distressed by the questions of children falling on the road for three - four kms .
Suddenly dramatic and charming changes take place from a sight on a slope .
Right in front , on the left side of the road on the upper slope of the deep valley a beautiful cave of houses is located .
People are skiing in snow on the flat surfaces situated in the upper part of the village .
The dense forest of cedar is spread till the peaks of the mountain above the skiing slope .
Snow has fallen all around .
The roofs of the houses of Bastar are shining because of the fall of the sun directly .
We reach that village in five minutes .
Here also this calmness is spread .
All around from the peak of the mountain till the valley is the empire of Dhawal Himalaya .
Within the next five minutes you reach a big round chakra in the middle of that chamber .
The name of Kasba is Leukerbad .

It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to Sikkim 's taxi because of which checking does not happen .
Travelling is going on , the state may be the second , but the mountain is that only , the trees are the same , the comfortable air is the same .
It is the hail that slides on all the body .
In the season of monsoon there is a fit of fitness .
As soon as the plan for Darjeeling journey was complete it was decided to take a glimpse of Kurseong first .
Karsyang Darjeeling is a small city .
The tea garden is full of smoke .
Famous for the production of best tea .
If we move ahead from Siliguri towards Darjeeling then the tea gardens spread in the beginning welcome the people coming to us by laughing .
Going from the road going through the tea gardens hypnotise the mind for the first time .
Green mountains covered with forests on one side , and on the other side deep green valleys .
Here sometimes the jungle and sometimes tea gardens were visible .
All around there was a greenery empire .
Once upon a time I saw these natural jungles hungry to see the tea plants planted by humans .
Both were attracting towards themselves .
The more beautiful wilderness the tea gardens spread on such a beautiful distance .
If the road falls on the way then the creation looks marvellous .
Like the snake snakes the slope and circular path was moving ahead .
Time was also appropriate .
If it was not finished then it was a forest and a garden of tea .
Sometimes small settlements were visible .
From a distance a mountain house has been seen very dense .
This happens to be karsiyang .
Staying here at one place we made a program to spend the whole day .
By this take a car and come out on the picnic of Kurseong .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles all around .
To reach up to the deer park the vehicle has to be left very low .
Even though Karsyang is full of beauty it is not possible to develop and develop in the form of tourism .
When the city is very good and clean .
The joy of reaching till Deer Park surrounded by jungles despite the road being desolate was giving us the joy of climbing the road through greed and smokey trees .
The next place was Eagle Craig .
On the other side of this city is a photograph situated at a height .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to give life by jumping from here .
At present there is a garden and a hotel here .
There is a zinc like pillar here from whose height a beautiful view of the whole city is prepared .
In the tea gardens nearby by putting a cap on the back of the woman the tablets of tea were studded in breaking the hands at a very fast pace .
There is a museum outside the city of Karsyang but on that day we could not go there because it seemed very necessary to roam around in the free environment of tea estates .
The next day it is certain to roam Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself but it was a greater concern than this that if such a rain continued then how would we roam
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching till Rupkund we enjoyed the bright sunny sunshine .
This park is a very attractive place with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The road reaching here is even more beautiful than this .
Going a little below from here one gets Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
The beauty of the waterfalls here is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we found that waterfalls are very beautiful in the art gallery of rocks and stones while the views of waterfalls in Ganga Maa are decorated with marble stones .
Both of these places are very low between the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw Batasia loop in Darjeeling rising up with the help of a car .
From here on the basis of telescope the whole mountain and city of Darjeeling can be seen .
The waves of the weather were clean till now .
But as we moved towards the monastery , we did n't know where and we started spooning .
In the evening plans were made for roaming and shopping on the mall road .
During the journey of Darjeeling toys enhance joy in the journey of fire .
Toy train from Darjeeling to Ghum and from Dhoom to Darjeeling is special attraction for the tourists .
Here in the Mirik lakes boating and luxury break in the park .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar by this route , where sweets sold by Nepali artisans are available .
There is arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its shape - color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here but there is abundance of jungles and waterfalls .
Kalimpong is the most popular tourist spot - Auli and Lolegaon , which is surrounded by jungle waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to Darjeeling in the shadow of coolness but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling kept me tied with us .
A small journey of my present was very attractive and thrilling .
This journey was neither of foreign nor of Rajasthan but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an attractive subject in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes a special place , boat ship or some royal train or some city like Gulmarg or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Due to some special attraction people start getting attracted .
The place where I am talking about is ready only four and a half years ago , but with the preparation this place has come there , that is really the welfare of the jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
My guide in my ears rotates the words of Ram Babu Meena . Before this we could not even think that we could stay in the jungle .
50 percent staff is in this area .
Suddenly I felt such local people did n't even get work in heritage hotels .
Ajabagarh resident Ram Babu used to work in Jaipur earlier and now this unique royal style is in Aman Bagh .
He brought his speech in a new color .
Sahiba ' is the guide of Aman Bagh .
There nobody speaks to you in English address .
Aman Bagh is actually a picnic spot with peace and all happiness .
That garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces itself to the surrounding region .
Many of the people spending holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan might have traveled to Bhangarh for landslides .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I also remember that night when Shabana Azmi had spoken to me there heartily but I could not go .
It is a different matter that he himself had reached Bhangarh after quitting .
On this occasion when I reached there suddenly for my foreign tour then it seemed as if people want to spend an excellent holiday in a short time then they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden emanating from those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in twenty one year .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of peace garden in the shadow of dense trees and surrounded by mountains attracts you .
Just as you come inside , the way you are welcomed , it feels that divine peace has been paid attention here .
The life of mantra of Mangalacharya is pronounced in Mangata along with price building .
We had reached after evening and we decided to kill one round that garden .
My lord Jackie who is a decorative , said easily . This is attractive .
All the havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . It is not surprising that Aman Bagh has also received the present prize .
The administrator decided our program for the morning .
First of all roamed on foot with Ram Babu and then jeep journey of Bhangadh .
While walking on the unfathomable road we saw the fort of Ajabagarh on which the rays of the sun were spreading slowly .
The dry lake was seen in which the farmers used to cultivate .
This year there was no rain but for the first time the field of tobacco was seen .
Such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience for Jackie .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
At dawn I saw a tourist of Halland keeping in mind .
These are unparalleled moments of millions of dollars .
They gave us nutrition by giving us traditional jaggery and curd .
Now it has been noticed that tourists come here with so much expenditure .
I have heard that for seeing the life of the tribe the daily tourist packages are kept .
Is it right
Undoubtedly and not only this happens in many states and tourists also show special interest in it .
This tour is usually prepared for a period of four days to two weeks and during this tourists go to different places .
In this stay , food etc are also included .
Thus an attempt was made to find such a place where there was not much development and where there was no special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
On that occasion where old tourist spots etc . are also present .
Besides this , attention is also given on doing all the tridial cuisine .
In reality , this tourism had to make the tourists aware of the way and tradition of living in that place .
Actually this idea seems a bit tough , but such tourism is really attractive and gives a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
By this you can take the pleasure of walking alone even after staying with many people .
Not only this , in this journey you can give more time to stop your favorite book .
Yes , it is sure that along with spending a lot of time in less expense and continuation these tours definitely keep the expectations of patience from you .
This is the reason that it is important to keep in mind some things for enjoyment , especially when you are watching some foreign destination with the help of bus tourism .
Find the best deal before taking a ticket .
Students , militia senior people , boys and girls get suits on them , then there is arrangement of giving suits for both the people as well .
However , it is cheap to buy fire tickets , therefore do a little quicker than doing a bus tour in the last moment .
Instead of towing get information about round trips .
These are cheap .
Rules regarding bags are specially difficult , therefore consider the shape and weight of the luggage .
Never do this that you will have to leave some of your things on the terminal or you will have to pay more money later .
Along with this you should also know the rules of compensation from tourism company .
Carry on bags are good , take them .
Because they sit right in the rock on this seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of luggage is yourself .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During weather you should pay special attention to these things .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the better option of seat will be with you .
Keep in mind whether it is comfortable while choosing seat .
If you sit too much on the back seat , then you will not be able to save yourself from the next seat .
If you have to go to the toilet continuously , then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like much obstruction then the seat of the window remains good for you .
Now there is talk of one chatti .
If you are thinking of shitting both then first sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other seat .
If there is no crowd in the bus then the plan will be successful .
If there is facility of washerum in the bus then keep in mind this thing while selecting the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there after a while .
Identify the bus driver and conductor .
So you will get very important information from them .
Everyone is asked to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat , because they do not take responsibility for it on being defeated .
Wherever the bus stops , return on time .
If you do not come in time then your place will be available to the other person and you will have to wait for the bus .

After that even if you stay in Male you can get hotels in a little while but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the charming beauty of Maldives then it will be very small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial .
In the first week of December Louis cruise started a single cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very famous in cruise and hotel business .
Actually due to some difficulties the Louis cruise has postponed its service now , but there is a possibility of its resumption from October .
On the Louis cruise ship MV exchange you can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at least Rs . 5850 per person every night .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are big then complete freedom for children less than 15 years of age .
What should be needed more .
Tea - breakfast , food are included in the cruise cruise cruise .
With entertainment of every time .
On reaching the capital Malle you can enjoy the entertainment , activity available in the Maldives with the help of your pocket - From sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
Suddenly if a sea plane stands in front of you while sliding in the big airplanes then you will feel like playing .
But this television oter aircraft with 12 - 15 seats is unquestionable for roaming the islands of Maldives .
On the surface of water while running like a speed boat he never feels like flying in the air .
In the entire journey we can not experience the journey of common aircraft .
Keeping in mind the different shadowed blue water of the Maldives , waterfalls towards the islands and shining islands keep on roaming continuously below the window .
Everyone looks so clean .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of these companies where there are 20 planes .
If you want then you can travel by air for an hour in about 4 thousand rupees -LRB- ever -RRB- or you can take the entire plane by flight -LRB- only empty -RRB- .
If we go to a separate island from Male island then the journey of sea plane is necessary because this is the only way to travel on different islands .
And this is such a journey that you will not feel like ending .
The sea plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Northern Mavilawar -RRB- to Maldives island .
We were in the most ancient and sovereign shops of the capital in the Ahmedabad market of Malaysia .
All the sellers used to listen carefully to the address given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Rashid in the World Climate Conference of Copenhagen one day earlier .
If we talk arbitrarily then I have not seen any Indian listening to the speech of President or Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of a supernatural object on this planet then such a seriousness was adventurous .
Many people might have understood the meeting taking place inside the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October but on going to Maldives it feels as if it is driven by nature ' s hypocrisy then world will be disturbed .
There is something special in the beauty there .
There is not so much beauty in that small country .
After that journey of the market while returning to the cruise if your eyes go in the water of the sea then it is necessary that how much people here pay attention to the beauty .
Water was so clean that fish swimming underneath in the light of the lamppost can be seen with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you are able to see a few centimetres in the sea or river water near any city of India then you will consider yourself intoxicated .
While returning from M . . . accommodation two hours of the evening spent in Malaysia used to take range in mind .
Praval stone -LRB- moong stone -RRB- is the life here .
So much that we will also find rocks on the stones of the grave .
After listening to the speeches of President Nasreed we had stayed in his administrative residence for some time .
Actually it was not possible that we were standing at the residence of one of the highest personalities of the country and there was no security guard on far off places .
In fun we were taking photographs of only 50 metres long gardens and slopes holding our hands inside the doors of their bungalows .
Can you think about the house of a leader of India
It was also understood that the President sometimes walking on his own , by covering the road , he reached his office two houses ahead .
Everything in the context of Maldives was enhancing eagerness .
That is why I was waiting for the next day .
It seemed as if that day would be special .
In the morning a name from cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we roamed around the runway on the base of Trans Maldives .
When the cruise reached near Male last evening then we immediately got to know the plane going above .
Such photographs were seen , theirs .
But then there was no imagination that next day there would be a chance of roaming around .
We had to go to Rangali island a hundred and five kilometres long by the sea plane of Tros Maldives .
The sea plane flying at a height of approximately thousand metres was unforgettable to see hundreds of rocks and islands spread on the sea of Maldives .
Such beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
By thrilling and excitement breathing becomes such a flight .
But on reaching the Conrad Hotel of Hilton Hotel in Rangali island it feels as if we have reached a different world .
In such a world where there is nothing to do with any outside world .
There was no such relationship that it was not possible to get out the beauty and comfort there .
The journey of Konarad can also be done on foot or on a battery .
The view of water on both the sides of the bridge passing through the port to the main island is unique .
While we could not separate ourselves from the surrounding nature then we reached such a place that was incomplete .
While descending down in the water below the Sumudra several metres below the Shilas we went to such a glass room which used to be in water .
Our room was continuously a dining room .
We were able to see a unique kind of small fish , snacks , snacks and scuba diving Manas across the glacier .
There the imagination of eating sitting on tables was totally thrilling .
The cost of one person is Rs . 47 thousand to come and see this island by sea plane from Malaysia and to take lunch inside water .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to leave our passport in water .
But it was known that it was not possible .
Returning with this hope heavily will be able to bring back to this place at some time .
It was decided to go a long way from Delhi for several days but he was not satisfied with the busyness of work .
Wildlife liked from childhood and thought that Jim Corbett should not be visited at this time .
In 2006 this was the second bike journey after Baiking till Pegong pond near Khardungla in Ladakh .
On 27 o'clock in the afternoon we set out at Jim Corbett from Delhi but the excitement that we had emerged , our speed was blown up .
The journey from Hapur to Gajraula was really tiring .
Dussehra and bad road ahead .
Many times we felt that it has come .
How to reach Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was frozen near the park which we had registered earlier .
On that day without any special program we went to the shore of Kosi after getting cold .
After spending two - three hours there we went to see a very far 2 kilometres away Corbett Museum situated near Dhangadi Gate .
From there we went to Ramnagar below .
It took a long time to return .
While coming out of Delhi it was assumed that the lion wandering openly in the jungle would surely seem to be a lion in the dream of the whole night .
In the darkness of the night I suddenly heard a terrible duration and after that the dogs began to hung like this which did not stop for two hours .
Earlier Kaladhungi and Corbett waterfalls were set to be seen .
Kalatungi is thirty kilometres away while Corbett Fall is on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kalatungi where some important items related to his personal life are kept .
Till return twelve o'clock .
Kalatungi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett was settled in this village .
On reaching the resort the rail jeepsy was waiting for us .
It is said that they have arranged for siteing in a number of site buildings there .
Considering one point one has to say that honeymoon is more there and tigers come here only for protection from cold .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide which takes Rs . 250 for roaming around four hours .
We took refuge in the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
We saw two tusk elephants inside which had long teeth .
I did a lot of photography .
During this time the guide started trekking the tiger .
Guide said that there are approximately 150 tigers in the park out of which some have died .
At some places we also saw the smell of their claws but I was disappointed because of not seeing tigers .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
My head was filled with tigers .
Then I remembered a friend of Haldani .
I made him such a phone .
I told him that I have come in the carpet .
He did n't see the tiger he asked .
Make that word like arrow .
I spoke slowly , no .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone told us that you take a ride to go inside .
