The protest took place on behalf of the secular progressive coalition, which strongly condemned the violence of the Hindu Front over the 28 recession.
On August 5, more than 60 organisations of the Hindu Federation entered the recessional company on the Andrew Road.
This resulted in the beating of Anggir workers and damage to the company's duties.
The police have done some rumour about this.

The police said the police had to take quick action to arrest the Hindu frontline rocks involved in the incident.

After six months, it has become a habit.
Now I am very satisfied with my heart.'
'Many said it was difficult to carry a lot of vegetables, and I recommended them to take a bamboo bamboo to fight the plastic threat.
But they laughed at it.
Therefore, I and my wife carried a bamboo bamboo and went to the market.
I knew that it would be very helpful in many ways.
During these days, many young people are not healthy.
I think they should start walking and control their food.
I am deeply confident that India can provide best solutions to the challenges faced by the modernised world.

There are revolutionary movements even before Bhagat Singh.
But it is not just commendable that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given a new dimension and a clear idea of revolutionary movements and Indian politics.
Today, we can see that the revolutionaries are just slaughtered, and there is a conception among the people that is not concerned about human lives.
The period of Bhagsingh makes us feel their humanity, a clear thought and capability.
The name of Bhagat Singh became widespread in India after the April 1929 assembly bombings.
He made his debut in Tamilnadu in 1930.
But within a year of his debut, his fame has spread to every corner of Tamilnadu.
This has not spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short span of time, including the most surprising news in history, the name of any leader born in the north, including Gandhi.
That's because the father is Periyar.
An editorial was published in the Republican Week magazine after the assassination of Bhagat Singh.
The editorial praised the characteristics of Bhagat Singh and presented some comments on the political situation of the day.
Some of the leading sections: -
'If he decides that the models he has followed are the right way, and if he decides, we will surely have to follow him, and if he does not, we cannot say that he is a wise man.
So now we call him a real man.
It is our strong achievement that India really has to do with Bhagat Singh's policy.
If Shri Bhagat Singh is not executed and he is not executed, this victory would not have been the source of such popularity.
We will say that if we had not lifted Bhagat Singh, Gandhi would still have been empowered.
Why did the people of India leave their lives to show the path of real equality and sensitivity to the people of the world for the sake of Bhagwad Singh, who had to die and die by himself
We congratulate Bhagyasinh, Vayar and Handloom for saying that the common man cannot reach.'
In a Republican editorial, Father Periyar has said.

I don't know if he took another child to the police station.
His granddaughter Kirkland, who had agreed to release the identity of the girl Kaya Roll, told the media about this, 'My bet on the issue of sleep apnea' has been suffocated from time to time due to the consequences of medicines used for it.
I was very shocked to say that he was arrested for this, and that it was difficult for any 6-year-old child to understand and explain.

Without even knowing the details, can the Chief Minister, who is in charge of the public service, speak out of the truth of Pilanisamy
The water resources of the earth grew in that area due to the vaccination built in Mayanur.
That's why agriculture has grown.
Thousands of people from farming and coastal areas can be happy to express their gratitude to the government.
As per the requirement of that period, the law was enacted by the state government in Mayanur.
There was no need for further detention.
If necessary, Kalaignar ji, who was then the then Chief Minister, would have immediately given him permission, allocated funds and stepped up the work.
Therefore, there is nothing closer to criticizing the League government in maintaining the interests of Christianity.
How many restrictions have you erected in the past eight years of the ADMK regime
We have constructed more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the DMK regime.
Can you indicate that the dam built in the ADMK regimes that took place so far

In response to the allegations made by the opposition leader, assert with the evidence that in many places we are planning or planning to build a ban.

Is the BJP taking over the caste politics in Tamilnadu
In Tamilnadu, it is said that if one cannot keep the dharma rubbish anywhere, then the BJP is finally putting the caste politics in the hands of BJP.
For the first time, when Modi was the Prime Minister, he had to leave Thamarai in Tamil Nadu and see the drainage.
After this, the second time, that is, during the Embassy elections, he said, "You don't know what to do.
However, in the 5 contested constituencies, the soil was covered.
Even though the BJP is shining all over the country, there is a wave of protest in Tamilnadu.
Above all this, the issue of Muthalaq, Kashmir, Hindi imposition, the only country is one language.
All this has been added so far.
That's why the BJP leadership is in a hurry on the BJP executives in Tamilnadu, which is why there is a problem that cannot even appoint the state leadership.
Though this is on the one hand, the BJP is planning to root out the BJP in Tamilnadu within the forthcoming assembly elections.
For that, the BJP leadership has come to an end through the direct field report and the intelligence report.
Accordingly, whether it be extremist or DMK, the idea of not giving enough importance to the people of the Nadar community and the people of the Vanniversar community and the people of Deogendrakulam.

Moreover, in any case, this caste will conceal the BJP in politics.
At the same time, when Tamilnadu is already small in caste politics, it is not known whether the BJP's activity will be like adding more oil to the burning fire.
It is true that if the fire of the goddess is filthy then the skin of a slightly blossoming Thamarai in Tamilnadu will blossom on the same island
