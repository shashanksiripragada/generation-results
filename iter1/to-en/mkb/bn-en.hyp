Mann Ki Baat October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
All of you have been conveyed here by Deepawali.
Diplomatisation in enemy disarmament.
How nice message.
Deepavali is currently being celebrated in different countries of the world.
It is not only the Indians who have joined this festival, but the government of many countries, citizens and social organizations of that country celebrate the Diwali festival with fervor.
India of unity is built there.
Friends, there is a different attraction of tourism in the world.
Our India is the country of those countries, there is a great opportunity for such tourism.
Be it Holi or Deepawali or Unam, Pongal or Bihu, we should try to spread all these festivals and join the people of other states and other countries in this happiness.
We have so many festivals in every state and every region that people of other countries are interested in all these festivals.
This is why the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in improving tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, I have decided on the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will do something different on the occasion of Diwali.
I said - Come, let us all celebrate the strength of Indian women and their success in this Diwali, that is, I respect Laxmi of India.
Immediately after seeing this, there is a lot of inspiring stories in the social media.
My mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took charge of five sons.
Today we're five brothers in good life.
My mother is my God.
He is the Laxmi of India.
Rameshji, your mother is my grace.
He was addressing a gathering on the television, the lady of Major Khushboo, the daughter of Bus Conductor, and led by the women forces of Assam Rifles.
Her daughter to poet Tiwari, Laxmi of India, is also her strength.
He is proud that his daughter has taken a very good picture, and has taken a very good place in Clatt's exam.
Again, a 92 year old woman has been supplying water to the railway station in Gualior for many years.
Mehmaji, India has been inspired by the humility and compassion of this Laxmi.
There's a lot of stories that people shared.
You must read, inspire and share something around yourself.
My heartfelt congratulations to all these lakhs of Indians.
My dear countrymen, Sachi Honnnamma, a famous woman poet of the seventeenth century, wrote a poem in Sankara.
This is the feeling that the lady of India, whom we are talking about, is likely to have spent seventy-five years of research.
Peninda Permegandun Himavantu, Penindra Bhrigu Perchidanupenunda Janakrayanu Jaswadenu means that Himavantu i. e.
Our daughters have a strong identity and a bright future for our society through the great work of our dignity and these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November 2019, the 550th Birth Anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Devji is not only in India but also in the whole world.
In many countries of the world, we have learned brothers and sisters who have completely dedicated their lives to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can't forget my Gurudwara journey in Vancouver and Tehran.
There is a lot of talk about Shri Guru Nanak Devji that I can share with you, but this will lead to a lot of changes in the mindset.
He has always placed serving work above all.
Guru Nanak Devji believed that the selfless service was invaluable.
He fought firmly against social curse like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji gave his message to the world far and wide.
He was one of the most travelers in his time.
He had gone to many places and wherever he had won his heart through simplicity, humility and purity.
Guru Nanak Devji visited many important religious places.
It is said that the sixth saint of Assam, Shankar Dev, has inspired him in his ideals.
He also traveled to the Holy Land of Haider.
During his visit to Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water there.
Virley, Guru Nanak Devji is a famous place called Guru Nanak Jira Saheb which reminds us of his words.
Guru Nanak ji had travelled in the north Kashmir and its neighbourhood during an uneasy period.
This led to a strong relationship between the learned followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji had gone to Tibet and there too he was confessed as Guru.
He also traveled to Uzbekistan, and there he was revered.
And during an unexpected period, he travelled extensively in European countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He lived in the hearts of lakhs of people, who followed and followed his teachings with full respect.
This journey was organised to commemorate the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
There, all the princes, Golden Temples, along with the philosophy of learning, heritage and culture.
He was a great hero who binded the country in unity.
Sardar Patel was able to coordinate with those who had a visionary difference.
Sardar Patel also looked into the microscopes and looked into the exams.
In this context, he was the Man of Detail.
At the same time, he was also engaged in organizational skills.
He was also specially advisory to formulate a plan and create a framework.
When we read or hear about Sardar Saheb's performance, we can see how extraordinary it was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country were present to attend the 1929 Ahmedabad session.
He ensures that no one suffers water.
He also interacted with the farmers and urged them to build Khadi bags.
Look again, the sale of khadi has increased considerably.
The country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constitution.
He did an important task of ensuring our fundamental right, so that there is no possibility of discrimination on the basis of the nation or the community.
Friends, we all know that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, as the first Minister of Self-Services of India, had done a historic and great job of uniting the Khandkhand states and regions of this country.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had a special feature that nobody would ever ignore his vision.
On the one hand, his vision was focused on Hyderabad, Junagadh and other states.
So far the southern Lakshadweep and his aim did not come out .
However, when we mention Sardar Patel's efforts, we discuss his role only in certain parts of the country.
Like Lakshadweep he also played an important role for a small corner .
Immediately after getting this news, Sardar Patel took immediate steps without delay.
He sent instructions to the brother-in-law of Mudalia , A . . Ramswami Mudaliar and A . . Laxmanswami Mudalia that after taking along the rulers of Trevker the national flag hoisted there immediately .
As per his instructions , the temporary stretch is taken and the neighbourhood of the Lakshadweep is overwhelmed .
After this incident Sardar Patel told the brother-in-law of Mudali that he had personally decided that the development of Lakshadweep would be helpful .
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing immensely towards the progress of India.
This is an attractive tourist destination and boat .
I hope you go to this beautiful island and their shores.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, the Statue of Unity, built in the memory of Sardar Saheb, was dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the world's longest human emotion.
It is twice as much as the Statue of Liberty in America .
The longest statue of the world fills the heart of every Indian with pride -LRB- Indian mind fills with pride when it feels that the longest statue of the world is established in our country -RRB- .
Every Indian 's head gets higher in spirituality .
You will be happy to know that 26 lakh tourists had come to see the Statue of Unity in a year .
It means that everyday about eight and a half thousand people have earned the glory of this Statue of Unity.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has said that the faith in his heart , that is the faith in him .
Now there are several attractions like gardens of cactus, fauna, jungle safari, child nutrition park, Ekta nursery and for this local economy and development are also getting new employment opportunities.
Professional training is being provided at homesteps or at homes for facilitation of guests.
Local people have now started dragon-fruit farming and I am confident that it will become the main means of achieving their livelihood.
Friends, for the country, for every state, for the tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a study.
How can we witness one place become a world famous tourist center within a year where people from within the country and abroad come .
Traffic system, accommodation, presence of guides, environment friendly systems.
Very big economic development has started and the needs of the tourists are innovating local people 's services .
The government is fulfilling its responsibilities.
Friends , is there any Indian who would not be proud to know that in a few days back Time magazine has kept this Statue of Unity in the highest position among the 100 best tourist spots of the world .
My hope is that all of you will be able to see this Statue of Unity by taking out a bit of obstacles from your precious time , but I am sorry that every Indian who leaves for the sake of tours , he travels to at least fifteen destinations of the country and stays there .
Friends, you know that every year from 2014, 31st October is being celebrated as National Unity Day.
This day gives us the message of unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost.
The Ran for Unity is being organised today.
This will involve all sections of the society.
Running, mind and body both are beneficial.
I hope that all of you will participate in the race on 31st October for the unity and well-being of the country.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel had binded the country on the basis of unity.
This mantra of unity should be a reform of our lives, like India, to strengthen the mantra of unity at every level, at every level in diverse countries.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious to strengthen the country's unity and its concerns.
There will be many examples around us who are working for this purpose.
But many times their words mix with our memories.
Friends, I remember that the month of September of 1970, when Allahabad High Court gave the verdict on the birthplace of Ram.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the former Prime Minister of our country, Smt. Indira Devi, was also assassinated on this day.
Today, my dear countrymen, if every household, every village, every village has a story, if a story is written from the east to the west, from the north to the south, then it is cleanliness.
I want to talk to every person, every family, every village about cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is being done by hundreds of millions of Indians.
Hundreds of crores of Indians have also benefitted from this.
But there is also a pleasant and thrilling experience.
I hear you and I want to hear you.
In such a difficult situation, it is not a matter of valour to remain in such adversity.
In such a terrible situation, our desperate soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country by brave-hearts, they are also carrying out Swachh Siachen Abhiyan.
There's nothing so cold there.
In such a situation, the management of waste is an important task.
We all know that Siachen is a glacier which is a source of river and pure water.
In one such place, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan means to ensure pure water supply for those living in the lower areas, using rivers like Nubra and Sioke.
My dear countrymen, the festival is such a festival that awakens a new consciousness in our lives.
And in Deepawali, there is a special kind of shopping, a small amount of money from the market.
I once said that we tried to buy local things.
If we get the necessary things in our own village then there is no need to go to Tahsil.
If you get it, you don't have to go to the district.
The more we try to buy local items, the more Gandhi 150 you will be on a grand festival.
And I always urge you to buy some of the things that we've got in the hands of our tents, some of our Khadi workers.
Even before Diwali, many people have bought a lot of things before Diwali, but there are people who believe that after Diwali, things may be cheaper.
So there's a lot of people who still have to buy.
Therefore, with the best wishes of Deepawali, I request you to come here and buy local items.
See, can we also play a crucial role in the dream of Mahatma Gandhi
I once again convey my best wishes to all of you on this occasion of Diwali.
Like all of us in Deepawali, we use beds.
But sometimes it's incredible.
Sometimes he gets hurt.
I appeal to all of you to be cautious and celebrate the festival with great fervor.
I have a lot of good wishes.
Thank you very much.
What do you mean, September 2018
Is there any Indian who does not feel proud of the soldiers of our Armed Forces
Yesterday, hundred and fifty crore countrymen have celebrated Parakram Parv.
We recalled the incident of Surgical Strike in 2016, when our soldiers responded to the destruction of proxy wire against terrorism in our country.
Our Armed Forces have organised exhibitions across the country so that the lions can feel the youth of the country, especially the youth of the country, how capable we are and how our soldiers protect our lives.
He spoke of the glorious legacy of our Armed Forces to the youth of the country on the day of Parakram Parv.
It inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a function in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
It is certain that our soldiers will give a fair answer to all those who want to destroy the peace and prosperity of our country.
But with respect, there is no penalties for the country's sovereign power.
India is committed and committed to maintaining peace and order.
We have dedicated our lives to the peace of more than one lakh soldiers in the two wars of the 1960s.
Our vision has never been on the land of any other country.
It was our commitment to peace.
A few days back on September 23, we remembered the brave soldiers of Mahishur, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lancer who had freed Haifa from the invaders.
Our soldiers were a parallel to peacekeeping.
Even today, India is one of the largest military forces in the UN peacekeeping forces.
Our brave soldiers have been playing a crucial role for the peace and prosperity of the entire world by placing a blue helmet for decades after the past.
My dear countrymen, our energy is comparable.
The FlyPast, which looks forward to the valuable interest of the people of Kutchwaj on the occasion of Republic Day celebrations, is a reflection of the unprecedented architecture and strength of our Air Force.
On the 8th of October, we observe the Vayu Sena Day.
When the Pakistani invaders invaded offensive in 1947, the Air Senai ensured that the Indian Army and Air Force had reached the battlefield at the right time in order to protect Sri Nagar from the attackers.
The Air Force responded to the enemy in the war of 1960.
Who doesn't know about the Bangladesh war
The Air Force has played a very important role in relieving Kargil from the insurgents.
The Tiger Hill continued to bomb the enemy's neighbourhood.
Whether it is rescue and rescue or emergency management, the entire country is grateful to them for the role of the Air Force.
Air Force contributors in combating natural disasters like Tufan, Jhanjha, French or French catastrophe are demonstrating.
In order to ensure equality of women and women in the country, the Air Force has established a portal and has opened the doors of every department to the daughters of the country.
Now the Air Force is giving women the opportunity to select the option of the SHC as well as the Permanent Commission which I had announced on the 15th of August this year on the occasion of the Red Fort.
India can proudly say that the Indian Armed Forces have not only men's strength but also women's strength.
The whole country was worried about how to save him.
You must know that the accusation is a fearless, brave and brave soldier of the Tommy Navy.
The first Indian to travel worldwide with a small boat without any modern technology.
For 80 days, India had participated in the Southern Golden Race of the Ocean during a rapid pace, a terrible maritime storm.
With such a great danger, he promised to do something like this...
I pray for the rapid recovery of Abhilash Tomy and hope that this courage, this determination will inspire and encourage the youth of our country.
My dear countrymen, children also know the importance of October 2nd.
This year, this day has a special significance.
We are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi for the next two years.
Mahatma Gandhis ideals and thoughts have reached the world today.
Everyone like Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandela has gained strength from Gandhiji's teachings and has fought a long way in achieving equal rights and dignity of the people.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about another great task of revered Bapu, which all the countrymen need to know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started devoting some ideas as a constructive programme or an organizational programme.
Later, when the freedom struggle became stronger in 1960, Gandhiji created a revised copy of his thoughts.
The revered Bapu elaborated his thoughts on the right of the farmers, the people of the village and the hard worker brothers about the welfare, hygiene and the spread of education, which is called the Gandhi Charter.
Respected Bapu was a public servant.
Meeting with people, the specialty of Bapu ji to take people, which was in his own way.
This is the valuable feature of the personality of Mahatma Gandhi.
He conveyed to the countrymen that they are important and essential for the development of the country.
He gave this vision a mass movement which was his greatest contribution in the freedom struggle.
In the freedom struggle, the people of every section of the society dedicated themselves to the call of Mahatma Gandhi.
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra, which is the mantra of Gandhiji.
Gandhiji had said, I am talking about such a trick whenever you feel suspicious or arrogant, remember my thoughts.
You have seen the poorest and the weakest person in your life, remember his face and ask yourself how useful the steps you are thinking of.
Does it mean that crores of people who are hungry and disappointed will achieve self-reliance
Only then will you see your doubts and your pride is circulated.
My dear countrymen, a strategy of Gandhiji is equally important today.
Today, the economic strength and purchasing power of the country's growing middle class is enhanced.
If that benefit reaches the poorest of the poor, my happiness will increase manifold.
Remembering Gandhiji's tricks, whenever we buy something, we must keep in mind that every one of our buyings is good for the countrymen and the sweat that has grown in the production of goods, those who have invested in their talent, everybody gets some benefit.
This is the trick of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji, I believe that a small step of yours can transform the lives of the poorest of the poor.
Similarly, today we can feel that we can contribute greatly to the economic progress of our country, to the economic empowerment of the poor and to fight against poverty.
And I believe that this is the true patriotism of today's times.
Imagine buying khadi and handicrafts on a special occasion.
After two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri ji with revered Bapu.
As the name of Shastri ji was highlighted, we had an infinite reverence in the minds of our people.
His gentleman always fills the hearts of every countrymen with pride.
The speciality of the Red Fort was that he looked very soft from outside, but at the same time he was firm.
The mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan was the ruler of his great personality.
During the last one and a half years, he has given the mantra to reach the height of the success of the youth and farmers of the country, which is his selfless penance towards the nation.
Millions of people have participated in this campaign and I am also fortunate to donate Swachh Bharat Shram with children at Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school on which the foundation was laid.
School children, college students, NCC, NSS, youth organisations, media groups, corporate world have performed Swachhata Karma in large numbers.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all the beloved countrymen for this.
Let's hear a phone call, "Namaskar, my name is Shaitan Singh.
I thank you very much for your phone.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a success story not only in the country but in the entire world.
India is going to host the worlds largest Swachhata Sammelan - Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
The officials of the Ministry of Cleanliness and experts from all over the world will come and share their experiments and experiences on Swachhta.
It is imperative for the freedom, peace and justice of the afflicted, distressed and deprived people.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on 12th October, 2006.
In a few days, the NHRC will complete twenty five years.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but also helped to increase spiritual pride.
Our beloved leader, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had clearly stated that human rights do not have any foreign understanding.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, the principles of Vedic ages are decorated with "Good Building:".
NHRC has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a pivotal role in preventing its misuse.
This commission has created an environment of hope and trust among the people of the country.
I think it is very optimistic for a healthy society, for democratic values.
At the national level, 26 Ts State Human Rights Commission has been constituted.
All these great men have inspired us, we salute them.
This year too, we are eager to organize the Run for Unity in our villages, towns, metropolitan cities.
This is the right way to remember Sardar Saheb because he has worked for the unity of the country forever.
I urge all of you to strengthen this effort by 31st October, through the Run for Unity, to bind every section of the society, every individual in the way of unity and that will be his reverence.
My dear countrymen, I extend my heartiest congratulations to all of you for this auspicious festival of Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijayadashmi.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, the entire country is celebrating the Rakhibandhan festival.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion.
This festival of Rakhibandhan symbolizes the love and belief of sister and brother.
For centuries, this festival is a great example of social harmony.
There are many such incidents in the history of the country that have seen how the two states, or the people of different religions have been bound up with trust.
A few days later.
The air will be heard in the sky. "Hathy horse sail-ki Jai Kanhaiya Red-ki and Gobinda-Sonda.
It's a different joy to fool yourself in the color of Krishna.
Children must have started organizing Dahi-Handi in Maharashtra, especially in different parts of the country.
I am grateful to Chinmayi that she has taken care of this.
Friends, Besides Rakhibandhan, Shravan Purnima is celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
I congratulate all those people who have been working towards ensuring this great legacy, taking it forward and delivering it to the people.
Every language has its own importance.
There is a huge repository of knowledge that can be used in every field of life in language and literature.
Whether it is science or technology, agriculture or health, scientific or architecture, anchor or management, economy or environment, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Challenge has been detailed.
You will be happy to know that all the people of Mattur village in Shivamoga district of Karnataka have chosen English language as a medium of conversation today.
You will be surprised to know that the film is a language in which the words can be created.
We use English quotations to weigh some words, sometimes it is called Shayari.
However, those who are familiar with the well-known words of the Christian epic, they know that the correct explanation of the subject can be made through these well-defined words of the paper.
In the end, if a teacher teaches his disciple a letter, then there is no wealth or wealth in the whole world which can suck the debt of the disciplined teacher.
On the occasion of 'Teach Day', we always remember Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the former President of India and the former President of India.
On his birth anniversary, 'Teachers Day' was celebrated across the country.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the eve of Teachers Day and also to his dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, our farmer brothers and sisters, who have worked hard, come here with the news of rain and happiness.
Just a while ago, we have seen how the floods have disturbed the lives of Kerala.
In such a difficult situation, the entire country has come near Kerala.
I convey my deepest condolences to all those families who lost their loved ones due to this disaster.
Whatever has been damaged may not be fulfilled for any day, but I want to assure all the families of those satisfying families that 125 crore countrymen have joined hands with you in the last few days.
I pray that those who have been injured in this natural disaster, they should be able to recover quickly.
I have full faith that the lives of the people of Kerala will soon become normal by filling the indomitable vitality and courage.
The way disaster destroys the lives of the people, it is very unfortunate, but in the last few days, we also realize the religion of humanity.
Every person from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is trying his best to ensure that the areas where disasters have become terrible, whether it is Kerala or any district or region of India, the lives of the people of these places are normal.
People of all ages and people associated with all kinds of work are enhancing their help.
Everyone is wondering how to share the sufferings and sufferings of the people of Kerala.
We all know the soldiers of the Armed Forces are the heroes of Kerala's disaster.
They have taken all the ways to save the flooded people.
Air Force, Navy or Army, BSF, CI-SF and A-F have been forced to carry out rescue operations and rescue operations.
I want to specifically mention the hard work of the NDRF personnel.
The manner in which they worked in combating these threats is particularly appreciative.
The strength of the NDRF, their commitment and the ability to bring the situation to the realm of rapid decisions have created a revered seat in the minds of all the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, while reading the suggestions sent for Mann Ki Baat, we have seen that most people have written about this thing, our dear Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Baat from Sonipat, Brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banarji from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, Shri Narendra Modi called on me to mention the various aspects of the life of Atalji in Mobile App and MyGov.
16th August, when the people of the country and the world have received the news of Atal ji's efforts, they have expressed deep condolences.
He is a leader who quit the Prime Minister 14 years ago and has been far away from active politics in the last ten years.
He wouldn't have seen the news.
All of us have seen an outcome of the affection, respect and grief for Atal ji, the director of his great personality.
This country will always be grateful to Atal ji for bringing good governance in the mainstream.
Today, I would like to inform you about one more example of Atal ji's great personality that it is the Political Cultural Cultural which he has tried to bring about a change in the Political Cultural Cultural and the efforts made by him to provide a sustainable infrastructure to political culture will be of great benefit to the country and to the future.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the Aknown Review Session.
This revision brings about significant changes in the politics of our country.
The first is to limit the Ministers of States to fifteen percent of the total seats in the Assembly.
Atal ji will bring about a change in this system, which will result in greater efficiency of money and resources.
Atal ji was the only Doordarshan who brought about a change in the situation and adopted a healthy and sustainable system in politics.
Atalji was a true patriot.
Atal ji gave away the budget from 5:00 a.m. instead of 5.
Another Azadi we have benefitted from Atal ji's work through the creation of Indian Flag Code.
It is luggage from 2001, which can lead to thunderstorms at all places.
Ordinary Indians get an opportunity to inaugurate the National Flag.
In this way, he brings our favourite tricolor to the people.
You have seen how Atalji has made the country strong by taking bold steps in the election of the people by bringing about a change in the voting process.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a discussion about the Parliament today, there is a talk of obstacles, but when there is a good thing, there is no specific discussion about it.
A few days ago, the Parliament session ended.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 77.
All MPs have tried to make the most useful by abandoning their party interests, resulting in the passing of 14 bills in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.
This session of Parliament will be remembered for social justice and youth.
Several important bills have been passed for the improvement of youth and backward classes in this session.
You all know, for decades, OBC commissions like the SCST Commission were being opposed.
In order to ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has fulfilled the resolution of the formation of the OBC Commission this time and has given this institution a constitutional right.
This will help in achieving the objective of social justice.
The session also commenced the passage of a revised bill for ensuring the rights of the tribal and tribal communities.
The Act will further protect the interests of the people of SC and STE.
At the same time, it will protect them from the torture of the oppressors and increase their trust.
No civil society can unjustly impose any kind of injustice to the people of the country.
The perpetrators of this misdeed will at least be 10 years old, if the girls under 12 are raped, they will be hanged.
A few days ago, you might have read a newspaper, a court in Dhansor in Madhya Pradesh has heard two convicts guilty of raping a girl after just two months of hearing.
Earlier, after hearing a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh for just five days, the convicts were sentenced to death.
A court in Rajasthan has also made such a decision.
This law will play a constructive role in resolving crime cases against women and girls.
Financial progress is incomplete without social change.
The Thin Talaq Bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha, although it has not been possible to pass this session in the Rajya Sabha, I want to assure Muslim women and the entire country is with all the strength to provide justice to them.
When we come forward to protect the interests of the country, we can bring about a change in the lives of the poor, backward, exploited and deprived.
Today, on this occasion, I have set up a model together.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, this time we are committed to the Asian regime organised to showcase the vision of crores of countrymen.
Every morning, in newspapers, TVs, in social media, some Indian sportspersons have won.
Asian games are still on.
I congratulate all those who have won medals for the country.
I convey my best wishes to those who are still in the race.
India's players, particularly Shooting and Wrestling, have been performing well before all the games that we have not been able to do well, our players are also bringing medals like Wushu and Rowing.
These are not just medals, it is a testimony to the courage and fulfillment of the dreams of Indian sports and Indian sports.
Our daughters have a large number of medal wins for the country.
Even the youngsters who won medals are 15-16 years old.
It is also a good sign that many of the sportspersons who have won medals have emerged from unprecedented villages and villages and have achieved this by working hard.
On 29th August, we will celebrate National Sports Day. On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the sportspersons and also pay my homage to the great sportsperson Shri Dhan Chand Ji.
I appeal to all the citizens of the country, let all of you sports and watch your fitness because healthy India will build a full and prosperous India.
India will build a bright future when India is fit.
Once again, convey my best wishes to the Asian Championship winners and also to the rest of the players.
But the Vrihadeshwar Temple of Tanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this unforgettable combination of architecture and engineering is seen.
Everyone is surprised to see the Rani Ki Bao of the 1980s in the Patan of Gujarat.
India continues to use engineering.
There are many engineers in India who have imagined the unimaginable and set examples by showing extraordinary performance in the engineering world.
Our great engineers have such a gem in the legacy of their legacy which still makes people surprised.
He is Bharat Ratna Dr.
In that part of the country, he remembered the rest of the country with great respect and respect.
In his memory, 15th September Engineers passed away as Day.
Following his footsteps, the engineers of our country have made their own identity in the eastern world.
I remember that in 2001, a terrible earthquake in Kutch in Gujarat was an unprecedented factor in the Engineering world.
He was funny to see me. Look at my house.
It's called 'Bhunga'.
My house saw three earthquakes.
He had said this with pride and pride. I feel that long ago, our engineers used to judge the local environment and situation and build houses so that people could be safe.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers Day, we have to think of the future and organize workshops at different places.
We need to think about what new things we need to learn in the changing times
You have to teach
The entire world is fighting with natural disasters.
What about the new use of structural engineering here
What's his course
Should students learn
I convey my best wishes to you all for this idea.
We'll talk again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
It's encouraging human thinking.
You must have seen on TV that a team of 12 teenage football players and their coaches went to a cave in Thailand.
It takes usually a few hours to go to the cave and get out of there.
But on that day, Bhagyadevi had a different desire.
When they entered a lot inside the cave, a lot of water accumulated in the mouth of the cave due to heavy rains.
Efforts are being made to find out where those youngsters are, how they can be brought out.
But I want to see this whole thing in a different way.
The government, parents, family members, media and citizens of the country have shown each other an integral part of peace and patience.
Everyone has joined this mission in groups.
I think it is a learning and self-confidence.
Mother-father didn't feel sad or mother didn't throw water in her eyes.
Everyone's patience, restraint, peaceful use of society is really academic for us.
A soldier from Thailand's navy had to die.
The entire world is surprised that despite such a catastrophic situation, the rescuers have worked bravely and patiently in the dark cave.
This shows that when people are united, there is a lot of surprise.
It is essential that we focus on our goals by calming down our minds and work for them.
A few days back, our country's popular poet Neeraj had tried.
The characteristics of poet Niraj were hope, trust, determination and confidence.
All the words of poetry can inspire and inspire all of us.
The darkness of his writings will be far away, if the storm rises, when the light rises, the darkness will be far away.
The month of July and August is very important for the farmers and for the youth.
This is because this is the time when Peak Session for colleges.
Millions of youngsters like truth go out of school and go to college.
The month of February and March is scheduled to be scheduled for examination, question-answer.
The month of July, when the youngsters stepped on the path of destruction of their lives, when the focus moved away from consciousness to Kat-off.
The focus of the students goes from Home to Hostel.
Students enter the rooftops of Professors from the rooftops of the parents.
I believe that my young friends are very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time, going out of the house, going out of the village, coming out of a safe environment, we have to make ourselves a guide.
So many youngsters left their homes and left their lives in a neutral way.
There's no choice but books, we have to study, but we have to keep on looking for nutritious matters.
Old friends are very precious.
Those youngsters who have left their homes and have gone somewhere else to study, discover that place, know about the people, languages and culture there.
I convey my best wishes to all the youngsters who are starting the Nutrition chapter.
Her father has lived up to the family by washing the waste of stale.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for this success.
How bad families are students who have shown their hard work and concentration in adverse conditions that inspire us all.
Like Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father DT-C's schoolchildren or Gupta, who has studied under the footpaths of the road, among them are Afrin Sheikh, the daughter of Auto Chala, the daughter of a school driver of Nagpur, Kartik, the son of Chaukidar of Haryana, or Ramesh Sahu, the son of a brick-wheeler in Jharkhand.
The victims of sexually transmitted diseases called spinal mascular autopsy have achieved the success of the world by crossing all the barriers of their determination and mind.
How many such examples can we get around us
Any good event in any corner of the country gives strength and inspiration to my mind.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a news came to my eyes, in which it was written: "The two youngsters had fulfilled the dream of Modi.
After reading the inner news, I came to know how our youth is trying to bring about changes in the lives of the common man through technology smart and creative yojana.
It was a matter of fact that once I had interacted with the Indian youth in the city of Technology Hub San Jose, USA, I had requested them to think of how they can use their talents for India and do something out of time.
I had requested Brain-Drain to be replaced by Brain-Gain.
Two I-T professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Bajpayee have confessed to this challenge.
Using their professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together created a Smart Championship App.
The App will not only connect the people of the village with the entire world but will also get any information or information on their mobile phones.
This App has been provided to the village telephone directory, news section, events list, health centers, information centers etc.
The FACT rate in the FACT and the farmers is working on the market to sell their goods.
Thank you very much for your phone
Indeed, Pondicherry is a unique festival.
Friends, The journey of Pandharpur with Janakajmak was accompanied by sixty-six months old, which was on 23rd July this year.
Pondicherry is the holy city of Kolapur district of Maharashtra.
Friends like Sant Jnaneshwar and Sant Tukaram, in the footsteps of Paduka Pauli, they were dancing in the name of Lord Buddha.
Lord Bitthal, who is also called Bithowa or Pandurang, was visited by devotees.
Lord Vitthal protected the poor, the helpless and the suffering.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have unwavering respect and devotion to this Lord.
You visit the Bithowa Temple in Pondicherry and have a different feeling of glory, beauty and spiritual joy.
My request to the audience of Mann Ki Baat will definitely be accomplished if there is an opportunity to visit Pondicherry.
Innumerable saints like Jnaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are teaching the people of Maharashtra today.
We receive advice from them on the basis of ease, love and brotherhood, such as 'Verud' or 'Abhang'.
The society can fight with respect to blind faith, we get this mantra from them.
They have shown the right path to society at the right time and have ensured that the old mischief is removed from the society, bringing compassion, equity and compassion among the people.
There was such a great warrior, Lokmanya Tilak, who had made deep impressions in the minds of many Indians.
We remember Tilak ji's birth anniversary on 23rd July and his devotion to 1st August.
People Tilco was brave and self-confidence.
He had the power and intellect to demonstrate the misconceptions of British rulers.
The British were so scared of the people that they had complained of treason against him three or three times in twenty years.
I am telling you about a special incident on the statues of Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad.
In the month of October 1916, when Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, more than 40 thousand people were gathered to welcome him 100 years ago.
After the Mayor of the Municipal Corporation, Vallabhbhai Patel decided to establish a memorial at Victoria Garden, the queen of UK.
Normally, the British ruler was very unhappy about this and the Collector was repeatedly proposing to build a memorial called Smaru Hella.
But Sardar Saheb is Sardar Saheb, if needed, he will resign, but he will leave the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak.
Finally, the statue of Sardar Patel was constructed and inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi on 28 February 1992.
Speaking on the occasion, the revered Bapu had said that the Ahmedabad Puducherry Mayor had not only received one person, but also had a power that could enable him to build a statue of Tilak.
My dear countrymen, there is a special feature of this statue that Sardar Patel had established here in Lokmanya Tilak ji's chair.
The English had to hear it as God's orders.
The first ever Ganesh festival was celebrated on the occasion of Lokmanya Tilak.
While the Sarvajanin Ganesh festival was traditionally rich in respect and honour, the society became an effective medium for awakening, unity, integrity and equilibrium.
Ganesh Mandap is now seen in the streets in the lane of any city.
All the families of that street, together, organised the Ganesh festival.
This is an unparalleled opportunity for our youth so that they can acquire special powers like organisation and leadership and develop them within themselves.
My dear countrymen, I have said this thing last time, to recall Lokmanya Tilak ji, let us celebrate the Ganesh festival with Dhammadham but celebrate the festival of 'Pavesh-Bhanba'.
May his decoration, his rituals and his rituals be associated with the idol of Ganeshji.
Those who had dedicated their lives so that the countrymen could breathe in a free India.
I'm talking about lunar jewels.
There are no young people in India who cannot be inspired by listening to this poem. Whether the poems like Ashfaq Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad were inspired by these poems.
Chandrashekhar Azads courage and freedom inspired many youngsters.
Azad lived his life, but never before the foreign rule.
It is my privilege to visit the village of Alirajpur in Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again I salute the two great sons of Mother India Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
A few days ago, in the 20th World Athletics Championship held in Finland, India's daughter, Hima Das, has shown history in winning the Golden Jubilee.
The country and one daughter, Ekta Bhayan, e-mailed me from Indonesia in response to my letter, are now preparing for the Asian regime.
E-mail writes: "It's what Mahendra was in the life of an athlete when he's inflicted on the shore and I'm proud to do it."
Ekta, we all are proud of you.
His success is due to the fact that he has made his challenges a means of success.
At the road accident in 2006, the part below the body of a terrible terrifying nervousness, but this girl has not dared to lose courage and has achieved her goal.
I convey my congratulations and congratulations to Ekta Bhayanji, Yogesh Katuniyaji and Sundar Singh ji for their courage and struggle.
Please move forward, play, improve.
My dear countrymen, many events in the history of the past month are full of festivals, but sometimes diseases enter home for the season.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for the well-being of your countrymen, for the forthcoming months and for the centuries-old festivals.
Mann Ki Baat will meet again.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, once again, on this occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I am fortunate to meet you all.
A few days ago, a historic match was held in Bangalore.
You might have realized that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was the first international test match in Afghanistan and the pride of all Indians that this historic match in Afghanistan was with India.
The two sides demonstrated excellent sports activity in the match.
And I remember that Afghan President Asherfanji tagged me and wrote on his tour. The people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I also thank our Indian friends who have created a platform to showcase our sportspersons.
The best of Afghans, Rasheed represented him.
He is an asset in the world of Christianity, and he also enjoyed a bit of fun - No, I don't want to give it to anyone.
This match will be remembered to all of us.
Though it was the first match, it was natural to remember, but I would also remember this match for one thing.
The Indian team has done something that is uninterrupted in the world.
While taking part in the Indian team, what a victorious team has done
While taking the Indian team, the Afghan team invites those who play international matches for the first time, and takes photographs together.
We can feel from this incident as to what can be a sportsman spirit and a sportsmanship.
The best way to unite sports society and find out the talent in our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, an unprecedented panorama was witnessed in the fourth yoga festival.
Whether it is Brazil-European Parliament, the United Nations Headquarters at New York, the Japanese Navy fighter ships, people have been exercising Yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic event of Yoga has been organised and I have been told that many women have also done the demonstration of seats.
India and China have worked together on the high snow peak of Ladakh.
If people from all over the world participated in the Yoga Day celebrations with so much enthusiasm, then why wouldn't India have a lot of enthusiasm
Our warriors of the Air Force have performed Yoga at 15,000 feet above the ground in the middle of the sky.
It was a sight to see, they didn't sit in the air, they were sweeping in the air.
Whether it is schools, colleges, offices, parks, high houses or playgrounds, Yoga has been done everywhere.
A vision of Ahmedabad was to be hypnotised, where around 750 defective brothers and sisters have made records at one place, together.
I am Mani, today Yoga is working as a wellness, revolution.
An effort is being made by Yoga for wellness, I hope that it will move forward.
Gradually, many people will choose Yoga as part of their lives.
Thank you for your phone.
You know why Kabirdasji had gone to Imaghar
He is the one who can understand the sorrows of others.
Whoever doesn't understand the sufferings of others, he's cruel.
Kabir Dasji gave special emphasis on social coordination.
"Jagme Bari Koi Nehi, Joe Mann Ki Baat.
Give me pulses, please.
Kabir Das ji said, "What kindness is your religion, which is the sin of greed.
Her invaluable words today have a similar effect. Now, when we talk about Saint poet Kabir Das Ji, we remember one of his dreams.
"This is the greatness of the Guru and one such guru is Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev.
Those who have shown millions of people the path of truth, who have been inspiring people for years.
The 550th edition of Guru Nanak Devji will be held in 2019.
One more history is linked to Punjab.
In 2019, the horrific event of Jallianwala Bagh, which is about to complete 100 years, was a shame to humanity.
On April 13, 1919, someone forgot the black day when the abuse of power crossed all limits of cruelty, innocent and innocent civilians were fired.
This madness is going to be completed for 100 years, but we will always remember the plain message given by this incident that no problem can be solved between violence and violence.
Peace, non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice have always won.
My dear countrymen, Shri Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi has written in the Narendra Modi Mobile App on 6th July, 2019.
Ramanji, thank you very much first
It was a pleasure to see your interest in the history of India.
You know, yesterday, June 23, Dr.
Perhaps it's very few people know, Dr.
At the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had spoken in language at Kolkata University Convocation.
This was the first example when during the British rule, a person spoke in the language language at the Convocation of Kolkata University.
From 1990 to 1960, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industrial Minister of India and in a sense, he had laid a strong foundation for India's progress in entrepreneurship and inclusiveness, set him on a strong foundation and platform.
In 1947, India was formed based on its first industrial policy, its plan and foresight.
Dr.
It was a dream of Mukherjee that India would be self-reliant, better and prosperous in every field of industry.
He wanted India to build a bigger industry and also focus on MSMEs, textiles, textiles and cottage industries.
For the proper development of cottage and sleeping industries, he has introduced financing and organisation set-ups for al-I between 1947 and 1980.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had a great contribution.
He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal.
A part of West Bengal has been protected due to his thinking, consciousness and activity and is still part of India.
Come, let us remember this solidarity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and continue to work towards taking India forward through harmony and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, for the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to interact with all those people who have benefited from various schemes of the government through video calls.
I got the opportunity to move away from the file and listen directly to the people.
People have spoken of their resolve, their happiness and sadness.
I think it was not just a government function, but it was a different learning experience and what could be more satisfactory and satisfactory than the joy I have witnessed in front of the people at this time
When I heard of an ordinary man, his simple words, his passionate feelings, he touched his heart.
I knew how girls from far-flung villages have been helping in the construction of common service centre to provide passports to the elderly and the elderly.
A sister from Chhattisgarh is doing business to produce ice cream from her, and lakhs of youngsters from Jharkhand like Anjan Prakash are running Jan Aushadhi and supplying medicines to the nearby villages.
The youngsters in West Bengal who were searching for jobs two-three years ago, now they are not only running their business with success, they have provided jobs to 10-15 people.
Students from schools in Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa have been working on important topics like West Management at the school's Tinkering Lab at an early age.
There was a story of innumerable experiences and there was no part of the country where there was no message of success.
I am glad that with the success of the government in the entire event, I have felt the strength of the success of the people, the strength of the nation and the power of the New India, the power of the resolve.
There are some individuals in the society, unless they speak desperately, they don't think of disappointment, they don't find ways to create unbelief, they don't get peace.
In such an environment, when the common man speaks of new hope and new zeal, his success is not for the government but for the government.
The story of a small girl from a small village on the far-flung side also inspires 125 crore people.
I am grateful to the countrymen.
You people have connected 40-40, 50-50 lakh people with this video bridge and have given me new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to you.
I also felt that this smell of good.
In fact, the Corporate Professionals of Bangalore, I-T engineers have jointly created a wealthy trust and have activated this trust to double the income of the farmers.
Through this trust, these people are connected to the farmers, they have constructed schemes and efforts are being made to increase the income of the farmers.
How to do biological farming with new methods of farming and how to harvest crops along with crops, all these trainings are being imparted to the farmers through this trust.
Earlier, all the farmers who were dependent on only one crop so that the crops were not good and the benefits were not there. Today they are not only harvesting many crops but also making the right marketing of the crops at affordable prices.
Farming will be good only when good seeds will be used for this purpose, Seed Bank has been created separately.
Women have taken care of this Seed Bank and women have also been linked to it.
My dear countrymen, the GST system is going to be completed one year.
Today, the dream of One Nation One Tax which was the dream of the countrymen has been realized.
If I have to credit someone for this arrangement of One Nation One Tax Reform, I will give this credit to the states.
The GST is a beautiful example of Cooperative Federalism, where all the States have decided to work together for the welfare of the country and as a result, such a large tax reform system has been started in the country.
Till now, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can be proud that individuals of different political viewpoints, different states and representatives of different priorities, the decisions taken in the GST Council till date have been taken unanimously.
There were 17 different taxes in the country before the GST but after the introduction of this system, one tax system is now available across the country.
The check posts have also been discontinued after the arrival of GST and have increased the speed of transportation of goods and other goods, which will not only save time but also benefit the logistics sectors.
GST is perhaps the world's largest tax reform system.
In India, such a huge tax reform has been successful because the people of the country have taken up this system and this manpower has ensured the success of GST.
It is generally recognised that such a large scale reform takes 5 to 7 years to properly implement such a large population.
But the zeal of the honest countrymen, the flow of the country's honesty festival and the participation of the people is that within a year, this new tax system has created its place, it has been established and it is also being revised through an inbuilt system.
This is a great success that 125 crore countrymen have achieved.
Mann Ki Baat May 2018
You must remember, a team of six women commanders from the Navy has been sailing for the past few months.
I want to say something about Nabika Sagar Parikrama.
The team of six daughters of India has returned to India on 21st May through more than 250 days of I-NS-V Tarini and expressed their warm welcome throughout the country.
Approximately 22,000 nautical distances have been crossed through various oceans and seas.
This is an unprecedented incident in the entire world.
Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
I once again convey my best wishes to these daughters for their adventurous work, for enhancing the reputation of the Navy, for enhancing India's honour and especially for the daughters of India to deliver this message to the world.
You must have seen that in the last few days, new information has been received about Mount Everest-Jai people.
On 16th May, five tribal students from Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisha Dhole, Pramesh Ale, Umakanth Madubi, poet Das Katmode and Vikas Sawam, have won the highest peak of the world.
They were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Ladakh since August 2017.
They were elected in Mission Shaurya.
And by winning Everest, they have brightened the name of the country.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to these young students of Chandrapur School.
Recently, sixteen year old Shivangi has won Everest as the youngest Indian woman in Nepal.
The first father-son jute won by the unwinned Bajaj and his daughter Diya Everest.
Not only the youngsters are winning Everest, but on 19th May, Smt. Sangeeta Behal also won the Everest.
There are some of the Everest climbers who are not only skilled but also experienced.
This work is not only praising but also responsible for the cleanliness and the environment.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all those brave hearts, especially the daughters.
People from all walks of life will come forward to support this.
In the context of Fit India, I believe that the more we play, the more we play, the more we play.
In the social media, people are sharing the video of their Fitness Challenge, they are tagging others.
I believe that this is a very good process and such challenges encourage us to fit ourselves and fit others.
My dear countrymen, several times in Mann Ki Baat you have heard from me about sportspersons and sportspersons.
Thank you very much for your phone.
These games were special parts of summer holidays.
There are two conventional games.
There's an outdoor and an indoor.
The diversity of our country can be seen somewhere in these sports.
The same game is known by various names.
It was played at the Square Board on 8th May, 2019 with hard or smooth beaches.
I don't know how many names like Champal in Maharashtra, Dayam in Tamil Nadu and Changpo in Rajasthan are.
If the people of different states don't know each other's language, they're right at the time of playing
That's the game that's seen everywhere in the village.
It is also known by various names across the country.
It is known as Gotibilla or Karabilla in Andhra Pradesh.
It's called a bullet in Orissa, in Maharashtra it's called Bittidalu.
Traditional sports are created in such a way that it helps in physical capacity as well as enhancing our logistics, concentration, awareness and efficiency.
And these are not just sports but also teaching the values of our lives, learning goals, achieving determination, building team spirits and helping each other.
A few days ago, I had seen that our traditional sports have been included in the training programmes of business management to improve the development and interpersonal skills of the individual.
At the same time, we are also aware of our culture and traditions.
Some sports are aware of our society, environment etc.
Now schools, schools and youth should come forward and encourage these sports.
Through Crowd Sourcing, we can build a museum of our heritage sports.
This game can be made in order to show how to play the rules of the game.
Animation film can also be made so that our new generation can know about these games, play and grow up, my dear countrymen
The theme is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I urge you all to understand the importance of this idea that we will not use polyethylene, low-grade plastic and will try to reduce the harmful impact of plastic pollution on our nature, wildlife and our health.
I urge all the information from World Environment Day website wedindia 2018 to try to use it in our daily life.
Life has been damaged, wealth has been damaged.
This is the result of the changes that have taken place in the 1980 Weather Pattern.
Mahatma Gandhi has been talking about this for the rest of his life.
Today, India is talking about Climate Justice, COP 21 and Paris Agreement. We have united the world through International Solar Alliance.
On this Pravasi Divas, we can think of what we can do to make this world cleaner and greener.
How can we move forward on this path, what can we do innovation
It's raining.
Now we can plant trees in record numbers, not only planting but also taking care of them until trees grow.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
You all remembered on 21st June, not just you and I, the whole world remembers June 21.
The 21st June is now celebrated as International Day of Yoga all over the world and it has been unanimously recognized that preparations for the event have begun a few months ago.
It is being reported that preparations are being made to celebrate 21st June as International Day of Yoga.
Yoga always braves us like a father.
Forgiveness is created as mother feels for her own child, mental peace becomes our last friend.
Bharuthuhari said that by doing regular yoga, the truth is our child, our fear, our integrity, our illusion, the world is our destiny and knowledge.
When someone is so talented, this yogi naturally wins all kinds of fear.
Once again, I appeal to all the countrymen that they should take forward the great legacy of Yoga and create a healthy, happy and comfortable nation.
My dear countrymen, today is 27th May, the third day of India's first Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
I salute Panditji.
In the month of May 1857, the people of India had given their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were roaring against injustice.
Sadly, for a long time, we have described the 1857 incident as 57 rebellions or military rebellions.
This incident has not only been shown in a small way, it was an attempt to hurt our self-respect.
This brave Savarkar has been devoid of writing that what happened in 1857 was not an insurgency but the first fight for freedom.
The gallantry of the India House in London, along with Savarkar, celebrated its 50th birth anniversary.
He was an adorer of both arms and scriptures.
Veer Savarkar, who was originally known for his struggle against Bahuduri and the British Raj.
But apart from this, he was also an Ojwai poet and social reformer who has always emphasized on harmony and unity.
Our beloved Atal Bihari Bajpayee ji has given us a wonderful description of Savarkar ji.
Savarkar is taking both poetry and revolution together.
Besides being a sensible poet, he was also a brave writer.
Our daughters, who were once forced to beg from the stupendous waste to house-to-house, today they have learnt the work of sewing and stealing the lives of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters who are full of hope and trust.
They have shown that if there is a prisoner to do something and you are grateful for it, then whatever success can be achieved in the troubles, this is not just the issue of Sikar, you will be able to see it in every corner of Hindustan.
In your neighborhood, you will see how people are defeating the problem.
You have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we get satisfaction with tea, there are discussions and discussions with some people.
These discussions are political, social, film, sports and sportspersons, the problems of the country and the problems of the country should be solved in such a way but most of the time this discussion is limited to discussions.
He organised education, health and food for all children coming to school.
He destroyed the darkness of their lives.
Who does not know this sadness, but has shown D Prakash Rao.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for society and for the entire nation.
There will be many incidents that inspire you.
There's probably a lot of things.
Let us take the positive mindset forward.
It is so hot in the month of June that people wait for the rain and hope for the clouds of the sky.
People will wait for the moon after a while from today.
To see the moon means the first to flee.
At the end of one month's fast at Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a symbol of the beginning of a bright festival.
I am confident that everybody will celebrate the festival with happiness, especially the children will get good news.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
Good luck to everyone.
My dear countrymen, thank you all very much.

Everyone has a significant role in this journey of their lives, their parents, parents, parents, coaches, other assistants, schools, school teachers or schools.
They also have the role of friends who have enhanced the spirit of players in all the situations.
I thank all of them along with the players, convey my best wishes

On the other hand, I feel happy and healthy by visiting the morning written by Ruma Devnath.
He added that Fitness comes with a smile, and when we are happy, we'll laugh.
There is no doubt that happiness and joy are fitness.
Dubble butterflies wrote a picture of their trekking.
It's traveling and trekking for me, Fit India.
It is a pleasure to see that a lot of people are also encouraging our youth for Fit India.
Chitraveneta Akshaykumar gave a video on the tour.
I've seen that video, you'll see, and this video shows him to try with wood.
He said that this exercise is very useful for stomach and back muscles.
I think this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
You must be preparing.
On 21st June, the entire world has accepted the importance of International Day of Yoga.
There is no need to tell anybody in India or the world about the benefits of Yoga in the entire physical development, mental development and normalization of the mental state.
You might have seen an animated video where I've been shown.
The work that a teacher can do is being done through animation, so I thank the animation preparers for doing this very carefully.
My young friends, all of you are coming out of the test-examination pillar and are thinking of a holiday.
I would like to invite you for a new job today.
I have seen that many youngsters are now spending time learning something new.
Outside the four walls, paper-colum, computer-life-living experience is an opportunity.
My young friends, I would request you today for a special internship. The three-four Ministries of the Government of India, such as Sports, Human Resource Development, Drinking Water Division, all of you will join the Swachh Bharat Summer II.
All those who worked very well in colleges, colleges, colleges will be awarded at the national level, which will be successfully featured by me.

You must send your experiences, send story, send photos, send video.
On this occasion, you will be able to know how many people from different parts of the country are doing well and how good they are talking about.
A few days back, I was seeing that some young poor children of Delhi are getting free of cost. These youngsters have started a mesmerising programme for the education of Delhi's commuters and slum children.
Initially, they explained to the vulnerable and small-scale working children on the road. They also joined the developmental work.
The programme, which started with 15 children from the settlement near Geetha Colony in Delhi today, has become a platform for studying two thousand children at 12 places in the capital.
In this campaign, young teachers are trying to bring about a two-hour free time from their daily busyness and to change the society.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of Uttarakhand have inspired farmers across the country.
They have changed the fate of their respective areas, not just their own.
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, the cultivation of potatoes, potatoes and potatoes is done.
In the hilly areas, the farmers did not get the right price for their crops, but the farmers of Kopkot Tahsil brought down their farm sales directly to the market and made them the way for value addition and value addition.
They have made biscuits from farm farming and selling biscuits.
These farmers have created a government agency in Munnar and opened a biscuit bakery.
On seeing this effort of the farmers, the administration has included it in the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit has spread to almost 50 Anganwadi centers of Bageshwar district and also to Kosani Almora.
With this effort of the farmers, the turnover of the company has reached 10 to 15 lakhs and more than 900 households have been provided with food grains.
My dear countrymen, I often hear that war for water will begin in the coming days.
Everyone says, but don't we have any responsibility
Water conservation is not new to Indians.
There is no need to know any particular language for reading books.
Our ancestors have done it in the past.
They have given maximum importance to every drop of water.
They have made new ways to save every drop of water.
You will see that many temples of Tamil Nadu have rocks on water supply system, water conservation, water conservation, drainage etc.
Large rocks can be seen in the temples of Monarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti and Pudukottai.
Even today, many bufferies are known as Step Wells tourism, but they are indeed a shining example of water conservation efforts of our ancestors.
If you go to Rajasthan, you must visit the Chand Bauri of Jodhpur.
This is the biggest and most beautiful burial of India, one thing we have to remember is the biggest burial in a region where there is a strong water crisis.
Water conservation will be as effective as April, June-July and as the timelines for water conservation and the advanced system can be maintained.
The Manerega Budget can be spent on water conservation.
In the last three years, many people have been making several efforts in water conservation and water conservation.
About 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation and water dam construction in the Manrega Budget every year.
In 2017-18, I can say that out of 64 thousand crore rupees, 55 or 35 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation schemes.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of farming has been benefitted by this water conservation and water conservation system.
This has been possible due to the hard work of about 40-45 villages.
I will say, April, May, June, July are coming and we can take a lot of responsibility for water conservation and water conservation, take some plans and do something.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is Mann Ki Baat, there are many news papers, letters and phone calls from all around the country.
But the people don't know anything about the philosophy that protects against the philosophy of Lord Buddha's pacefulness, beauty and integrity.
Please tell you about this in the Mann Ki Baat program so that the common man can know it.
In his writings, he had an unprecedented impression on all matters, a talented personality, a personality of diversity, but he always felt that there was a teacher in him.
He wrote in Geethaanjali: "He who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students, and his responsibility is to share with the enquiry students.
It is a coincidence that when people are illiterate, they can feel hungry for others.
When he is thirsty, he can feel the thirst of others.
It is time to remember the teachings and messages of the Hon'ble Prime Minister.
The teachings of his life create a commitment to equity and brotherhood among us.
Once a member asked, "What is the best thing in Islam"
The Prime Minister said, "Ease of feeding poor and deprived people and maintaining ease of living with everyone.
He believed in wisdom and compassion.
He had no doubt about it.
He used to say that arrogance exposes wisdom.
You should give it to someone who needs it, so that Ramzan has a special significance.
In this Holy Month, all of them gave gifts to the poor.
Paigambar Mohammad believed that the sacred soul of the individual was not rich in him.
My dear countrymen, Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, the land of compassion, service and sacrifice, which has guided millions of people across the world.
This intellectual reminds us of the efforts, determination and greater responsibility of walking on the path shown by Lord Buddha.
Lord Buddha's inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
This is the human value, the world's most needed today.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar used to say that Lord Buddha had a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
He said, "My social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words
Whether it is the people of the country who are oppressed, exploited or deprived, Baba Saheb has strengthened the people of this region through the Constitution.
There's nothing bigger than compassion.
This compassion of Lord Buddha for human suffering was one of his great qualities.
We have received the teachings of Lord Buddha inherited by the whole of Asia.
The teachings of Buddha in many countries of Asia such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar etc. are linked to the roots of Buddha and this is why we are building a Buddhist tourism infrastructure that connects the important places of South-East Asia with the Buddhist regions of India.
May the entire world bless the great soul that we can fulfil our responsibility in building a peaceful and compassionate world in his ideals.
Today, we remember Lord Buddha. You will also listen to the statue of Lafing Buddha, which is said to bring good fortune to Lafing Buddha, but very few people know that this buddha is also associated with an important event in the history of India's security.
Perhaps you are wondering what could be the link between the forces of Lafing Buddha and India
You must be recalled that 20 years ago, on the 11th of May, 1997, the Prime Minister of Tatkalin, Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee ji had spoken to the people of the country, which conveyed the message of glory, valour and happiness to the entire country.
There was a new confidence among the people of India that was spread all over the world.
That day was intelligent.
Nuclear tests were conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan on 11th May, 1998 on the west coast of India.
This test was done on the day of Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias exams were successful and from the point of view, India was able to showcase its strength in science and technology.
We can say that the day has been marked as the day of his exhibition of military power in Indian history.
Lord Buddha has shown the world that the energy of the heart is essential for peace.
In this way, when you can become stronger as a nation, you can stay peaceful with everyone.
The month of May, 1996 is not only important for testing of atomics in the month of May, but also for making it possible.
It showed the entire world that India has the potential to reach new goals and heights by keeping the great scientists in front of their own land and a strong leadership.
Atal Behari Vajpayee ji gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai KisanjanJai Vigyan.
Today, when we are celebrating the month of May 11, 1998, the mantra of Atalji Jai Vigyan for India's vision of 'Jai Vigyan', we have to move forward to build a modern India.
We have to make our strength a part of India's strength.
And then we will be able to gain a new joy and satisfaction to take forward the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, we will talk again about Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
On 26th January, the representatives of the ASEAN countries came here and brought together various cultural groups.
It is a matter of great pride that most of them presented Ramayana to us.
That is, the inspiration and influence of Ram and Ramayana, not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries of the world.
My dear countrymen, I have received a lot of letters, e-mails, phone calls and suggestions from you all this time.
I have read what MyGov has written about the introduction of online course of software.
I am glad to see your indulgence in the field of information technology as well as your indulgence in the field of technology.
I asked the concerned departments to inform you about this.
I also urge all the audiences of Mann Ki Baat to think about how this proposal of common cold can be taken forward.
The Narendra Modi App has been approved by Shri Ghansham Kumar of Barakar village in Nalanda district of Bihar.
The concern that you have expressed regarding the decreasing groundwater level is really important.
And the Ayushman land can be only when we take care of every animal living in this land.
You have requested for water supply for animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal ji, you think I've reached all the audience friends.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha said, I would like to say something about the health of the youth.
According to him, the youth of our country are physically weak compared to other Asian countries.
A few days ago, the Hon'ble President of France had visited Kashi, who had written to Mr. Prabhas Kumar of Varanasi, who touched his heart and inspired him.
He expressed interest that all these photos should be published in the video social media.
The Government of India has shared all the photos on social media and the Narendra Modi App on that day.
I want to tell all the children like Angha, Jayesh that if all these letters are sent to them, then my entire day's misery and hard work gets over and over.
All these letters, so many phone calls, letters, opinions, what I could read, and there are many things that touched my heart.
They wrote about their tests, shared their vacation plans, and thought about the suffering of animals and birds in this summer.
Farmer brothers and sisters have sent letters to me about the movement of farmers across the country regarding 'Kishan Mela' and farming.
Some conscious citizens sent me suggestions on water conservation.
Our festivals, our cultures and traditions are also being portrayed during the festival.
When I read a letter to you, I know that Ali, a resident of Karimganj in Assam, has built nine schools for the poor children by filling their hearts with his will.
When I heard the story of Dr. Ajit Mohan Chowdhury from Kanpur, who travelled from the bottom to the footpath and treated these doctors and brothers and sisters and gave free medicines, hence the pride of sympathy and humanity of the country.
Thirteen years ago, the sister of Cuttack Citizen Silk Lasker died due to lack of timely treatment.
This kind of inspiring incident involves the identity of my country.
Today, the entire world has seen India in other eyes.
Today, when the name of India is highly respected, the glory of the children and daughters of this country remains hidden behind it.
My dear countrymen, the next few months will become very important for the farmers brothers and sisters.
Because there's a lot of farming letters.
This time, I have seen the video of this programme with farmer friends in DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan, and I feel that all the farmer friends should visit this DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan, and the agricultural advice should be used in their own field.
Whether we talk about Mahatma Gandhi or whether Shastri ji or Lohia ji or Rabindra Singh ji, everybody considers agriculture and farmers as an important part of this country's economy and public life.
Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri always emphasized the need for conservation of trees, plants, forests etc. and improved farming.
Dr. Ramnohar Lohia spoke of our farmers' income, improved search and ensuring that all these things are sufficient for food and milk production.
In his address in 1956, Dr. Charan Singh appealed to farmers to use new technologies and innovate them.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced record production in 2015-16 over the last five years.
They showed that if the goal is stable, there is complete confidence, if there is a promise in mind then all can be done.
Today, technology has been linked with the hard work of the farmers.
This will give a lot of energy to the agricultural producers.
I have seen that many farmer friends have written about the MSP and they want me to discuss it in detail.
Brothers and sisters, A major decision has been taken in this year's budget to give the farmers the right price for their crops.
It has been decided that MSP for specific crops will be reduced to one and a half times the investment.
Further, work on Agricultural Marketing Reforms is underway in the country so that farmers can get the right price.
Attempts are being made to ensure that the local markets of the villages are connected to the world market.
20,000 rural haats in the country will be connected to APMC and e-NAM platform for farmers to sell their produce so that they dont have to go far away.
This means that a system can be connected to any market in the country from a single field.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
How will the country celebrate this festival
You must share your thoughts with everyone through mygov.
What can be the logo of Gandhi 150
All the work related to health was earlier taken up by the Health Ministry.
Preventive Health Care is very cheap and easy.
The more we become aware of the Preventive Health Care, the more the people, the family and the society will benefit from it.
The first term of keeping life healthy is cleanliness.
Besides, work is underway to create Health Wellness Centre across the country.
Yoga as a Preventive Health Care has created its own identity in the world.
Yoga promises to be both healthy and capable.
This is the result of our commitment that Yoga has become a mass movement today and has reached home.
This year, International Day of Yoga is not left for 21st June and 100 days.
In the last three International Yoga Day, people from all over the country and abroad participated with great enthusiasm.
Now we have to ensure that we join ourselves and encourage our family and friends to join us.
In a new and innovative way, we must popularise Yoga among children, young and adults, be it men or women.
There are separate events involving TV and electronic media in the country.
But from now on, can you create awareness about Yoga as a campaign till Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga, but I am a compassionate teacher.
Some people have made me a teacher of Yoga through their own thoughts and made me a 3-D animated video of Yoga.
I would like to share this video with you so that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Adequate efforts are being made to ensure that healthcare is free, be it possible for all, affordable and affordable for the people.

New medical colleges will be opened in every three districts.
Everyone needs your help to reach this awareness.
We all have to strive together to get rid of TB.
Dr. Ambedkar had spoken of India's industrialization many years ago.
His thinking is that the entrepreneurship is a strong medium which will benefit the poorest of the poorest of the poor.
Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt that India will once again be a strong center of labour and craft.
Today, the dream of Make in India is inspired by the success of the nation.
India's position in the world economy is now like a bright star, and most of the foreign investment is happening in India.
The world is now looking at India because we are now becoming the centre of investment and new traditional innovation.
Dr. Ambedkar was deeply convinced of self-sufficiency and self-reliance.
One of the people of the country should not live in poverty, such as Dr.
He also believed that poverty was not possible by giving donations to the poor.
Today, projects like 'Mudra Yojana', 'Start-up India' and 'Stand-up India' are creating youth youth in our country.
The vision for water conservation and use of rivers and valleys was imagined by a number of executives.
Today, the historic history of expansion of waterways and ports has started in the country.
New ports and old ports are also being repaired at the same time in different coasts of India.
In the decade of 1990, when the world was at the forefront of the Second World War, the Winter War between the two powers and the concerns of the nation, Dr. Ambedkar imagined the spirit of Tim India or India.
He understood the importance of federalism and felt that the Centre and the States have to work together for the development of the country.
Today, we are committed to cooperative federalism and competitive cooperative federalism at every level of the country and the entire United Nations.
The most important thing is that Dr. Ambedkar is an inspiration for a number of people like me in the backward classes of the country.
The story of India is entirely different: this is an India of the poorest of the poor.
The Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organised across the country from 14th April to 5th May.
The nation will continue to undertake various programmes for rural development, poverty and social justice.
I request you all to participate in this national mission in a swift manner.
My dear countrymen, in a few days, many festivals and festivals are coming here: Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Ister and Vaishali.
May Mahavir Jayanti remember the sacrifice and penance of Lord Mahavir.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavir, the preacher of Ahimsa, inspires us.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti.
Esther Elle thinks of Jesus Christ, the peace of mankind, the goodness, the righteousness, the compassion and compassion.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you for the coming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2018
We have seen that the colours of the sea look blue, but we know from the daily experience of the sun that there is no color of water.
Have we ever thought that the river, the sea, the water becomes colorful
This is the question of a young man in the 1920s.
This question was given by a great scientist in modern India.
When we talk of science, India's first sir C.
He was awarded the Prize for his outstanding work on light scattering or radiation.
His discovery is known as Roman Effect.
We celebrate 28th February every year as National Science Day, as it is said that on this day, he discovered Light Scattering, for which he was awarded the Award.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana, scientists like Satyendra Nath Bose are proud of India.
Famous by the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, Boson has also been named.
Recently, at a function in Mumbai, I got the opportunity to inaugurate the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
The extraordinary work on science is very attractive.
The Artificial Intelligence has helped in manufacturing robots, boots and reconstructive machines.
Nowadays, various machines are smartening their intelligence through self learning.
Technology can help improve the lives of poor, deprived and helpless people.
At this event of Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientists that what kind of artificial intelligence can be facilitated to ease the lives of brothers and sisters
Can we get a better prediction on natural disasters through Artificial Intelligence
Can artificial intelligence facilitate ease of access to health services
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate the 'I Create' programme in Ahmedabad in Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel.
There was a new young man who said that he had made a digital instrument where if no one could speak, it would become frightened by writing about the instrumental channel and you can talk in such a way that you can talk to a person who is able to speak.
I think we can use artificial intelligence in such a way.
Science and Technology Valunutral.
You are not involved in this.
Any machine will do what we want.
But it depends on us what we want from the machine.
Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of Light Balloon, has been unsuccessful in his work.
Once he was asked about this, he said, "I have searched ten thousand ways not to build a light. "
It is a matter of great privilege that today I have been in the Auroville, the land of Maharshi Aravind.
As a Congressman, he challenged the British administration, fought against them, raised their rule in the face of questions.
In this way, he spoke of every aspect of life like a great sage, finding answers and guiding humanity.
It is important to ask the truth again and again.
Congratulations to our scientists and all those associated with science on National Science Day.
Friends, I have several messages about safety and disaster during the crisis, people send me something or the other.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today delivered his address at the National Mobile App, in Pune.
He wrote that there is no better settlement in our country in terms of calling and construction work.
If we are not aware of safety in everyday life, if we cannot afford security, then it is even more difficult to ensure that there is any major danger or misery.
Most of the accidents are the result of our mistakes.
If we are cautious, follow the necessary rules, we can save our lives and save our society from any major accident.
Sometimes I have noticed, several instructions have been given for safety in the workplace, but the rules are not executed.
My request is that all the municipalities, municipalities, who have fire brigades, should go to different schools at least once a month and drive them in front of students.
It will have two benefits, namely, the caution of the criteria and the new generations will learn a lot.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading disaster response across the country.
A scheme called Apada-Mitra has been launched to train volunteers in Cyclone or Bana-Pravana districts.
Training and awareness is extremely important.
Two or three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year in Lu or hit wave.
Since then, NDMA organised workshops on Heat Wave confrontation and launched a campaign to increase public awareness.
We have a good outcome in all collaborations.
The number of deaths due to heat waves in 2017 is estimated to be around 220.
This shows that if we give importance to safety then we can be safe.
I would like to honour all those who are present at the scene during an accident and help the victims.
The number of heroes is not less than the number of such names.
Friends, Friends Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Para-Military Force and Armed Forces, who risked their lives and rescued others.
India and other BIMSTEC countries, namely, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal, participated in this exercise led by India a few days ago.
We've heard them many times.
But today, if anyone asks us about our plane, where is life jacket, how to use it, I'm sure no one can answer it.
If we all become aware of our security, the security of the society is also included in it.
My dear countrymen, in this budget, emphasis has been laid on the production of Wasteto Wealth and Wasteto Energy through biogas in villages to create a Swachh Bharat.
Efforts have been initiated and it has been named as GOBAR Dhan, Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The objective of this GOBAR Dhan Yojana is to clean up the villages and make the livestock dung and after farming the remaining waste in the fields into compost and bio-gas.
Animal dung and other biological fossils are used for power generation in any European country and in identification.
But India has not been fully exploited.
We are progressing at a rapid pace by incorporating Swachh Bharat Mission Rural Scheme.
The objective of utilizing Bio-Gass based energy is to ensure sustainable development of livestock, post-farm waste and kitchen waste.
The Gobar-Dhan Yojana will encourage the farmers, rural brothers and sisters of rural India to look at cow dung and waste as a source of income without seeing it as a pound of land.
Use of biogas for cooking and power generation will also increase self-reliance.
This will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal husbandry.
New employment opportunities will increase in the areas like waste collection, transportation, bio-gas sale etc.
An online trading platform will be created to properly implement the Govardhan scheme, which will connect farmers with the purchaser so that farmers get the right price for dung and agricultural waste.
I would like to urge the enthusiastic people, especially the sisters living in the villages, to come forward and build self-help groups and utilize this opportunity by assisting the Assistant Secretaries.
I invite you, let us also join the leadership of Clean Energy and Green Jobs.
But, there was an unprecedented attempt at Raipur in Chhattisgarh, and it was the first Varja Mahotsav organised in this state.
The objective of the Mahotsav organised by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to increase awareness about cleanliness, creativity of city waste and creating awareness about various methods of re-use of garbage.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Raipur Nagar Nigam, the entire Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for showcasing this festival in a remarkable manner in the importance of waste management and cleanliness.
International Women's Day is celebrated every year on 8th March.
Various events take place in the country and the world.
On that day, all those women who have done exemplary work in various fields in the last few days were honored by the Mahila Shakti Puraskar.
Today, the country is moving towards the development of women by leaving the development of women.
Today I am reminded of a saying of Swami Vivekananda .
Hundreds of years ago, this idea of Swamiji reflects the spirit of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
Today, our women power has shown their self-confidence and self-confidence through their work.
They have taken the country and society forward and have taken it to a new height.
Finally, this is our dream of a New India where women are equally involved in the development of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
A few days ago, a man gave me a great suggestion.
He suggested that on 8th March, various events were held on the occasion of Women's Day. But can all the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village or city be honoured
This number is not a small number of 15 lakh women who have undergone Swachhta Abhiyan for one month.
In just 20 days, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand Jal-Shahia i. e.
You can imagine how big it is.
These women from Jharkhand have shown that women power, a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which will transform the cleanliness drive in everyday life and the reform of cleanliness in the spirit of the people.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was looking at the fact that the three villages of Elephanta Island have been electrified after seventy years of independence.
You know very well that Elephanta island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai in the sea.
This is an important tourist destination.
I am amazed to know that despite being such a major tourist destination in Mumbai, even after so many years of independence, electricity has not reached Elephant.
For seventy years, the darkness of the three villages of the Elephanta Islands - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Senthbandar - the darkness of the life of the people there has been removed and their lives have become shining.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that now the Elephanta village and the Elephanta cave will be electrified.
This is not just a power but a new beginning in the face of development.
My dear brothers and sisters, a few days ago we had celebrated the 'Shivratri' festival.
The importance of Hollywood is as important as Hollywood.
On the day of Holi, sitting together in every corner of the world, sharing happiness and happiness is a beautiful moment and a message of love, unity and harmony.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
And two days ago, we have directly celebrated Republic Day.
The first thing in history is that the top leadership of 10 countries was present at the function.
My dear countrymen, Shri Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter to me in the Narendra Modi App. He wished that I should touch his letter.
He wrote that the death anniversary of Kalpana Chawla on Saturday, February.
He took us away from the Columbia Space Accident but inspired millions of youngsters around the world.
I express my gratitude to Bhai Prakash ji for starting his long letter of imagination with Chawla's farewell.
If there is a will and a firm resolve to do something, nothing is impossible.
Several scientists from all over the country have contributed in various activities of the past.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi, I don't know how much name
Today, we talk about Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, but hundreds of years ago, in our classics, Skandhapuran, we have said: Dasputra, Samagraha and Dasuprata.
This is the pride of our society.
And that is why in our society women have been given the status of energy.
This woman power keeps the entire country, the society and the family united.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given many more examples after this.
He wrote that our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharamans 'Suhoi-30' war flight will inspire him.
Three brave women think Kanth, Mohla Singh and Avani Vedadevi fighter aircraft are currently undergoing training for Suhoi-30 fighter aircraft.
Today, there are several areas where women are the first to live and our women are doing something or the other.
This has also been added to the Narendra Modi website as e-book.
Today, even the positive changes in the country and society are crucial for women.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women's empowerment might think of what could be the connection
Mumbai's Matunga Station is the first railway station in India where women from all levels are women.
Ministry of Women and Child Development
Be it the Department of Commercial Affairs, Railway Police, Ticket Examiners, Announcements, Point Person, more than 40 women employees are handling the station.
Today our Nari Shakti is leading from the front.
Whenever we talk about tribal women, everybody feels that there will be forests, mountain chests, there will be a familiar view of women walking in the minds of children.
But our tribal women in Chhattisgarh have produced a new picture in front of our country.
Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is among the Maoist-affected areas.
Fighters of violence, torture, bombs, guns and guns have created a terrible environment.
Tribal women living in such a state of treachery are self-determined by e-rickshaws.
In a very short span of time, all the women there have become part of this process.
On the one hand, as they are empowering themselves through self-employment, the Maoist-affected areas are also changing the pictures.
And with this, it is also possible to provide special strength to the environment conservation.
I also appreciate the District Administration there. From grants to training, the District Administration is playing an important role in the success of these women.
We have repeatedly heard that people say, "There is something that doesn't lose our existence.
Destroy whatever is negative, whatever is required to be adopted.
And the specialty of our society is to maintain the continuous process of self-review.
Any vibrant society remains in the process of self-assurance.
Several centuries of attempts against social evils and evils have been made in our country individually and socially.
Through this campaign, efforts have been made to create awareness against social curse like Balwas and Panapratha.
He was sworn in in the State to fight against law and order such as law and order.
Children, elderly, enthusiastic and motivated youngsters, mothers and sisters have made themselves victorious in this fight.
From the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, the human chain continued to reach the borders of the state.
It is important to be free from such illicit laws to contribute to the real development of all sections of the society.
Let us all simultaneously pledge to remove such evil practices from the society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration there, the human chain, for ignoring such special and comprehensive issues for the welfare of the society.
My dear countrymen, Shri Darshan from Mysore of Karnataka was written in MyGov and spent six thousand rupees per year for his father's treatment.
He was not aware of Prime Minister Jan Aushadhi Yojana earlier.
But as soon as he came to know about Jan Aushadhi Kendras, the price of medicines was reduced to 75 percent.
He wished that I should talk about this while talking about Mann Ki Baat so that more and more people get information about it.
Several people have been writing to me about this for the past few days.
I have seen a lot of videos and social media that are taking advantage of this scheme.
And when I get to know this kind of thing, I feel very happy.
A deep satisfaction.
And I am also glad that Shri Darshan ji had a feeling that the benefits that he had received would have been received by others.
This has benefitted the common man, especially the elderly, who are forced to take medicines everyday.
The life-saving medicines from here are manufactured in accordance with the approval of the World Health Organisation.
This is the main reason of absorption of good qualities medicines .
Today, more than three thousand medicine centres have been set up across the country.
These are not only cheaper medicines but also new employment opportunities for private entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at the Prime Ministers Jan Aushadhi Kendras and Hospitals Amritsar Stores.
The only purpose behind this is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country to build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh has shared a picture on the Narendra Modi App from Maharashtra.
That picture was such that my attention was attracted to that photo.
A grandson has joined the Clean Morning River Campaign with his grandfather.
I have come to know that the citizens of Akola organised Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Morana river through Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The river Morna used to flow in the past twelve months but now it is dependent.
The second point of sadness is that the river was filled with jungle grass and garbage.
The river and its surroundings were being wasted in abundance .
Hence, an Action Plan was formulated and one day before Makar-connectivity, from 13 January to 13 January, the first phase of Mission Clean Morna was carried out at fourteen places in the area of four kilometres.
This Swachhta-Abhiyan was continued in the same way as on 20th January and I am told that this campaign will continue every Saturday morning as long as the river Mornana is not fully cleaned.
This means that nothing is impossible if people take a firm resolve to do something.
It is possible to bring about a big change through Jan Andolan.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Akola, to the district and municipal administration, to all the citizens associated with this work as a mass movement.
My dear countrymen, you have heard a lot of discussions on Padma Puraskar.
The discussions have attracted attention on news papers and TV.
But if you look at this thing with a little attention then it will be a matter of pride for you. It will be a matter of great pride for us and it will be a matter of great pride for us to see how the common man of our country is reaching this height without any recommendation.
There is a tradition of awarding Padma awards every year. However, in the last three years, its entire process has changed.
Now any citizen can choose any person.
This has brought transparency in the entire process online.
The election process of this award has been completely transformed.
Everyone has been awarded Padma awards in big cities, news papers, TV shows.
Now the importance of his work is increasing, not the identity of the person in the field of awards.
You might have heard about Shri Arvind Guptaji.
He is making toys from things that have been left out for four decades, so that the youth can enhance their zeal towards science.
Their efforts are to encourage small people to use scientific products.
For this, three thousand schools in different parts of the country are inspiring the youngsters by showing films made in 18 languages.
One such story is the story of Sitaba Jodatti in Karnataka.
He is not called the goddess of Women Empowerment.
He has done a great job in transforming the lives of innumerable women in Belagavi since last three decades.
He dedicated himself as a goddess at the age of seven, but then added his entire life to the welfare of the gods.
Not only this, he has also done a great job for the welfare of Dalit women.
You can hear the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh. Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a poor family and tribal family.
He did a small job for his life, but he had the hobby of creating traditional tribal paintings.
Today, he is honoured not only in India but in the entire world.
His pictures have been displayed in many countries like Thailand, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyamji, which has been illuminated abroad, has been recognized and given Padma Shri Samman.
You will be surprised to hear the story of Laxmikutty, the tribal woman of Kerala.
Laxmikutty teaches in the area of the fort and is still in the middle of the dense forest in the tribal areas under the shadow of the shadow hut .
He has prepared five hundred medicines based on his memory.
He has the capability to produce snake bites.
Laxmi ji is serving people responsive to his knowledge of this herbal medicine.
He was honored with Padma Shri for his participation in the society by marking this unconscious person.
Today, I want to mention another name. In West Bengal, seventy-seven years of Subhasini Mistrik has also been selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistri is a woman who has hired a house for other people to build a hospital and sold vegetables.
When he was thirty years old, his husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired him to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in the hospital constructed by his hard work.
I firmly believe that there are so many rituals, women and rituals in our multicultural years that no one knows or knows.
Sometimes people should come to school and colleges and know their experiences.
There should be some effort in the society outside the prize.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas every year on January 9th.
This is the day when the revered Mahatma Gandhi had returned to India from South Africa.
Today, we celebrate the festival of unbroken bonds between Indians and Indians living in different parts of the world.
This year, on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, we had organized a function where all the MPs and Mayors of Indian origin living in different countries of the world were invited.
You will be glad to know that Indian dynasty and Mayor from Malaysia, Thailand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, UK, Suriname, South Africa, USA and many other countries have joined this event.
Our Indian diaspora, who are living in different countries of Europe, are working on the safety of cyberspace, some are connected to Ayurveda, some are enjoying the minds of the society through music or poetry.
I would like to thank the European leadership for this remarkable task, for the recognition of the Indian dynasty and for the information of the people of the world through them.
3rd January is a revered Bapu Punya Thi who showed us a new path.
These were not just the basic principles.
At present, we can see every step as to how good Bapu's message was.
If we take a pledge that we can walk on the path shown by Bapu, what can be a greater respect than that
My dear countrymen, I conclude my speech by conveying my best wishes to all of you in 2022.
Namaskar .
Mann Ki Baat, December 2017
The last episode of this episode of Mann Kiwat is this year, and what a strange concert is, today is the last day of 2017.
I and you have shared a lot of things this year.
Your letters, comments and exchanges on Mann Ki Baat always keep me in a new spirit.
We'll change the year after just a few hours, but this continuation of our message will continue.
We will share new experiences in the next new year.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to you all for the New Year 2018.
A few days ago, the Holy Christmas Festival smoked all over the world.
This festival is celebrated with great fervor throughout India.
At this time of Christmas, we consider the teachings and teachings of Jesus Christ, and the greatest emphasis on Jesus Christ is service.
This service is also reflected in the realm of thought.
Ramkrishna Paramhansadeva also said that it is a matter of serving life in Shiva's wisdom.
Dear countrymen, this year was also the year of Guru Gobind Singh ji's 350th birth anniversary.
Guru, poets, poets, poets, great warriors, all these compositions have consistently inspired man.
He has shown the path of liberation from the bonds of nation and religion, to be straightforward against injustice and torture.
And in this endeavour, he had to lose a lot in his personal life, but he never remembered his inferiority.
Every moment of his life was filled with love, sacrifice and peace.
Come, let us commit ourselves to inspire Guru Gobind Singh ji's teachings and his great life philosophy and acknowledge his ideals in our life.
You might be surprised to think that the New Year comes every year and the Pylosopher also comes every time, what happens to be the next day
The entire India is looking forward to welcoming you to the 21st century.
You must be proud of yourselves for voting in the 21st century.
The power of exchange is the greatest power of democracy.
Remember, you can also play an important role in building a 21st century India and starting from Pylaguri.
In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had specially wanted to address the valuable youth of the age group of 18 to 25 years.
My belief is that the dream of New India will be fulfilled by ensuring the skills and strength of Ayushman Bharat.
The new India that we are talking about next day is a poisonous India of nationalism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
Free India of hygiene and poverty.
New India, which will have energy, peace, unity and harmony.
Let us make a path for ourselves, connect those whom you associate with us, and let us move forward.
Think about how we plan before 2022
Mahatma Gandhi transformed the freedom movement into a mass movement.
My young friends, it is a matter of time for us to make the dream of a very beautiful, meaningful India a mass movement.
Today, a lot of opportunities have been created for the youth.
From Skill Development to Innovation and Enterprises, our youngsters are moving forward and successfully.
I would like to imagine how this New India Youth can be found in one place and there should be a system for this thing that can be easily accessible to all these things in the world as soon as the age of twenty-four years is over.
Dear countrymen, during the previous Mann Ki Baat programme, I had talked about Impactivity with you people.
Nothing is impossible for a person full of positive and enthusiasm.
In English, they also said, "Pessimism Leadsou Wicknes, Optimism to Power.
In the previous Mann Ki Baat programme, I had appealed to the people to share their positive moments in 2017 and welcome 2018 in a positive atmosphere.
I am glad that people have shared their experiences in the social media platform, MyGov and Narendra Modi App in a very positive manner.
Lacs of lakhs of people have been identified with Positive India Hashtag which has reached more than 1.
One thing is that the transmission of the positive system has started in India and has spread across the world.
That's really an inspiring tournament.
There was a feeling of happiness.
Some of the countrymen have discussed all the incidents that have had a significant impact on this year.
Some people shared their own experiences.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I'm staying in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Fase One, Delhi.
 My name is Joti Rajendra.
And he died in the accident.
We know what happened to us at that time.
We were very helpful in this aid of the government and we were able to handle the situation.
 My name is satisfactory.
National Highway has been constructed in 2017 from different villages across our villages.
Two incidents that our Indian soldiers carried out - one of the surgical strikes carried out by the Pakistanis, which strengthened the launching pad, and at the same time, the transformation of our Indian soldiers in Doklam was incomplete.
 My name is Satish Bawani.
Over the past forty years, there was water problem in our area and we were dependent on the pipeline for the army.
Now we have a pipeline.
So, in 2017, we don't get this bigger.
In a way, there are many people who are doing such things at their own level so that there is a positive change in the lives of many people.
In reality, this is the New India which we are all combining.
Come, let us enjoy all these small joys in 2018, start the New Year and take a firm step towards Positive India.
I want to share a word when we're talking about positive.
I came to know about the inspiring story of Anjum Bashir Khan Khatak, the topper of the administrative service of Kashmir.
He has expelled from the clutches of excitement and hatred and topped the test of Esakashmi's Administrative Service.
You will be surprised to know that in 1990, the rebels burnt his ancestral home.
There was so much anger and violence that his family had to leave their ancestral homes.
Such a violent atmosphere around a young child was enough for darkness and bitterness in the heart but the fig didn't allow it to happen.
He never gave up hope.
Today, he is not only in Jammu and Kashmir but also inspired the youth of the country.
Anjum has proved that no matter how bad the situation may be, the clouds of despair can be wasted through positive action.
Last week, I had a meeting with some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
This is the strength of our country, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, just in our country, whenever there is a discussion of the world's famous religious places, it is natural to have a meeting of Kerala's Sabarimala temple.
Crores of dedicated people were present here every year in the blessings of Lord AyappaSwami.
How big challenges can there be to maintain cleanliness in such a large number of places where devoted people come to such a large number
And especially those places in the mountains and forests.
P.
A police officer named Vijayan started a program called 'Punyam Punkavanam' and started Swachhta Abhiyan to increase awareness about cleanliness.
He is a pilgrim, unless a pilgrim is working hard for cleanliness, his pilgrimage will not be complete.
There is no small difference in this campaign.
Every pilgrim is participating in the Swachhata chapter as part of the worship of Lord.
Every morning there is a strange sight of this safai and all the pilgrims participated in it.
He can be a celebrity or a very big officer, or a common pilgrim, everyone participated in the Punyanam Punkavanam programme and had to move forward after performing sufficient work.
The countrymen have many such examples.
This Swachhta Abhiyan in Sabarimala is progressing, Puneyam Punakavnam has been successful and all the participants participated in it.
And we have sworn that when the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will do something to give a Swachh Bharat to his dream.
Efforts are being made at affordable level across the country for cleanliness.
There is a change in the rural and urban areas.
The Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be organised in the worlds largest survey from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to pursue cleanliness at the city level.
More than four thousand cities will be covered by nearly 40 crore people.
Analysis will be done for Swachhta App facilitation and revision of service sector.
It will be seen in the city that every citizen of the city is involved in the process of keeping the city clean and it is transformed into a city habit.
My dear countrymen, some of these things appear to be very small, but they are far-reaching in a society.
Today, I have mentioned such an incident in this episode of Mann Kiwat.
Is this wrong with tens of Muslim women since the 19th century
He has not given the right to Muslim women of our country.
I am very happy that our government has focused on this.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken urgent steps in this regard and this tradition of 70 years has brought about this obstacle.
Today, a Muslim woman can go to Hajkar without a pilgrimage and I am glad that about 1300 Muslim women have applied to go to the pilgrimage and Muslim women from different parts of the country from Kerala to North India have expressed their desire to go to Haj.
I suggested to the Ministry of Minority Affairs that women who want to go to Haj alone should get permission from them.
Our effort will be to get equal rights as our women and equal opportunities so that we can achieve equal dividends in the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26th is a historic day of our country.
But on 26th January, 2018, we have to keep in mind the day.
This has never happened before in India.
The year 2017 was marked by ASEAN countries and India-II parties.
The ASEAN has completed fifty years and has completed 25 years of Indias MoU with the ASEAN countries in 2017.
It is a matter of great pride for us to meet the ten great leaders of the world on 26th January.
My dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals.
Perhaps there's no such day that there's no precedent.
Recently, we all celebrated Christmas, and the new year is coming.
May the New Year bring happiness, prosperity and happiness to all of you.
Let us all move forward with new initiatives, new zeal, new hopes and resolves.
In January, the sun rises and the calendar of Makar Sankranti celebrates.
It's a surveillance with nature.
On the one hand, each of our forefathers is in some way connected with the natural calamities, but in our culture full of diversity, these incidents of nature are different.
All these surroundings flee from 13th to 17th January.
The name of these ancestors is different, but there is only one theory in its depth - the link between nature and agriculture.
I convey my best wishes to all fellow citizens for their pride.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
There will not be anybody in India who has not remembered or honored him.
He testifies to all of us and to all the incidents of the country.
He completed the ninth year on 28th September.
I was fortunate to talk to Didi before my foreign visit.
This conversation was exactly the way a younger brother interacted with his elder sister.
Lotadi, Pranam.
I'm talking to Narendra Modi.
Pranam.
Modi ji: I called for this because now I will be busy traveling by air.
Modi ji: I'll be back on 28th night, and on 29th morning, your birthday will be over.
Okay, okay.
Lota ji: At a young age many people grew up, but it is a great achievement to get the blessings of those who grew up with their work.
Yes, but I think it's my parents' blessings and blessings.
Modiji:..
I'm glad when you proudly said your mother was Gujrati...
No, I don't want to hurt you anymore, because I can see and know how much you work and how much you work.
How much we have to think about.
When you brought your mother's footprint, I sent one to her, to bless her.
My mother too is very happy to share your love.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you on your birthday.
But I was so busy that I couldn't take time.
Yes, yes, of course
My dear countrymen, from today onwards, the festival will be filled with a new zeal and resolve.
Talk about the festival
Over the next few weeks, the festival will be happy and shining across the country.
The house will be full of happiness.
But you must have seen many people around us who are deprived of this festival.
And it is called the darkness under the lamp.
Maybe this expression isn't just a word, it's an instruction for us, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Imagine, some houses are lighted on one side
On the other hand, in front of him, the darkness of some people around him.
In some houses sweets are destroyed, and in some houses children become sweet for sweets.
At least the household extra or destructive items can be delivered.
In many cities, the startups of the young friends of the NGO are doing this.
They collected dresses, sweets, food from the people's house, and then discovered the bad guys and returned the things to them slowly.
Can we sleep in the darkness of the lamp with complete awareness and resolve during this festival
Laxmi was welcomed in the traditional tradition.
In our culture, girls are considered to be Lakshmi, because girls come with luck and prosperity.
This year, can we have a massive programme to honour girls in our society, village and city
Can we have a programme to honour these labourers of India on this occasion
There are many daughters and daughters around us who are doing extraordinary work.
Someone is doing the job of reading poor children, somebody is creating awareness about cleanliness and health, some are serving the society as a doctor, others are trying to provide justice to someone as a lawyer.
Our society should respect and proud of these girls.
Let them be honoured by the country.
You can do one more thing, share these girls in social media as much as possible and use the hashtagbharatkilaxmi.
Like we all had a massive campaign called Selfie with Dotter, which had spread all over the world.
My dear countrymen, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I have already said this is a funny advantage that I am fortunate to speak directly or indirectly to the well-known people.
A few days ago, Alina Tayang, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, sent me a very attractive letter.
I'm Roeing, Arunachal Pradesh.
I'm very nice to read, I think it would be very useful to read before the booking test.
I am very fond of this book, but I also noticed that there are many suggestions for students in this book, but there is nothing in this book for parents and teachers.
So, my young friends also have this confidence that if the country's chief servant speaks of something then it will happen.
My little student friend, thank you for writing the letter first.
Thank you for reading Ekjam Warriors two or three times.
If I can take time for a new version, I will definitely try to write a few words for parents and teachers.
But I'll put an application to all of you.
Can you help me
I must consider them.
I will think about it and I will definitely try to write in my own language, in my own way what I think is appropriate.
If your advice comes in sufficient numbers, it will be sure that my new edition will be confirmed.
So I'll wait for your opinion.
I thank our young student friend Arunchallina Tayang again.
My dear countrymen, you are aware of the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of the country through the medium of information papers and television.
But you know that I'm a common man like you.
I've heard the speech and watched the match.
The simplicity and consequences of the 23-year-old Daniel Medvev are like influencing everyone.
I'm definitely impressed.
Shortly before that speech, he won the Grandslam 19 times and finally defeated the British Legend Raphael Nadal.
Someone else was sorry and disappointed in that situation.
He lauded his campaign for defeating the final post-competitiveness and lauded the sportsman spirit.
On the other hand, Champion Nadal also complimented Donald.
In the same match, the morale of the player and the use of the winners both are educated.
If you don't listen to the speech of Daniel Maidenbhav, I would like to urge all of you, especially the youngsters to watch the video.
It's learning a lot for people of all ages.
This moment teaches us that defeat does not mean anything.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, what I am talking about is just for your good.
Arguments, restructuring will continue, but the problem should be resolved before any matter is resolved.
Otherwise, the problem is a big deal and it's a toxic thing to solve.
If we are conscious of moving, we can save a lot.
With this feeling, I feel that my young friends must talk about an emergency.
We all know how harmful to the health of tobacco and how hard it is to avoid this evil once.
Tomato nicotine is intoxicating.
The development of the brain also gets damaged due to the introduction of this tobacco in cashew season.
We all know about these things, but today I want to inform you about a new subject.
You know, recently there has been a ban on e-cigarettes in India.
This-cigarette, apart from the common cigarette, is a technical instrument.
The e-cigarette-A nicotine liquid materials are heated and a chemical smoke is produced through which nicotine enters the body.
We know about the dangers of simplegarettes, but there is a confusion about e-cigarettes that it is not harmful.
Aromatic chemicals are used to avoid ordinary cigarettes.
We must be aware of the fact that in a family, he tried to have a father chain smoker so that no one else could smoke.
More chunwari's little cigarettes to keep away from the beedi.
There is no smoke about the cigarette, those who are selling, those who are buying or watching, everyone knows that the cigarette is dangerous.
But the e-cigarette matter is quite different.
There's very little awareness about this among people.
The common man is not aware of the harmful nature of e-cigarettes and this is why the transformation has entered homes.
Over the years, children are playing magic in front of their parents, without fire, without smoke, by taking e-cigarettes from their mouths and by giving them a big hand.
You know, we smell it when somebody around us smoked the cigarette.
Even cigarette packets in pockets can be smelled.
However, this is not the case with e-cigarettes. Whether it is known to the youngsters or to the fashion statements, whether it is fashion statistics, whether it is in the middle of the book or in the middle of the book or in the hands of the fashioned persons, they are in the grip of this intoxication.
Youth is the future of our country.
Resistance to e-cigarette has been imposed so that this new drug addiction does not destroy our country, does not destroy the dreams of the family, does not destroy the lives of the children.
Somehow the disease of drugs cannot bite the roots in society.
I urge all of you to abandon the abuses of tobacco and stop making any confusion about e-cigarettes.
You must remember the Fit India.
Fit India means not to go to the gym every morning and evening.
It is also called 'Fit India' to avoid all these misconceptions.
I believe I don't want to hurt you, but it's better.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is a matter of great privilege for us that India has dedicated its lives not for ourselves but for others.
Our India, our territories are very extraordinary.
This country has gifted a lot of humanity.
A human being is going to be honored in Vatican City on October 13, which is a matter of pride for all of us.
On that day, Pope Francis is going to announce the St. Mary Thresia.
The unlimited contributions made by the Cyber Mary threshold in the last 50 years of age have been a reflection of the world.
I once again pay my homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the Indian diaspora for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world that when we are going to celebrate Gandhi 150, at the same time, 130 crore countrymen have resolved to completely shut down the use of single-use plastic.
The world's attention is now on India in the way India has played a leading role in environment conservation.
I firmly believe that you all will be involved in the campaign launched on 2nd October, Single Use Plastic.
People are contributing to this mission in different ways.
However, a young man from our country has started a campaign.
Her work attracts my vision and I have spoken to her and tried to know and understand her new plan.
Perhaps his words will help other people of the country.
It was new to me when I heard the plogging word for the first time.
Perhaps this word is used on a small scale abroad.
Hello, Ripudamani, I am Narendra Modi.
We will not only take care of our health but will also save our mothers.
I believe that our country will take 130 crore steps to build a single plastic free India by moving ahead in this direction.
Rippu Daman ji, thank you very much
My dear countrymen, the preparations for 2nd October are going on in India and across the globe, but we want to take Gandhi 150 towards the path of duty.
I want to sacrifice my life for the welfare of the country.
This is our dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, and that is why every year on 31st October, we are running for the unity of the country.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August, I had told the Red Fort that by 2022, you should visit 15 places in India.
Go to at least 15 places and try to stay there for a night.
You see India, understand it, feel it.
How variety we have.
On the occasion of Deepavali, whenever there is a vacation, all of you will be able to run, so I request you to visit the fifteenth place of India.
You will be happy to know that India has made a lot of progress in the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index and it has been possible only through your cooperation.
This has been possible, particularly because of the importance of running.
That is, we have moved ahead at this very moment, if we try more then we will be able to achieve a place in the entire world in the tourism sector before the completion of 75 years of independence.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of various festivals of this diverse India.
It must be seen that in the days of Diwali, there is no fire or damage to any person.
Happy once more.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
My dear countrymen, bow down to all of you
Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
Six days after Diwali, the Mahaprab Chhat is one of the most valuable festivals in our country.
Everything from food to sufficient quantity is celebrated with tradition.
Chat is completely associated with the unparalleled nature of worship and the worship of nature.
On the one hand, sun and water at the centre of worship of Lord Mahaprabhut, bamboo and soiled utensils and originals related to its worship.
Our lives are also an expression of the importance of cleanliness.
Before the dawn, along with rivers, ponds, ponds, shrines, shrines, shrines, shrines, ghats and ghats, all the people are united.
Surya Bandhan or Chhat Puja - Conservation of environment, Disease and Discipline
It is also advisable to follow the tradition of eating more than offerings that causes a menace of arrogance, which hinders the progress of the individual.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I am confident that Mann Ki Baat has tied up with the people of this country.
Take the examples of khadi and handloom.
You must be glad to hear that a single store in Khadi and Handloom has been sold so much.
During Deepavali, the sale of Khadi gift coupons has increased by six hundred and eight percent.
The fat deficit of khadi and handicrafts has shown an increase of nearly ninety percent this year as compared to last year.
It is being observed that today youngsters, elderly people, women, every age group likes mankind and handlooms.
I can imagine how much it benefits the families of the poor, the families of the poor and the families of the working class.
And we talked about Khadi for fashion, but in the last few years, I can say that after Khadi for Nation and Khadi for fashion, Khadi for Transformation is taking the place.
In the lives of the poorest of the poor, the handloom has become a powerful instrument to empower the poorest of the poor.
He's playing a big role for the villager.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt wrote in the Narendra Modi App that he would like to know about the experiences of my Diwali with the Defence Forces and he also wanted to know how the Defence Forces had laid down their lives.
Shriman Tejas Guhawad O Narendra Modi wrote the App - what can be done to bring our home sweetness to the defence forces
We also think of our brave defense forces.
We also think that our household sweets need to reach out to the jawans.
All of you must have spent the Diwali in a very horrific manner.
Deepavali has brought a special experience for me.
Once again, I am fortunate to celebrate Diwali with our brave defence forces.
This time, Deepavali with Defence Forces has become unforgettable for me in the Gujarat sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all the people of our defence forces for their commitment, dedication and sacrifice to protect our country by combating the difficult situation in the border.
Whenever we get an opportunity, we should know the experience of our soldiers and listen to their glory.
Many of us do not know that the voices of our defence forces are playing a vital role in peace in the entire world, not just on the borders.
They are bringing India to the world as a UN peacekeeping force.
A few days ago, on 24th October, the United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world.
The effort of the United Nations to establish peace in the world, everyone remembers the positive role.
And we follow the Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that is, the whole world is our family.
And for this belief, India has been actively contributing to the development of the United Nations.
You must know that the proposals of the Constitution of India and the proposals of the UN Charter were started by both the Wi-The People.
India has always emphasized on equal rights of women and live examples of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
In its opening remarks, it was proposed that the All-Main and Burn Free and Equal representatives of India, who were part of the Hong Kong Festival, are Al-Human Beijings and Burn Free and Equal.
Though it seems to be a very small change, we can see a healthy thought.
India's one of the most important contributions to the UN embrace is India's role in the peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations.
India has always played a major role in the UK peace and education mission.
There are many of you who know this information for the first time.
More than 3000 Defence Forces have contributed to the peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations.
At present, nearly seven thousand soldiers of India are connected with the peacekeeping programme of the United Nations and this is the third highest in the world.
By August 2017, nearly 50 of the world's sole peacekeeping efforts have contributed.
All these efforts are being carried out in different parts of the world including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
More than twenty thousand patients have been treated at the Indian Army Hospital in Kango and Southern Sudan and many have been saved.
India's defence forces have not only protected the people of the country but have also conquered peacekeeping forces.
Indian women have played a very important role in the peace process.
Very few people knew that India was the first country to send women police units to Liberia in the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations.
And see, this move of India has been inspired by all the countries since then.
After that, all the countries started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to know that India's role is not only for peacekeeping, but also for training the peacekeeping forces of 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers are sending messages of peace and prosperity to the world from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha.
The Peacekeeping Expedition is not possible at all.
Our security forces have to go to the inaccessible areas of the world.
They have to understand different situations and different cultures.
Remembering him, the hearts of the people of the country are filled with pride.
He was the only member of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, who was honoured by the Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji, one of the Indian Peacekeepers, who has also received a special recognition of his work in Cyprus.
In 1965, at the age of 72, he was appointed Commander of the Army in his campaign for Namibia, who served to ensure freedom of Namibia.
The former Chief of the Army Staff, Thimayya, led the United Nations Peacekeeping Force at Cyprus and laid down their lives in peace.
India is always sending messages of peace, unity and harmony to the world as ambassadors of peace.
Our belief, let us live a peaceful and prosperous life and move forward to build a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, this land of our reverence is immensely satisfying all such great men who have served humanity in their own righteousness.
Sister Nivedita, whoever we are well-being, revered by Bhagni Nivedita, is one of the greatest dignitaries.
Margaret Elizabeth was born on the British Airlines and later named him Swami Vivekananda Nivedita.
Nivedita means one who is fully dedicated.
He later proved his name as a perfect glory.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his happiness and happiness and dedicated his life to the poor.
Sister Nivedita was suffering from the atrocities of the British Raj.
The British tried to compel the Indians not only physically but also mentally.
Efforts have always been made to bring down our culture.
Bhagni Nivedita revived the Indian culture.
Inspired by national consciousness, awakened, helped people unite.
He turned around the world and became aware of the spread of Sanatan Dharma and philosophy.
The renowned nationalist Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati will be inspired by his distinguished poem Pudumai Penn, NewWomen and Nari Shakti.
It is said that Bhagni Nivedita was the source of inspiration for this.
The great scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose also helped him in many ways.
He also assisted in the publication and publicity of exams through his Lekhani and various conventions.
This wonderful co-production of our India where the spirituality and science of our culture is incomplete.
Sister Nivedita and Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose.
In 1899, Shaye Shaw fell into a humanitarian corner to see the catastrophe of the terrible plate in Mahanagari.
Sister Nivedita, ignoring her health, came forward in the campaign of Rastaghat, Nardama Safai.
This is the lady who gave up her lust for the poor and the weak.
Sister Nivedita, who has given everything to India.
Undoubtedly, this is the best truth.
This will be our recognition to this great personality - if every Indian follows the path of learning from his life and his displayed service.
Thank you for your phone.
First of all, I convey my best wishes to all the children on the occasion of the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the most important part of building a New India, the hero of the day.
Your anxiety is perfect and all the diseases that were seen in the past have been seen in the early days.
It's surprising that kids are hunting for diabetes today.
But now there has been a lot of change in our journey of life.
Nowadays these diseases are called lifestyle disorders.
The main reason for all these diseases in a young age is lack of physical labor and food habits.
It must be monitored by both the society and the family.
There should be no unusual or terrible change in this regard.
What is needed is to focus on small matters and to do it in their own habits.
I want people to be careful so that children can play open fields.
If possible, the elders of the family will also join them.
Children may be habituated to using stairs in the elevators.
After dinner, the whole family will walk with the kids.
Yoga will help in creating a healthy life habit of our youth and protecting them from lifestyledisorder.
Yoga is simple because Yoga can be taught in Yoga.
No specific equipment or land.
Several tests are underway for effective diabetes control.
AMS has also worked a lot in this regard and the results that have been received so far are very optimistic.
Ayurveda and Yoga should not only be considered as disease-free methods but also be a part of everyday life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have been happy with the world of sports in the last few days.
India is also happy with its badminton.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikanth has won the extraordinary play Denmark open and has honored every Indian.
After the opening of the Indonesian Open and Australian, it won its third superstar.
I congratulate this youngster for his success and for the glory of India.
Friends, FIFA Under-17 World Cup has been organized this month.
The teams from all over the world have come to India to participate in it and their sports complex has enjoyed us.
I also had a chance to see a match.
The audience was very enthusiastic.
The World Cup is a big event, where the world is watching you.
I was amazed at the enthusiasm, swelling and zeal of young players.
The World Cup has been successfully organised and all teams have shown their best wishes.
Even if India cannot win the elections, the players of India have won the hearts of all.
India and the entire world have enjoyed this festival and the entire soccer tornment was extremely charming for the soccer lovers.
The future of soccer is very bright and its forecast is available.
I once again convey my congratulations to all stakeholders, their colleagues and all sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, if I have to deal with the people in the future of 'Swachh Bharat', then I have to do Mann Ki Baat every day and discuss every aspect of 'Mann Ki Baat' cleanliness.
It is a matter of great pride for the youngsters to play a crucial role in their efforts.
There is an incident of innovation with cleanliness somewhere and somewhere the enthusiasm for the work of some officer becomes new.
A few days back, I got a big port where the Chandrapur Fort of Maharashtra has a description of its renovation.
The entire team of NGO, called Ecological Protection Organization, conducted a safai drive in the Chandrapur Fort.
They sent me two pictures before and after Safai.
I am surprised to see that those people who have been deprived of the environment of waste, filth and dirt can see the pictures of the Chandrapur Fort. I would like to tell them how the work, resolution, jealousy and livelihood of the youth of Ecologistic Programme Organisation have been demonstrated.
Your disappointment, unbelief will disappear from them.
This vibrant effort for cleanliness is a wonderful example of compassion, commitment and prosperity.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of all the people of the country to protect and preserve historical software.
I express my gratitude to all the employees of the Ecologist Protection Organization and to all the leaders of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak on 4th November.
Guru Nanakshu is not the first teacher of the Sikh community, he is a Jagadguru.
He spoke of the welfare of the entire human race, and said that it is equal to all nations and communities.
He stressed on women's self-respect and empowerment.
Guru Nanak Dev travelled 28 thousand kilometers and spread the message of humanity in this journey.
He interacted with the people on the path of honesty, sacrifice and work.
He didn't just say that he did his work in his own life.
He has started the launch and served the people.
Consumption of food at the vendor together will lead to unity and equity.
Guru Nanak has spoken of the three educators of a successful life, accumulate the name of Paramatma, be enjoying labour and help the troubled.
Guru Nanak had also written 'Guruvani' for his propaganda.
The 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak will be celebrated in 2019.
Come, let us try to live with his words and teachings.
My dear countrymen, and two days later on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel will be celebrated.
We all know that he had planned a modern India.
We can learn a lot from the wonderful life of this great son of India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had worked as a clue to India.
I had assured crores of Indians of one nation, one Constitution.
His contemplation gave him the power to cross all barriers.
He has set a goal and in full swing, he has moved ahead with that goal.
He said, "To make the nation live in a way, one who dreams of a nation where all people have equal rights."
I want Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to inspire us all the time.
He said that the diversity of the nation and the community cannot change, every woman and woman of India should define the future of love and harmony among the people.
Sardar Saheb's speech is still the inspiration and strength of our New India Vision.
And that is why his birthday will be celebrated as International Day of Unity.
The contributions of those who have made our country an integral part are incomplete.
On 31st October, Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary, the Run for Unity will be organised across the country where children, women, youth and elderly will be included.
I appeal to all of you to participate in the Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Diwali, you have returned to your daily routine with a new resolve and a new resolve.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for fulfilling their dreams.
What is the mind, September, 2017
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat through Akashwani.
Today it is the 36th phase.
Most of them encourage me.
And I will take you half an hour in a month, but the people will continue to talk about Mann Ki Baat on the 30th day of the month.
And that is why the government is also creating a simple idea of focusing on the sensitivity of the society.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of the countrymen, their thoughts and their feelings.
And maybe in such a short span of time I am very grateful to the countrymen for the opportunity that I have got to understand the feelings of the people of the country.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have often recalled that Acharya Vinoba Bhawan.
Acharya used to say frequently, unnecessary, effective.
I must believe that after three years, social scientists, universities, researchers and media experts will definitely analyze this.
Keep up the plus-minus of every thing, and I believe that in the future, this analysis will be very useful for Mann Ki Baat, a new consciousness, a new dimension.
And when I had once said in Mann Ki Baat, we should think of eating as much as we need, we will not waste it.
But then I have seen that so many letters have come from every corner of the country, so many social organizations and numerous nuances have been doing this thing since time.
And then I have seen how many people have come forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Once I see a selfie with a five-head selfie with a doctor in Haryana and keep it in front of everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only from India but also from around the world, a big campaign of selfie with doctor has started.
A few days ago, I had a meeting with the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
Send photographs where you have visited in the Incredible I India.
Millions of images from every corner of India have become one of the biggest resources of those who work in the field of tourism.
I have felt that how small events have created a big movement in Mann Ki Baat
Today, because when I think it's been three years, how many incidents of the last three years have gathered in my mind.
The country is moving ahead in the right direction.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the betterment of the society and for the betterment of the country.
In my three-year journey to Mann Ki Baat, I have learnt it from the countrymen, I have learnt it.
For any country this is a big source of wealth, a big power.
And I have seen that there has been a lot of attraction for the farms and I have naturally said that no one has to go to the farm.
But there are so many fabrics, why not eat it
There may be a house cover, a room, a curtain, and it seems that the attraction of the trench has increased among the young people.
The sale of farms has increased and there is a direct link between the poor.
2-October, the farm is released, so much is left.
Once again I would like to say that we should take forward the campaign for Khadi.
We are working with the idea of bringing lamps in the households of the poor.
The poor people of our country will get one strength from this work and we should do it.
And to enhance the interest of this farm, the enthusiasts of the farm sector and the people associated with the farming of the Government of India are encouraging to think in a new way.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase productivity, how to bring solar power and handicrafts
How to revive the old heritage that had been closed for about 20, 25, 30 years
A Khadi Ashram at Sewapur, Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh was closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
Various methods have been added.
Many people have got new employment opportunities.
The Khadi and Village Industries Training Centre, which is closed in Kashmir Pompore, has been resumed and Kashmir has a lot to do with it.
Now this training centre has helped build new generations, build new things, build new things and I am happy that the gifts given by the big corporate houses to Deepawali have started giving them farming.
People are also giving gifts to each other.
All of us are feeling the way things go ahead easily.
My dear countrymen, last month we all made a solemn pledge in Mann Ki Baat and we decided that we will celebrate the 15th day of Gandhi Jayanti across the country.
We will connect people with cleanliness.
Our honourable President has started this work and the country is connected to it.
Everyone has become a part of Swachhta Abhiyan.
When I talk of resolution resolutions, we can see how our Swachhta Abhiyan is progressing on the path of resolution resolution.
I've noticed that some people are doing their jobs.
This time we have seen one more thing - first of all, we will clear one place, secondly, it may be that we will not disintegrate anywhere in a conscious way, but if we have to make cleanliness a habit then we need a diversified change in our judicial system.
Now a lot of competitions were organized in the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign.
More than 1. 25 crore children participated in the competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of children have been painted.
They have painted their own imagination of cleanliness.
Whenever there is talk of cleanliness, I never forget to express my gratitude to the people of publicity.
Our country's electronic media, print media, how much service can be done in the country, we have seen it in the Swachhata Hi Seva movement.
Recently, a few days back, someone has attracted my attention to the 18-year-old Youth Bilal Dar of Srinagar.
Since the age of 12-13, the last 5-6 years, Bilal has been working on cleanliness.
Plastics, polythenes, utilized bottles, dust wastes are also cleaned by the biggest lake in Asia near Srinagar.
I am glad that only Brand Ambassador has not been created by Pranigam Bilal, they have given Bilal a car, a uniform, Bilal is also educating and inspiring the people of other areas about cleanliness, inspiring them and without getting the expected results.
At the age of Bilal Dar, those who are interested in cleanliness are inspiring.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we have to admit that the history of the future is born in the womb of history and when we talk of history, it is natural to remember the great men.
The month of October is the month of remembering many of our great men.
Sardar Patel from Mahatma Gandhi was born in October this month, who led us in the 21st century and 21st century, showed us the path of walking and suffered many hardships for the country.
When the former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalamji spoke to the youth, he often talked about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh.
In a deep sense, he mentioned the programme and he himself went to the village to witness the work of Nanaji.
Remembering all these great men, we remember them so that they can find a way forward so that they can get the right direction for the future.
I will definitely talk about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
We are very simple - unity in diversity is India's specialty.
We are proud of diversity, and do we ever try to realize that diversity of ourselves
I want to tell all my countrymen in Hindustan, especially my youngsters, that we are in a waking condition.
Feel the diversity of India, touch it, enjoy its glory.
This diversity of our country plays an important role in the development of your inner personality.
You go abroad, I have no objection, but sometimes you will see your home too
People of North India don't know what is in South India
The people of western India don't know what is there in the East India
Our country is full of diversity.
When everybody visited India, everybody like Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, there was a new inspiration for the country to see and understand the country.
These great men have seen this country roaming very widely.
They tried to know and understand India in the beginning of their work.
He tried to make India self-reliant.
Can we also not understand the rules of different states, different societies or groups of our country, traditions, clothing, eating and drinking as a student
The value addition in tourism will be only when we are not just an audience, we will be able to take, understand and embrace the specialty of all those places like a student.
I got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of my own Hindustan.
More than four and a half districts have also experienced night stay.
Today, when I am taking this responsibility of the country, the experience of that journey is very useful for me.
That's why I have a lot of advantages to understand.
My request to you is that in this huge India, unity of diversity is not just a slogan but also acknowledge this vision of our energy.
It will not be repeated if a single meal is eaten every day for the entire life.
This is the power of our tourism.
I would like you to leave this vacation only for a while to go out of your house and for a bit of change.
Your anxiety will be great.
What could be a bigger teacher than an acquaintance
Ordinarily, from October to March, the time is commendable for tourism.
If you meet the people there, send them photographs.
Not only the architecture but also the natural beauty, but also the lives of the people there.
Please send all the good documents on your leave to MyGov and send them to Narendra Modi App.
I have seen one thing that if you want to know about the seven best tourist destinations in your own state for the development of tourism industry of India, every Indian should know about these seven things in his state.
If possible, we have to go to the seven places.
Can you give me any information about this
You see, if everyone in the same state sends these information, then I will tell the government to scrutinize them and make a publicity about the seven common issues that have come from every state.
This means how to improve tourist destinations from the perspective of a person
Similarly, the seven things that you have seen in the entire country, you want someone or someone else to visit it, if you need to know about it, you must send the names of seven such places in MyGov, NarendraModiApp.
The Government of India will work on this.
The government will accept your decision to create a film, create a video, create a publicity literature and give a befitting reply to a question.
Come, join me.
You can also be a major blow to the improvement of tourism from October to March.
I'm inviting you.
My dear countrymen, because of being a man, a lot of things touch my mind and make my mind stiff.
I feel deeply impressed.
Because I'm a man like you.
A few days back, maybe your vision has been drawn - the countrymen have seen a wonderful example of women power and patriotism.
The Indian Army has got two brave men named Lieutenant Swati and Nidhi. They are immense bravery.
This is extraordinary because we had been martyred to serve our mother and sister.
We can imagine how the world's destructive when it's young
But the martyr colonel, Santosh Mahavira's wife Swati Mahadik fought against this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He laboured hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to fulfil his dream of his husband.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey, his husband, Mukesh Dubey, worked as a hero in the army and when he was martyred for the motherland, he decided in his mind and he also joined the army.
It is natural for every countrymen to respect our women and our brave hearts.
I convey my best wishes to these two sisters.
They have created a new inspiration, a new consciousness for crores of people of the country.
Many congratulations to the two sisters.
My dear countrymen, this time between Navratri festival and Deepawali is a great opportunity for the youth of our country.
The World Cup of FIFA under-17 is happening here.
I believe we can hear soccer buzz in the west.
Every generation will be attracted to the soccer.
There will be no school-college field in India where our youngsters will not be able to play soccer.
Come, when the entire world is playing on the soil of India, we will also make this game a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
My mother's Durga's time.
The entire atmosphere is filled with auspicious fragrance.
I convey my best wishes to the countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Navratri. May our country scale new heights of success towards fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the common man of the country.
Let the nation come to the ability to deal with every challenge.
May the country progress at a rapid pace, and in the 75 years of India's independence in 2022, we have started our journey by creating a road map of five years to realize the dreams of the freedom fighters, the dreams of 125 crore countrymen, the hard work, the hard work and the dreams of the countrymen. Give us our blessings.
I'm glad you all are so happy.
Celebrate the festival. Encourage your enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2017
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who is dedicated to the unity of the country.
Our ancestors from ancient times have been linked to our lives with the values of non-violence and harmony.
Ohimasa Param Dharma, we have heard it from our childhood.
I also told the Red Fort that violence will not be slaughtered in the name of trust, it can be communal belief, belief in political ideology or belief in any tradition - violence will not be slaughtered in any way.
Nobody has the right to take the law in the name of trust.
Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar has ensured that every person has access to the Constitution.
I want to assure the countrymen that the government or the country will not force anybody, individual or community, whoever goes on the path of violence against those who have taken the law.
Everyone has to be condemned to the law, the law will judge him and the culprit will have to be punished.
Even our festivals are full of diversity.
Many of our festivals are directly linked to farmers and fishermen brothers and sisters.
Today, I am talking about the festival, so first of all I want to tell you 'Millami Dukkadam'.
Yesterday, the Sambasari festival of the Jain community was celebrated.
Fisheries are celebrated in the month of Bhadra in the Jain community.
Festivals to forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
And it is also called the festival of forgiveness and on this day there is a tradition of conveying our best wishes to each other as 'Millami Dukkadam'.
Besides, our class is the land of forgiveness, bravery and forgiveness.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great enthusiasm and fervour throughout India.
And when Ganesh Chaturthi was spoken, it was natural for the masses to come together.
This great festival of Ganesh Chaturthi lasted for 10 days.
And we know this great man as a symbol of unity, equality and sanctity.
I convey my best wishes to every countrymen on this occasion.
Now the 'Onam' festival is going on in Kerala.
Omn is one of the most important festivals of India.
This festival is special for its social and cultural importance.
Omna Festival reminds us of the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
And now this festival has become a center of attraction for tourism.
Besides, I would like to tell the countrymen that like Gujarat's Navratri Festival or the Durga Festival of the West Champaran, it has become the main attraction of tourism today.
There is a lot of opportunity to attract foreigners in other festivals of our country.
We have to think about what steps we can take in the coming days.
Id-ul-uha will flee after a while in this festival.
Congratulations and good wishes of Id-ul-uha to all the countrymen
Our family is connected with festivals and cleanliness in an organic way.
Festival preparations begin with cleanliness.
It is not new, but it is very important to transform cleanliness in a social way.
Cleanliness as a people is not only in our homes but in every village, in every city, in our state, in our country and in our country, this cleanliness and festival has to be accomplished.
My dear countrymen, modernisation is changing.
Nowadays it's a new dimension, a new parameter.
You will be able to see in YouTube, today the children are making idols of Ganesh with soil at home.
Three years ago, the Swachhta Abhiyan that we launched was completed by 2nd October.
At a time, the officers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanarai, Banaskanth district of Gujarat have taken up the entire work of safari and sanitation of 22 temples and 3 mosques affected by floods.
If this effort for cleanliness becomes a permanent part of our nature, then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I appeal to you that once again, on October 15-20th of Gandhi Jayanti, I start the campaign for Swachhata Hi Seva, just as it was said earlier, 'Jal Sewai Prabhu Seva' and 'Swachhata Hi Seva'.
We have created an environment of cleanliness across the country.
And whenever we get the opportunity, we find and use the opportunity.
Please work.
Work together on a holiday or on Sundays.
Go to the neighbourhood areas, go to the nearby villages, give it a shape.
I apply to all the NGOs, schools, colleges, social-cultural political leaders, government officials, collectors and panchayat chiefs, on 2nd October, 2019, we have created a clean environment before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, so that the India of Gandhiji's dream is realised.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Mygov.
In-A has created a department where after the toilets have been constructed, you can list your name and the name of the family you have helped in this work.
Friends of my social media can play a creative campaign in the virtual world that can be really inspiring.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation can organise a short film and photograph competition under Swachh Sankalp to Swachh Siddhi.
You can write contacts in different languages and there is no specific age limit for this competition.
Out of the participants, three will be selected at the district level and three at the state level.
I appeal to you that you can participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan in such a way.
Certainly take some steps for cleanliness.
Millions and millions of people send messages or phone calls through letters, send a message that I have a sufficient receipt and rare asset.
This is a great opportunity for me to understand the thoughts and minds of the people of the country.
I am waiting for you more than the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I wait for you because I can learn a lot from you.
I try to see, hear, read and know as much as you can.
"Prime Minister, I am calling from Pune.
I want to tell you about one of my friends.
He's always trying to help people, but he's got a bad feeling I'm surprised to see.
I was dying with him to buy it once.
I saw that he bought a two-thousand bucks sari and spent Rs.450 for the pizza.
In order to go to Mal, he has spent a long time with the automobile for five rupees.
He did the same thing while buying vegetables on the way back and saved four-five.
I was so bad.
We spend a lot of money in big shops, but we dont believe in how much money we spend with our hardworking brothers and sisters.
"My belief, after listening to this phone call, you were not just aware, you decided not to make such a mistake.
Do you not think that whenever someone comes to sell things around our homes, comes to ferry, we work with a small shopkeeper, a subscriber, sometimes with auto-rickshaws. Whenever we work with a person, we are comfortable.
And when a person like us goes to a big restaurant to eat food then don't see what is written on the bill, I'll get the money out immediately.
Not only this, I don't care if I buy sarees in the showroom, but don't leave if I work with a poor person.
There will be no guarantee in your life for Rs. 2 and Rs. 5.
Madam, I'm grateful to you, you've given me a message with such a heart-breaking call.
I believe that if my countrymen have the habit of doing this with the poor, they will definitely abandon it.
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the entire country celebrates National Sports Day.
This day is the birth anniversary of great hockey player and wizard Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to the Holi is unparalleled.
I remember this because I want to connect with the new generation of sports in our country.
Let sports become part of our lives.
If we are the fastest nation in the world, we should also watch this in the field of sports.
Play is physical fitness, mental alternates, personality enhancement.
It's an excellent call to reconnect the sportsman's heart.
May the young generation of our country come forward in the field of sports and today I would like to be aware of the fact that the flying field is more important than the plate-state.
Play on the computer but also showcase the football outside.
Perhaps it's a computer, but it's a different joy to play under the sky in the open field.
Today, the situation is such that the kids start watching a cartoon movie in a corner of their homes, or they get into a mobile game, and then they have to scream and say - when are you going out
Time changes, she was a time when she told her son when you'd come and today it's been like telling Mom, Dad, when will you go out
Young friends, the Ministry of Sports has created a Sports Talent Survey (STS) portal for exploring and developing sports talents where a child from all over the country has a talent in the sports sector, he can upload his biodiversity or video on this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to Selected Emerging Players and the Ministry is launching it tomorrow.
It is a matter of great pleasure for our youngsters that the Seventeenth World Cup will be organised in India from October 6-28.
Twenty-four teams of the world are making India their homes.
Welcome to our young guests from all over the world, let us enjoy sports and create a suitable environment in the country.
When I talk about sports today, it is reminded that last week's interactions will be shared with the countrymen.
I had the opportunity to meet some young girls and some of them were born in the Himalayas, who never had any connection with the sea.
Six daughters of our country who work in Navy, their emotions will inspire us all.
These six daughters will carry a small boat carrying IN-NS Tarini and pass through the sea.
The campaign has been named Nabika Sagar Parikrama and they will reach India within a few months after travelling around the world.
Sometimes it'll be in water forty days.
Sometimes we will spend 30 days in water together.
Between the waves of the sea, our brave six daughters, and this is the first thing in the world.
No Indian will be proud of our daughters
I quote the feelings of these girls and I told them to share their thoughts with the entire country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their thinking on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read them.
Because it will be a matter of courage, it will be a matter of self-confidence, and I am glad to bring these girls to you.
My best wishes to these daughters, the blessings of the waves.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September, we all celebrate 'Teach Day'.
The birth anniversary of Dr Radhakrishnan ji, the former President of our country.
He was the President, but for the whole of his life he made himself a teacher.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was a dedicated life to education.
The great quality of a teacher is to awaken the emotions of creation among his students and to enjoy knowledge.
Can I start a campaign in a mission mode
When we talk of transformation in our country, the way we remember the mothers of the family, similarly we will remember the role of teachers in the society.
Teachers have a big role in transformation.
Every teacher has a transformation technologies in his life.
It will play a very important role in transformation of the country.
Let us move forward with this mantra of 'Teach to Transform'.
My name is Dr. Abhima.
I am associated with the residents of Mumbai and the Indian Research Centre of Howard University.
The scheme was started with a dream that had taken place on 28th of 2014.
Yesterday, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will complete three years on 28th August.
30 crore Indians participated in this scheme and opened their first bank account.
The number of new accountants is more than the population of many countries in the world.
If you have money at home or in a pocket, you'll have to pay for it.
65,000 crore has been deposited in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
Those who have opened their accounts in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana have also got the facility of insurance.
The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, has created a new confidence in the lives of the poor.
When the poorest of the poor fell in a large number of families - the head of the family has died, the benefit of this premium is getting two lakh rupees.
The encouraging results of Jan Dhan Yojana, Rupay Card, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and the benefits of the common man for insurance have been conveyed to me.
My dear countrymen, let me tell you, Michami Dokkadam
What is your mind, July 2017
The heart of the people is such that the monsoon is very happy for the people.
Animals, birds, animals, animals, nature, everyone is happy with the arrival of rains.
But sometimes when the monsoon takes a terrible form, it can be understood as to how vulnerable water is.
Nature is our lifelong leader, our native, but sometimes floods, natural calamities like earthquakes, their terrible forms are enormous.
The changes in the climate change and environment have a negative impact.
Over the past few days, natural hazards have been caused due to heavy rains in some parts of India, particularly in Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal.
The flooded area is under observation.
It's getting a lot of rescue.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers are on their way.
The State Government is doing its best to help the flooded people in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations, citizens wishing to do serving work are making every effort to reach out to the people in this situation.
It has an impact on agriculture, animals, infrastructure, electricity and connectivity.
In particular, for the loss of farming and farming of our farmer brothers, we have formulated a scheme to facilitate farm insurance companies, in addition to insurance companies, so that the claimsettelement of farmers can be done very quickly.
People are talking about their duration.
Prior to the rainy season, most of the mock drills were made and the entire government programme was formulated.
NDRF's team was appointed.
Gradually, we have created us in such a way that we will do our job in accordance with the forecast of the year so that we can get rid of the losses.
Whenever I am ready for Mann Ki Baat, I see the citizens of my country more than me.
Now there's so many letters with GST, so many phone calls, and people are still happy with GST, asking questions.
I would like to tell you, "Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am calling Neetu Gorg from Gurgaon.
I am very impressed with your speech on Chartered Accountant Day.
This is the reason in our country that the Goods and Service Tax-GST has started in the last few days.
I want to hear your opinion about this.
Thank you.
It's almost a month since the GST was started and the results are visible.
And I am glad that whenever a poor man writes a letter, how the prices of the poorest of the poor have been reduced for GST, how things have become cheaper
Anyone living in the forests, north-eastern and far-flung mountains, informs us that earlier I was afraid that what would happen, but now when I learn and understand it, I feel that the work has become very easy from the past.
Business has become very simple.
And the biggest thing is that the confidence of the consumers is increasing.
Now I can see how the GST has been affected by the transportation and logistics sector.
How the truck has grown.
As a result, there is a strong smooth transition in which there is a strong migration, a new registration and this has created a new faith across the country.
And sometimes, sometimes, some politicians, politicians, politicians of management, teachers, researchers and researchers will certainly make use of GST in India as a model for the world.
This will become a Case Study for various universities of the world.
It is a testimony to the success of such a massive transformation in such a large measure that the contribution of such a large number of millions of people can be made in such a large country.
The world must be researching about this.
GST has been used, every kingdom has participated in it, every state has its responsibility.
All decisions have been taken in conjunction with all the States and Centres.
And this is the primary goal of every government that there is no pressure on the poor for GST.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the departments, departments, central and state government employees associated with this work.
GST is one of the best examples of India's success.
It's a predictable experience.
This is a social reform campaign.
I once again bow down to crores of countrymen for such a great effort.
My dear countrymen, August is 48 months.
Yusuf Meher Ali.
What happened to our new generation window on 9th August 1942
Our descriptions in the history leaflets inspire us to build a better India, how much they had to understand and tolerate for their self-reliance from 1857 to 1942.
This was the time when every corner of Hindustan, everywhere in every corner of the city, everywhere in the village, educated, educated, rich and marginalized, all the people joined hands and joined hands to join the uit India Movement.
Lacs of Indians dedicated their lives to the mantra of 'Karenge Ye Morange' to the cause of Mahatma Gandhi.
On 9th August, when Mahatma Gandhi called upon all the great leaders of the United Kingdom, Dr.
Lohia, the leaders of the second generation of Jaiprakash Narayan.
Mahatma Gandhis two distinctive approaches in the 1920 'Assistance Movement' and the 1942 uit India Movement.
The unprotected face was similar, followed by the situation in 42, the intensity of the movement increased so much that even the great men like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karange Yamarange'.
Behind all these successes were the people's problems, people's rights, people's problems and the masses.
The whole country fought together that day.
I sometimes feel that the first freedom struggle of India was celebrated in 1857.
The war that began in 1857, till 1942, has moved to some or the other end of the country and in this long period, it has given rise to a strong demand for freedom for the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone is committed to do something or the other.
Generations have changed, but the intensity of their resolve has not yet changed.
A group of people have come, they have joined the struggle, they have joined the same struggle. And they have tried their best for the freedom of the British empire.
From 1855 to 1942, this effort has brought the movement to such a level that it has reached a very high level in 1942 and the poisoning of Bharatchhado is wasted in such a way that it can lead to the British in 1942.
Between 1857 and 1942, freedom struggle came to the people of every country and from 1942 to 1942, this five-year resolution was the reason for the country's independence in the five decisive years.
These five years were the roots.
Now I want to connect you with this process.
We're free in 1947 and today's 2017.
It's almost 70 years.
The government has arrived.
Policies have been formulated, changed, improved.
Everyone has worked on their own for the country's problems free.
Efforts are being made to increase the income of the common man in the country, to remove poverty.
There's hope.
We will celebrate the 15th of August of 2017 as the beginning of our resolve and we will fulfil the resolve of 75 years of independence in 2022.
From 1942 to 1965, as the country's independence was decisive, from 2017 to 2022, these five years could become the decisive year of India's future.
After five years, we will celebrate 75 years of independence.
A vision that we shall mark in the next five years.
Please come forward with new ideas like Video Post, Blog, Registration.
This movement has to be transformed into a mass movement.
uit India uiz will be organised for young friends in the Narendra Modi App.
The uiz competition is an effort to familiarize the youth of the country with the vision of the heroes of the country's glorious history and freedom struggle.
I am glad that I have received a lot of proposals from every corner of the country regarding what should be said in the last three years as on 15th August, the main objective of these projects is to make their dreams sound.
On 15th August, I will try to discuss these proposals as much as I can.
I'll finish it in 40-45 or 50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I talk about one more thing today.
Socio-economic interactions with India's economy in a more intense manner.
It should never be eaten.
Our festivals are not just for pleasure.
Our festivals and festivals are actually a campaign for social reforms and connected with each of our festivals directly to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
A few days later, after Rakhi Bandhan, Janmashtami, Chauth Chandra, Anantachandra, Durga Puja, Deepawali etc. , there will be one after the other and the poor will get some opportunity to earn money.
There is also a simple natural joy with all this.
A few months before the marriage, hundreds of families have been engaged in small businesses.
Suti, silk potatoes have a variety of conservations, and today people prefer hommade.
Thousands of businessmen are connected to a festival like Raksha Mantri, Sweet Businessmen.
But Deepavali is directly linked to all those poor families.
Today, when I talk about the economy of the poor, the festivals and the people associated with it, I also want to talk about the environment.
Sometimes I feel that the people of India are more aware and active than me and I have realized that.
Citizens have written letters to me about the sensitivity last month.
They have appealed to me that at the same time, I would like to talk about eco-friendly Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturthi so that the people like earth-made Ganesh.
Lokmanya Tilak started this great tradition this year, the 125th year of the Ganesh festival.
125th year and 125 crore countrymen.
Lokmanya Tilak Ganesh Festival was organised in front of the idea of social unity, aware society and social reform.
Come, let us also remember him and organize competitions, discussions etc. during the Ganesh festival this year.
Come, let us connect this festival with the economy of the poor, let us enjoy the joy of our festivals as a financing festival for the poor.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the future generations.
My dear countrymen, we have consistently seen that be it education, economic sector, social sector or sports, our daughters are emerging from the country and are reaching the top of new success.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters, we are honoured for them.
A few days ago, our women showed extraordinary satisfaction in the films of women.
This week, I had the opportunity to meet these playing girls.
They had a mark on their faces.
I told all those girls that I had a different valuation.
I have seen that if the sportspersons of India are fascinating then the anger of the countrymen will also come after the players.
Some people say something that breaks humiliation and gives things that are very painful.
Not all of this, the girls enumerated their virtues, honored them.
I have seen a beautiful change in this thing and I have told these girls that you see, this is only fortunate for you and you people should remove this thing from your mind.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won the hearts of 125 crore countrymen.
Indeed, the youth of our country, apart from our daughters, are doing a lot to brighten the name of the country.
My dear countrymen, once again I want to remind you of the August movement.
May every countrymen take a path of five years to fulfill their resolve.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
Let us move forward with this belief that the fate of the country and the future of the country will continue to be more effective.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2017
The weather is changing.
It was too hot this time.
But fortunately, the rainy season has been following its footprints.
Rainfall has started in some parts of the country.
It feels comfortable with the heat of the previous day in the cold weather after the rains.
We all have seen that as much excitement or anxiety remains in personal life or in public life, rain comes but gives us mental stability.
Today, the rath yatra of Lord Jagannath Dev in different parts of the country is very encouraging and happy.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated in some other places of the world.
The poor people of the country are specially associated with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
Very few people know that there is a word in English which means a beautiful chariot whose speed cannot be stopped.
Ironically, this word has come from Jagannathadeva.
This means that the people of the world have accepted the importance of this journey of Jagannath in their own way.
My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.
Come, let us all take the country forward by inspiring us from this festival.
In the month of Ramzan, I came to know about a very inspiring incident in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In this small village, he spent nearly half a thousand Muslim brothers and sisters living in this village, and most of them are from Muslim families.
In this month of Ramzan, everyone in the village decided to make toilets together.
17 lakhs have been provided to the government for making personal toilets.
You will be happy to hear and will be surprised to know that in this holy month of Ramzan, the British brothers and sisters returned the government's 17 lakh rupees.
These 17 lakhs will be spent on other services.
I thank all the villagers of Mubarakpur on this auspicious occasion of Ramzan.
Everything is very inspiring.
The biggest thing is that they have made Mubarakpur an open defecation-free place.
We know that three states - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration and people of this state for fulfilling this task.
We are well aware that we have to work hard to do something good in personal life or social life.
If my hand's writing is bad, I've been trying to fix it for a long time.
This is how the physical and mental condition changes.
That's how clean it is.
Some bad habits have become our habit.
Everybody has to draw attention.
We will also recall the inspiring events.
I am glad that cleanliness is no longer a government programme.
It is taking the form of a common man in the society.
When the people associated with the administration take this step forward with the participation of the people, the strength increases naturally.
I remember a good thing last day that I want to tell you.
This is the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
Their objective was to construct 777 villages and 5000 families in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the work of constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours has been completed by the local administration.
77 thousand villages have been defecated in unmanned places.
In-A, through letters, all these suggestions come in AIR.
It is important to be aware of democracy and therefore to recall the incidents that hit democracy and encourage goodwill for democracy.
25th June, 1977 is such a black day that no Indian can forget democracy.
The entire country was jailed in one way.
The voices of the opposition were buried.
The great leaders of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were jailed.
The system of justice hasn't been excluded from the necessity.
The newspaper was totally useless.
Students from todays journalistic world, people working on democracy also recalled the black day and are constantly striving to increase awareness about democracy.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also jailed at that time.
Atal ji wrote a poem on the occasion of Emergency Year, which describes the mental state of his time.
We have to strengthen this heritage.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud of the world today.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world was together.
People from the sea to the mountain welcomed the ray of sunrise through yoga morning and evening.
Is there any Indian who will not be proud of it
This was not the case before, but today when Yoga has been tied up in the form of Yoga, Yoga has become the cause of the world.
Almost all the countries of the world have made this Yoga audience their own.
On the one hand, where the Great Wall of China has been manned in China, on the other hand, the World Heritage Site at Peru, about 2,400 meters above sea level, has been serving in Machupithu.
The Eiffel Tower in France has been displayed.
More than four thousand people have joined the United Arab Emirates Abu Dhabi.
India-Afghan Friendship Dam has contributed a new dimension of friendship to India in the heart of Afghanistan.
In a small country like Singapore, there have been seventy places and they have conducted a campaign throughout the week.
The United Nations released 10 postage stamps on International Day of Yoga.
Yoga experts have been employed in the United Nations Headquarters.
Employees from the United Nations, all over the world, participated in this.
Once again, Yoga has created a world record.
Nearly fifty thousand people joined together in Ahmedabad and created a new world record.
I also have the opportunity to participate in Yoga celebrations in Lucknow.
But for the first time, I am fortunate to join the rain.
Our soldiers have also practiced the Siachens that are at a temperature of twenty, fifty and forty degrees.
Whether it is our Armed Forces, BSF, IT-B-P, C-R-P-F-Hoh, CI-SF, everybody has participated in their work as well.
On this occasion, I had said that three generations, since it was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that the three generations of the family should join together and share their photos.
Some television channels have taken this forward.
I've got a lot of photographs in this regard, some of these are selected photographs and are kept in the Narendra Modi app.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to visit a very dear place.
For a few days in Kerala, the PENPONICE FOUNDICAR FOUNDICAL FOR THE REDING DAY, REDING MANTH is being celebrated.
I had an opportunity to go to the dais and I was told there that we didn't blossom the flowers, we gave them books.
My good guy.
Now, I also remember the fact that I got out of the center of attention.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a system in the government that we wouldn't give up, we'll give up or welcome to Rumal.
He's gonna be rubbing the trench so that he's in the trench.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this was the habit of everyone, but after coming here, my habit goes away.
But he went to Kerala and woke up again.
And I've been giving the government a note again about this.
We can gradually create a habit.
Flowers are very low.
I have to take it once.
But if I give a book, it becomes a part of the house and becomes a family member.
I went to London, the ueen of Britain, ueen Elizabeth invited me.
How many years have passed and how many ueen Elizabeth took care of Mahatma Gandhi.
And I was very happy to go.
I don't know if he wanted me to touch it once.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
I believe that these habits don't change night and sometimes they have to be critical.
But still such a thing should be highlighted, let's try.
Now I can't say that I went somewhere and somebody picked up flowers, then I won't tell him, I can't do it.
But anyway, there will be a review, but the conversation should continue, it will change gradually.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work has been done in terms of being the Prime Minister.
I have to drown in the files, but I have created a habit of myself, I have received some letters from all the letters that I have received and there is an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different kinds of people wrote letters.
I think you read a letter like this.
He has written a letter from a housewife Arulmozhi, a resident of Tamil Nadu in the south.
What is being written in that letter - I am talking about dealing with my world, doing something to handle children's education so that there is some financial support in the society.
Likewise, I started the Mudra Yojana by lending some of the banks and buying some goods from the market.
In the meantime, the government has initiated a system called Government e-Marketplace.
So I'm registering myself in the search system.
Anyone who wants to supply any goods to the government, electric power, dustbin supply, brooms, chairs, tables, you can register whatever you want to sell.
He wrote, First of all, I got out of the 'Mudra Yojana' and started my business, after which I had registered all my sales goods in E-GEM, then I received orders from the Prime Minister's Office, PMO.
It was also an unknown news to me, I wanted to know what the PMO wanted to buy
He said he bought the dung thermos and got 1600 pamphlets.
Yeah, that's Empowerment.
It has transparency, emergence, enterpriseship along with it.
Government-Marketplace- GEM.
I want those who want to sell something to the government, their numbers continue to grow.
I understand that this is an unparalleled example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance and its goals are MinimumPrice and Maximumese, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, as we can proud of Yoga, we can also be proud of the success of the Space Science.
This is India's specialty, Yoga has spread to our country and it is also our country's remote space mission.
India has shown many successes in sports and science.
Today, India is not only on the ground but also on the strength of its success.
These two days back, ISRO has launched 30 nanosatalites with cartosat-2009 satellites.
Apart from India, 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and USA have joined these satellites.
And from these nano satellites of India, there will be plenty of useful information in the field of farming and forecasting of natural calories.
A few days ago, we all remember that ISRO has successfully launched the GSAT-19.
Just imagine how big our scientists have achieved in space research.
On June 19th, a thousand days of Mars Mission.
You all remember that for this Mars mission we were successfully established in Forbit and the period was fixed for six months.
It was six months old.
But did our scientists have an extraordinary skill that crossed a thousand days after six months.
Our scientific journey of completing one thousand days is leading to greater success in our space research.
Our younger generations are brightening the nation with their skills and their physical capabilities in the field of education as well as sports.
This is the day when Kidambi Championships played by India's badminton in Indonesia and Spain have enhanced the respect of the country.
I congratulate the retired Srikanth and his coach.
T.
Sports persons play a vital role in development.
Sports play a vital role in the development of all individuals.
There's no replacement in the country.
If the family's boys and girls are hungry for sports, they should be executed.
Once again, the countrymen, the rainy season, the festival of festivals are celebrated in a way.
What is your mind, May 2017
Today, when I talk to you, the Holy Ramzan month has started.
In the Holy month of Ramadan, I extend my heartiest congratulations to all the people of the world, especially the people of the Muslim community in this holy month.
During Ramzan, special emphasis is given to prayers, spirituality and grace.
We Hindustanis are very fortunate that our ancestors have created a tradition that can proudly proud the Indians.
We can immensely proud of the hundred and fifty crore countrymen in India that all sections of the world are present.
It is a nation that believes in God or Nathik, who fulfils the idols or those who pursue idolatry, all kinds of thoughts, all kinds of worshipping methods and all kinds of traditions, who have strived to live together.
Whether it is religion, community, ideology or tradition, it gives us one message - peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan will help in furthering this stream of peace, unity and harmony.
I once again convey my best wishes.
Last time when I had spoken about Mann Ki Baat, I had a word, especially the youngsters told them to do something new, to come out of the comfort zone with a new experience.
And this is the age of survival - a bit of risk, a bit of toughness.
I'm glad many people gave me feedback.
Personally, everyone encouraged me to talk to me.
There's so many messages that I can't get all down, I can't even hear the message sent to everyone.
But I have seen in my sight that somebody is trying to learn songs, somebody is listening to new musical instruments, somebody is trying to learn new things using U-Tube, somebody is trying to learn new languages, somebody is learning cooking, somebody is learning dancing, somebody has learned drama, somebody has started writing poetry.
My teaching habits were almost closed.
That's why I tried to read this vacation.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much struggle we had to do for the freedom of India, how many freedom fighters had spent years in prison.
Bhagat Singh, who has done a lot at an early age, has inspired me from his life.
That is why I request you to talk about this in today's era.
I am glad that today's youth are expressing their desire to know about our history, our freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives for our country.
I went to Andaman and Nicobar many years ago.
I went to see Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar sat in jail and wrote Manji Janmath.
Writing poetry on the prison wall.
He was shut down in a small house.
How hard it was for freedom.
I am inspired to see the Cellular Prison when I read the book "Manji Birthday" of Savarkar ji.
There's a light and sound show that's inspiring.
There is no such state in Hindustan, no language speaking people who did not enjoy Kalapani for the sake of freedom, even in Andaman jail.
You must visit the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, the first Monday of June 5th.
And this year the theme of the United Nations is ' Connecting People to Nature ' .
In other words back to basics .
And someone else said better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi has said many times: One must care about world one will not seee, that is, our duty is to think about it and take care of it.
After being very tired, the window of the house opens up and breathes freshly.
Whenever we get connected with that fifty-five, we have a new life and a new zeal in our body.
It's all we saw, but we didn't think about it, we couldn't tie it on a rope.
After that you will definitely see that whenever you will be associated with different natural conditions, there will be a new consciousness within you.
And that is why on 5th June we should have our own expeditions worldwide to join nature.
We get some results of our ancestors' work to protect the environment.
If we protect the environment, our next generation will get its results.
The world and the environment are considered to be the root cause of energy.
We are told here - Mata Bhoomi: Son Aham Prithviva.
The sanctity that we have in us is for our world.
Earth is our mother and we are her children.
If we think of Lord Buddha, one thing must come out that Lord Buddha's birth, his wisdom and his Mahaparinirvana-3 had happened in the trees.
But we need to connect him with modern words, modern debates.
I've got information from different states at this time.
With the arrival of rains, a big campaign to plant trees has started in almost all the states.
Crores of trees are planted.
The entire world celebrates this day as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, the World Yoga Day has made a detailed presentation on 21st June, involving people.
On the one hand, many powers that diversify the world are showing its deformed form, at this time, the World Yoga Day is a major contributor to India.
Through Yoga, we have tied the world together.
The way Yoga binds the body, mind, intellect and soul together, Yoga is binding the world together today.
Yoga has a major role to play in achieving stress-free life in this situation.
Yoga is not an exercise , health is absorbed by body , mind , judgement and this intercourse is possible only through yoga exercise .
Two days ago, I wrote letters to all the leaders of the world on Yoga Day.
Last year, I announced some competitions related to Yoga and announced some awards.
A funny offer.
He said: This is the third International Yoga Day, I urge all of you to work together on this third International Yoga Day.
Whether grandparents or grandparents , parents , boys and girls should practice yoga together and upload their pictures .
Yesterday, today and tomorrow, a lucky meeting will showcase a new direction to Yoga.
I express my gratitude for this proposal, and I feel that as we have carried out the campaign of Selfie with Daughter, we have created a joyous feeling, the pictures of these three generations of Yoga, the entire country and the world will create light.
You must be the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi App, where people from three generations are working together, these three generations will send me pictures together.
Tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow will be a beautiful tomorrow.
I invite you all.
There are still about three weeks left for the International Yoga Day.
Start a habit from today.
You should also campaign for three weeks of uninterrupted Yoga, spread and join people.
This is the movement of one-sided Preventive Health Care.
I invite all of you to participate in this.
Since you have assigned me the responsibility of working as a major servant, and from the Red Fort, I had the opportunity to speak on the 15th of August.
I have been visiting various parts of India since that day.
Today, on Modiji, on TV and on social media, I have seen people from wherever you are going, they are paying special attention to cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, in your appeal, people have accepted cleanliness as a mission.
Small people are also aware of cleanliness with the elders.
Sometimes the younger elders watched them burn.
The cleanliness that you have started from the valley of Kasir has taken an unprecedented look through your inspiration.
You are right, wherever I am going, there is a government surveillance work, but today a festival of cleanliness has started in society.
But when this phone call came, I thought and saw that, yes, that's right.
There will be other preparations to welcome the Prime Minister, but it will be the first to be clean.
It will enjoy anybody who is voluntary.
I want to thank everyone for emphasizing upon this cleanliness.
Someone gave me an offer.
It's a funny offer.
I don't know if I can do it.
Modi ji, when you go to an invitation, tell me, if you invite me then it will be a level of cleanliness, on the basis of how many tons of journals you give me, I will decide to go.
Dea is very good, but I have to think.
Again, there is a need to be a movement, and a few tons of water will be cleaned instead of other things.
How many people we'll save from illness.
How big a humanity will be.
Once we consider it as a wealth, we will come up with a new way of waste management.
The youngsters associated with start-ups will come forward with new plans, new instruments.
It is expected that these four thousand cities will be covered with dry waste, blue dustbin-A and wet waste-waste green dustbin.
Wet waste - green dustbin , green dustbin , eggs , eggs , eggs .
If all these things are used in agriculture, if you remember the greenery of food then you will remember what to do with green dustbin.
And the remaining waste materials like iron , cardboard , glass , plastic , polythene , rubber and other metallic wastes , which are to be recycled and recycled in machines , are not normally used , they should be used in blue dustbin .
I believe that we can create a habit like this and if we need to take new steps for cleanliness then we can fulfil the dreams of Gandhiji's cleanliness.
Today, I would like to mention with pride that if a person is conscious then how big a movement can be created.
Cleanliness is one such thing.
You must have heard a news in the last few days. The filthy Barsoba Beach of Mumbai has become a clean and clean procession today.
However, it has not been sudden that a citizen has been working for 80-90 weeks to change the pictures of Barsova Beach, which has been made clean, clean and beautiful by removing thousands of tons of oil.
And it's the responsibility of Versova Residence Volunteer.
One person, Shriman Afroz Shah, has been empowered by all powers since October 2015 and gradually many more people are involved in this work and it becomes a mass movement.
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has rewarded Afroz Shah for this purpose.
He was the first Indian to be awarded the Championsof the Earth Award.
I knew that the local women had given the highest leadership in this work.
They mixed mosquitoes to create awareness among the people, in every street, in every household, they inspired everyone to do this.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to all these mothers and sisters.
I also convey my best wishes to the officers of Jammu and Kashmir for a beautiful launch by opening a block of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, the work done by the present government for the last three years has been continuously being discussed in newspapers, TV channels and social media in the last 15 days.
Three years ago, you gave me the charge of the chief servant.
All sections of society have analyzed it.
This is a good tradition for democracy.
I also thank all those people who have given positive and important feedback, who have got the opportunity to get rid of misconceptions, flaws etc.
For an awakening nation, it is very important for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, because of a simple citizen like me and you, I feel the same effect on a common citizen.
There are hundreds of families who have written this to me.
As a little man, it has influenced my mind as a minor citizen, this has encouraged me.
I'm grateful to Akbar.
Come, let us all proceed with love for nature in this environment.
I convey my best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
And we have the desire to do something great for the youth and the zeal of the elders.
Every time the inputs for Mann Ki Baat are provided by the Government.
What are the complaints, what are the feelings of people.
On the motor, people's temperament is suggested.
On the train, if there is someone who wants to go to the bus, do the same with others.
But when I tried to see these things, I was satisfied.
In most cases, those people sent suggestions, tried to reach me, who really did something in their own lives.
They have tried to do something good according to their own spirit, strength, capability and opportunities.
And when I figured it out, I thought it wasn't a little bit of a suggestion.
It's from the people's feelings.
Some people feel that they are working wherever they are working, these things are coming up, so if more people listen to these things, they can create a comprehensive form of it, it can benefit many people.
Not only this, when I mention something, I feel like this and I am very happy.
I have never been able to think that in our country, especially the youth have been working on this thing for a long time.
I knew for a few years that some social organisations have been working on this thing, but the youth of my country have been working on this thing.
Many sent me a video.
There are many places where bread banking is being run.
People collect bread from their own banks, collect surpluses, and those who are poor, collect them for themselves.
Those who are giving, they are happy, and those who don't think they're their own children.
This is an example of how it works in collaboration with society.
This is the last day of April.
Poyla was recognised as Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states have been working towards achieving new goals of development and have been working towards the development of the country.
And in both the states, we continue to inspire the future of the great men and their lives in every field of society.
Remembering the great souls of both the states, the nations, our societies, our cities, our families, the 75 years after the independence of 2022 should be resolved.
It should be planned to transform this resolve into work, and all citizens should further enhance their efficiency.
The kind of warmth in our country and abroad has come to the forefront of March.
When I was advising people in Mann Kiwat, I had suggested what should be done in this summer.
All these things are prevalent, nothing is new, but it is useful to repeat it at a particular time.
And I have seen that the kids of the family are doing this very well.
Once they get to know why this water should be filled, then ten times in a day, whether there is water in the pot or not.
And the birds come and see them.
I think this is a game, but it is really a wonderful way of awakening condolences to the boys.
In our country, we must live together in animals and birds, colour them, yet together we must emphasize on their conservation.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a hundred years of Dawoodi Bohra Samaj's Dharmaguru Abhina Saheb was completed.
He lived for 103 years.
And for his hundred years, the Bohra community launched a massive campaign to save the slopes through Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to honour this campaign.
Approximately a thousand bird feeders spread them across the corner of the world.
This campaign has taken place at the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes I became so busy that I forget to give some water to the news papers, dollars, souvenirs, postmen and those who come to my house.
Young friends, I want to talk to you too.
Sometimes I feel that some of our youngsters are enjoying their lives from the short zone.
Their parents have also raised them in one of their hordes.
Some people give a lot of adversity but most people spend their lives in comfortzones.
Now the exams are over, many plans have been made to enjoy the vacation.
It's funny when it's hot in the summer.
However, as a friend, I would like to talk about how to make your vacation possible.
My belief is that some people will surely listen to me and inform me.
Sometimes there is a difference between watching something on TV, reading in books or listening to acquaintances and feeling themselves.
Be it test-reviewable, just like a little out of the comfortzone.
We're a middle-class family, happy family.
Friends, Have you ever thought that without reservation of seats, we would sit in the second class rooms of the train with tickets and travel 24 hours.
Sometimes feel it, I don't mean to repeat it, but do it once or twice.
In the evening, with their soccer, volleyballs or other means of sports, they are going to a poor settlement.
Play yourself with those poor boys, you will see that you have never had the joy of playing in life before.
When you will get a chance to see such children living in the society, do you think how big changes will come in the lives of those children
This experience will tell you a lot.
Several NGOs are working on this service.
Sometimes a lot of memorials are organised because of personality development, it has a variety of developments.
If you have accepted the Summer Camp, you have been doing a personality development course, you should go freely to all those people who have been deprived of all these services and teach them what you have learned.
How to do this, you can teach.
We are concerned that the technology has come to reduce the distance, but the result is that there are six people together in the same house, but the difference between them has increased so much as imagination.
Everyone has been busy with new technologies.
Staying together is also a reform, that is strength.
Secondly, I want to tell you about the skills you don't want to.
Let us try and lose ourselves to do good work, let us join any coaching class in the vaccination.
Sometimes we get scared, our young generation isn't becoming robots.
A little stress can be given to improve skills.
Far from technology, we can try to spend ourselves together. Someone has learnt the musical instruments, somebody is learning from Tamil Nadu, Telegu, Tamil Nadu, Bengal, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi languages.
If you don't swim, learn swimming, draw pictures, it may not be a good picture, but you can try to draw anything on the paper.
You want to learn how to drive your car, do you ever want to learn what to do
You see, this is a new experiment, its skills will give you joy and you will be able to get rid of the horrifying hypocrisy of life.
Get out of the past life, do something, guys.
It's a chance to make life.
You think that the exam is over, the new career will be learned only then, but there will be no chance.
I'll tell you, if you're going to learn your magic, at least learn the magic of it.
Keep showing your friends magic.
Try to know something you don't know, you'll be sure.
The human qualities within you will be awakened, and there will be many steps to improve.
I am telling myself, I cannot even imagine how much we can learn from the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages, new areas.
But before going to the place wherever we go, if we go there, if we go there, if we go there, if we go there, we see it like a curiosity, if we try and ask people, then we can enjoy seeing that new place.
Go to the same place and stay for four days.
Go to another place and stay for three days or four.
You can learn more than that.
Where did you go
You share your experiences using Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, this time the Government of India has given you a very good opportunity.
New generations are almost free from cash transactions.
They need cash.
They started believing in digital currency.
But if you refer to someone else or focus on someone else and the new person deals with the money thrice, you earn Rs.
Your account will deposit ten rupees from the government.
If you get 20 people in a day, you'll get 200 rupees in the evening.
Businessmen can earn income and students can also earn.
This scheme is scheduled to be completed on 14th October, for the development of Digital India.
Now the red light is gone, so nobody can tell you that the red light in your mind is gone.
I had an interesting phone call.
This phone has also created alarms, but this phone shows that the common people did not like it at all, they felt a distance.
"Namaskar Prime Minister, I am from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh to Shiva Choubey.
I want to say something about the government's Red Bacon lights.
I don't have to hang on traffic jams, and I don't have to wait.
I want to thank you very much for this idea.
PK's grandparents are also being cleaned.
It is a part of the government's system of inflammation of cars.
But we have to be conscious of this idea.
We all have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that our history, our culture, our heritage must be remembered again and again.
This gives us strength, inspiration.
This year, we are observing the millennium of Saint Ramanujacharya.
Centuries are celebrated in other countries of the world, but India is such a remarkable nation that we have the opportunity to remember thousands of years or more.
Thousands of years ago, he organised an expedition to his temple and was successful.
We are so fortunate that in order to deny the faults of the society, we have taken birth in this country.
We can inspire him to leverage the vision of the spirit of social unity, when we celebrate the birth anniversary of Sant Ramnujacharya.
Tomorrow, India is publishing a postage stamp in the memory of Saint.
I salute Santramsujacharya with reverence.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is the second day of the festival.
In some places of the world, this day is celebrated as 'Sharmi Divas'.
And when we talk of the hard work day, when we talk about the hard work and the hardworking people, I remember the story of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Very few people may know that we are grateful to Baba Saheb Ambedkar for the problems faced by the workers today.
Baba Saheb's role in the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I am talking about Babasaheb Ambedkar and Sant Rammujacharya, I also remember the great saint and musician Jagatguru Basaveshwar of Karnataka in the 12th century.
In the twelfth century, he talked about labour and labour in the language of Kannada.
He had spoken in Kannada - Kay Kave Kailas.
This means that you can reach Alokala in Shiva through hard work.
Today, when I talk to the workers, it is very natural to remember Thapanth Tengiri.
My dear countrymen, a few days later, we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
All the Buddhist monks of the world celebrate that day.
And in India, the journey from war to Buddha is a symbol of His Majesty Ashoka's life.
This is especially applicable to our neighbouring countries.
Cooperation between the two countries of India and their development.
Several projects are underway at the international level.
On 5th May, India will launch 48 Asia Satellites.
The opportunities available from this satellite will be specially helpful in the economic and other developmental areas of the country.
These include mapping of natural resources, telemedicine, education, information technology and people-to-people contacts.
An invaluable gift from India is a good example of our commitment to South Asia.
I convey my best wishes to all those countries of South Asia who are involved in this South-Eastern satellite project for this special effort.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2017
Most of the families in every corner of the country are busy with the tests of their children.
Those whose tests have been completed have a bit of comfortable environment and those families are still under pressure where the test is going on.
But at such a time, I would like to say that last time I had spoken to the students about Mann Ki Baat.
You must use those words at the time of the test.
March 26th.
26th March, Bangladesh Independence Day
Historical battle against injustice and the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh led by Bangabandhu.
Today, on this great day, I convey my best wishes to the Bangladesh citizen brothers and sisters for their freedom.
And I would like to assure the people of Bangladesh that India will contribute towards peace, security and development in the entire region by joining hands with a strong partner and a good friend of Bangladesh.
We are all proud of the legacy of our two countries.
The National Music of Bangladesh is also the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
A very interesting information about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is that in 1931, he was not only the first person to be honored with the Brazilian prize, but also to the British.
And when in 1919, when the British drove a massacre at the Jallianwala Bagh, then Prabhadra was the father of all the great men who were straightforward and at that time when a twelve-year-old child had a deep impact on this incident.
A new face was brought to the lives of the boy who was laughing at the field.
And in 1919, the 12-year-old boy is our dearest, the inspiration and martyrdom of all of us.
Three days before today, on March 23, Bhagat Singh and his colleagues - Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know that on March 23, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had no fear of satisfaction in the service of Mother India.
They gave us all the dreams of life for the freedom of Mother India.
And those three heroes still inspire us.
We cannot describe the sacrifices made by Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
The entire British administration was afraid of these three young men.
They're prisoners in prison, they're fine on the day of hanging, but they're worried about what they can do with them.
And so on March 24, where the trap was hanged on 23rd.
It's hiding that we don't see normally.
And then the British quietly burned their bodies in Punjab today.
Many years ago when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I could feel the vibration of that land.
And I will certainly tell the youngsters of the country that whenever you get a chance to go to Punjab, you must visit the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Mahadeo.
At this very moment, freedom struggle, its intensity, its indifference continued to grow.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth to revolutionize the armed forces.
On the other hand, just 100 years ago, Mahatma Gandhi had performed Satyagraha in Champaran on April 10, 1917.
This year is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time in Champaran, a symbol of Gandhian and Gandhian style in the freedom struggle of India was seen.
It was a bit of a change in the entire freedom movement, especially from the perspective of the traditional methods of federalism.
In this phase, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the hard work of the factory workers in Ahmedabad, and all these had a deep impact on Mahatma Gandhi's teachings and working style.
In 1915 Gandhiji came back from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha based on the photographs of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
Imagine a man who returned to Hindustan in 1915, worked only for two years.
And the Champaran Satyagraha was one where the consolidation of Mahatma Gandhi, the strength of the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, the power of learning the characters of Mahatma Gandhi, the ruthlessness of the British administration through his own behaviour, the creation of an intelligent person for fighting, inspiring and bringing him to the battlefield.
Therefore, we can feel the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if we talk about Gandhiji a hundred years ago, then it is a matter of deep study for any person who has to enter into the public life.
We can learn from him how much hard work we have to do and how Gandhi did it.
And it was a time when the leaders of Tabor Tabor, whom we heard, he was Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani Hone, had sent everyone to the village.
Prisoned on one side and handed himself over to constructive activities.
A wonderful balance was in the working style of Gandhiji.
What can be the meaning of Satyagraha, what can be the meaning of disagreement, what can be the meaning of unemployment in such a large era - not just by words, but by successful presentation, Gandhi had established a full new Constitution.
The unwavering efforts of the people to do something for the country and for the society by nurturing the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' will fulfil the dreams of those great men who have sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the country.
And in this 21st century, there are Indians who do not want to change, who do not want to be a partner in the progress of the country.
This will give a boost to the progress of 1. 25 billion Indians.
There are many people who regularly visit the hospital to serve the patients.
Our country is the service of the Lord of Ratnagraha and Jansebai.
If we look at this idea together, we can understand how big it is.
It is very natural and unnecessary to have a discussion on India as well as a wide range of views.
But it is also true that the dream of a New India can succeed if the entire country is determined and taken on the path of realisation.
It is not necessary that the work is to be done in budget or government expenditure.
If every citizen envisages that he will follow the traffic rules, follow his own duty, stop using petrol-diesel at least once a week, then we will be able to take this small step forward.
I would like to see the dream of India becoming a reality and I would like to say that everybody should follow his own citizenship and perform his duty.
This can be the beginning of a New India.
It is going to be 75 years of India's independence in 2022.
I urge you to come and dedicate your lives and participate in this journey from Swaraj to Suraj.
My dear countrymen, today I want to express my gratitude to you.
The BHIM App has started two and a half months ago, but about one and a half million people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
You cannot imagine that you can become a big partner in the country and you can resist yourself against black money and corruption.
A few days back, Digidhan Mela was organised for public education and awareness.
Approximately 1. 25 lakh people have received specific awards for entrepreneurs and have received specific awards for seventy thousand businessmen.
Let us join this effort to reduce the use of cash transactions and notes.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that whenever I seek your advice for Mann Ki Baat, there is a lot of consensus.
But I have noticed that there is no interest in cleanliness.
I think it's very important to explain to the common man.
I pass through a river every day, where people drive a lot of waste and pollut the river.
This river is flowing through Rispana Pul and our house is lying beside us .
In order to keep this river clean, I have spoken to the people at the level of publicity, I have met, but there is no special benefit.
I urge you to send a team here or publish it through newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, you can see how difficult a girl from the 1980s is.
How cruel he sees the dirty rubbish in the river
I think it's a good signal.
I want 125 crore countrymen to be angry with garbage.
Once there is anger, destruction and anguish, we will certainly be able to do something against waste.
It is a good thing that Gayatri has provoked me, advised me and said at the same time that he has tried a lot, but has failed.
Since the movement of cleanliness has started, awareness has increased.
Everyone is connected with it in a positive way.
It took the form of a convergence.
The hate of rubbish is slowing down.
Whether it is conscious, active or active, the movement has its own importance.
This movement is possible in a smooth way.
It's hard to work, but we have to do it.
I believe that the consciousness of the youth among the youth, among the youth, among the youth of the country is indicative of a very good recognition.
Today, I would like to tell all the countrymen that the words of Gayatri are spoken by all of us.
As much as half of it doesn't get in the stomach, and leave it there.
Sometimes we have seen how much we waste the unrecognized food we leave.
Have you ever thought that if you don't waste it, then how much of this food can fill the stomach of the poor
There's nothing different about this.
Normally when the mother serves the food of small children in our house , she says , take as much as you can eat .
There may be some efforts in this regard, but despite this, the indifference to this is a social inequality.
It's unfair to the poor.
Secondly, if there is relief, the family will also have financial benefits.
It is a good idea for the society, but it is a matter of fact that it will also benefit the family.
I don't want to say anything about this but I want to increase awareness.
I know some youngsters who are associated with this kind of movement.
The youngsters of our country worked hard.
This kind of people will be found in every state of the country.
Their work can motivate us so that we don't waste food.
We'll take as much as we eat.
That's the way to change.
And those who are healthy , they always say - keep a little empty plate , keep a little empty stomach .
When it comes to health, we say, 7th April is World Health Day.
The United Nations has set a target of Universal Health Coverage by 2030.
The United Nations has focused on depression on World Health Day on 7th April.
According to a message, more than twenty five crore people in the world are victims of mental depression.
The problem is that many people around us are victims of this disease, but we cannot understand it, and perhaps we feel confused to talk about it.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not such that it cannot be freed from it.
When he creates a psychological circumstance, he starts getting rid of it.
The first thing is that depression should not be suppressed and expressed.
With your friends, with your parents, brothers and sisters, tell the teacher what is happening inside you.
Did you ever think that man's doing this
You must be sure these are the first symptoms of depression.
If you want to keep yourself away from the middle of everyone, keep in mind - don't let him alone.
Leave those whom he likes to stay with.
In a funny way, encouraging him to speak openly, find out what his heart is hiding in the depths of mind.
In diseases like diabetes, as man becomes physically weak, depression reduces the concept of man, reduces courage, reduces the strength of fighting in lifestyle and destroys all our lives.
Your confidence will come back if you start solving other problems with the minds of service.
If you can interact with someone else, you can serve and do it unnecessarily, you will see if your mind is lightened.
Yoga is a habit but it is useful to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is an extremely effective means for emancipation from depression, freedom from complications and happiness.
International Day of Yoga was celebrated every year on 21st June.
If you have some suggestions on the occasion of International Yoga Day, send me all the ideas through my mobile app, guide me.
Keep writing as many poems and songs as you can with Yoga so that there can be an inspiration among the common people.
This time I will talk to my mothers and sisters and there is a lot of talk about health care.
A few days back, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
That is why the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The maternal period which was given during pregnancy , pregnancy and post-pregnancy period during pregnancy of women was 12 weeks ago .
In this regard, only two or three countries of the world are ahead of us.
When these children grow up, the country will be rich.
Festivals of New Year are celebrated in different parts of our country.
The New Year Festival is celebrated on the occasion of Ugadi, Sindhi, Cheti Chand, Kashmiri Navareh, Ayodh in Maharashtra, Samvatsar Puja in Bihar in the New Year.
The vast country is full of diversity in India.
Greetings to all of you on New Year
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
The bird's skeleton brings a pair of fun.
Not only flowers, but also fruits glow in tree branches.
The summer fruits are also seen in this spring.
Similarly, in the field of farming, yellow yellow yellow flowers are expected to grow.
The red flower in the neighbourhood threatens Holly's arrival.
Amir Khasru gave a very beautiful description of this season of monsoon.
He wrote: He's blossoming in the forest. He's blossoming, he's calling Kokil, huh-huh.
People enjoy it when the color of happiness in nature touches the quality of life in the form of sages.
The spring-panchami, mahashivratri and Holi festivities colour the lives of people.
And so he said that I would say something about the launch of 104 satellites and the interceptor missile.
Shobhaji thanks you very much for remembering the glory of India.
Whether it is fighting poverty, protecting ourselves from diseases, connecting with the world, inspiring knowledge or information, technology and science have proved their role.
A glorious day in the national life of India on February 15, 2017.
Our scientists have raised our heads around the world.
And we know that in a few years, ISRO has successfully completed a few unprecedented projects.
ISRO has established a world record in the field of space expedition after the success of the Mars Mission, Mangalyaan.
India is the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together.
And it is also heartening to note that this is the 38th final launch of PSLV.
This is not just ISRO but a historic achievement for the entire India.
ISROs cost effective space programme has shown a wonder to the world and the entire world is appreciating the success of Indian scientists in an open mind.
In particular, my farmer brothers and sisters will be able to know how much water is available in our country, how it should be used, what should be monitored - our new satellite cartosat-2D will help in all these things.
He sent some pictures when he reached our satellite room.
That's what he's doing.
It is also a matter of great pleasure for us that our young scholars, our women scientists, have led all these missions.
This marvellous collaboration between the youth and the women is a great pride in the success of ISRO.
I compliment the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
For the common man, they have always kept the aim of using great science for the service of the nation and are working on a new dimension.
The more we appreciate these scientists and their entire team, the less it will be.
Shobhaji has asked one more question and it is related to Indias security.
India has completed the successful test of the Ballistic Interceptor missile in defence sector.
In the interception technology, the ballian has successfully captured about one hundred kilometres of ammunition from the soil during its experimental flight.
This is an important achievement in defence.
When I see new technologies, I see new scientific achievements, then it is our pleasure.
And the questioning has played a vital role in the development of human life.
And whoever intellectually does not let him ask as a question, he also contributed to it, find new questions, create new questions.
That's the reason for a new discovery.
They don't calm down until the answer is answered.
And if we look at the stream of human life for thousands of years then we can say that there is no fault in this development of human life.
It's impossible.
Efforts to know the universe, the laws of creation, the minds of man are constantly going on.
New science and new technologies emerge from them.
And every technology, every new form of science, gives a new generation.
My dear youngsters, when we talk of science and hard work of the scholars, I remember that this Mann Ki Baat programme should be an attraction for younger generations of science.
Many scientists are required in the country.
Todays scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific
In keeping with the need of the common man, when science researches, discoveries and innovations, science becomes a source of inspiration for the common man, then science becomes great.
This is where I saw an innovation for our deserted poor fishermen.
All such innovations came from this competition.
Various services are also being driven by technology.
Technology has become an integral part of life.
India's digital transaction rate is rising.
Especially the young people are removing digital payments from their mobile phones.
I think it's a good sign.
Lakigrahak Yojana and DGDP scheme have got a big response.
It has been almost two months since the two schemes, 15,000 people are receiving a prize of Rs.
Several people have received 1 lakh rupees for this scheme.
More than four thousand businessmen have paid fifty thousand rupees.
Shriman Santosh, Minister of Mysore expressed happiness at the Narendra Modi-App that he received the award of Rs. 1,000 in the Laki Grahak Yojana.
And then I believe that what you should share with you people is a slightest satisfaction.
I am very happy to know about this - Santosh ji, your name and work have given us immense pleasure.
On the one hand, as he is driving, he has become the ambassador of the 'Lakhi Grahak Yojana'.
The carriage is also aware of the digital ecosystem and many of them have started taking part in the digital ecosystem.
He interacted with his friends about how the use of cards, e-wallets in the form of a bedroom in a young friendly priesthood from Maharashtra.
He is also encouraging others to take up a mission of one lakh rupees for him.
This work plays an important role in the fight against corruption and black money in a way.
A memorable day.
A few days back, Babasaheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary passed away.
Recalling him, you must teach at least 125 people to update the BHIM.
Teach us how to deal with it.
Therefore, I mean, we have to strengthen the foundation stone of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
We have to reach the BHIM App in the hands of 125 crore people.
This movement has been going on for the past three months, its success is being achieved in many villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, farming contributes a lot to the economy of our country.
The economic power of the village strengthens the economic momentum of the country.
Today I want to tell you about one joy.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard to provide food grains.
The hard work of our farmers has resulted in the highest production of paddy this year.
All kinds of information indicate that our farmers have broken all old records.
This year, the way the crops have grown in the fields, it seems every day that we celebrate Pongal or Vaishali.
This year, more than two thousand tons of food grains have been distributed in the country.
The last record of our farmers was eight percent more than that.
It's an unprecedented achievement.
I would like to express my gratitude to the farmers of the country.
I am glad that the farmers of the country have heard about the poor, about two hundred ninety lakh hectares of pulses have been cultivated.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service of the poor of the country by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters of my country who have worked hard and have produced record pulses, are very thankful to me for this thing.
My dear countrymen, some programmes are being run by the government, by the society, by the organizations and by the organizations for cleanliness.
Sometimes we see the awareness of cleanliness in a way.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and UK.
The Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February.
Six household toilets have been cleaned and the officers themselves showed how to use the TwinPit Toilet once again.
They also showed that there is no other problem or contagious mental obstacle to cleanliness of this new method.
We also do the work of small safari, just as we can clean the toilets.
A Standard Two Pittoilet for six members is completed in about five to four years.
Our farmers are well-known with NPK.
Different government departments and different sanitation systems.
For the first time in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
On the second side of the month of March, the two Ministers will undertake Swachhta Abhiyan (Swachhta Abhiyan) and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does a great job, then the entire country gains a new strength, the confidence increases.
We all welcome the kind of impact that our Divyang players have made on the Rio Paralympics.
In the Blind T-20 World Cup Final held this month, India has enhanced the glory of the country by becoming a World Champion for the second time in the defeat of Pakistan.
I once again congratulate all the players of this party.
The country is proud of the success of our friends.
I have always said that the Divyang brothers and sisters are supportive, strong, courageous and incomplete.
Always we can learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, the daughters of our country are not lagging behind.
They walked on their feet and glorifying the country with their success.
A few days ago, our women sportspersons won talent in the Asian Ragbsevices Championships.
I convey my best wishes to all these players.
The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is progressing at a fast pace.
It is no longer just a governmental project, it has now become a campaign for social consciousness and public education.
In the last two years, people have also joined this scheme.
The burning sensation from every corner of the country has also forced the common man to think and for years, the mindset of the old system is changing.
It is a matter of great joy when there is such news that the festival has been celebrated on the occasion of the birth of daughter-in-law.
Such positive thinking towards daughter-in-law leads to social recognition.
I have come to know that the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu has been helping to stop the sales due to a special operation.
So far, more than 175 barrels have been discontinued.
More than 55-60,000 bank accounts have been opened in the Sugar Sukanya Samridhi Yojana.
In every village, a campaign to educate the daughters in every village is underway under the 'Har Housing Struggle' scheme in Madhya Pradesh.
Your children are encouraging the students to re-school their students without finishing their education in Rajasthan through your school campaign.
New visions are also linked.
It has changed as per local requirements.
You are actively associated with it.
I know more from you.
What is happening in the world, the thoughts and thoughts of the poor people of the village are reaching me.
I am extremely grateful for your cooperation.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Perhaps our ancestors have decorated our climate, economic structure and social systems in such a way that there is no sustainability in social life.
In the past few days, we have celebrated a lot of festivals.
Yesterday, the birth anniversary of Shri Krishna was celebrated across India.
Shri Krishna is an individual who, even after so many thousands of years, creates innovation, inspiration and innovation in every festival, the past of our imagination.
He can be an example to solve any problem even today.
Any person can find solutions to any current problem from the life of Shri Krishna.
On the other hand, such a great personality can be said to be willing to do the work of Sarath in the battlefield.
Sometimes climbing mountains and sometimes throwing bricks of food, so that you feel humiliation.
Today, when I talk to you, my mind is moving towards two moments.
A handsome chapter, Mohan, the other chariot.
He left the river Yamuna and visited Dwarka town on the seashore of Gujarat and spent the last day of his life in Delhi on the banks of Mohen Yamuna, born on the seashore.
During that period, several thousand years ago, the Sudarshan Chakravar Mohammad had contributed to his intellect, duty, courage and thinking to avoid the war.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On the seashore of Porbandar, which we called Kirti Thiruvananthapuram today, on the 2nd of October 1869, a person was born not just one generation, who showed a path of destruction to human history, had established nutritional excellence.
He served those who were not deserved of milestones.
He used to consider serving poor, helpless, hungry people as one of the duties of his life.
He used to serve leprosy patients so that others are inspired to prove falsehood about leprosy.
Whenever any person is in danger, Mahatma Gandhi used to run away to help him.
He did not only emphasize the importance of service, but also the importance of satisfaction in service.
The word 'Seva' is fulfilled only if it is done with joy, then it becomes 'Seva Param Dharma'.
However, the real pleasure of the moment is that this idea of self-determination is also inherent in service matters.
We can easily understand this by observing Gandhiji's life.
In the life of Mahatma Gandhi, individuals and society, humanity was the only concern.
He emphasized on community mobilisation in the development of the society, whether it is African Phoenix Farm, whether it is Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha.
I am fortunate to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi on various occasions of his life.
Gandhiji serving as well as emphasizing on socio-economic power.
Both these ideas of social and social integration, community service and community mobilization are being used in our lives.
Come and leave. Can we accept this
There is no obstacle in the mindset of those who come to their minds, who are conscientious, who have full self-respect in their beliefs.
My dear countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
Several events, competitions, exhibitions etc. are being organized in the coming days.
I'll give you a wonderful news in this context.
The Haripura Panels were specially fascinated.
You people remember that there was an assembly session in Haripur in Gujarat where Subhash Chandra Bose was recorded in the history of the election of the President of India.
These Art Panels have a very beautiful past.
Prior to the Haripura Session of 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then President of Shantiniketan Nandlal Bose.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through artificial intelligence.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose architecture blends our Constitution.
It gives the Constitution a new identity.
Her artwork has embarked upon the Constitution as well as Nandlal Bose.
Nandlal Bose inspected the villages around Haripura and then constructed a short canvas on rural India.
This precious sculpture was discussed in Venice.
And once again with the congratulations of Gandhiji for 150 years, I request every Indian to make some or the other resolve.
We need to do something for the country, for the society, for the other.
This will be our beautiful, true and true reverence to Bapu.
My dear countrymen, you must remember that for the past few years, we have launched the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign in the country for two weeks before 2nd October.
This year it starts on September 11.
This time we have to put a special emphasis on plastic.
There is a lot of enthusiasm in the society about this campaign.
Many of my business brothers and sisters have planted a placard at a edge of the shop where it is written that the treasurer comes with his own bag.
You can also show your partnership in saving money and protecting the environment.
On 2nd October, when the 150th anniversary of Bapus death, we will not only dedicate him to an open defecation free India, but on that day a new foundation stone will be laid against plastic.
I would like to appeal to all sections of the society, to every village, to the people of the world and to the people of the city, to pray for Gandhi Jayanti this year in a way, let us celebrate this Mother India from plastic.
May 2nd October be a special day.
It can be recycled.
It can also be used as fuel.
There is no need to be seen here for inspiration, no one bigger than Gandhiji can be inspirational.
My dear countrymen, our scriptures are well-described, a gem of knowledge.
Today, I want to touch upon an important topic by an intellectual scholarship, it is a matter written in a long time ago, but today it has a huge potential.
The fools call the rock as stones.
Our culture is rich in food.
Even we have changed the knowledge of food to science.
We all need nutritious and nutritious food, especially for women and infants.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and entertaining ways.
On the day of harvesting, Anganwadi Sebikas used to collect one minute from everyone.
These foods were used to produce hot food for children and women.
Those who donate this will become a conscious citizen and social worker.
After this, the person dedicated himself to this goal and he also became a soldier in this movement.
Liquid no food solid food.
In Gujarat, it was thought in 1960 that the child should be given a complementary food in the Annaprashan program so that the minds of the people become aware.
This is a great initiative that can be taken everywhere.
In many states, people have started the 'Tithi Bhoja' campaign.
If a family has a birthday, auspicious day, a memorable day, then the family members go to Anganwadi, school, and the family members themselves serve children and share their joy and enjoyment in everyone.
This is a unique combination of service and joy.
Friends, there are so many small things that our country can fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, malnutrition has affected the families of both the poor and the rich.
The Poshan Abhiyan will be celebrated throughout the country in the month of September.
You must be associated with this campaign, collect information and add new ideas.
If you can save one or two persons from malnutrition, then our country will also be protected from malnutrition.
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that there would be a lot of questions on this matter and that is why.
Just a few weeks ago, wherever I went and whom I met, Man Vs Wild has emerged.
With this episode, I am not only India but also the youth of all parts of the world. I have never thought that such a place will be created in the minds of the youth.
I have never thought about the variety of topics our country and the youth of the world.
I went to Bhutan last week.
That's what I felt.
Tiger, Lion, creatures, I wonder how many things people can enjoy.
My belief is that people are now asking about the steps taken by the Climate Judicial Oclean Environment in India.
Is it edited later
Look, there's no secret.
Some people have questions about this, so I'm unveiling this mystery.
It's not a mystery.
I used to say Hindi but he used to hear English, so that the conversation becomes very easy and this is the bitterness of technology.
After this show, I have noticed that many people are discussing the Jim Corbett National Park.
You must visit nature and wildlife.
I told you before, I repeat, you must go to the North East.
Your mind will expand.
On 15th August, I urged all of you from the Red Fort to visit 15 places for 10000 tourism in the next three years, check, take family and spend some time there.
Your life will spread your thoughts.
Last year, the country had the privilege of collecting Tiger Census.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
There are 297 tigers in India.
A few years ago, half of it was very painful.
The Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg, Russia on Tigers.
A resolution was taken here expressing concern over the reduction of tiger numbers in the world.
This resolution was to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is New India, where we have achieved our goals very soon.
We have doubled the number of tigers here by 2019.
Not only tigers in India, but also the number of Protected Area and Community Reserves has increased.
When I was expressing my wishes to the tigers, I also remembered the lion of Gir Aryan in Gujarat.
When I was in charge of the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the lion's residence in the jungle of Gir was getting confused.
Their numbers were going down.
We've done a lot of work in Gir.
I'll decide to appoint a woman's guard there in 1947.
Infrastructure will improve the tourism industry.
We are focusing on conservation and conservation in terms of nature and wild life.
Now we have to think about our conservation systems in the backdrop of compassion.
My dear countrymen, can we forget the historic address of Swami Vivekananda at 1894
This young Indian saint's Tejaswai speech was awakened among humankind all over the world.
When India became the worlds next compassionate compassionate compassionate compassionate compassionate compassionate compassionate compassionate compassionate compassionately, in 1894, it was compelled to discover a new India with the bright words of Swami Vivekananda.
Come, let us build the form of Swami Vivekananda, the power that he knew.
On this occasion, we are going to launch the country's Fit India Movement.
You have to keep yourself fit, make the country fit.
This will be an attractive mission for all of us.
But today I don't have any details about this.
Wait for August 29.
2nd October for Totally Dedicated Plastics.
With all our strengths, we will join the campaign to keep our homes and its surroundings plastic free.
I believe this campaign will create light on social media.
Let us start this campaign with a new zeal, a new resolve and a new energy.
I waited for your message and advice.
Please be conscious of the mantra of joy and service.
Thanks a lot, sweetheart
Mann Ki Baat, January 2017
Our commitment to the Constitution of India, the duty of the citizens, the right of the citizens, and the democracy is a reform that will constitute the next generation in a conscious and reformed manner in terms of democracy.
But in our country, there should not be any depth of debate on citizens' duties and citizens' duties.
I hope that at every level, every moment, as much as is given on the right, the more urgently it is.
India's democracies can move on both sides of the right and duty.
Tomorrow, January 30th, we will be honoured by Punya Tithi.
On 30th January, we pay homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the nation by observing a two-minute funeral at 11:30 in the morning.
As a united society, as a country, we must become a common habit of celebrating a two-minute homage on January 30, 11.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I convey my best wishes to the brave soldiers and their members who have been honoured in the various gallantry awards.
All these awards include 'Kirti Chakra', 'Suryachakra', 'Param Vishnu Seva Medal' and 'SabkaSeva Medal'.
I want to especially appeal to the youngsters - you are very active in social media, can you do something
This time everyone has accepted this honor - write a compliment on the Internet and send it to your friends.
When we get to know about their courage, valour and valour in detail, it becomes astonishing as well as inspiration.
On the one hand, when we were all happy on 26th January and on the other hand, our soldiers in Kashmir who were steadfast in the security of the country and their brave-hearts due to the storms.
I pay my respects and respects to all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are well aware that I am listening to Mann Ki Baat.
The month of January, February, March, April is the month of examination for each family.
Half or two children are tested in the world, but the entire family remains under pressure from the examination.
Family concerns, learning concerns, teacher tensions, a very variety of psychological environments can be seen in every world.
And I have always believed that we should come out of it and that is why today I want to talk to the young friends in detail in detail.
When I announced this, a lot of teachers, parents, students sent me a message, asked me questions, advised, wrote about pain, stressed, and after seeing all these things I want to share with you today.
I sent a message on the telephone from the creation.
Anyway, the question has been created, but all of you must have heard the same question.
The test must be a pleasure.
Work has been done throughout the year, it has been an opportunity to inform, it should be an occasion of hope and enthusiasm.
You have to decide that you think it's pressurre, not pleasure.
And when the festival is the best that comes out of us.
At the time of the festival, the society has its own strength.
During the exams, a festival should be created between families, friends and friends in 42 days.
Like a team, the entire family should celebrate this festival with enthusiasm, see how fast it will change.
The truth is that these three-four months from Kashmir to Kanyakumarika, Kutch and Arunachal from Amreli are just tests and tests.
It is our responsibility that every year these three-four months, by following the tradition of self-reliance, by understanding the atmosphere of the family of ourselves, this is a festival.
And so I'll tell you 'smile more sore More'.
And you've seen that when you're happy, you're laughing, you're relaxed.
You remember the whole view of what the teacher said in the clasroom a year ago.
Sometimes it seems that we cannot see the exam properly.
I think it's a question of life and death.
The test means that you've been studying for years.
J.
It's a brilliant example of Kalam.
He wanted to join the winds but was ungrateful.
If he had been disappointed after this failure, if he had to go to Puducherry, would India have had such a great scientist
This has not only increased the competition among the children but also increased the stress.
I want to know your views on the current situation and future of education.
Whatever is true in your life is your knowledge, your skills, your self-confidence and resolve.
You don't think he's a good doctor, so you go to him.
Whenever you go to a neighbourhood for a big case, do you look for his marksheet
You have seen his experience, his wisdom and success.
That's why sometimes this number becomes an integral part of our way.
Analysis will show that while just running for numbers, they have found the easiest way and focused on certain things, but you are getting unsuccessful when you face any problem outside this tunnel.
And that is why sometimes this kind of thing happens that despite being extremely grateful in the examination, we face failures in life.
Richa raised one more topic, the competition.
It's an area of great mental conflict.
We can give examples of Sachin Tendulkar.
Friends, in every case of your life and particularly when you are going to give your exams, take care of yourself, if you've given two hours to take care of yourself, can you do it for three hours now
Earlier, when he thought of getting up, it was too late, can you get up at the right time
Shri S.
This way he helped me.
My mother couldn't pass the 10th standard test, but if she didn't get help, I couldn't pass the CBSE test.
Nice-yes, you're right.
You must have noticed that the number of women in those who asked me questions is higher.
If you learn to confess once, many problems will be solved there.
If you don't admit it, you're gonna get rid of this problem.
Hope makes the way hard.
Acknowledgement of the present situation creates an opportunity to open the path of solution.
So admit what's there.
See, you'll be free of weight.
We discuss the weight of school bags for small children, but sometimes I think that parents expect more than school bags for children.
Many years ago, one of our familiar personalities was in hospital due to heart attack.
In fact, we go to a sick person and create a fear in his mind about the disease.
I would like to tell the parents that sometimes we live like this with the youngsters.
Have you ever thought of giving a smile to the children during the test days
You'll see the situation will change.
I've got a very funny phone.
The gentleman didn't want to mention his name.
If you hear the details of the phone, you'll understand why the person doesn't want to publish his name.
"Namaskar, Prime Minister, I have done something in my childhood that I don't have to tell my name.
I tried to fake once when I was a kid.
I've been wasting a lot of time thinking about how to fake, what to do with it.
I could get the same number when I spent that time for studying.
When I tried to pass through a fake, I was caught and many friends around me were distressed.
I'm telling you the same thing.
So where will you reach
Imagine you're finding your own way out of the hole, creating a hurdle.
I have seen that some people are using all their talents and using creative powers to fabricate them.
If I talk about sports during the exams, everyone will say - How is this Prime Minister
It is because the common man thinks that if a sportsperson gets into sports, he will be unemployed.
Besides the brain, the rest of the body should have proper activity.
If you have a break for five minutes, you'll feel it's too much to read.
I don't know if everybody likes this, but I'm convinced.
Once a folk song came to meet me.
He asked me how long did you sleep
I want to know, brother, are you a doctor
He said, No, no, you don't have to say that you have a relationship with him when you give this address.
You're gonna get a break in your lunch card.
I didn't think of my sleep and throat.
He gave me a simple tomato.
Don't forget that you'll be disappointed with me.
Otherwise the parents will be able to see my reflection instead of you when the market comes.
If you lie down, it'll work. Don't think about it once.
The sportsperson also plays a crucial role in keeping the mind, intellect and body stable.
Let's move forward with this mantra.
Dear Countrymen, on 1st February this year, the Indian Coast Guard is completing forty years.
Congratulations and thanks to all the personnel and soldiers of the Coast Guard for their duties towards the nation.
Our Coast Guards have achieved their proud place among the top four Coast Guards in the world in collaboration with 126 warships and 66 television aircraft built in our country.
Remembering the commitment of Coast Guards Mantra Oym Rakshasham, our Coast Guard has always been ready to protect the coastal areas of the country.
Last year, the Coast Guard launched a programme to clean the seashores of our country with their origins and added thousands of civilians.
The Coast Guard is our female pilot officer, but they are also familiar with the hovercraft.
Spring rider.
Saraswati is worshipped in spring.
For the purpose of teaching, worship is done.
Not just learning, but also a festival of inspiration for bravery.
Rang Devasanti Chola is the inspiration.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to the people of this spring-five journey.
My dear countrymen, the Mann Ki Baat programme has been accomplished with a lot of illustrations.
Mann Ki Baat has been heard in the regional language after addressing my Mann Ki Baat last month.
This has been a great success.
The countrymen have written letters from far away.
I convey my best wishes to them for this self-sufficient effort of AIR.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
My best wishes to you all for Christmas.
Today is the day to recognise service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Christ Jesus said: We don't want to be helpful for the poor, we want our recognition.
There's a story about this.
Lord Jesus stood by a Temple Treasure.
Many rich people came and donated a lot of charity.
At the same time, a poor widow came and donated two copper money.
On the one hand, two copper donors don't mean anything.
Madan Mohan Malviji was born on the occasion of his birth anniversary.
On his birth anniversary, he paid homage to Bhav-Gambi.
Just two days back, I had the opportunity to inaugurate a number of developmental works in Banaras, the shores of Malviyaji.
I also laid the Foundation Stone of the Mohammati Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University.
This is a cancer centre for the entire region, not just the east of Uttar Pradesh but also the benefits of the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of the Prime Minister of India, Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country will never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Our country has also elevated the strength of nuclear power under its leadership.
Atal ji had established an ideal in every role of the leader, parliament, minister or Prime Minister.
I salute Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray to God for his health.
I am fortunate to work with Atal ji as a worker.
A lot of memories are drawing in front of the eyes.
When I visited this morning, I shared an old video of how Atal ji's affection towards a small worker would be realized only after watching the video.
Today, as a gift to the people of the country, they are going to benefit from the two schemes.
Everyone wants to understand and learn from each other.
In order to encourage this, the Government of India is formulating a scheme for encouraging customers and small businessmen to transform e-payment to enhance the strength of mobile banking.
The Scheme of Encouraging Consumers is 'Lakhi Grahak Yojana' and the name of the Business Scheme - DG-DhanBihar Yojana.
And on 25th December, as a gift of Christmas, a drive of Rs. 1,000 will be deposited in the accounts of 15,000 people.
Today, not just for one day, this scheme will continue for the next 100 days.
15,000 people will receive this award every day.
Millions of rupees will be delivered to lakhs of families in 100 days but the gift will be deserved by those who are Mobile Banking, E-Banking, Card, UPI.
Use the digital transaction methods like USSD etc.
The DG-Dhan Darbar Yojana is for the businessmen.
As the businessmen themselves join this scheme, they will also connect the customers to cashless their businesses.
Businessmen will also be awarded separately and the number of awards will be thousands and thousands.
The award will not be available for those who can purchase more than Rs. 3,000.
With the help of USSD, poor people can avail the benefits of the scheme through Feature phones and general phones, and can avail the benefits of the scheme.
People from rural areas can win this award by making them poor through AEPS.
Your family will also be able to teach you this method in a better way.
It is very easy to send a Houts App from a mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to know how to use technology in the country, how to make e-payments, how to make online payments.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased by 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to encourage this process.
It is a decision that businessmen can easily guess how big it is.
All businessmen who exchange digital transactions will be able to extend online payment systems instead of cash in their businesses.
I have come to know that the Government of Assam has announced a 10 discount on providing property taxes and business licenses for digitalisation.
The branches of Rural Banks have been decided, with their 75 subscribers from January to March, at least two digital transactions, Rs. 50,000 will be paid by their Government.
As on 31st March, 2017, if a village has transacted 100 digital transactions, the Government has announced a grant of Rs. 5 lakhs under the Uttam Panchayat for Digi-Transaction scheme.
For the farmers, the Government of Assam has decided to give Rs. 5,000 to the first 10 farmers under the Digital Kisan Shiromani Yojana, who will fully follow the Digital Mechanism for procurement of seeds and fertilizers.
I congratulate the Government of Assam and congratulate all the States who have taken such initiatives.
It's funny that GNFC's sales have increased by 27 percent over the previous year.
Brothers and sisters, in our economy, there is a need for an unorganized sector in our everyday life.
In most cases, the money for the wages, the money for the work is also paid or paid on the taxes. And we know that the workers are being distributed for this.
80 instead of Rs. 100, when Rs. 80 is to be paid, Rs. 50 is given there and all these workers are deprived of a lot of benefits including health insurance.
But when cashless payments are made, the money is deposited directly into the bank.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easy for us.
A country like India should come forward in this regard.
Our youngsters have made a lot of progress through start-ups.
This digital-endolon is a golden opportunity for our younger generation to take new ideas, new technologies, new technologies and innovations.
We have to join hands with full force in the campaign to free the country from black money and economic corruption.
My dear countrymen, I request the people before every episode of Mann Ki Baat, send your suggestions, give your suggestions and suggestions on MyGov and Narender Modi App.
The authors of the second group, who have enforced the importance of all these things, work for the betterment of the country, work for the betterment of the country, have given a detailed account of the kind of fraud that has taken place against them.
Shri Gurumani Keobal has written in MyGov - this is a complimentary measure to draw money in black money.
We are in trouble as a citizen, but we are happy that we are cooperating in the fight against corruption.
We are playing the role of the army in fighting corruption, black money etc.
This is the same idea from all corners of the country.
We all feel it.
In fact, the Agent of Change is an integral part of change.
I want to thank everyone for one more reason, not just the difficulties they have suffered, but those who are trying to confuse the common man, they have also given a strong answer.
Not only this, some people have opened their mouths to the people of Gujarat with their intellect, power and creativity.
I salute this power of the people for centuries.
People are the blessings of God, the blessings of the people.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for taking part in this great zeal against corruption and black money.
I wanted that there should be detailed discussions on political parties and political funding in Parliament as the fight against corruption and black money.
Those who are saying that political parties have a lot of abandonment - their rocks are wrong.
This government is the government of the people.
On the other hand, I had said on the first day - 8th, this is an extraordinary fight.
A lot of information has been received from the citizens of the government.
The success we achieve is because of the awareness of the masses.
Can anybody imagine how much risk the aware citizens of our country are taking to open these masks
If you get help, this fight will be very easy.
There's a third group of those who send me letters, many of them.
They say, don't stop Modi ji, don't get tired, take as hard as possible.
We have to win this war, we don't get tired.
We have brought it out and we have very strictly enacted the Benami Property Act.
The law will play its role in the next day.
This is our primary duty for patriots and people.
In the last few years, India has established itself with pride in the global economy.
According to the World Investment Report published by UNCTAD, India has reached third place in 2016-18 Top Prospective Host Economies.
India has improved 32 points in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
Similarly, the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index-2016 highlights India's 19-phase progress.
In other reports, India has shown rapid improvement.
My dear countrymen, this time the session of Parliament has created fervor among the countrymen.
They have been angry at the proceedings of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also expressed their enthusiasm on this.
But sometimes something good happens in these things, the mind is filled with happiness.
There was a good job in the Assembly elections, which was not seen by the people of the country.
Brothers and sisters, I am glad to say this thing today that a bill related to the government has been passed in Parliament by keeping in mind the goals of the Divyangjans.
Our government is committed to Divyangjans.
My Divyang brothers and sisters have made this effort even stronger when they won four medals in Paradise.
This victory has not only increased the respect of the country but its strength surprised the countrymen.
Like other citizens of the country, our Divyang brothers and sisters are our invaluable resources and strength.
Today, I am extremely happy that the passage of this law will facilitate employment for Divyangjans.
The limit for conservation of government jobs has been increased to four percent.
The Act provides for the education, facilities and grievances of Divyangjans.
The Government has enacted this new law in terms of public opinion.
Some such categories have been created for the Divyang people so that they can get the right opportunity and justice for the first time.
Thalassemia, Persons with Persons with Disease and Dwarves have also been linked to this category.
My young friends, there have been reports from the field of sports in the last few weeks so that we all feel proud.
It is natural for us to be proud of being an Indian.
The Indian team won 4-0 seats against England.
The performance of some young sportspersons is very appreciable.
The great Kohli of the Test Times has not only done a good job but has also led a good leadership.
I convey my best wishes to all of them.
Even after 15 years, there were good news.
I convey my best wishes to these youngsters for their success.
This success is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey Group.
Our women sportspersons have also achieved great success in the last month.
The Indian women hockey team won the Asian Championships, and a few days back, India's women hockey team won the medal in 18 Asian cups.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all the players of the Christian and Hockey team.
My dear countrymen, the year 2017 is a year of new hope and enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
Last month we all celebrated Diwali.
Every year, during Diwali, I had gone to China border to make Deepavali with the army.
Deepavali Festival has been celebrated in the highlands of the Himalayas with I-TB-P jawans.
Every year I go to the border, but this time Deepavali's experience is totally different.
They were filled with that feeling and not just that, I was witnessing a wonderful response from the countrymen who had conveyed their best wishes to the soldiers.
When I saw these things, I was amazed to think of what he was imagining.
But, really, we don't think it's time for the Diwali festival.
On the contrary, it seemed as if I had joined the festival of Deepawali with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, the spirit, happiness, love and joy that has been shared among the soldiers of our army should not remain in Holi Deepawali alone
May I appeal to you, as a society, as a nation, as a nation, as a part of nature and as a nation, whenever any festival or festival is celebrated, we will remember the soldiers of our army in some way or the other.
The strength of the army will increase by 125 crore when it becomes united with the UN Army.
A few days ago, the heads of all the villages of Jammu and Kashmir met me.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the Panchayat Convention.
Around 40-50 prominent people came from different villages of the Kashmir Valley.
I've been talking for a long time.
Even though they have come to demand for development and development of villages, the recent situation in the Kashmir Valley, the law and the future of the children have come up in a natural way.
A few days back, the boards in Kashmir were together and about 95 of the students were in the examination.
I am sure that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are keen on the development of a bright future through education.
I thank the students not only for their commitment but also for their parents, parents, teachers and all-round village heads.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I had asked for a discussion on Mann Ki Baat today, I confess to everyone.
Everyone wanted me to say something in detail with a note of five hundred thousand rupees.
On 8th November night, I had spoken of a major campaign for the right development of the country.
This is not a simple decision, this is a tough step.
At the time of the decision making, I warned that the effect of this proposal is so bad that it will take at least 50 days to get out of it and then we can move towards normalcy.
It is not easy to recover from the diseases that have spread over seventy years.
125 crore Indians are deeply respected and confident that they are committed to the nation's progress.
This is the reason why we will succeed, the bank and post office personnel are working in adversity.
And when it comes to humanity, they are becoming more active.
When the local bank employees were heard, they immediately reached the house of the elderly gentleman.
Not only that, he's treated.
I'm really impressed with this incident.
They are taking various legal measures to save their black money.
One request, don't play with the poor people to fulfil their unfair interests.
Your injustice is incorporated into the records of the poor, not after the investigation, these poor people will be trapped, they will suffer.
An extremely stringent regulation has been made to bring down the regulations which are being implemented in all respects.
I am a common citizen of District, Tehsil and Village Tirali in Madhya Pradesh.
Your five hundred thousand notes are extremely commendable.
My request is that through Mann Ki Baat a few such festivals where the common man has welcomed this move for the development of the nation even after facing many difficulties.
Thank you internally, you said that the tsunami is coming, but no one can think that you can take such a big step.
By closing the notes of five hundred and thousand, you should have taught corrupt blacksmiths.
Every citizen of India doesn't have a longer time than this.
That's why I thank you again.
"Midea, when I hear such reports through public and government sources, there is a great increase in the risk of working.
People ate there and paid the bill after two or four days when they returned.
This is the strength of my country, where sensitivity and sacrifice are the main ones.
The news that I had made during my election was spread all over the world.
Many countries of the world also learnt the use of tea-level words.
But I didn't even know that there could be a Cha-Bethak
I got the news that it was like a wedding to save November.
In this marriage, only tea drinks were organised for the patriotic invitees, otherwise there was no feeding and ill-fated event because they lacked cash in cash due to the closure of the notes.
Travelers also endorsed the issue and set an example in the fight against black money and corruption of the Maru and the efficient tradition to protect the marriage.
Whenever there is a crisis, the people find a new path, once in a day, I see an incident in Dhekiajuli village of Assam on TV.
Grameen tea workers and these tea workers get a weekly wage.
Four neighbouring women collectively purchased and paid two thousand rupees notes.
You know very well that the poorest of the poor deposit two days ago.
Only fifty percent of each municipality tax falls.
But after the announcement on 8th December, the old notebooks of the people fell on the verge of deposits.
You will be surprised to know that there has been a collection of Rs. 3000 crores in a week.
We're getting such a plurality that we're seeing the direct benefits.
Brothers and sisters, Gram and farming are the backbone of our country's economy.
I would like to especially congratulate the farmers of the country when we are adjusting every citizen to face many problems due to this change in the economy.
I was calculating this year's seeds.
I am glad to see that gum, pulses or sesame seeds have grown this year in comparison to the previous year.
In all adversities, the farmers have taken a new path.
Some important decisions have also been taken by the government, where the Chassibilities and the villages are being given priority.
Our businessmen also created employment opportunities and participated in economic development.
For them, I had made an important decision in the budget last year and the small shopkeepers of villages like the big Mall of the city will be doing business for twenty-four hours and no law will stop them.
Adequate approval has been made to provide loans through the Mudra Yojana.
Millions of rupees have been given to all these small businessmen through the MUDRA Yojana because innumerable people who have been involved in this small business have started the transaction of crores of rupees.
But with this decision, it is natural for all these small businessmen to be in trouble.
You should also download the bank's app on your mobile phone.
Provide POS Machine for credit cards and learn how to do business without a note.
You have seen that big Malls and bullets continue to trade through technology.
Similarly, a small businessman can also make a lot of transactions through a simple User Friendly technology.
There is no chance of any loss, there is a chance to grow.
I urge you to join hands in the creation of a cashless society.
You can facilitate full banking on the mobile phone for commercial growth and continue the business without payment of cash notes.
These are technical methods that are safe, secure and fast.
I want you to not only help in the success of this campaign but also give you leadership, I believe that you can lead this transformation.
I am confident that you can complete all the business transactions in the village through technology.
I also want to tell the working brothers and sisters that there has been a lot of accusations on you.
It's written in the papers that a pay and what is being paid in the hands is different.
Whenever there is complete hard work, there is one standing outside, it has to be divided and laboured, it is considered as a part of life.
In today's new system, we want to have your bank accounts, your remunerative money is deposited in the bank so that the minimum wages are saved.
You get the whole money, nobody cut it.
Today, I want to talk to young friends.
We say that India is 65 per cent of the population of the world.
You, the youth and the youth of my country, I know that my decision has been taken by you.
I also know that you support this decision.
I also know that you will contribute to taking this thing forward in a positive way.
But friends, you're my real soldier, real friend.
My brave young men, can you help me
Just stay with me, it won't work.
You don't have any idea of the world today.
It may be that the elder brothers in your family don't know so much about Arma-Baba, Kaka-Kakima, Mama-Mami too.
You know how online ticket booking is done.
This is a common thing for you and you also use it.
But today, the great work that the country wants to do, our dreams are the Cashless Revolution.
It is true that a hundred percent of the cashless treatment is not possible.
But once we are able to circumvent the Less Cash Corps, the goal of Cashless Corps will not be tolerated.
And I want your active cooperation, time and resolution in this regard. And you will never let me down because we all are citizens of India who wish to change the lives of the poorest of the poor.
You know, how many opportunities are today for cashless transactions, digital banking or mobile banking.
Every bank provides online access.
Every bank in Hindustan has its own mobile app.
Every bank has a daily wallet.
The white of the wallet means e-manibag.
There's a lot of cardboards.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have a RuPay card, which was used very little in RuPay cards.
Since 8th of December, it has been used as a plural for the poor and it has increased by nearly three hundred.
As per the pre-paid cards available on mobile phones, cards are available for banking expenses.
And this is as simple as your Houts Apebarta sent.
The phone with common characteristics can also be a cashtronsphere.
Whether it is smoking or vegetables, milk, news papers, tea, chocolate sellers, everyone can use it unnecessarily.
And I have also emphasized on simplifying this system.
All the banks are working together.
My young friends, despite all this, there is a generation that is strange about all these things.
And you, Aurasbai, I know well that this great work is active.
The kind of creative message that you have given the Houts App - Slogan, poetry, story, cartoons, new imagination, laughter, and this creative force of the younger generation in the face of challenges seems to be that the specialty of this India was born during the war.
And today, when we are in such a big transformation, the basic creativity within you is emerging.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that you need help in this thing and I believe that crores of youngsters of the country will do this thing.
Please do one thing and promise that you yourself will be a part of the Cashless Constitution.
Use the online technology on your mobile phone.
Not only this, everyday half an hour, one hour or two hours, you will tell at least ten families how to use this technology, how to download your bank accounts, how to spend the money in your accounts.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business.
You will have to give leadership to the great campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to free people from black money, the campaign to free people from misery and misery.
I invite you - Come, not just forgiveness, we become soldiers of this change and change.
We will take this fight to liberate the country from corruption and black money and there are many countries in the world where youngsters have changed the lifestyle of that nation.
A mobile system called M-PESA has been used, M-PESA has been named and today Africa has aimed at transforming the entire business market into Kenya in this area.
This country has brought about a big revolution.
My youngsters, I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for taking this mission forward.
I invite every school, college, university, NC-C, NS-S to do this work in a collective manner.
You have seen that the most popular poet of this period, Amitabh ji, is taking the cleanliness drive forward with utmost hard work.
My dear countrymen, today through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your thoughts, your thoughts, your thoughts, your thoughts, you are reaching the Mai Gov-A, Narendra Modi App and keeping me in touch with you.
Now, Mann Ki Baat is being promoted during the 11th of April, but after the end of this broadcast, it is being started in the language of the country.
I am grateful to Akashwani, this new initiative that they have taken will also get the opportunity to connect with the Hindi language everywhere.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, October 2016
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
The festival of Deepavali is celebrated in every corner of India with enthusiasm and inspiration.
India is a country where festivals are seen in some or the other part of the country for 365 days.
We have simply acknowledged the changes in the festivals as per the time and society, by ending some traditional festivals.
But we have been able to see all these things in a very good way that in India, for the entire year, the journey of the festival, its depth, its impact on every person - all these things are connected to the common mantra.
Increasing individuals and individuals, an effort is being made to spread their limited thoughts from Periasmaz to Alexandria.
And that can be done through this festival.
Sometimes there is a festival in India which means a festival of food, but there is a feeling of anxiety among them - a festival of weather and what should be eaten there.
What kind of crops are being produced by the farmers and how the crops can be linked to the festivals, what kind of reforms should be considered for disease-free, etc.
Today, we're thinking about the entire world.
The destruction of nature is a matter of concern.
In India, this tradition of festivals makes nature-loving stronger, it makes everybody better than boys.
And science has inspired the changes in the waters of Purnima and Ambassador to the sea, the impact of any thing on nature and its impact on the minds of human beings.
So far, our vacations have been linked to science with the universe.
Today, when we are celebrating the festival of Deepavali, as I said, every festival of ours is academic, it comes with the feeling of education.
The festival of Deepavali gives a message of 'Tamsoma Suggamay' from darkness to light.
Social fault- Deepawali is a festival of freedom from the shadow of personal fault and darkness.
We all are well aware of the fact that whenever we go to any corner of India, we see the cleanliness drive in every family during the hut of rich and poor people.
Every corner of the house is cleaned up.
The government of any place in the world, the parliamentarians, the rulers and all the dignitaries used to be part of the festival.
The Prime Minister of Singapore, through Instagram, shared the picture of the festival of Deepawali with the entire world with great pride.
Sixty-six women members of the 1960s were photographed outside the Parliament after Indian sarees and the photographs were spread on the social networking site.
And all this has been done for Deepavali.
Deepavali festivals are celebrated on every road in Singapore.
The festival of Deepavali inspires everyone from the darkness to the light.
Deepavali reports of accidents, news of fire, deaths are very worried.
And there is a problem during Diwali - many of the doctors went to Deepavali to celebrate Deepavali with the families.
It's not just one day, but for a long time from Govardhan Puja, Bhai Photta, Love Panchami to Kartik-Purnima.
This is a festival that has been going on for four days.
But it has a special significance - this festival gives a deep message to society.
There is evidence that all the people of the world worship the sun.
Chhat Puja is a festival where the next sun is also worshipped.
It has a very big social message.
This is the time when I express my gratitude to all of you, especially to the people of the country, to express my gratitude to all of you on the occasion of Deepavali festival.
In the last few months, every corner of our army has sacrificed everything for our well-being.
I am happy that the sacrifices, rituals and hard work of the soldiers of the Army-Security Forces have been a major impact in this regard.
That's why I think this island is to be dedicated to the security forces.
I call upon the countrymen to participate in an expedition called Sandesh to Soldiers.
But today, I would like to say that there is no such person in India who has no unlimited love for the soldiers of the country, there is no pride in the army, there is no pride in the security forces.
The way people have expressed it will give more strength to the countrymen.
We cannot imagine the security forces, how powerful they have a message.
Whether it is the Indo-Tibetan Police, the Assam Rifles, the Navy, the Army or the Air Force, or the Coast Guard, I cannot mention the names of all.
When we are launching the Deepawali then somebody is protecting the desert, somebody is protecting the Himalayan peaks, somebody is protecting the airport.
I really want to express my gratitude to the countrymen.
The artist, whom he has conveyed through art, has produced photographs, alpines, cartoons, which he has written in poetry.
I can imagine how proud it is for the youth of my country.
How many messages and messages have come to this hashtag
Mr. Ashwini Kumar Chouhan has composed a poem, I want to read it.
I celebrate the festival, Sahasay, I tell you today, it's impossible you are.
My dear countrymen, one such sister, Shivani has sent me a telephone message from the house of his father and the house of his father-in-law.
Come, let us hear what this soldier family is saying - "Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Shivani Mohan.
Our fauji brothers have got a special boost in the launch of Sandesh to Solzer's campaign in this Diwali.
My family is a soldier family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and father-in-law were the army officers.
This Sandesh has inspired all the officers of the border and all of them in the Army Circle.
I want to say that the army officers and soldiers have to sacrifice their wives and their entire family very much.
My dear countrymen, it is true that not only the borders that the soldiers are guarding, but also their awareness about the various aspects of life.
Our brave soldiers are moving forward towards the nation in every sphere of their lives because of natural disasters or administrative concerns or bringing the enemy back to the right path.
This discussion shows that some families are not able to build household toilets due to lack of money.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the Swachhta Abhiyan, at a cost of Rs.
Thus, Himachal Pradesh has become an open defecation free state.
Nobody goes there easily.
These youngsters will walk on their shoulders with bricks, cement and other toilets and reach the jungle.
More than 150 municipalities and corporations have been declared toilet-free in Gujarat.
Ten districts have also come to this list.
My dear countrymen, the government has made a lot of plans, if there is a better plan after the first plan, then it will have to be abolished.
But usually no one pays attention to this.
There is no need for kerosene in every household in our country where there is gas connection and electricity.
But the government is looking for arrows
I have heard that seven or eight districts of Sergey have been released.
I feel that the entire state will become very simple kerosene free.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always our guide.
What will the country do, what will he do in the future is still considered to be his vision.
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you plan, you will remember the poor and the weakest sections of the country and then think that what you are going to do will be of any benefit to these people.
We have to take another step to get rid of the problem.
Whatever our ancient beliefs, we must remove the distinction between our sons and daughters in society.
This opportunity is a symbol of distinction among our daughters in the Indian society.
Millions of children are evacuated from the vaccination programme and are suffering from diseases.
Mission Indradhanush is such an expedition involving the survivors of the survivors, which enables the children to get rid of the terrible diseases.
The village will be dark in the 21st century, it doesn't happen.
For this reason, the mission of electrifying the village from the base has been going on with success.
Work is going on before the scheduled time.
The effort is to free 5 crore families from smoke and this campaign is also progressing successfully.
Small businessmen, small shopkeepers, entrepreneurs, milk sellers, peasants, peasants, peasants, peasants, peasants, peasants, peasants, peasants, peasants, peasants, peasants, peasants, peasants, peasants etc.
Mudra Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account - a successful campaign to get rid of all the sufficient people.
Through Aadhaar card, the money is directly reaching the bank and direct financial benefits are being provided to the real estates.
It is time to get rid of the casualties in the lives of the common man.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the warrior of this country, who had originated and demonstrated India's unity, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's birth anniversary.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the great leader of the country's solidarity and on the one hand, Smt.
My Lord, you know that 31st October is the birthday of Sardar Patel.
Sardar Patel is a person who has given up his entire life for the integrity of his life and I think he has succeeded in this thing.
He has united everyone, and we can say the country's misfortune or say that Gandhiji was killed on that day.
And we all know what happened in the country after his assassination.
Excellency, I want to tell you how we can stop such unfortunate incidents.
Dear countrymen, this sadness is not one.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has witnessed this incident and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great job of gathering the nation after Chanakya.
But this is also a sad fact that Sardar Saheb had dedicated his life for unity, fought for unity, had the main objective of uniting the country.
But on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar, thousands of Sardar Sahebs and thousands of Sardar Sahebs have been taken to the path of death after the assassination of Smt.
It is the birth anniversary of the great soul who spent his entire life for unity that tortured the Sardar Saheb and this page of history hurts all of us.
But in this crisis, we have to take forward the mantra of unity.
The unity of the diversity is the strength of the nation.
There are many languages, nations, dresses, food and drink, but unity in diversity is India's strength, India's speciality.
Every generation has a responsibility, every government has a responsibility, every government has an example of unity in the corner of the country and develop the policy of unity in the country.
We should protect ourselves and our country from the spirit of discrimination and discrimination.
Sardar Saheb has given us a One India, all of us are responsible for building a Shreshtha Bharat.
The Union Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship
At present, we have heard the name of 'Amul'.
Today, the people of India and India are also aware of every aspect of 'Amul'.
But few people knew that the Doordarshan Sardar Saheb had envisaged the creation of cooperative producers.
We have a live example of what Sardar Saheb had done for the happiness and well-being of the farmers of Amul in 1942.
I pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
On 31st October, we will remember Sardar Saheb wherever we live on Ekta Diwas.
My dear countrymen, after this Diwali, Karthik Purnima is also a part of the festival of light.
Guru Nanak's teachings showcase the right direction for mankind, for India alone, for the entire humankind.
This is Guru Nanak's message, be it service, truth and everyone's good.
Peace, unity and harmony were his mantra.
Every word of Guru Nanak was a campaign to free the society from discrimination, blind faith and evil.
I salute Guru Nanak from the very heart of the festival of happiness.
My dear countrymen, once again, this lamp dedicated to the soldiers of the country, on this occasion of Diwali, my best wishes to you all.
Your dreams, your resolves are all successful.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for your happiness and peace.
My dear countrymen, bow down to you all.
A few days ago, we lost the brave sons of our country in an attack on Jammu and Kashmir's Uri sector.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay my homage.
And that's why I'll tell my countrymen that on that day, I'll repeat what I said, that the culprits will be decorated.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We're proud of our army.
I also want to talk to the citizens of Kashmir today.
The citizens of Kashmir are well aware of the powers of the country.
And whoever realizes the truth, they have started walking on the path of peace, differing from all those powers.
Every mother and child should start at a fast pace and at a fast pace.
Farmers also want their fruits to reach every market in the country.
And in the last few days, businesses have started running smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are our way of resolving all our problems, our path of progress and our development.
We have to scale new heights of development for the next generation.
I am confident that we will sit together to find solutions to all the problems, find solutions and create a better way for the future generations of Kashmir.
It is the responsibility of the administration to protect the citizens of Kashmir.
To maintain law and order, the administration has to make some amendments.
I would like to tell the lawyers that we have the power, the power, the law, the rules and regulations that are required to maintain law and order, to provide the lives of the citizens of Kashmir with happiness and peace.
Sometimes people think differently than what we think.
I've got a lot of opportunities to know in Social Media today.
Every nook and corner of Hindustan has the opportunity to understand the thoughts of all sorts of people and it enhances the strength of democracy.
A few days ago, a student of the 1980s, Harsh Vardhan sent me a different kind of idea.
He wrote: "I am very surprised after the Uri attack.
I had a question in my mind about what I could do for the countrymen.
I'm sorry I'm gonna study three hours a day.
I will be able to serve the nation.
"Brother Harsh Vardhan, it is my pleasure that you can think well in this atmosphere of anger and at such a young age.
At that time, Lal Bahadur Shastriji tried to bring this spirit of the country to the world.
And he inspired the common man through the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jaikisan and showed how to work for the country.
Red Fort Scientists showed that there are more patriotic exhibitions in the sound of bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi used to run the movement, when the movement was intense, there was a need to create a frontline, he used this intensity to further strengthen the constructive work within the society with great success.
We all - the Armed Forces should take up their responsibility, the people of the administration should perform their duties and we should contribute in some or the other constructive work with the awakening of this countrymen, then the country will reach new heights.
My dear countrymen, Small T.
S.
Karthik has written to me through the Narendra Modi App that all the athletes who went to Para Olympics have created history and won their victory.
Both of you are not just an emotional attachment for every person in the country, but also to the athletes participating in Para-Olympics.
Perhaps the performance of Para Olympics and our sportspersons in the face of sports has completely changed our vision towards the disabled from the point of view of humanity.
And I won't forget the words of Deepa boss.
When he got the medal, he said, "I have lost my disability through this danger.
There is a lot of strength in this matter.
This time, in Para Olympics, three women from our country participated in their athletes.
In comparison with other games, physical strength, sports tricks become a bigger word - will power, will power.
You will be happy to know and will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have won the best four medals, two gold medals, one medal and one medal.
Goldman Devendra Jhajjaria brought a second golden shirt after twelve years.
The age of twelve years grows a lot, once you get a goldsmith, it's a bit starving.
But Debendra has shown that the condition of the body has never been allowed to sleep in the old age and he has won the goldsmith after 12 years.
He wasn't born Divyang.
Electronic shock left one of his hands.
You can imagine that the person who was at the age of thirty years of age was the first Golden Peace Prize and the first Gold in the age of twenty-five years.
Mariappan Thangavelu won the gold medal at the hijamp.
Thangavelu lose his right leg at five.
Poverty couldn't stop his mission.
He didn't come from a big city, he didn't come from a clean family.
In the life of the twenty-four years, fighting with charity has provided medals to the nation in the power of vision, despite physical problems.
Athlete Deepa's name is a great victory.
Varun C.
You won a medal at the VATI hijamp.
In our country, in our society, around us, this medal has done a great job in changing our vision for our brothers and sisters.
Very few people know how the people of Divyang showed their sympathy at Para Olympics.
A few days ago, there was a contest at the same place.
Not only this, I was distressed when I came to know that the fourth of those who had not received any medal, they ran for less than the golden agents of the common man. I once again congratulate all our sportspersons.
In the coming days, India is moving forward to formulate a sustainable scheme for Para-Olympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, how wonderful I have experienced in Navsari last week.
It was a very sensitive moment for me.
The Government of India has organised a Mega Camp for Divyangjans and several World Record Camps on the same day.
There I met a little girl Gaurishardul, who didn't see the girl from the jungles of Dang district.
The Government of India has established a world record on the land of development, which is very important.
Six hundred Divyangs, who could not hear, were provided with machines to listen.
This is a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of great pride for our countrymen that the establishment of three world records by the Divyangs in a day.
Dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we started Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of Bapu.
On that day, I had said that cleanliness and cleanliness should be our nature and every citizen should be duties and create a sense of hatred towards uncertainty.
On 2nd October, when two years are over, I can assure you that there has been an increase in awareness about cleanliness in the heart of 125 crore countrymen.
I had said, let us move forward towards cleanliness and let us all say that today everybody has made every effort to move forward in one step.
That is, the country has moved towards 125 crore Swachhta.
Everyone, therefore, might have contributed to the welfare of the poor, the poor, the farmers and the poor.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role in this regard.
I think we still have to move a long way.
If you are healthy, for the honor of the citizens, especially for the honour of the mothers and sisters, we have to stop the practice of open defecation.
And for this reason, a campaign for Open Defecation Free (ODF) has begun.
I had recently visited Gujarat where officials have informed me that this year 22nd October of Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will reach the target of ODF.
Congratulations to all those who have already succeeded in this endeavour.
My condolences to the countrymen - for the honour of our mothers and sisters, for the health of small children, this problem will free our country.
Come on, let us move ahead with our resolve.
I have started a new scheme for young friends, especially those who are used for technologies today.
Everyone has the right to know about the cleanliness mission in your city, which is why the Government of India has given a telephone number - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1818.
And in 2019, we are going to celebrate 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
You can call on this 1969 and not only know the data of the toilets in your city but also ask for new toilets.
You, especially the younger generation.
The Government of India is also calling upon the Corporate World to come forward and invite such professionals to sponsor the youth who are willing to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent as Swachh Bharat Shram in the districts.
And we have to move forward with the cleanliness mission towards the Wasteto Compost.
The chemical surcompanies were told that the compost that was created from the Waste was bought by them.
The farmers who want to go to organic farming should get the necessary juice.
Those who rectify the health of their land, those who think about the health of the soil, those who have been deprived of the use of chemical fertilizers, even if they need such fertilizers in certain quantities, they should supply them.
Shri Amitabh Bachchan has participated in this work as a brand ambassador.
I see that there is a constant new news about cleanliness.
One day I got the news papers - students from Gujarat Technical University went to 107 villages and started awareness campaigns in toilets.
The Government of India has also created one year calendar in their respective districts.
Every department is focusing on 15 days, especially on cleanliness.
My request to the citizens of the country, if you have any kind of links with these government departments, then you are also involved in this campaign.
This time there are about five hundred cities in one lakh posts.
Therefore, one of the people of every city is creating a feeling that we are lagging behind and we will do something good next time.
An atmosphere of competition has been created in the area of cleanliness.
I hope that all citizens will participate in this campaign.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is completing two years.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepavali, I urge you to buy something or the other from Khadi.
This time too, I would request that every family should supplement the fertilizers of the farm, which will bring lamps to the poor.
On 2nd October, however, Sunday, but as a citizen, can we participate in the cleanliness drive somewhere
You should work hard for at least two-four hours in cleanliness and share one of them in the Narendra Modi App.
You can share it if it's a video.
This campaign will be strengthened and new momentum will be achieved by our collective efforts.
Let us remember Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and do something good for the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a different joy and a wonderful pleasure in donating life in an acknowledged manner.
In the last few days, I have seen that when I had requested for abatement of gas, the manner in which the common man has responded is an extremely inspiring event in our national life.
Some youths, small organisations, people from corporate world, students and members of some voluntary organisations of our country will celebrate the Joy of Giving Week in many cities from October 8th to October 8th.
We have to reach out to the underprivileged by encouraging various food items and dresses.
When I was in Gujarat, I noticed that our officers visited different parts of the country and collected the old toys in their homes and provided them with the children of the poorest of the poor.
It was really a pleasure to see the joy of all those poor people.
I believe that in every city where the Joy of Giving Week will be celebrated, the enthusiastic youth will have to inspire and help.
This festival is a festival of monsters.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all the youngsters who are doing this.
Dear Countrymen, on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and his birth centenary is being celebrated from today.
How can the poorest of the poor get the benefit of development
He spoke of his economic vision of work in all hands and water in all lands.
The country will celebrate his birth centenary as a 'Grib Kalyan Year'.
We will be able to get rid of poverty only if the society, the government and all others are focused on how the progress of the farmers will benefit.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on Vijayadashmi, I started the Mann Ki Baat programme.
My thoughts are with the common man of the country which has always been revealed in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audiences for the manner in which you have encouraged this event in the two years of Mann Ki Baat.
I also express my gratitude to the audience that they have not only promoted the event, but have also made every effort to reach the audience in all languages.
I also express my gratitude to all those who wrote letters on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, advising the government system, making special programmes on these letters, creating a platform to solve problems in Samilk.
This is why Mann Ki Baat has become a new medium of social change, not just a few minutes of speech.
What could be the reason for anybody's satisfaction
This is why I thank all those associated with it for making this vision a success.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Durgapuja, Vijayadashmi, Deepavali will begin next week.
New Night or Durga Puja - this ritual of Shakti must be the ritual of the unity of society.
It will be a festival to connect with each other.
But that will be the fulfilment of the real power and then we will celebrate the victory festival together.
Let us come forward with the mantra of unity.
Tomorrow, on the 29th of August, the birthday of the magicians.
The day marks the National Sports Day throughout the country.
I pay my homage to Dhan Chand ji and at the same time I would like to remind all of you of his contributions.
He played a crucial role in the Golden Jubilee celebrations of India in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
We all know the name of Bradman.
He spoke of contempt, He scores goals like runs.
Dhyanchand ji was a playing psychology and a living mosquito of the countrymen.
Once upon a match in Kolkata, he was hit by a hockey stick in the head of the opposition party.
It's only 10 minutes left when the match ends.
Dhananchand ji made three rounds in that 10 minutes and said, I took out the trauma.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is time for Mann Ki Baat, there is a lot of suggestion on the MyGov portal or Narendra Modi App.
Shri Ajit Singh wrote in the Narendra Modi App, Please tell the people about their participation in the education and sports of Mann Ki Baat now because they have made the country proud by winning medals in the Reoulimpics.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has written to you, "Mann Ki Baat".
One of them is North India and one of South India, one of the eastern India and one of the other parts of India.
It seems that women from all over the country have taken up the responsibility of brightening the name of India.
We could have done a better job in the MyGov portal.
The Prime Minister said, Sir, I thank you for winning two medals at Rio.
But I would also like to draw your attention to this thing - what was the meaning of our participation in our other contests
Answer: No
And no one else can do better than you.
Such a remarkable guest has written in the Narendra Modi App, Mann Ki Baat, we need to emphasize our additional educational programmes, particularly children and youth.
Thousands of people have expressed the same feeling.
It's not the way of the infidels that we couldn't perform as hopefully.
In some cases, it has also been said that our sportspersons have not been able to reach the extent of the sports activity.
And in the medals, we are merely two medals.
But if we don't realize this, then we will see that India's sportspersons have shown great sympathy for the first time in many cases.
Look, our innovation in the shooting has made the fourth place right and the medal for a very short span of time has been discovered.
In the gymnastics, Deepa workers also performed excellent sports and eligible for the fourth position.
But how can we forget that he was the first Indian woman in Gymnastics who had qualified for Olympics and for the Final Festival of Olympics
Something like this happened in Sania and Rohan Bopana Jute.
We've performed good results at the athletics.
After 32 years, Lalitabar achieved sports at the Track and Field Final.
Boxing-Obicash Krishna reached the uarter Final, but he didn't get the medal.
There are many players like Ashok, Dadu Bhokanal, Atanu Das, who have performed very well.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot more.
If we do what we've done this time, we'll be disappointed again.
I announced the formation of a committee.
We will go deep into the house and discuss how sports activity is taking place in the world.
We'll build a roadmap for how we can do better.
We have formulated a roadmap for the outcome by 2020, 2024.
I would also request the State Governments to form such a committee and see what we can do in the field of sports.
I would also urge the sportspersons to do brainstorming in an unprecedented manner.
Send their suggestions by examining the States themselves.
We have to prepare our entire architects and I believe that we will have to move ahead with the promise of 125 crore countrymen, 65 percent of the youth and the best of the sports world.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is Teacher's Day.
I have spent some time with the teachers for a few years and spent time as a student.
I learned a lot from all these little boys.
As on 5th September Teacher's Day, I have the same education.
But now I have to go to the G-20summit so I would like to express this feeling of my heart in Mann Kiwat today.
As much as mother's place in life, as much as teacher's place.
This time, after the review, the story of Pullela Gopichand is being discussed again and again.
He's a player, but we've found out how good he is.
I see Gopichand as one of the best trainers today.
On Teacher's Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand, his valour, his self-respect for sports and his personal joy in the success of his discipline.
We always feel the role of teachers in our lives.
The President of India, Dr.
On the birth anniversary of Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji, the nation celebrates this day as 'Teachers Day'.
He always tried to spend his day as a teacher, wherever he did not reach.
Not only that, he always said, "Good teacher is one whose students never lose.
Dr. Radhakrishnan ji has lived a wonderful life even after being the President.
I sometimes feel that I remember a lot of teachers because he was our model in our small village.
Today, I am happy to say that a teacher of mine, who is now the ninth year old, has received letters written in his own hands every month.
If you have photographs with your teachers, if there is a good thing with your teachers, if there is any message to your teachers then you must share it with everyone in the Narendra Modi App.
See, it is extremely valuable to see teachers in the country from the point of view of the students.
My dear countrymen, the Ganesh festival will be celebrated a few days later.
Lord Ganesha removes all odds and we all want our country, society, family, everyone and their lives to be ruined.
Whenever we talk about the Ganesh festival, it is very strange to remember the name of Lokmanya Tilak.
Lokmanya Tilak gave the Ganesh Festival as a people.
Through the Sarvananda Festival, he had converted this festival into a festival of consciousness, a festival of social reform.
Through the Ganesh Festival, there should be discussions on all aspects affecting the lives of the people so that the society becomes a new force and a new dimension through the rituals organised at this time.
However, at the same time, Lokmanya Tilak, who had made the mantra-Swaraj is our birthright, be it the center of all discussions.
Nowadays, not only Maharashtra but also the Ganesh festivals of the country.
Particularly the youth started preparations to celebrate this festival with enthusiasm.
Some people are eager to follow the idea that the festival was started by the people of Tilak.
Discussions on various topics, competitions, alternate competitions were organized.
Everything that affects our society in the process of idol transformation is presented very well.
The Ganesh Festival is being organised by a public education campaign.
Lokmanya Tilak has given us the mantra of 'Swaraj our birthright'.
But now we live in a free India.
Now we will say on this unprecedented Ganesh festival, Su-Raj is our right.
We will proceed to Su-Raj, Su-Raj will be our basic requirement.
Can't we move ahead with this mantra
Come on, I appeal to you.
Festivals are impossible for our lives, but we need to change them as per the requirements of time.
This time many people have written a lot about Ganesh festival and Durgapuja.
They are particularly concerned about the environment.
An individual named Shankar Narayana Pashupati told me: Modiji, do you understand through such a voyage that they do not use the Ganesh idol built by the Plaster of Paris and use the Ganesh idol made of the soil of Pushkarini in the village.
Protecting the environment, protecting rivers and floriculture and conservation of small creatures living in water from pollution transforms the service of God.
Lord Ganesh - Vighanhari
So we're not gonna build such idols that cause destruction.
I don't know how you're gonna take my words, but I'm not telling you alone, many more.
Environment-friendly Ganesh Mahotsav is also a social service.
There's still some time left.
Now we have to stabilise that those old families who built idols, if they build idols from Pushkarini or from the river, they will get the opportunity to earn.
And after the festival, they will be resurrected and protected by the environment.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna will commemorate Mother Teresa on September 4th, 2019.
Mother Teresa spent her entire life in serving the poor people of India.
It is natural for all the Indians to be proud of the fact that this mother Teresa's "Sant" has been accomplished in the service of the poor.
A delegation of officials led by our Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj will be present on the sidelines of the 100th Indian and the Government of India to participate in the 4th September event.
We can always learn something from saints, sages, cattle and cowards.
I hope we'll eat something new, learn and do something good.
Jan Shakti is considered as a form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the people with the five States in the Ganga Safai Abhiyan for clean Ganga.
The villagers present in Allahabad have vowed to testify to Ma-Ganga. They will stop the practice of defecation at the Open Defecation Free Village, drive the toilets, not allow Ganga kenongra or participate in Ganga Safai Abhiyan.
I thank all the Ministers and Ministers of the Government of India who have made this event possible.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of the state who have taken an important step by linking the masses in the Ganga Safai Abhiyan.
Seven to twelve years old boys and girls did this.
The emotional effect of this letter has been that in the next day after receiving the letter, some parents have issued letters to the teachers of the school, they will make toilets at home within a specific date.
A sixty-year-old girl from Koppal district of Karnataka has sat on a pilgrimage against her family.
When the village chief, Mohammad Shafi, came to know that Mallamma was praising for toilets, he spent 18 thousand rupees and built toilets within a week.
The village head of a girl like Mallamma is really prominent.
This is the manpower that can be created to solve the problems.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is now the dream of all Indians.
It's a resolution for someone else.
And some Indians have chosen it as their own.
The Government of India has suggested that all people should make a film on Swachh Bharat for two or three minutes and send this shortfill to the Government of India.
Detailed details of this will be available on the website.
It will be a competition and it will be accomplished by the winners of Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October.
I also tell the TV channels that you have made such a photo-operation.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to deepen our relations with our neighbours, be it ease or be it ease.
A few days ago, an important incident took place. Our President Pranab Mukherjee has greeted the Akashwani Motithri channel in Kolkata.
Now, maybe many will think that the President will make a radio channel
But it's not a common radio channel, it's a very big step.
We've got a dashboard.
We know that the same cultural traditions of 1980 and West Bengal are still moving forward.
Therefore, on the one hand, Akashwani Maitri and on the other hand, they will be presenting various events among themselves, and on the other hand, people from both sides will enjoy the Akashwani festival.
Akashwani has contributed a lot to human interaction.
The Hon'ble President inaugurated it.
I also want to thank the British for their involvement in it.
I also convey my best wishes to the friends of Akashwani who are also playing their role in foreign policy.
This is the source of inspiration for the countrymen to do something or the other.
A few days ago, I received a letter that dragged my mind.
A mother of approximately 40 years old, a retired teacher, wrote this letter.
Unless he ever rejected his name in the letter, I was very keen to tell you all.
He wrote in the letter, "When you made an appeal to put an end to gas, I gave up the gas supply, then I forgot it.
My countrymen, you know, I tried to send a letter to those who gave up their gas supply, and some of my representatives were present on the letter.
I'm trying to write more than one crore letters.
It is not important here that the feelings of this mother are important, and the blessings of millions of mothers and sisters like her help in building the future of our country, it gives strength and confidence.
My dear countrymen, last year we were very worried about ruins, but in this August, we are constantly facing floods.
There have been many floods in some parts of the country.
The State Government, Central Government, Local Administration, Social Institutions and Citizens have been able to do so.
But there are reports in this flood that we need to remember.
Those who are trying to create peace in Kashmir by pushing these young boys, they must never answer these innocent boys.
My dear countrymen, this country is prosperous and rich in diversity.
Thank you very much today
I had the opportunity to interact with the young friends of Delhi this morning.
My belief is that in the coming days, the atmosphere of the youth of every country will spread throughout the country.
We are all aware that within a few days, the biggest sports talent in the world is being organized.
Our ears will be reflected in the Rio.
In Delhi today, the Government of India has organized a massive and beautiful race called Run for Rio, Khelo and Live, Play and Urea.
I will do something for encouraging our sportspersons wherever I live in the next day.
I am also a citizen of 125 crore countrymen, as a citizen, I will be with you to enhance the enthusiasm of all of us.
Come, let us all make every effort to glorify each and every player in the coming days.
Today, when I talk about Rio Olympics, a poem has been published by a poet-favourite student of Panjab Central University, Surjeev Prasad.
Maybe there are many other poets who have written many poems, perhaps somebody writes poetry, write it in every language, but I want to enjoy the poetry that Surajji has taught me.
A young man, Shriman Ankit, reminded me of the death anniversary of President Abdul Kalam ji.
The nation and the world paid tributes to Abdul Kalam ji on his death anniversary last week.
As soon as the name of Bindukalam ji is mentioned, science, technology, missiles and a powerful India of the future are engraved in front of us.
And that's why your government is doing so to fulfil the dreams of Abdul Kalam ji.
If we drag the old technology out of research and invention, we will be out of the changing ages of this world.
And that is why the government has taken a lot of steps to bring research and innovation to new generations of science, technology development.
So, I say, Let us aim to innovate.
And when I say Let us aim to innovate, then AIM means Atal i.
If we have to make the next generation entrepreneurs, then we have to connect with this work.
That is why the Government of India has taken the initiative to create Atal Tinkering Labs.
If we have a strong and improved laboratory, we have a framework for discovering, for innovation, for innovation, for sustainable development.
There is also a need to improve the quality of research in ancient laboratory as it is necessary.
We have to find technological solutions to these problems in everyday life.
We have called upon the youth of today to explore technology, research, discover and find out if you have any problem with your vision.
If the Government of India is able to find new technologies for solving our problems, it will give a special boost to the innovators.
I'm glad people are very interested in this.
When we talked about the Tinkering Lab, more than thirty thousand schools applied and when we talked about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand educational and other institutions applied.
The State Government and the Union Government are working together to help the flooded people.
Even if there is a problem for rains, the minds of every person in the rainy season are relaxed because our entire economic picture is in the center of rain and farming.
Sometimes there is a disease that we have to absorb our lives.
However, if we remain aware, be careful, be cautious in dealing with the disease, then it is easy to save the bone.
Try to be careful about cleanliness, be cautious, try to be safe.
Pay special attention to the children and there is no mistake that dengue is only a poor settlement but it is not right.
Happy, prosperous Elaka is the first to spread dengue.
You must have seen the vision of Doordarshan, but sometimes we have become indifferent to using it.
Dear countrymen, I want to draw your attention to each other.
Life is so complicated, so there is no chance of thinking for itself.
I'm sick, I think I'm gonna get well soon, so let's get some antibiotics.
But my dear countrymen, the habit of eating antibiotics can create serious problems in such a way.
Maybe you're comfortable for a while, but we should stop eating anti-biotics consulting doctors.
The microbial tuberculosis and malaria, which are rapidly transforming ourselves so that the functioning of the medicine is destroyed.
In medical terms, it is called antibiotic registration.
Antibiotics should be used as a result of this.
You must watch it.
When there is talk of health, I want to add another word to it.
Sometimes the thought of life-threatening mothers in our country is very bad.
About three crore women are pregnant every year in our country, but some mothers die during childbirth, sometimes mother dies, some or the other child, sometimes mother and children die.
It is true that in the last one decade, the maternal mortality rate of mothers has decreased, but even today it is not possible to save the lives of many pregnant mothers.
Nobody knows how to destroy his life during pregnancy, infection during pregnancy, high blood pressure etc.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has started a new campaign in the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
According to the exercise, all pregnant women can be tested at the Police Health Centre every month on 9th of every month.
Both mothers and children will be able to save their lives and I would like to say in contrast to the physicians that you cannot afford to pay the poor mothers without paying their dues for one month or nine months.
My doctors, brothers and sisters, cannot wear ourselves for the welfare of the poor for twelve days a year
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is particularly concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
In the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Lord Shiva had spoken to the trees in the field of war.
In Geetha, Lord Shri Krishna says: "Swatth: Sarvrikshanang" means I am among all trees.
There is no such tree which has no medicinal medicinal properties.
The tree that donates crosses her like that tree.
Therefore, the mothers and fathers who talk about their welfare, make good trees and glorify their children.
Our scriptures - Geethahoh, Sukracharya Nidhi or Mahabharata's discipline - are some of the present generations who have performed this philosophy of Shastri in their own way.
Just a few days ago, the example of a daughter of Puna gold is reminding me that she touched my heart.
In the Discipline Celebrations of the Mahabharata, the trees also perform the duties of Parlo, and the golden ones have done such a thing to fulfil the needs of the society, apart from their parents and parents.
The farmers of Narayanpur village of Punnar Taluk in Maharashtra have made their marriage of Natni Swayam in an exemplary manner at the Maruti Mahatra.
Other temples can also start the tradition of sacrificing trees instead of prasad in this year.
Currently, in order to build a house in India, a piece of wood worth crores of rupees has to be imported from abroad.
If we plant plant such trees on our edges, which will be used for building houses and houses, then you can sell them after 15-20 years with government permission.
This can be a new source of income for you, and also to save India from wood imports.
In the last few days, several States have undertaken several drives for this season, the Government of India has also passed a CAMPA Act and more than 40 thousand crore rupees are being disbursed to the States for tree plantation.
Rajasthan has celebrated such a large forest festival in a desert and has resolved to plant twenty five lakh saplings.
It's not a small thing to plant five million saplings in Rajasthan.
He will be able to understand the hard work done by visiting the soil of Jerusalem.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval for the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Bangladesh.
The Union Government is implementing the Green India Mission through this scheme.
There is a bright confluence of forests and fish in Gujarat too.
This year, Gujarat has embarked upon several schemes called 'Aman', 'Ektawan' and 'Shahid Van' as forest fishermen and has launched crores of plantation campaigns.
I can't mention all the kingdoms, but everyone is commendable.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa a few days ago.
This is my first journey, and whenever there is a foreign travel, there is talk of code-organisation, entrepreneurship, defence, sometimes "Mou" is witnessed - all this has to happen.
But I had a pilgrimage to South Africa.
Whenever it is recalled in South Africa, it is very strange to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
As soon as the words of non-violence, love, forgiveness etc. come to the fore, their faces bloom in front of us.
During my visit to South Africa, I visited the Phoenix Settlement, which is known by the name of Sarvodaya, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi.
I am fortunate to visit that train from the Petermaritzburg station on which Mahatma Gandhi had visited, but what I want to talk is that now I had the opportunity to meet those great people who have lived their lives for the equality of all and for the equality of all.
Even after such a great deal of penance, there was no need to take anything on their faces, nothing to do with them.
I was able to see the duties that were spoken in Geetha.
I'll remember that meeting.
There can be no greater mantra than equivalent and equal opportunity for any society or any government.
This is the way for all of us to think equally and think of all.
We want a beautiful life, we want a good future for children - everyone needs differently.
Priority can be different, but the path is one and that is the path of progress, equity, equal opportunity, equal respect and respect for all.
Come, let us feel proud of those Indians who have lived their lives in South Africa as well.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to Artist Burma, he has told me about an incident.
Prime Minister, I am an artist from Bangalore.
A few days back, I have read a newspaper report that a gentleman has committed suicide by cheating and fraudulently losing Rs.
I have enough condolences for his family as a woman.
I want to know what you are thinking about this cheating and e-mail.
"Some people will be able to lose their money.
This is a new way of technological transformation that is spreading across the world.
On the one hand, as technology has played a major role in economic development, people who use it have also landed in the field.
You've made a mistake at some point of time, because they're writing so beautifully that you think it's real.
Your credit card, the number of debit cards, and your bank accounts are empty through technology.
This is a new kind of fraud, digital fraud.
We have to stay away from such joys, be aware, and we have to warn them by sharing such false messages with friends and friends of the Alliance.
Our MPs also take people from their respective areas, meet me, talk to them and talk to them about their problems.
But recently I had a good experience.
Some students from Aligarh were sent to me.
You've got a nice picture at the station.
Not only A-I, he has collected all the plastic bottles or oil cane and planted trees and made virtual gardens.
Thus, they have given a new shape to the parlor.
If you ever go to Aligarh, you must see the station.
There's a new feeling.
This is the example of a change in the participation of the people.
Thank you, especially my colleagues in Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of festivals starts in our country when rains come.
Festivals will be held in different parts of the country in the coming days.
Festivals will be held in the temple, in the sanctum sanctorum, and you will also celebrate the festival at home.
Maintenance is an important festival for us.
Can't you give the mothers and sisters the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan last year
My dear countrymen, we have many people who were born after independence.
I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in a free India.
The launch of 'Bharatcho' was started on 8th August, this year it will be 75 years and August 15th is going to be 70 years of independence.
We are enjoying the joy of freedom and proud of being an independent citizen.
75 years of Indias uit India Movement and 70 years of independence can inspire us, give us a new zeal, and it can become a time for us to take a pledge to do something good for the country.
I hope you will do something good with the inspiration of the nation.
And nowadays technology has become so comfortable that whatever thing you can do with me in your own way, I invite you - let us remember the lives of freedom fighters.
Everybody plans during the holiday.
And the time of this holiday is our season, so I enjoy my taste.
Sometimes it seems that it is very good if you get some time to sleep in the afternoon.
But now you've enjoyed all the fun in the hot mountains.
It is natural for the countrymen to be worried.
And there is also a reduction in all the water conservation sites.
Therefore, there is a lot of sensitivity towards water and efforts are being made to conserve water.
A few days ago, somebody had told me that the village panchayats and the villagers of Hibre Bazar village in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra had given utmost importance to water requirements in the village.
They have decided to release the cultivation of all the crops that are required for water.
Listen, as simple as it looks, it's not as easy.
All of us have made a big resolve.
If any factory uses water and we talk about shutting down the factory, because if the use of water is high, then you know what will be the result.
It's true that I'm talking about a small village in Hebrew, but there are many more villages like this.
I congratulate all the villagers for this kind of good work.
I am told that the Gorwa Gram Panchayat of Devas district of Madhya Pradesh had tried to build a pond in their efforts.
They built around 27 agricultural reservoirs.
This led to an increase in the groundwater level, the water had risen very high.
I'll say they're more congratulating than the railways.
The nature of human beings is that in every danger the day is not at all, it seems that there is a danger in any good news.
Since 106 percent of the rainfall in place of 106 percent, it was felt that there was a message of great peace.
There is still a delay in rains, but the news of good rainfall has created a new zeal.
Farmers need soil, they are used for farming.
Now we can't take the soil out of the village pond and pour it into the field
It will also improve the farms and enhance the power of water conservation.
Can water be harvested by putting stones and soil filled water in a cement house
The water level will grow, we'll have water in the well.
Therefore, water must be harvested as much as possible.
The rainwater will remain in the village and if we do something for this purpose then it will be possible in a very detailed manner.
So, today the water crisis is good, the waste is going on, but we have time in the next month.
Shriman Kumar Krishna asked on MyGov - will the Ganga Safai mission be possible in our lifetime
How many governments have come to power, how many projects have been created and a lot of expenditure has been made.
And that is why it is natural for millions of people of the country like Bhai Kumar Krishna to ask this question.
The Ganga lays the foundation of our Ruji Ruti and the Ganga enables us to renew our strength.
Like the Ganga flows, the economy of the country also gives a new impetus.
We have brought the Ganga to our neighbourhood, but it requires crores of crores of hardships to save it.
This will never be possible without the support of the people.
We have to be a change agent for its cleanliness and cleanliness.
Several projects are underway by the government.
Efforts are being made to fully cooperate with the States on the banks of Ganga.
Efforts are being made to connect social and voluntary organizations with one another.
Several steps have been taken to prevent pollution through environmental pollution and factory.
Every day, there is a lot of drainage in the Ganges.
In order to clean this water, the trash skimmers in Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc. keep on cleaning the water.
All the local organisations have been informed and requested to continue the work and regularise the work of disposal.
Earlier I was told that where efforts were made, it was possible to supplement 3 to 11 tons per day.
So it's true that we're helping to clean up a large quantity of garbage.
There is a plan to set up a Trash skimmer in some other places in the coming days.
And as a result of this, the people of Ganga and Yamuna will soon be able to understand, an effective plan has been formulated to control pollution of pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industry.
The disposal of waste material from the plant of Pulp and Paper Industries black liquid has almost stopped completely.
All these things have proved that we are moving towards the right goal and awareness has also increased.
People are also providing financial assistance for the cleanliness of the Ganga which has led to this work in a very good manner.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Diwas in India.
Today, Panchayati Raj system was started in our country.
Today, the Panchayati Raj system is working with success as an important factor in our democracy.
On 4th April, we celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar and today on 24th April, we are celebrating the Panchayati Raj Diwas.
This is a beautiful concert, the most important part of our Constitution is our village.
He inspired this important task of connecting the village with the Constitution.
In this context, his birth anniversary was started from 111st April to 24th April, 2019, from 10th day of Bapi Gramodya.
It is my good fortune that on 14th April, I had the opportunity to pay my homage at the holy place where he was born on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today, on 24th December, in Jharkhand, where most tribal brothers and sisters are present, I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Diwas.
Once again, I will interact with all the Panchayats of the country.
This campaign has done a great job of awareness.
At the same time, such programmes have been going on in such villages of India for ten days.
I congratulate all the State Governments, the village heads for this.
You have made this opportunity to further strengthen democracy in a very basic and new way for the development and prosperity of the village.
And that is why we will get the same kind of optimistic fruit as much as we will emphasize on the rise of the village.
Shermila called from Mumbai and spoke of her thoughts.
- Prime Minister ji Namaskar
I'm from Mumbai to Sharmila.
You have questions about my school and learning.
For example, there has been a need to amend the education sector for the past several years.
Today, if every family has only one dream, then it is the education of children.
We're talking about home and car.
In a country like India, this feeling of education for children is a big power.
I want to further enhance this feeling of good education to the child and more awareness is needed.
Therefore, I would like to urge all parents and parents to discuss the programme of school with children for a long time.
And if you feel something then go to school and discuss with the teachers.
This surveillance will help in reducing the burden of our education sector.
And it must be possible for everyone to participate.
Every government in our country has given importance to education and they have tried their own way.
And it is also true that for a long time our focus was on building educational institutions, expanding the education system, building schools and colleges, appointing teachers, and many children coming to school.
We have done a great job in the field of education.
Now we have to emphasize quality education.
Our main objective should be good education through the Christian mission.
There was a need to calculate the infrastructure.
Now it is necessary to calculate the success of education.
Until now, how many students have come to school were given importance.
This mantra was kept in full, full and full.
But now we have to focus on providing good and efficient education to the children who have come to school.
You have seen the budget of the present government.
Attempts are being made to focus on education.
It's right, it's a long way to go.
But if we decide about 125 crore countrymen then we will be able to cross this path.
However, it is true that there is a positive change in our thinking too.
You must have noticed that some work has been done outside the traditional concept in the budget.
Ten government universities and 10 disciplinary universities have been asked to free themselves from government bonds and ask them what is the challenge before them to be the best universities
Universities of India can compete with other universities of the world and should also make such competitions.
Along with this, education is as important as skills.
Therefore, technology will play a very important role in education.
Technologies will make our education easier.
And I believe we will understand the results in the future.
Hon'ble Prime Minister, Namaskar
I'm calling Visionor Manna Karnawal.
Young people have an important role to play with reading and sports in todays day.
They need to have a psychological and good leadership qualities so that their overall development can be achieved.
I want you to inspire the youth in large numbers, I want the government to encourage the NCC, NSS and India Scouts and Guides in large numbers.
You have sent me so many proposals that I also look forward to talking to NCC, NSS, India Scouts and Guides PSUs before talking to you.
I have held a meeting on your request and suggestions so that the heads of NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guide, Red Cross, Nehru Youth Centre were present.
When I asked them when they had met together before, they told me that they had attended such a meeting for the first time since independence.
Now I've given them something like this.
I told them why our youngsters will not participate in water conservation during this summer
There was such a conversation with them.
I see it as a light in us.
You must have noticed that the political situation in our country has reached such a level that there has been a lot of talk about this in the last few elections.
On the other hand, the economists talked about reducing gas subsidies.
Some committees also proposed to reduce gas subsidies.
It's all experience.
I had spoken like this but today I want to say that I am proud of my countrymen.
One crore families have given up their gas subsidy on their own.
And this one crore family is not rich.
I see that among those who have left the subsidies, some of them are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers.
However, it has been observed that more than 80 percent of those families who have left the gas subsidy have gone to the distributors and left the gas subsidy.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small issue.
If the government leaves a little bit of tax, then the government can appreciate the weekly TV and newspapers.
In our country, SubCDs are considered to be one of the rights.
But one crore families left the subsidies.
First of all, I convey my best wishes and congratulations to those one crore families because they have forced the political leaders to think in a new way.
The world's economists, if they do this, will present such a financial agenda, which is unimportant to them.
Sometimes I feel that we declare that there will be no ticket examiners on this railway line today.
We can do a lot of tests like this.
If we believe in the people of the country then we can achieve the same.
Anyway, it's your own opinion.
It can't be a government rule, but we can create such an environment.
And this environment is not being created by any political leader, but one family of the country has created this environment.
All breaking news is bad.
Isn't there anything good in this country about 125 crore population
Please change this situation.
He used to say this again and again.
A few days ago, from the papers of a news paper, he wrote a letter to me that on Monday, they will not print any disappointing news.
And everybody wants the common man to get the right and good news.
It is true that if a famous person speaks good words, he speaks good words, he preaches good words, his impact can be seen more than any good news.
Good news inspires us to do good.
That's right, it's very important that you're gonna lose yourself.
If the lamp burns, the darkness will be gone, it will be
Perhaps you know, that is why the government has opened a website on behalf of the government - transforming India - this website has been published with optimal reports.
This is not just the government, but the common man can send any good news to this portal.
You can also join it.
Raviji, you gave good advice, but please don't be angry with me.
We will try to do constructive work together, try to speak constructively, try to reach a constructive goal.
The speciality of our country is Kumbh Mela.
Kumbh Mela can be a center of attraction.
There are very few people in the world who have come to the edge of the river for such a long time.
Peaceful, this fair is completed in a quiet atmosphere.
This incident, in its organisational vision, creates a huge insight into the participation of the common man in the event of event management.
For the past few days, I have seen that some people are uploading the pictures of the Singhast Kumbh.
I want the tourism departments of the Government of India and the State Government to organize a competition on these pictures.
And tell the people to upload a good photo.
He said that we have laid special emphasis on cleanliness, and cleanliness should not only be confined to this process, but also take the message of cleanliness from the Kumbh.
I believe that this Kumbh Mela is a religious and religious fair, but we can build it as a social reconciliation.
I can also build as a cultural area.
This can be an opportunity to reach the village in the Satvaas village.
My dear countrymen, on this auspicious day of Panchmadi Raj, I will meet you once again, thank you all very much.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
I always wait for Mann Ki Baat and wait for you.
This time also I have seen that a lot of letters, comments, phone calls have come in which I have received many stories, suggestions and inspiration.
I think you're testing me.
In such a scenario, I want to share your thoughts with you once again in the context of Mann Ki Baat.
You must be remembered that last time I had discussed a book on Prem Chandji's story and we decided that if anyone reads a book, he will share something with everyone through NarendraModiApp.
I have seen that a large number of people have shared information about various types of books.
I am glad that people have discussed books on science, technology, new innovation, history, culture, trade and spirituality.
Some people also advised me to talk about some more books.
But I have to admit that I don't have much time to read.
But I think we should take this experience forward in the last one month.
I want this book to be an active platform for the corner, readers and writers.
Friends, I feel that earlier I had touched upon the issue of water conservation in Mann Ki Baat, but today I feel that this water conservation issue was like touching your hearts before I was told that it was a favorite thing for the people.
I feel that recently this water issue has shaken the minds of your countrymen.
The country has been working hard to conserve water.
People are sharing information on various traditions.
A lot of innovative propaganda has been launched on the conservation of Media.
This is not only preventing land deficit and crop failures, but also providing water to the fields.
You will be happy to know that the beautiful state of the North-East, Meghalaya, the first state in the country has taken up its own water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
There's a lot of time for this.
We can use these fairs for water conservation.
People from all walks of life come to this fair.
We can organize exhibitions and dramatic exhibitions and provide water conservation along with the festival.
That's why today some children are trying to listen to you.
These are Nidhi Biptu, Manish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Deodharkar, Anant Tewari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aryantesh Ganguly and Hrithik Al-Mand.
You will also be proud of what I say about them.
We all know, "Cancer" is a word that scares the whole world.
Looks like death's on the verge of death.
But these ten children have not only defeated cancer-like traumatic diseases in their lives, but have also brightened India's name throughout the world.
In the field of sports, we often see that after winning a sports event or winning a medal, this is a rare experience, where they have been championed before participating in the competition and they are also in the war again.
The World Children's Winners Games were organised in Moscow this month.
The event is a game of shooting, beard, swimming, race, soccer, table tennis.
Our country has won this medal in the 10th Creation Championship.
Some of them have won medals in different fields.
My dear countrymen, I am confident that you have been proud of the success of India in the remotest part of the sky as Chandrayaan 2.
Sanjeev Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.
Several people like Arvind Rao have written on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov from different parts of the country and expressed interest in discussing Chandrayaan 2.
As a matter of fact, 2019 is a good year for India from the point of view of space research.
Our scientists launched the A-Sat in March and then the Chandrayaan-2.
At that time, it was not possible to examine such a big and important news as A-Sat.
In just 3 minutes, the A-Sat missile was capable of hitting a satellite of 300 km.
India is the fourth country in the world who has achieved success in this special area.
Recently, on 22nd July, the entire country has seen how Chandrayaan-2 from Sriharikota has been brought to the forefront.
All these photos of successful launch of Chandrayaan-2 have given a fillip to the country's pride, strength and happiness.
Chandrayaan-2 is a special kind of mission.
We must trust our talents and talents.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is an entire Indian initiative.
This is an Indian.
It's completely an indigenous mission.
The way our scientists launched Chandrayaan-2 at a record time, at night, all technical problems.
We have faced such temporary setbacks in our lives.
But always remember that we have the ability to cross this barrier.
I am confident that this Chandrayaan-2 expedition will inspire the youth of the country to innovate science and innovation.
It is true that science is the path of development.
We are now awaiting the month of September when two landers and rovers will land on the land of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to invite the students of my country, my young friends to know something about a competitive competition and to invite the youth of the country in a quiz competition.
Asked about space and space, India's space mission, science and technology are the main issues of this questionnaire, what to do with launching rockets, how to send a satellite on orbit or what we can know from this satellite or satellite, A-Satki.
I urge my young friends to participate in this quiz competition and make it more ambitious and memorable.
This will be a historic event in the lives of those awardees but for that you will have to take part in this uiz Competition and get the highest number.
My dear countrymen, you will keep an eye on the fact that our Mann Ki Baat has provided momentum to the Swachhta Abhiyan.
All the efforts being made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that began five years ago has set a new benchmark of cleanliness in collaboration with everyone.
It is true that we have not been able to achieve the ideals of cleanliness, but the way Swachhata Abhiyan has been successful in all public places, it is the result of the will power of 130 crore countrymen.
But that's what we don't stop.
This movement has now moved from 'Swachhata' to 'Samandraya'.
A few days ago, I was watching a news report from Shri Yogesh Sini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Sinny is an engineer who has left his job in America for serving Bharat Mata.
He took the responsibility of not only making Delhi clean but also making it comfortable a few days ago.
He started beautification of Lodhi Garden with his team.
Through Street Art, many areas of Delhi are decorated with beautiful paintings.
When he made the huts beautiful from the walls of the overbridge and school, a lot of people started coming forward and this was how the work was progressed.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh Mela.
I came to know that Yogesh Sini and his team played a very important role in this work.
There is no sound in the colors and the wings, but the impact of the films produced by them is more than thousands of words.
We have also observed this beauty in Swachhata Abhiyan.
It is very important that we make efforts to make waste to wealth in our lives.
That is, we have to move forward to make gold from waste.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I had a fascinating speech at the MyGov portal.
The statement was from brother Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Sopian district of Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote, "Mann Ki Baat".
I am glad that I have played an active role in organizing the Community Mobilisation Programme Back to Village in my state of Jammu Kashmir.
The event was held in June.
I think this event should be held every three months.
Further, the event should be organized online monitoring.
I think this is the first such event where the people were able to speak directly to the government.
After reading the message that Brother Aslam ji had sent to me, I was keen to know about the Back to Village scheme, so I read it in detail and then I felt that it should be told to the entire country.
The people of Kashmir are very interested in connecting with the mainstream of development.
They also found out if the villagers are getting government services.
How can their income be increased
Some more things were added to the programme to make it more attractive.
Children's Sports Competition was organized under the Khelo India Scheme.
The programme was distributed sports equipment, Manerega Platform Power Cards and Tribes Certificates.
The Economic Engineering Camp was opened and the stall was given to the Government Department of Agriculture and Shipping.
Thus, the event had turned into a development festival.
It was a festival of peoples participation, a festival of public awareness.
The common people of Kashmir have lost their hearts in this development festival.
Any officer was so impressed with the warm welcome given to the villagers that they migrated to the village during the two days.
It is a matter of great joy to participate in the Gram Saubhagya Yojana in all these areas and to prepare plans for their progress.
This is a wonderful outcome of a new zeal and a new resolve.
Such programmes and participation of human beings are proof that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir are interested in good governance and the power of progress that always proves more than the strength of the bombers.
Those who want to spread hatred on the path of development and stop progress, they will never succeed in their hatred.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, honoured by the Gyanpeeth Award, said while describing the poem of Shravanamas in a poem, "Agyantagna, Adrag Land Magna", i. e.
As soon as we get closer to this weather, it looks like the smoke of green sheets.
The festival of love of brothers and sisters is also celebrated during this period.
When it comes to the month of Shravan, you will be happy to know that the maximum number of pilgrims have participated in the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave from 1st July till now.
More than 60 pilgrims participated in this journey in 2015, more than 28 days ago.
For the success of Amarnath Yatra, I would especially like to compliment the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality.
Those who have returned their journey have brought the people of that state with warm memories of care and hospitality.
All these things will help in improving tourism in the future.
I have been told that more than 8 lakh pilgrims have visited Kedarnath Dham in one and a half months since the start of four Dham Yatra in Uttarakhand this year.
After a huge natural disaster in 1960, first time such a record number of pilgrims arrived there.
I appeal to all of you, to all those regions of the country where beauty and rainy season looks nice.
This beauty of our country and the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and television, may not be a big teacher.
I convey my best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and lively month of Shravan should bring new energy, new hope and new zeal to all of you.
On the other hand, this is the time when heavy rains are taking place in different parts of the country.
When we watch TV, floods all around the rain, water, traffic jams.
You will have to come out with your family to see another picture of the rains where we are enjoying our farmers, birds, waterfalls and green cover.
Freshness and Happiness bring together both the rains, freshness and happiness, my best wishes to all of you in a sustainable manner.
My dear countrymen, from the beginning of Mann Ki Baat, it seems to be a difficult task to stop, but, in the end, a limit of time.
I'll be back after waiting for a month.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My young friends, all of you are busy with the test now.
Some people may have passed the test.
Some people are undergoing experiments because on the one hand, on the other hand, the T-20202020 World Cup.
Even today, you are waiting for matches between India and Australia.
Today, India will play with Australia and I convey my best wishes to the players of both the countries.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been continuously getting downstairs - losing - backward and backward.
We can't dare speak anymore.
Throughout this year, we can create a soccer-football environment.
In schools, colleges, in every corner of the country, our youth, our school children sweat them.
There are very few people who go abroad, most of them go to their own state for five days or seven days.
Some people go out of the kingdom.
I told you earlier, upload the photographs from wherever you don't go.
We have to take this forward.
You should do the same thing now, but now write something with him - not just the photographs.
And it is said - A traveler without observation is abird without wing.
If you're looking for good things, you're gonna have to make surveillance.
And I'm lucky I've got a lot of chance to travel.
When I was not the Chief Minister, I was not the Prime Minister, and I was a young man like you.
Perhaps there is no such district in India where I have no chance to go.
Tourism has a major role to play in creating life.
And now the youth of India are going on tourism with courage and they are going to gather courage.
I think it's a very good example.
Our youngsters should be brave, wherever they are, they should be able to reach.
I want to specially thank Coal India.
Then stay away.
When we look at the pictures of the people there, we think it's good to go there.
And it's a matter of fact that the coal is black, that's why people get away from the mine.
But that coal mine has been developed as a tourist centre
And I am glad that this is the beginning, so far more than ten thousand people have visited the environment friendly mines tourist centres in Saon village near Nagpur.
This place gives you a chance to see new things.
I hope that if you go out on vacation, you can do something about cleanliness.
Maybe it's not scientific, but it's happening.
Can you also not give importance to the cleanliness of the tourist centres as a tourist
My belief is that our young friends will definitely help in this regard.
There is a lot of employment in tourism.
India is still lagging behind in tourism in comparison to other countries of the world.
But if we believe that our tourism needs to be strengthened then we can definitely attract the world.
We can drag a large part of the world to ourselves.
And then we will be able to provide millions of youngsters of our country with the help of employment.
Whether it is the government, the institution, the society or the citizens, all these things have to be done together.
Come on, we do something for him.
My young friends, the holidays come and go away - I don't like it.
You guys think about this.
Would you like to let your vacations, your important years of life and these moments of importance go away like this
How many things I say - you can think of it.
Can't you make a pledge to add even greater qualities to your personalities on this holiday
If you don't swim, you can swim on vacation.
If you don't know if you don't run a bike, you'll learn to ride a bike on holidays.
Do something for your personal development, for your ability, for your workforce.
Not only the areas I have talked about, but there is a greater opportunity to work.
This will enhance your personality and your confidence.
Friends will talk about it.
Some suggestions have been made at the MyGov portal for Mann Ki Baat this time.
Like my name is Abhiyan.
I am delighted to do this, and I have also become friends with many birds on this occasion.
I request you to reiterate this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to this boy by the name of Abhyantarvedi.
He reminded me of a good job.
Afghan told me he's been doing this all year and many birds have become his friends.
The great poet of Hindi, Mahadevi Burma loved birds.
In his poems, he wrote: "I will not let you go away, I will fill you with glory, I will fill you with sweet cold water.
Come, let us make this conversation of Mahadevi ji useful.
I convey my congratulations and thank you - you have reminded me of very important things.
From Mysore, the entrepreneurs have conveyed a lot of condolences to all of us.
He said the milkman, the newsman, the postman, came to our house.
Sometimes the dresser, the cloth seller goes that way.
Have we ever asked them to drink water on the days of summer, have we given them water
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have heard a lot about Digital India.
Some people think Digital India is the world of young people in town
If you download this app on your mobile phone, you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and weather.
The App has a variety of topics such as market conditions, pickery market conditions, availability of good crops, availability of suitable medicines etc.
And if you put any questions in front of them, they will answer and explain to you.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
This time is very important for farmers before the beginning of farming.
Can't we find those old places once again, clean them up so that they can harvest too much water
Now you might have seen that efforts have been made to build 5 lakh ponds and ponds of farm land.
Under the 'Manerega' scheme, emphasis has been laid on water conservation.
You should prepare a plan to save water from villages, to save every drop of rain in the villages and to live in the villages.
You should join the various government schemes in order to create a mass movement for water conservation.
There are so many villages in the country that are very progressive farmers and are very conscious citizens who are doing this thing.
But we have to move forward.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to tell you one more thing.
I have seen how many modern techniques have come and how many changes have been brought about in agriculture.
But these technologies will now have to reach the farmers' fields.
And now the farmers are saying that we need to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers.
I convey my best wishes to you.
The excessive use of chemical fertilizers has made our mother sick.
But if good spices are given in excess quantity, what do you like to eat
No matter how good it is, excessive use of these serpents will be harmful.
Everything needs to be used.
It also reduces the cost, saves the money.
I hope that we will complete this work with full focus on the essential work for water conservation.
The more the water will be saved, the more the farmers will benefit and the more life will be saved.
My dear countrymen, April 7th is World Health Day.
The theme of World Health Day is Beat Diabetes this year.
Diabetes is a disease that calls all other diseases.
Once someone has diabetes, then many patients enter their homes and their bodies.
According to statistics, in 2014, there were 6. 5 crore diabetes patients in our country.
Three percent of the deaths are due to diabetes.
Two types of diabetes Type 1 and Type 2.
Type 1 is hereditary, mother-father, there is a possibility of children.
And Type-II's the reason for bad luck, old and extra weight.
The entire world is concerned about diabetes, so on 7th, the theme of World Health Day is Diabetes.
We all know that the biggest cause of diabetes is our lifestyle.
Coincidence is getting less.
There's no sweat.
I'm not walking.
We're playing the game online.
Nothing's happening in offline.
If you're interested in yoga, then practice yoga.
Otherwise, run at least.
If every citizen of our country is healthy then our India will be healthy.
And now all the opportunities are near the hands, they become very easy.
You must think about it.
On 24th March, the world has witnessed the Generation Day.
When I was a kid, I was scared when I heard the tuberculosis.
But when tuberculosis was the cause of death, we were afraid.
But now we don't care.
The number of tuberculosis patients in our country is very high as compared to the entire world.
If we get rid of tuberculosis, we need proper treatment and proper treatment, we need proper and complete treatment.
If you leave it in the middle of the treatment, you'll get a new problem.
Tuberculosis is a disease that everyone around knows, they can also suggest check-ups.
This means that it's a disease that needs a quick test.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is going on in this regard.
There are more than 13,500 Microscope Centres and more than 4 lakh DOTs providers.
Treat properly and continue to cure until the disease is cured.
I appeal to you, whether it is tuberculosis or diabetes, we have to defeat them.
India has to be freed from these diseases.
But this will not only be done by the government, doctors and medicines until you come forward.
And that is why I appeal to the countrymen today, come, defeat diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, several important days are coming in the month of April, especially on April 14th, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.
His 125th Birth Anniversary was accompanied by smoke all over the country.
The birthplace of a Mahu of the Fifth.
His study in London, Digha in Nagpur.
I am fortunate that this year, on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar will be lucky to go to Mahu.
Baba Saheb has given us a lot of things to become a responsible citizen of the country.
We can pay tributes to him as a citizen of the country following that path.
This festival is celebrated in different states and in different names.
Someone calls it 'Nab Samvatsar' or 'Gudi-Papa' or 'Varsha Pratipada' or 'Ugadi'.
You know, I have said this thing last time that my Mann Ki Baat programme can be heard on your mobile phone at any time in almost 20 languages.
You just have to call a missed call.
This facility is just a month, and I am happy that about 35 lakh people have benefited from it.
You can also write the number 81908 81908.
I repeat, 81908 81908.
I'll be happy to join you.
I want to be your body in this regard.
As much as you are concerned about the tests of your children, I am so concerned.
However, if we change our thinking process about the test, we may be free from worry.
I have said in my earlier Mann Ki Baat that you must send me through your suggestions Narendra Modi App.
In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to parents, examiners and teachers in a special way.
I want to tell you something from what I've heard, what I've been told.
I know, the test is going to start in a few days.
How many percent of the tests will be available
I want to say that you set a target for yourself.
Don't put pressure on yourself for someone else's expectations.
You must work hard, but you can set a goal for yourself and try to touch this goal.
When I was playing cricket, I had many expectations.
As time has passed, people's expectations have also increased.
It was very important for me to find a solution.
I thought that I would expect myself and set a target for myself.
And if I set my own goals and fulfill that goal then I must do something good for the country.
And I have always tried to fulfill this goal.
My goal was always on words and that is why the goal has been fulfilled gradually.
And I believe that God will give you good results.
Good luck
Never fall under the pressure of hope.
You have to prepare your future.
You set yourself on your own.
Why would I waste my time to compete with others
Why don't I try to break all my own records
Friends, don't worry about the number of tests.
Life should always be driven for a greater cause - a dream should be fulfilled.
Whether we are moving on the right path or whether we are moving ahead properly, this test is done by him.
If there's something wrong with fulfilling the expectations, don't be disappointed.
Create a more hard work and a spirit of effort.
Thousands of people have spoken in my App through mobile phones.
Shrey Gupta says that the healthy body is healthy.
Students, you must focus on health with your studies so that you can test properly.
Anyway, for 365 days, we must be favourable to our dreams and resolves every day.
I agree with Shri Prabhakar Reddy, who specifically asked him to sleep at the right time and asked him to revise at dawn.
Admit cards and other papers should be accessed beforehand in the testing centre.
I couldn't talk about it, because I'm a little uneasy about sleeping.
And when I spoke of sleep, don't think I'm sleeping for the test.
Don't misunderstand, I'm talking about sleeping for a tension-free test.
Don't do that.
I believe you won't do that.
There is a need to strengthen the foundation of chaos and success in life.
Creation is the strong foundation of life.
The disorder and disorder that works in the morning, works in the afternoon, he feels like work is done.
I don't think anybody's small.
Do it properly, do it.
Friends, I've seen sometimes two examiners.
One, what those who read, what they learned, what they thought was good.
Secondly, there are other test takers who don't know what kind of questions, what kind of questions will come, can we solve
I have seen these two kinds of tests that will not be difficult.
A lot of tests are matched with the Dad's game.
When you're playing, you don't know what the boat's rice will come, just like you don't know.
So if you're calm, eat and drink properly, sleep enough, you'll see that your brain can remember the correct answer to the right question.
Don't be very highly expecting - see this as just a challenge. Can I imagine what I have learned for years can I answer these questions
So be calm, sleep well at night, don't be too self-reliant, but don't be negative.
I've seen that your exams are better than your fears about the test.
So, be confident and best wishes for you.
Viswanathan joy is truly very important.
His eyes don't turn around.
We have heard that Arjuna's life was the only sight of the bird.
Similarly, I have seen the joy of Viswanathan and his full attention at the time of sports and that is the peace of his inner world.
Don't talk to your friends - stay alone, be comfortable, we will change the leaflet to the last minute so that you can never calm your mind.
That's why you smile a lot of smiles and smile with your friends.
But if the water isn't calm, nothing can be seen.
I feel that if we take some rest then it will be good. That's why I have created a system for myself.
Deep breathing.
Let's take a deep breath three times.
Sometimes it crosses 30, 40 or 50 seconds, but I feel very quiet that something can be understood.
Maybe it's my experience, but it can help you too.
Because most of the time we see, we continue to hijack the tests, what is right and what is wrong
If parents are educated at home, they are teachers then they should write what I have written in the entire field.
We're stuck in it.
Friends, you don't do that.
That's what happened during the test.
Talk to the people of the family about something else.
If you go somewhere with your parents, remember that.
Spend at least half an hour of your exam.
In this context, we are trying to reach the world with his views on the importance of Traditional Monsoon.
Respected Murari Bapu gave some important suggestions for the students.
And no matter what the situation is, admit him.
In my experience, we can be psychologically pleased and happy to adjust the situation.
Without putting any stress on it, it will definitely be successful.
And if you succeed, you will not be sorry for failure.
We are grateful for the revered Muraribapu's advice to all of us.
Friends, today I want to talk.
My Mobile App Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, Shri Sushant Kumar, Shri K.
Yes.
But friends, if I tell you that if you start yoga from tomorrow morning then it will be wrong to you.
However, those who practice Yoga will not be able to do so today.
If you're doing yoga, do it.
If you do not practice yoga before examining yourself, then contact someone who knows Yoga around you, who can do it within two-five minutes.
Why don't you hurry
Make yourself timely so that you can get timely tests when you get stuck in traffic jams.
Otherwise, such a situation creates anxiety in the mind.
And one thing, the orders on the question papers, maybe the time will be wasted if they are read.
I have seen that whenever we get the question papers, we don't understand the truth, but if the instructions are read properly, we can adjust ourselves with them and decide how to move forward.
It's very important to ask questions.
Rao stressed on patience, he advised all the test takers in a very short time.
That's what I call my young friends.
Remember that we have a lot of opportunities in the country.
What you need is jeed, self-sacrifice and ability to lie down.
With all these qualities, you will be successful in all the tests and efforts.
This is the power of science and the power of scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for encouraging the children of the country, for their determination, fortitude and hard work.
Stay on, guys. Stay on.
If you're on your way, you'll be scared.
The bright future is waiting for you to do good.
My app Ruchika Dubs shared his test experience.
We all know about Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the electrical bull, and we've read about him in our syllabus.
However, today the light of that power - the light of that bubble illuminates the lives of the people, that is why the seed of success lies in failure.
He had no legislative education in mathematics, no special training.
Harry Potter is popular all over the world today.
But it wasn't the beginning.
He had to face a lot of difficulties.
Nowadays, the entire family, schools and teachers are connected to it.
But without the cooperation of parents and teachers, the situation of the students is not suitable.
As teachers, parents and even senior students prepare a team of students, united and coordinated, the study becomes easier.
Shri Keshav Vaishno Devi has written my app, he has complained that parents should not put too much pressure on students to get more numbers.
Just encouraging to be ready.
They have to think that they're unconscious.
Writing victory, don't put your hopes on children.
Take their courage as much as possible.
Please don't press.
If he's talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Friends, I am sure about one thing that I especially want to tell my young friends - our present lifestyle has changed from our ancient generation.
We want to move forward with science at the same pace.
Friends, I am talking about this because today is National Science Day.
Every year we celebrate the day of February as National Science Day.
On February 1928, Sir C.
Raman announced his discovery of 'Raman Fact'.
For this discovery, he received the award.
This is why the day of February is celebrated in the form of National Science Day.
Asked the Genius of Science.
Science-discipline, attraction for science creates new ideas and on the other hand, science and technology cannot create new ideas.
I am C.
I salute Raman and request all of you to enhance our interest in science.
Friends, sometimes it is too late to achieve success. And when success comes, the vision of the world changes.
Perhaps you were not aware of the fact that you were busy with the test, but I would like to remind my countrymen that you probably have heard that there has been a very important discovery in the world in science.
Our scientists have identified their powerful gravity waves.
I convey my heartiest congratulations to all those scientists.
Our scientists will continue their efforts to carry this research forward in the future.
India will also participate in international efforts.
My countrymen, we have taken a positive decision in the last few days.
There are two such systems in the world.
India is third.
I once again thank all the scientists - best wishes.
My dear countrymen, this is the number one. You will be able to hear my Mann Ki Baat from tomorrow with a missed call.
You will also hear in your mother tongue.
81908 81908, I reiterate: 81908 81908.
Friends, your exams are on.
I'll have to test tomorrow too.
125 crore countrymen will take my exams.
February 29 - It's Lipp Year.
But yes, you must have seen how healthy I am, how confident I am.
I'll be tested by tomorrow. You'll start.
If we all succeed, the entire country will succeed.
Thanks a lot
This is my last episode of Mann Ki Baat in 2015.
The next episode will be Mann Ki Baat in 2016.
A few days back, we have done Christmas and now we are preparing to welcome the New Year.
India is a diverse country.
There are different festivals.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where the economy is also connected with the festival.
The way the poor sections of the society live up to the festival.
I also convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on Christmas and my best wishes to the people of English for the New Year 2016.
May 2016 bring a lot of happiness for all of you.
New joy, new hope and new resolve should reach your new heights.
Whether it is terrorism, global warming, natural disasters, other humanitarian factions, it is free from everything.
You know, I'm using technology completely, so I know a lot.
Many go out of the Christmas holiday.
The tourist destinations should be focused on cleaning up the tourist destinations where tourists visit and dwell.
The more clean our tourist destinations, the more bright the pictures of India in the world will be.
I welcome the vision of Mr. Sauleshwarkar and deliver his message to the countrymen.
He did a remarkable job, printed in newspapers.
So I think I'll get it to you.
Dileep Singh Malviya, a resident of a small village, had established that if a villager provides the necessary equipment for toilets, he would make toilets without any hesitation.
He has worked hard in Bhojpura village so far and has constructed 100 toilets.
I convey my heartiest congratulations and best wishes to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes we can hear desperate things about our country.
Our country is moving forward at a rapid pace as a result of all the peoples collective efforts.
125 crore countrymen are moving ahead together and taking the country forward.
We have achieved a new reform in the field of improved education, new technologies and sustainable new opportunities, banking opportunities from taking citizens under insurance protection, new reforms in the era of international trade and new business infrastructure.
For those people who could not reach the bank's doorsteps, we have made easy access to loans through Mudra Yojana.
When every Indian came to know that the entire world was attracted towards Yoga and when all the countries of the world were united by celebrating International Yoga Day, we believed that this is our country- great India.
When this kind of feeling is created in our minds, a very surprising picture appears in front of our eyes.
Cleanliness is being heard in every household.
People's participation is also increasing.
But I believe that through the medium of publicity all these villages will be able to bring the hopes and aspirations of the people there to the entire country.
Therefore, the biggest benefit would be that all government employees associated with this scheme will be encouraged and happy that they have done something that will bring about a major change in the lives of the people of the village.
Is it not necessary to reach this happiness to the farmers, the poor, the youth, the women and everyone
No government has worked, no government has worked, no information is required to be reached which they cannot be deprived of what they can achieve.
They must be informed about their rights.
We must be conscious of the right and good messages that are being delivered to the people in large numbers.
It's a serving job.
I made a little effort to do this like me.
I can't do everything myself, but I should do what I'm saying.
A common man can download the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone and contact me.
You should also join this effort like you.
I want to reach 125 crore countrymen without your help.
Come, let us all encourag the common man by reaching out to the common man about the right to good and deserving rights.
My dear young friends, I was from the Red Fort on 15th August, Start up India, Stand up I.
Since then, every department of the government has spread the message that India can become a start-up capital.
There is a new thinking, a new strategy for everyone, because the world cannot move forward without a new innovation.
There are talented young friends in every corner of India, they need only opportunities.
We will take this project forward by requesting all the State Governments.
On the 16th of January, I will meet you and discuss in affordable manner and wait for your advice.
There are crores of people in this country like me who are inspired by the ideals of Swami Vivekananda.
The birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated as the National Youth Festival from January 12, 1996.
This year, the festival is scheduled to be held at Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12th January to 16th January.
Can you give me some advice about this young man
My special request to the youngsters is to send your suggestions directly through the Narendra Modi App.
I want to know and understand your mind.
This will be reflected in the National Youth Festival and I will give appropriate advice and information to my Government.
Friends, I have been waiting for your opinion on the youth festival through the Narendra Modi App.
Ambedkar, Gujarats visually impaired teacher, Dilip Chauhan, performed the Accessible India Day at his school.
I have received a very encouraging response from the students and inspired them to help the physically challenged persons in the society.
I think this effort is an important step.
Dileepji, thank you very much.
You're doing it yourself.
You are well aware of these problems and you must have faced a lot of problems.
When there is an opportunity to interact with such people in the society, I feel that there is a lot of thinking in my mind.
We express our vision for their problems as per our thinking.
Some people are accidentally victims of organ loss.
Again, some people are born victims of physical disabilities.
A lot of words are used for identifying all these people and a lot of thoughts are being made about these words.
But it always seems that the use of such words for these people is not right, it is not honorable.
It's true that the word has a special significance.
This year, the Government of India has launched the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
Since I was supposed to be present at that event, I was thinking about it.
During this period, I felt that God has given some incompleteness in his body or one organ of which does not function properly, we know him as a disabled person.
But whenever I meet them, I realize that there is something incomplete in our eyes, but God has given him some extra power.
These are the people who have one or many organs that have divine power, which are not in the body of ordinary people like us.
I like this word.
Can we deny the word 'Dibang' instead of the word 'Dibang'
On that day we started 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
Physical and Virtual - We will strive to improve both infrastructure and make the persons with disabilities easier.
We need a lot of things like schools, hospitals, government offices or bus terminus, railway station slopes or ramps, easy parking and lifting, braille clubs etc.
We are providing gas cylinders in our country.
The government has brought about some changes in this regard.
With the help of Jan Dhan account, Aadhaar card etc., the world's largest Largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme has directly reached the bank accounts of the beneficiary.
I am proud to inform the countrymen that this is the Genes Book of World Records for successfully launching the biggest Direct Benefit Scheme.
This project, known as Pahal, has been very successful.
By the end of November, nearly 15 crore LPG literature has been benefitted through the Pahal scheme.
Nowadays, the MNREGA scheme has ensured the livelihood of rural people.
There were several complaints regarding the funds under this scheme.
Now, in most places, this money is directly reaching the bank accounts of the workers.
There was a lot of problem with the students' scholarship money, there were complaints.
This system has also been started for them and it will be carried forward gradually.
About 40,000 crore rupees have been reached directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries under various schemes.
According to a general calculation, about 35 to 40 projects have been included in the Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, the Republic Day.
This year is the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the founder of the Constitution.
It was a very good experience for two days in the session of Parliament to discuss the Constitution.
Emphasis has been laid on duty in the Constitution.
There is a lot of duties while voting, but why shouldn't there be any duties in everyday life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, what can we do in schools, colleges, villages, cities and various social organisations to organise our preliminary duties, debates and poetry competitions
A new thought has come to my mind. Before 26th January, you can write to me in your mother tongue or in English or in Hindi, writing poetry.
I want to be aware of your thoughts.
You can send it to my Mygov portal.
I am very keen to know about the duties of the youth of our country.
I want a small offer.
When we observe Republic Day on 26th January, cant we make arrangements for cleaning and sustaining the replica of the great saints founded in our cities by the citizens and school children of the country and maintaining the cleanliness of the replica sector
I'm not talking about government.
As a citizen, we are equally indifferent to the encouraging and emotional preservation of these great men.
For society, can we not transform it into our natural habits for the country
On 26th January, let us all together be aware of the cleanliness of all these statues built in honor of the great saints.
For this, the common man, the citizens will have to come forward voluntarily.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2016.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
With new zeal, business and employment will also start.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas must have begun.
Festivals have a different significance in the lives of society.
Sometimes the festival works to remove grief, sometimes or sometimes it creates new zeal.
But sometimes it becomes very painful when there is a crisis during the festival.
There are reports of natural disasters everywhere in the world.
There are reports of all natural calamities that have never been heard or thought.
On this occasion, I express my condolences and condolences to all these families.
The State Government uses utility to rescue and rescue.
The central government also works shoulder to shoulder at all times.
Presently, a team rescued by the Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I believe that despite this danger, Tamil Nadu will continue to move forward at a rapid pace in the new era.
When these dangers are happening around, the necessity of preventing them is also increasing.
Now his form has changed.
Enhancing its capacity building in every field has become a necessity.
Government, various societies and people, even small organizations, have to work in a very scientific manner in the Capacity Building.
I am glad that this initiative has been launched through a tele-tock exercise and a programme of excellence in the countrys circuits in Delhi.
You are well aware of the problems faced by the farmers in the field of biotechnology.
This is our nature and generation. This is how the generations are working to raise the pace of farming.
Initially, there was no concept of the damage caused by it. Therefore, we are doing it.
Secondly, there was no training for what other methods could be.
When the impact of these dangers started falling on the city, people would be able to overcome it.
The sorrow you have expressed is perfect.
First of all, we have to provide proper training to our farmer brothers and sisters.
It will save time, labour will be saved, farms will be ready for the next crop but it will not be right.
The harvest is very precious.
It's a biological serpent.
We're burning the food and destroying it.
This is not the end, if these roots are swallowed up, they can also be animals.
The upper layer of the farm is burning to burn this heel.
The upper level of our land burns, which our ancestors drive the earth to death.
That's why we have to play a vital role.
Make this harvest mixed on the ground, it'll be cured.
If this biological surplus is used in that land, it can be doubled.
I once had the opportunity to talk to the artisans.
They spoke of a very good experience.
Earlier, when they used to cultivate bananas, they used to spend five thousand rupees per hectare, ten or fifteen thousand rupees per hectare.
If we hadn't got a tracker to clean it, the heels would have fallen like that.
Some farmers then pieces of six or eight inches of pieces of pieces of land.
Because there is so much water in the roots of that banana plant that if there is any tree, tree or vegetation, there is no need to give water separately for three months.
The water that lies on the edge of the banana keeps the crops alive.
Those who had to spend their money before cleaning their hips are earning from them.
Our farmer brothers are not less than any scientist.
Dear Countrymen, on December 3, the entire world will celebrate International Day of Resistance.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had talked about organ donations.
I also spoke of the helpline of NOTO for organ donation.
On 27th November, the National Organ Donation Day was celebrated.
Chitravenetra Rabina Tandon, along with many other dignitaries from the society, participated in it.
Organ donation can save valuable lives.
It can bring immortality in a way.
When a part of the body is replaced from one body to another, it brings a new life and it also brings a new life.
What could be greater than this
A national level competition was organised through MyGov. in portal to create a logo, a donor card and a slogon in this regard.
Physical and mentally retarded people have immense courage and strength.
But if we change our vision, change our attitude towards them, then they can become the inspiration for our lives and work.
We're crying when we're in a small problem.
That's why they are the source of our inspiration.
I appreciate the determination of their lives, their energy, their way of fighting with life and their incredible efforts to make the problem stronger.
I want to talk to Javed Ahms today.
He had to explore some of the kidneys, microscopes and nerves of the terrorists.
There was a serious injury in the spine.
He lost his ability to stand on his own, but he didn't obey.
The terrorists couldn't defeat him.
Without any kind of anger or anguish, a innocent person is suffering from this kind of damage, a life-threatening crisis is faced with sympathy and sympathy.
This is his greatest mental stability, he added his life to the service of society.
He has not been empowered all the time, but for the last twenty years, he has been appointed for the education of children.
Today, as an admirer of social science and as an admirer of social service and conscious citizens, he is making an unprecedented revolution.
Can the people of every corner of India not get inspiration from the life of Javed
I will specially recall the life, penance and self-employment of Javed Ahmad on December 3.
I am talking about Javedra only from time to time, but I know that every corner of India is a lamp of inspiration that shows life in a new way.
3-December, let us remember all those inspiring people.
Our country is a big country.
There are many things that are dependent on the government.
The government and the government have a dedicated relationship with the middle-class, lower middle class, poor, oppressed, exploited and deprived.
There is a network of hope workers all over the country.
They did a lot of social work in India.
There's a lot of outbreak in malaria.
Yamuna Monising, a hopeful resident of this village, has decided not to let anyone in his own village die in malaria.
Someone in the village, even if there is a small fever, will reach that house immediately.
He started treatment on the basis of the primary treatment he was taught.
Emphasis on the use of pesticides in every household.
Just as one needs to sleep and take care of ones own child, this hope worker, Yamuna Monising, has fully dedicated himself to protect the entire village from mosquitoes and has created all villages for prevention of malaria.
How many such Yamuna Monitoring are there
There are millions of people around us.
We'll try to see them with respect.
These people can become very powerful in the country.
All our times are happy and sad.
I am honouring all the hopes and accomplishments through Yamuna Monising.
The first is the incident related to Swachh Bharat, the second is related to 'Azhagya Gram Sadan' and third health issues.
I request you to see these e-books.
Not only yourself, but also the others.
You might be able to read these things and add something to it.
Then send it to mygov portal.
There are many such incidents that do not come to our notice but are the real power for the society.
The exact illustration is our biggest strength.
I appeal to you, come, join you in the work of nation building.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worried about climate change.
World Warming, Climate Change is now the lightest and worrisome thing.
The temperature of the world should not increase, it should be thought and accountable for everyone.
The first way to avoid temperature rise is energy conservation.
I once said that the night of full moon should be bathed in the full moon after shutting down the light of the road and saving the electricity.
You should feel the ray of that moon.
I had a chance to see a friend who sent me a link to this kind of vision.
A woman named Nurjaha in Kanpur who cannot be seen on TV that she has got a chance to learn a lot, has done something that no one thought.
He is working towards providing electricity to the poor by using solar energy from the sunlight.
He's fighting darkness and brightening his name.
People take the calls in the evening and leave them in the morning to charge.
About three to four rupees per day, but there is enough light in the house.
This salt has been recharged by this solar power in the factory all day.
Look, the world's largest people are doing a lot for climate change, but there is a way to inspire all of them.
Anyway, the name of Mirzahan is to illuminate the world.
He's spreading light like this.
Congratulations to the Hon'ble Prime Minister that he has started a scheme with a Mudra bank.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana Fund the Unfunded.
Anyway, the speed at which I want to move is still coming.
Most of these helpers, most of the tenacious nations, peninsular tribes and other backward classes, who are working hard on their own, are trying to run their families with dignity.
Absolutely encouraging.
I've got a lot of information.
Someone told me that there is someone named Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He has received a loan of Rs. 8.
And he's started a piece of suffocation.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that this campaign will create a new entrepreneur.
And the Lord showed it at the bed of Shailesh.
And there was a good business for his family.
But I want this plan to be more propagated.
May all our banks be more sensitive and help small businessmen.
In reality, the economy of the country is based on them.
People employed in small businesses are the real strength of the country's economy.
We want to focus on it.
Good, but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had spoken of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
There are many things that always create awareness in our society's life.
Internal Vigilance is the Press Obligation of Liberty will be the prize of freedom.
To maintain the unity of the country, we have to keep the river of domestic protection alive.
I want to make this a plan for Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat and I also agreed on it at the portal.
I'm told there's a lot of suggestions.
I am told that those who take part in this will be given their certificates.
A big prize has also been announced.
I believe your advice will be very useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter season is starting.
It is a very good time to eat and drink and wear a variety of clothes.
But I'll say, exercise.
At least one hour of the family members should be together, see what kind of awareness will increase and how fresh it will be for the whole day.
Be good habits in a good season.
Jai Hind
My dear countrymen, bow down to all of you
This is the twelfth episode of Mann Ki Baat and this is how a year has passed.
For the first time on 3rd October last year, I was fortunate to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
Democracy has greater popularity.
I have an idea in my life and that is why I believe in the power of the people.
Whatever Mann Ki Baat taught me, what I have understood, what I have experienced, I can say that the strength of the people is greater than what we thought.
Our ancestors told the people that they were part of God.
I can say from Mann Ki Baat that our ancestors have immense power and immense truth because I have felt it.
I asked everyone for advice for Mann Ki Baat but perhaps I have been able to see or understand two or four suggestions every time.
But lakhs of people are actively consulting me.
It's a big power.
And this is how Mann Ki Baat has become a medium of expressing the thoughts of the society.
I once talked about selfy with daughter.
And so the whole world was surprised to hear.
But lakhs of selfy with daughter have come from all over the world and daughters and daughters have been proud of it.
And when they took the selfy with daughter, they had not only honored their daughters but also made a resolution within themselves.
And when the others see these selfies, everyone feels that they too have to sacrifice their indifference to daughters.
People from every corner of India have sent such photographs in lakhs of numbers.
The tourism department of the state government or the central government could not even think that we have such valuable resources in our country.
A little bit of a piece of shit we've bought.
Today, I am happy to say that the sale of Khadi has almost doubled in the last one year.
And it's not for any government advertising.
I didn't have to spend crores of rupees.
It was a belief of the people's power, a feeling.
I urged the financially eligible people to dedicate what is required for gas cylinders.
On a TV channel, I saw a widow, she is on the line of extradition of retired teachers, gas cylinders.
The middle class, the lower middle class families of the society, which are very difficult to give up sacrificial habits, have also given up the facility of sanitation.
Isn't that a fucking revolution
He will be able to work as a good driver for the betterment of the society as the government works with the people.
The people of my country are trying to consolidate themselves for the welfare of the country with the importance of every small thing.
In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I thought of taking a new initiative.
Whether it is Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup or Kanyakumarika from Kashmir, there is no such place in India where the people did not call.
It's a fragrance of my own.
People of all ages have called.
I heard some phones myself and I liked it.
My entire government will work as per your advice.
They gave positive suggestions.
Therefore, the common man of the country should take such a positive attitude and this is a huge treasure for the country.
There was perhaps some serious complaint on one or two per cent phone.
And one thing has come to our notice, especially the capable person, especially the blind persons, has received a lot of calls.
One of the reasons for this is that they don't have the luck to watch TV, so they listen to the radio.
From this, I realized how important the radio is for the blind people.
I have received a new direction from all these phones and these phones are extremely important for making the government more sensitive.
Pawan Acharya gave me a suggestion from Alwar in Rajasthan.
I think everyone should listen to it and the people of the whole country should believe it.
Definitely listen to what he wants to say: "My name is Pawan Acharya, I live in Alwar, Rajasthan.
Pawan, my belief, your suggestions on air will spread across the corner of India.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering at the inaugural session of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.
What wasn't there - the entire history was brought alive.
We can appreciate the glorious moments of the war, the indomitable courage and sacrifices of our army.
The battle of Haji Pi or the battle of Northern India, the battle of Chamunda or Haji Pi Pass, whichever you do not see, is a thrilling experience and is proud of our soldiers.
This exhibition will last a few more days.
My request is that those who are around Delhi, you must see this exhibition with your family and do not hurry like me.
Look at the strength of democracy, a young boy is ordering the Prime Minister, but the younger boy has forgotten his name.
We should make smooth and proper arrangements for cleanliness.
I also have to hear a lot of things that Modiji spoke a lot about cleanliness, but what is happening at the end
On the other hand, on the one hand, Parliament and on the other hand both the children of the country are talking about cleanliness.
This movement will create awareness about cleanliness and hatred towards waste and will also force this government to work towards making a Swachh Bharat.
Local autonomous bodies such as Panchayat, Nagar Panchayat, Purnigam, Mahanagar Purnigam or State or Centre each has to work in this regard.
We have to take this movement forward in a difficult situation. And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will move on the right path to fulfil the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Mahatma Gandhi once said, Freedom and Cleanliness - if I have to choose one of these two, then I would like cleanliness first, after independence.
Gandhiji had greater freedom than freedom.
Come, let us all follow Mahatma Gandhi and take some steps to fulfill his wishes.
He wanted to know about Deendayalji's birth centenary.
My dear countrymen, the philosophy of the great men is a source of inspiration for us.
Any day or the other is connected with the name of a coward in historical sight.
In the days to come, we will recall all these great men, we will reach every household to see their lives and we will try to learn something from it.
I would like to specifically mention the 2nd of October, the birthday of the revered Mahatma Gandhi, I had said last year that you have different fashion clothes, different types of fabrics, many other things, but the fertilizer goods should have a special place.
And that's why we're going to give us a place in this lamp, we're gonna wear clothing.
And see, the sale of cultivation was doubled last time.
How many poor people have benefited
The government that cannot afford lakhs of rupees through advertisements has been able to accomplish this task with your small help.
This is Jan Shakti. And that is why I once again request you for this work.
My dear countrymen, one thing has filled my heart with happiness.
I wish you all the joys.
I went to Kolkata in May, some of the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose came to meet me.
His brother-in-law Chandra Bose made all arrangements.
It was an opportunity to spend a lot of time with the family members of Subhash Babu.
You can imagine how enjoyable this is for me.
Perhaps they are all coming to the Prime Minister's house for the first time.
But the most happy thing for me is that I have never had the opportunity to have such a hospitality in the Prime Minister's house in October.
More than 50 members of the family of Subhash Babu, who live in different countries, are all coming.
Bhargavi sent me a message in his voice, and I felt that he was going to be a leader or a leader.
He said, My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I urge the Prime Minister to make you aware about the registration of voters, which will enhance the participation of the youth in the coming days, and make a significant contribution to the formation and management of the Government in the future.
Thank you. The voter has been nominated and briefed about voting.
Every voter in the democracy is lucky and this awareness is gradually increasing.
A few years ago, we have seen that Election Commissions were conducting elections but in the last few years there has been a major change.
Today, our Election Commission is not only the Election Commission but is working as a supporter, the voter has become friendly and all their thoughts and plans are central to the voter.
But only the Election Commission will work, it will not work.
I hope that if the neo-liberals of the country do not register their names on the polling booths, they will definitely register and vote.
On the day of election, I will say, "I will vote in the first place, then drink water."
It's a sacred duty, everyone should do it.
Last year, I've visited Kashi.
I have met many people, several events have been held, many have met, but I want to tell you about the two boys.
But his interest in physics at such a young age surprised me.
I think he learns a lot, he does internet surfing, is aware of the new use of science.
He was talking about how to get rid of rail accidents, what kind of technology is needed, how to reduce energy costs, how to experience robots etc.
One such person has met a small sailor named Sonampatel.
Sonam is no year old.
I was surprised that the whole Geetha was a girl, but the most important thing is that when I asked her, she was advocating in English as a shloka, explaining the shloka, and also analyzing in Hindi.
He told me to ask his father that the girl has been doing this since she was five.
I asked him about his studies, did he just read Geetha or do anything else
The gentleman said, "No, if Sonam's reading in the morning and evening, and if he reads history, he's in the evening."
They're astonished about the girl, but she's only so much in the family.
I'm really impressed.
Sometimes children have a hobby of celebrity, and there was nothing in Sonam.
I think God has given him a special power.
"Sandeep ji, what else will you do with me
I have to make a lot of efforts to do this one time in a month.
Sometimes, half an hour of our Akashwani friends have to wait for me for an hour.
One year of Mann Ki Baat was completed.
Do you know how much Subhas Babu used the radio
He started his radio broadcast from Germany, and through radio he used to tell the people of India about the freedom struggle.
He launched Azad Hind Radio with a weekly news bulletin.
This radio was broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengal, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushtu, Thiruvananthapuram.
Let us listen to you, think for you, consider your proposals, and that is why the vision of my thinking opens up, which reaches you through AIR.
I say, but it's yours, and that's my satisfaction.
Once again I got the opportunity to visit you on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat.
The people of South India are now on the occasion of Omn Festival and the entire nation celebrated the holy Rakhibandhan Festival yesterday.
The Government of India has started some new schemes including social security for the common man.
I am happy that in a short span of time many people have come under this scheme.
I had requested that our sisters should be given such a security scheme in the Rakhibandhan festival.
I have plenty of information from which it has come to know that since the launch of the scheme, about 11 crore families have been connected.
I have also been told that about half of the benefits have been received by the mothers and sisters.
The Jan Dhan Yojana was launched a year ago when I was talking to you people.
A lot of questions arose whether the work that was not done in sixty years would be done in such a short time
This has helped the youngsters of the country.
You will be happy to know that in this year, 1 lakh 31 thousand Financial Literacy Camps have been opened for collection of banking sectors, economies and underprivileged people.
It is a belief that even the poorest of the poor can get money from the bank.
I once again thank everyone associated with it and I appeal to the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters who have opened bank accounts, you will not let this link with the bank separately.
This bank is yours, you don't leave it anymore.
I've brought it to you, you're responsible for holding it.
We all have to keep accounts in the bank.
I have full faith, you keep it.
A few days ago, the violent incidents of Gujarat had disturbed the entire country.
And it is natural that if something happens in the state of Gandhi and Sardar Patel then the entire country feels sad.
But in a short span of time, the middle class citizens of Gujarat and my brothers and sisters have taken up the situation.
They have played an active role in preventing the situation from deteriorating and Gujarat has taken the path of peace again.
This is the path of peace, unity and brotherhood.
It's the solution to all our problems in prosperity.
Recently, I had the opportunity to meet and listen to the distinguished personalities of Sufi.
I am sure that this experience of listening to their glorious words brings a sense of singing.
Their words, their words, their words, that is, the tradition of peaceful liberty in the Sufi cycle, have come to my mind like a musical rhythm.
I love it.
Perhaps it is the most important thing to bring this true form of Islam to the Tamil world.
My belief is that this love and generosity of Sufi tradition will reach far and wide so that the benefits of the entire humanity and Islam can be accomplished.
I tell others, we need to understand the Sufi sentiments, even though we are different communities.
I am fortunate to have another opportunity to meet this invitation in the coming days.
The leaders of Buddhist religions of many countries of the world are coming to India and will discuss various issues related to humanity all over the world.
I am glad that these scholars have invited me there too.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Buddha.
This is a moment of joy for me to meet all these miracles of the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I want to talk to you especially in my mind.
I have already spoken about this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
You have heard about Mann Ki Baat in Parliament, in public meetings or in Mann Ki Baat.
I have come here every time to tell you that the government has opened its minds on the issue of land acquisition laws.
I have agreed to take any suggestions for the welfare of the farmers.
But today I want to tell the brothers and sisters that the proposal to amend the Land Acquisition Act has come from the state.
But I have seen that a lot of misunderstandings have been spread about this and farmers are scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, our farmers will never be misunderstood and fear will never be achieved.
I don't want anybody to misunderstand or frighten.
I need every demand of the country, but the farmers' demand is most important.
I've decided to end this period.
I mean, the situation before my government was formed came back.
But one thing was incomplete.
There were 13 things that were supposed to end in a year, and that is why we brought them in the country, but this is also incomplete.
The welfare of the poor and the farmers in the village is the mantra of our path.
Therefore, on 15th August, I had said that not only the agriculture department but also the agriculture and farmers-farming departments.
This decision is being taken at a fast pace.
My farmer brothers and sisters, there is no reason to worry anymore.
Don't be afraid if anyone tries to scare you.
I have one more thing to say.
Two days back, the battle of 1960 was completed fifty years.
Whenever there is talk of the war of 1960, it is natural to remember the Red Fort.
It is also natural to remember the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan.
It is natural to recall the sacrifices made by the people who were martyred to maintain the dignity and dignity of the tri-color flag of India.
I salute all those associated with Indias victory in 655 and bow down to the brave martyrs.
Such historical events inspire us.
I am very happy that India is doing a great job in many fields of science.
Our scientists are really doing a great job.
I have seen a new dream in the eyes of young scientists who are talking with enthusiasm.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had said that our students should move towards science.
After this interaction with the scientists, I feel that there is a lot of chance and a lot of potential in this regard.
I am glad that within fifteen days, the government has started working on this thing in a very short span of time.
Instructions are being issued and expected to provide interview facility in small jobs.
Today, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
In order to reduce health, especially the deaths of mothers and children, 24 countries of the world have come together to agree on the India Call to Action Plan.
This is the first time in any other country outside the USA.
It is true that even today, about fifty thousand mothers and about one lakh children die every year in the morning or after that.
It's very worrying and fearful.
Though there has been a lot of improvement in this regard, India has also started appreciating internationally, yet this number is not less.
Like we got rid of polio, we got rid of death due to mother and child tetanus.
The whole world recognized it.
But we still have to save our mothers and newborns.
Brothers and sisters, the news of dengue is getting very good today.
It's really dangerous to dengue, but it's easy to get rid of dengue.
It is directly linked to the Swachh Bharat Mission.
We're advertising on TV with dengue, advertising on news papers, but we don't mind.
There are rules for cleaning small household goods, keeping water clean.
People's education has started in this regard, but we are not focusing on it.
Sometimes it seems that we are in a very clean house, a very good arrangement, but I don't think I'm inviting Dengue to see the water accumulated in my house.
I urge everyone not to let death come so easily.
Life is very precious.
It's not right to stand in a state of desperation for dirty water around.
There are about 514 centres across the country to check dengue free of cost.
It is extremely important to keep the tested death intact.
Your cooperation in this regard is a great pleasure.
Cleanliness has to be extremely important.
Now there will be several festivals across the country from Rakhibandhan to Deepavali.
You will see that this method of cleanliness will become your nature.
My dear countrymen, today I want to tell you a good news.
I often say that now we do not have the privilege of donating life for our country, but it is our privilege to save the country.
Two young men of my country, two brothers of Maharashtra Nasik, Dr.
L. Mahajan and Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan has a strong desire to serve the tribal people of the country.
These two brothers have enhanced the dignity of India.
There is a bike race in America, Race Across America, which is very difficult.
I convey my best wishes, thanks and congratulations to these two brothers.
I am glad that these two brothers have succeeded in this campaign with the objective of Tim India Vision for Tribals.
See how everybody is trying to take the country forward at a personal level.
When I hear all this, I feel proud.
Sometimes we become indifferent to the new generations by getting old meditation.
Old generations believe that new generations don't know anything, this meditation has been going on for centuries.
I have met many youngsters who have sacrificed their lives to the Sunday on Cycle.
Some people say that I celebrate one day a week.
It is also very useful for protecting my health and environment.
And I like to think of that young man.
Now in many cities of our country there is a lot of cycling and people are also enthusiastic about cycling.
It is a good effort to protect the environment and improve health.
Today, when two youngsters of my country have flagged off the national flag in the USA, I am happy to mention the way the thoughts and thoughts of the youth of India are going on.
I would like to congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
The work of constructing the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar on the land of Ill Mill in Mumbai has been stuck for a long time.
With this, we have bought the house of 10 King Henry Rod of London where Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar used to be.
The Government of Maharashtra will build a memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
This place of London will be an inspiration for those who travel around the world.
I express my gratitude to both the efforts of the Government of Maharashtra for honouring Babasaheb Ambedkar. I am proud of them.
It's good to start this year.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will be helped in poor surveillance.
And I'm glad to have a good news.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
I want pulses for poor people, I want some oil to prepare sweets for food.
I am glad that the yield of pulses has increased by nearly 50 and oilseeds have increased by approximately 33.
My dear countrymen, on 26th July, the history of our country is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas.
The kind of relationship between the land of the farmers is equal to that of the soldiers of our country.
The war in Kargil was not just in the borders of the country, every city of India, every village of the country was connected with this war.
This war was fought by all those mothers and sisters who were fighting the enemy in Kargil.
Today, India is able to speak highly to the world for their sacrifices.
It is my pleasure to have seen the MyGov portal of almost two crore people by working together for the betterment of the country by increasing the direct participation of people in democracy.
Why don't you preserve the train tickets through the website of RCTC
Now this is very small, but the government has never thought about it or not judged.
But brothers and sisters, the government has considered this issue of Akhilesh Bajpayee with utmost importance and today this system has been started for our dear brothers and sisters.
The logo that is being prepared today, the tag line is being constructed, the plan is being formulated, the policy is being formulated, the MyGov portal has a positive consensus on all these things.
There is a feeling of a new wind blowing in the regime.
I feel a new consciousness.
There is a lot of suggestion in the MyGov portal for what I should say on 15th August.
The Film Festival from Chennai sent a lot of opinions.
You can send Mygov to the portal, write letters in Akashwani and write letters to the Prime Minister's Office.
Look, I believe it is a good thing that on 15th August, I have received advice from the people and people for my speech.
I believe you must send good advice.
Just two days ago, I got a glimpse of an accident in Delhi and after the accident a scooter drive has been running for 10 minutes.
He didn't get any help
And when you look at the statistics, your mind gets upset.
There was an accident in our country every minute.
For the accident, one death occurs every 4 minutes for the road accident.
And the biggest concern is that one-third of all these dead people is not only 15 to 25 years old, but one death can destroy the entire family.
They will do the work that should be done by the government, but I will request the parents, your children should be clever or fore-wheeler, all efforts should be made to caution the family.
Sometimes I see, it is written in the background of Ato Ricksaw, "Do not come home soon" (Get back home soon).
And that is why I am saying that the government has taken a number of new initiatives in this regard - be it education on road safety or road construction, administrative arrangements or be it emergency treatment for those injured after the accident, we are bringing the Road Transport and Safety Bill.
I am keen to take some important steps in the coming days to use the National Road Safety Policy and the Road Safety Action Plan.
I have taken another initiative which will benefit from Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara to all the highways of the country including Mumbai, Ranchi, Ranganga and Mondia.
I am talking about a cashless treatment system for the first fifty hours after the accident - whether the injured person has money or not, who will pay the money or not - how the injured person will get good health care and first aid.
All over the country, I have arranged a toll-free number 1033, an ambulance for reporting accidents, but all these are the following steps.
Sometimes I say that the employees are working.
In the past few days, some incidents have come to my notice and I want to tell you what I like.
Vijay Vishal showed how to connect with his own interests, his own industry and his own capabilities with his work.
In the coming days, there must be a lot of discussions and exchanges on the pictures of Vijay Vishal.
I also remember that the entire team of officers of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has started a task in the entire district which has touched my heart and I like their work.
And they have taken the responsibility to ensure that all the brothers and sisters of this kind of family get toilets in the Rakhibandhan Festival.
I got to know something like this that I want to share with you.
There is a small village named Keshala in Rajnand of Chhattisgarh in 1997.
The people of this village have been campaigning for toilets for the past few months.
Now no one in this village has to do toilets in the open space.
After the completion of toilet construction, the people of the entire village celebrated a big festival on this occasion.
How the values of the society are changing, how the mental needs of the people are changing, how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward, this is an example of what has come upon me.
Guahati Deka wrote to me about North-Eastern India, however, that the work of the people of North-East India is very active.
They are writing a lot - it is a good thing.
I am happy to tell them that there is a separate ministry for North-East India.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was the Prime Minister, a separate ministry called Development of North-East Region (D-ON-E-R) was formed.
After the formation of our government, our Donor Department has taken an important decision that the development of North-Eastern India cannot be achieved in Delhi.
All of us decided that a team of officers of the Government of India will visit the States of North-Eastern India like Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal, Tripura, Assam, Sikkim and will be camping for seven days.
The effort to move away from Delhi to the east, which I call Act East Policy, needs to be taken forward.
My dear countrymen, we are happy with the success of the Mars Mission.
Last day, I successfully launched five satellites of India's PSLV C28 United Kingdom.
All these news comes for a few moments and goes back.
We don't remember these usually.
But sometimes I feel that today when we talk to the younger generation and want to know what they want to be in the future, one or half of the hundred students are found who say I want to be scientists.
The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India has launched a National Intellectual Exploration Campaign to explore new talents.
Now we have to go to another village to charge the mobile.
All the facilities available in the city should also be available in the villages.
That is why we have started the Gram Jyoti Programme at Deendayal Upadhyaya.
But we have to do more for the poor.
We'll complete it.
I've started it, I'll finish it.
On the one hand, the month of August-September Festival is celebrated in our country.
A lot of festivals are over.
My best wishes to all of you.
You must send your suggestions for August 15th.
Your opinion will help me a lot.
Thank you very much
When I said, I didn't think I'd get such a great answer.
Millions of people posted photographs in the tour, Facebook, Instagram.
After this, I saw a photo, how many varieties are there in India - architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas, how much
I believe that the government of India has not thought of tourism.
I liked some more pictures that I re-touched myself.
I think that if we don't post the Belum cave in Andhra Pradesh, we wouldn't know what is hidden in our country.
But the scene we saw on 21st June is very strange. I think there was no country in the world where the sun rays reached, where the sun was not welcomed by yoga exercises.
I can insist that the sun doesn't set in the world of Yoga.
The way Yoga has been honoured and self-respected by the people of the world, it is a matter of pride for every Indian.
I am also very happy.
The Sin River and the Eiffel Tower for the French people are the symbols of pride and respect for Yoga.
People in New York Times Square have performed yoga.
The pictures of the Opera House swell in front of the eyes when it comes to Hollywood.
Citizens of Australia have performed Yoga at Opera House, showcasing Yoga as Opera House.
Whether it is North America or the Silicon Valley or the Duomo Cathedral of Milan, Yoga has made us proud.
I am delighted when the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, joined the United Nations Chief Minister on 21st June.
Likewise, members of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force have performed very well.
In the Siachen of India, our army has deployed a white ice cover, wherever our boatmen were there, they participated in the event of Yoga.
In Delhi, Yogavas has placed the Guinnessbook of World Records.
It seemed that a new question - a new joy - a new zeal - a new zeal is emerging from everywhere in the world.
A few days ago, when I visited the tour to serve a young child of Vietnam in Vietnam, the photo was so beautiful that it was appreciated all over the world.
Wives, children, villages, villages, improved and developing countries have joined hands with Yoga.
Yoga is truly tied to the whole world.
I don't know how distinguished and wise people will see this incident but I feel one thing, every Indian can be proud that the entire world is interested in knowing India.
Everyone's interest in knowing India has increased.
The world wants to know the values, traditions and traditions of India.
The responsibility of all of us is to keep this legacy unprecedented.
If we are proud of our heritage, we can do this.
Sometimes something is known to us so much that we don't see any integrity as our family values, we don't know that our family values are important to the people of the world.
Why shouldn't we introduce our family traditions and values to the world
I believe that the world will be surprised - I believe that there are many things that the ancestors have given us.
The success, joy and satisfaction of International Day of Yoga has taken a new responsibility.
We are responsible for giving good yoga to the world.
I believe that you can create a database on where to learn Yoga and where to find Yoga teachers.
We have seen that the government is working very actively, if the target is fixed then we have seen the results.
As we heard a year ago, nothing will happen - nothing will happen.
There is a department of government Ayush.
Nobody gave any importance to this
However, on the occasion of Yoga Day, this small section of the length has led and organized such a big event across the globe.
If the goal is stable, the smaller departments can work well - this is a sample of that.
A few days ago, the world saw how our people protected people from Yemen.
In a few hours, Indians have reached Nepal and have moved forward to help.
If the government is active, all the bank employees come forward to open the Jan Dhan account and within a few days crores of countrymen are connected to the bank.
On 15th August, I requested all the schools in the Red Fort to construct toilets and said that we have to complete this work in the next 15th August.
The work that has not been completed in sixty years was a very brave task.
That is, the government, the common man, the government employees, everybody wants to work for the country.
Last month, I started three public safety projects from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have been involved in the Jan Arogya Yojana, although we have to take this project forward.
Festivals to be held in the month of August.
Can we together create a strong mass movement before this festival and facilitate the welfare of mothers and sisters of our country
On the occasion of Rakhibandhan, this can be a great gift for sisters on the banks of Bhai.
When I come to Mann Ki Baat, many people send me advice.
Many people sent me advice that I should talk about rain.
Yogesh Dandekar from Nagpur, His Highness Harsh Vardhan from Mysore, His Excellency Praveen Nadkarni Mahasai, Divya Bhagwa Mahashy, everyone told me to talk about rain in Mann Ki Baat.
This weather gives a lot of pleasure to the mind.
Any old man wants to enjoy the first rain water.
You must be enjoying hot tea with hot potatoes, fresh land and potatoes in this rainy season.
As the rays of the sun give us life, rain gives us strength.
Digest water is also valuable.
As a citizen, as a society, we have to create a habit of saving even a bit of water.
We should make a solemn pledge in the villages, cities and cities.
Rain water harvesting is not a new thing for centuries.
Whether it is check dam, watershed development, small ponds, small ponds, small ponds, we have to save even a little water.
This port on the seashore, therefore, was used to collect rainwater for sweet water and keep it at home.
At that time, so much efforts were made to save rain water.
We can do this.
And I advise you to get from my direct and successful experience.
It's a complete rural maritime.
When you plant a tree, put an old soil on the tree and fill it with water.
We'll have to fill water once or twice a month.
You will see that this tree will grow rapidly and become very strong.
I'm gonna tell the farmers that you don't run around your fields and plant trees.
And we also know that in the rainy season, water is spreading more.
Bacteria become active to increase moisture in the weather.
Therefore, cleanliness is extremely important at this time.
You should drink pure drinking water at this time.
It's right, as careful as we are, the disease will be as far away.
We want water, we want rain, but we also want to prevent diseases.
My countrymen, we have started three new projects, especially for the citizens of the city.
There are at least five hundred small towns in our country.
We have to take this effort forward.
And I want to stay in this house for electricity, drinking water, toilets and schools for children's education.
When India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022, then we want to provide our homes to every countrymen.
I have been associated with all of you through social media.
Several new ideas, suggestions and suggestions have been received by you people and I have been conveying my best wishes to you about the work of the government.
But when this government scheme becomes its own scheme of individuals, society or villages, how much increases its strength.
In the last few days, Shriman Sunil Jaglan Mahashya, a Panchayat chief from Bibipur village in Haryana, has started a very funny effort.
And this creates such an environment that every father takes selfies with his daughter and asks for a post in social media.
The number of sands in Haryana is very low than the boys.
There are about 100 districts in the country where there is such a situation that is very worrying.
The worst situation in Haryana.
And that is why I appeal to you people to join your daughters in Selfie with Daughter.
In order to further strengthen the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, write beautiful taglines, it can be in any language, English, Hindi, your mother tongue or any other language.
The tag line that will be inspiring, I will retire your selfie with your daughter.
In a way, we can make this scheme a mass movement.
Make our country ruined.
I am telling you from my experience, take this effort forward.
Make this part of your life.
And one more thing - Incredible India - wherever you do not go, you must send the pictures there.
Our country will be able to know about the diversity of our country.
I feel that the pictures you are sending are very low in handicrafts.
You can also post your area handicrafts in Incredible India.
There are many things that are created in your city - the poor people have also produced many things.
And we have a simple way through which we can reach.
My dear countrymen, this is the case today.
The next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be held again.
Some people sometimes feel that in Mann Ki Baat, I have announced a big scheme of the government but not that.
I'm working day and night.
I am very happy to meet you all through this programme.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
Just imagine what's going on in the middle of this.
When I used to talk about Mann Ki Baat, I used to say that the words and the voices of my throats were mine, but the words were males and males.
But this Sunday made me wait a lot.
Well, the last chance has come.
In a household environment, Mann Ki Baat means a small and light mind that can be transformed into a society, its sustainability is the birth of a new zeal, and thus, the spirit of a New India continues to move forward.
My interaction with you was a part of this kind of spiritual journey.
Some people asked me why did I go to Kedarnath in the course of the vote
You have the right and I can understand your curiosity.
I think I'll talk to you about the situation of that time.
But today I feel that if I talk about those things then the form of Mann Ki Baat will change.
Voting is busy, guess of defeat and Polling remains when I got out.
Most people found the political meaning in it.
But for me it was an opportunity to meet myself.
You can tell me I was going to meet me.
I don't know when I can tell you, but I'm sure you have your rights on me.
The way people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, in your endeavour, I feel at all times about you.
Sometimes some of your words reflect my thoughts.
He also spoke of the challenges faced by the people of the country and society and reiterated their resolve.
I have noticed that there is a problem in the letter, but there is a special feature with it that some solutions, some suggestions, some imaginations are given directly or indirectly.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering after inaugurating the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
When someone talks about the environment, he also spoke of his own efforts with a feeling of suffering towards pollution.
He also spoke of the ways being adopted, and said that the entire imagination that he had put in mind was to prevent environmental pollution.
It means that how can we solve the problem with the entire society, I get a glimpse of it from your conversation.
Mann Ki Baat is a dedication to the nation and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of inner strength, capability and talent among the countrymen.
It is only necessary to keep that power and talent in the right way, to give them the opportunity and to use them.
The Mann Ki Baat Ao has said that in the progress of the country, the strength and activity of the 130 crore countrymen have to be linked.
I must say one more thing that in Mann Ki Baat, I have a lot of letters, a lot of phone calls, a lot of messages, but there is very little grievance.
You can imagine that anybody has written a letter to the Prime Minister of the country but is he not asking for anything for himself
This is a symbol of the high thinking of millions of people of the country.
My heart is full of happiness today.
And that is why I easily announced in Mann Ki Baat that after a few months I will return to you.
Keeping this in mind, let us take forward the continuity of Mann Ki Baat.
When the emergency was in force in the country, the movement against it was not limited to political circles, political leaders and prisons.
I don't feel hungry when we eat at night.
In the same way, the importance of control of control in everyday life is felt only when that right lies.
And this is not because the Indian Constitution took some steps to promote democracy.
Constitution and law required to drive the society smoothly.
And that is why the country dedicated a total election not only for itself but also for the protection of democracy.
Recently, the great democracy, the largest electoral process was completed in our country, where the poorest of the poor, all of them joined the campaign to decide the future of the country.
When things are very close to us, we cannot understand its importance
More than 61 crore people voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India, Sixty One Crore
The number may seem to be a bit simple, but if the entire world remains unchanged, I will say that more than any country in the world has voted in India.
The number of people who voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than double the total number of Americans.
The total number of voters in India is more than the total population of Europe.
These are the preservation of the vastness and vastness of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha elections are still one of the largest democratic elections in history.
You can imagine what a huge organisation and human resources are required to complete this process.
This election has been possible for the hard work of lakhs of teachers, officers and professionals.
On the one hand, nearly three lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces have discharged their responsibilities to fulfil this legacy of democracy and on the other hand, 20 lakh police personnel of various states have worked tirelessly.
As a result of these hard work, this time more votes were cast than last election.
In this election process, more than 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines have been arranged.
To ensure that no one is deprived of using his voter.
Polling stations are built for only one female voter everywhere in Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the officials of the Election Commission have been travelling for two days to reach that place.
This is the true honor of democracy.
The highest number of polling stations in the world are also in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
There is another information that we can be proud of.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women also voted with enthusiasm like men.
The number of male and female voters in this election is almost equal.
There are 77 women parliamentarians in the Parliament who have a record.
I congratulate the Election Commission and everyone associated with the voting process and salute the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you will be listening to me a few times i. e.
My wish was to give books instead of flowers for the disapproval of the habituals
Another story that deepens my heart is Eidgah.
The story is a child's condolence, a pure love for his sister.
When the four-five-year-old Hamid takes a chimney from the fair to his sister-in-law, it is really a matter of immense love and compassion.
The last line of this story is a wonderful truth of our life. "Sheesh Hamid played the role of an old man, like the old man, the girl was transformed into me.
One such heartfelt story is Poose Ki Rat.
This story shows a vibrant picture of the life of a poor farmer.
The farmers are happy even after their crops have been destroyed, because they do not have to sleep in the fields in winter.
Though these stories are almost centuries old, yet their relevance is felt as much today.
After reading the story, I feel a different kind.
When it's about reading books, I read about the library of Kerala.
You'll be surprised to know that the library is located in a village in the depths of Idukki.
There's a primary school teacher P.
V. Chinnathampi did extraordinary work for this library.
There was a time when books were filled with bags and pressed on the back.
Today, this library is showing a new direction to the tribal children.
Gujarat's Wangchu Gujarat campaign is a successful initiative.
Millions of people from all ages participated in this campaign of reading books.
In today's digital world, in the times of Google Guru, I would like to urge you to take some time out and give some space to books in your daily routine.
You will really enjoy and write in the NarendraModiApp about the books you do not read so that all the audiences of Mann Ki Baat are aware of it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy that the people of my country are thinking about all those things which are not just present, but a big challenge for the future.
I was reading your comments on the NarendraModiApp and MyGov.
Belgavir Pawan Gaudai, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about water related problems.
Water has a huge impact on our culture.
Smt. Suttam, Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Dr.
Several parts of the country are being damaged every year due to lack of water.
You will be surprised to know that in a year, only 8 percent of the water received from rain has been saved in our country.
Just 8 percent.
But now it's time to solve this problem.
I believe that we will find solutions to this crisis through the support, collaboration and resolution of 130 crore countrymen, with the strength of the people, with the help of other problems, public participation.
The Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation has been set up in the country keeping in mind the importance of water.
This will lead to early decisions on all water related issues.
A few days ago, I tried to invent something different.
I wrote letters to all the village heads of the country.
I had written to the village heads to save water, to save water, to save every drop of rain, to meet the villagers and sit with the villagers.
I am glad that they have fully encouraged this thing and on 22nd December, thousands of people have laid down their lives in Panchayats.
People have resolved to collect one drop of water in the village.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I want to listen to a gram panchayat.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has written a letter to the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in saving water, and he has not been able to believe that the Prime Minister has written our letters.
The people there are once again ready to play their active role in water conservation.
I convey my best wishes to all the Prime Ministers, all the Panchayats, to their activeness.
There are several Panchayat Prime Ministers across the country who have been involved in water conservation.
What I said, it is possible for everyone to achieve a great positive outcome.
But everyone's goal is to save water, to save water.
Water drainage reforms are underway in Punjab.
This will save water from the problem of accumulation.
The construction of a reservoir at Thimaipalli in Telangana has changed the lives of the people of the village.
There has been a major change in the construction of small ponds built in the fields in the poetry of Rajasthan.
I was talking about a massive effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women were in one place to save Nagandi again.
I was also reading about all the women from Garhwal who are working very well to keep the rain water together.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, three requests have been made to the countrymen.
Let me begin a mass movement for water conservation just as my first request was to make the country's cleanliness a mass movement.
All of us together resolve to save every drop of water. I believe that water from Parameswar is the source of water and water supply.
I have started an awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Whether it is the world of cinema, the world of sports, the media friends, the people associated with social organisations, the people associated with the cultural organisations, the artists of the world, everybody should lead this campaign through their own methods.
Wake up the society, join everyone and bind them together.
You see, we can see changes in front of our eyes.
Let us inspire people to conserve water by creating a list of water conservation methods.
You all can share your content using the hashtag janshakti4jalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I thank you and all the people of the world for one more thing.
Just as on 21st June, once again on Yoga Day, we have celebrated Yoga Day with a sense of zeal and zeal and zeal.
The importance of Yoga Day is increasing among the awareness that has come up for Holistic Health Care.
If a yogic sun welcomes every corner of the world with the sunrise, its entire journey ends with the sunset.
The President of the world, the Prime Minister, the great personalities of the world, and the common man, showed me how they celebrated Yoga Day in their own country.
That day, the world looked like a huge family.
We all know that we need healthy and sensitive people to create a healthy society and Yoga ensures that.
Therefore, the promotion and promotion of Yoga is an integral part of social service.
In 2019, Prime Minister's Awards were announced to contribute in the promotion and development of Yoga, which is of course good news to me.
The award has been conferred on the organizations of the world who have played a crucial role in the promotion and promotion of Yoga.
Like Japan Yoga Niketan, who made Yoga extremely popular in Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutions and training courses.
And can Indians remain behind where the subject is linked to Yoga
Yoga schools in Munger, Bihar, which have been honoured for the past few decades.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Munich has also been honoured to establish Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
To honour and honour the participants of Yoga and those who have brought home the message of Yoga, these two things have added a different dimension to Yoga Day.
My dear countrymen, this journey of ours has started achieving new ideas, new feelings, new resolves and innovative energy today.
We can connect ourselves with your thoughts, I have a very important thing, Mann Ki Baat.
Let your blessings be with me.
You are my inspiration, my strength.
Let us all sit together and listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme.
In the coming month, we will again talk to you in Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much, Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today, my heart is immersed in the beginning of Mann Ki Baat.
Ten days ago, Mother India lost her brave sons.
To address this challenge in front of the country, we all have to forget caste, communalism, regionalism and other neighbourhoods so that we can take stronger, stronger and fruitful steps against terrorism.
Our armed forces are very brave.
You have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of terrorism.
The Army has taken a pledge to destroy the terrorists and their insurgents.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, through media, inspiring messages from the people of the country have emerged as a source of immense courage, enthusiasm and strength.
Ramnanjan ji, the father of Shahid Ratan Bhagawan in Bhagalpur, Bihar, inspired us all to introduce a strong resolve to this sad moment.
He said that his other son will also be sent to fight the enemies of the country and he will be present in the battlefield if necessary.
The entire nation wishes the bravery of the martyrs of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
He resolved to join his only son in the CRPF.
When Shahid Vijay Soren's body on the national flag reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his younger son says he will join the army.
With the enthusiasm of this innocent child, this determination and thinking reflects the feelings of the young children of India.
My dear countrymen, in such a long period of independence, all of us had waited for War Memorial.
It is natural for the countrymen to have a lot of questions about this.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has expressed his happiness at the formation of the National War Memorial at Odupi, Karnataka.
I was surprised and distressed that there was no National War Memorial in India.
My dear countrymen, our country's former Prime Minister Morarji Bhai was born on February 29th.
You all know that this special day comes once in four years.
In a simple, peaceful personality, Balian and Morarji Bhai were one of the most trusted leaders of this country.
Morarji Bhai Deshai has recorded the highest budget in our independent India and Parliament.
During that difficult period, Morarji Desh ji gave India the right leadership, when the democracy of the country was in a dilemma.
Morarji Bhai had dedicated himself to the struggle against 'urgency' to protect this democracy.
And for this, he had to pay a lot of money.
That day's government arrests him and brings him to jail.
But when Janta Party won the vote in 1971, he became our Prime Minister.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the 44th Constitution Amendment.
This is very important because the 42nd Amendment to the Emergency was proposed, wherein there were other proposals to deprive the power of the Supreme Court, so that our democratic values could not be ruined.
As the 44th Amendment Proposal provides for the publication of information about the functioning of Parliament and Assembly.
The amendment proposes that the fundamental rights of the citizens are not to be deducted in any way due to the urgent situation in terms of Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution.
Once again I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, just like every year, people were very enthusiastic about the Padma Awards.
I want to tell you something like this today.
He has done a surprising job to revive the biological artistry of Kutch.
He has done a wonderful job to bring this rare industry to a new generation.
I gave a present to former US President Barak Obama, the Treaty of Life, made by Abdel Gafu.
Among the awardees, everyone knows Sabbi Sayeed of Marathwada as Gomata Sevak.
He added that the way he has spent all his life in the service of Gomata.
Madurai Chinna Pillai, a distinguished person who tried to strengthen and self-reliant the victims and the victims through the Kalanjiyam movement in Tamil Nadu.
He has trained all people around the world at the age of one hundred years and has so far produced 1500 Yoga teachers.
He not only saved 50 hectares of forests, but also sent ten thousand women together to protect trees and wildlife.
Today, as a result of this hard work of Yamuna Ji, people of the village should plant 18 trees at the time of birth of every child and 10 trees at the time of marriage of every girl.
He also dedicated himself to the cause of self-reliance and self-reliance of blind children by creating an institution called 'Chuchh Mahila Sevakunj'.
My dear countrymen, for the first time, it was felt that 12 farmers were among those who were awarded the Padma awards this year.
Normally, very few people associated with farming and those who directly belong to the farming community are among the smallest of the farmers.
And this is the changing picture of India.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to share a heartfelt experience with all of you, I have been conveying myself for the past few days.
Today, I want to meet the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana PM-JYA and PMJAY everywhere in the country.
Brothers and sisters, nearly 12 lakh poor families have taken the opportunity of this scheme in the last five months.
I understand how big changes have been brought about in the lives of the poor.
If you know a poor person, who cannot afford to avail the benefits of this scheme.
This scheme has been launched for the benefit of the poor people.
My dear brothers and sisters are going to start a school examination.
Preparations will be initiated for the examination of various educational parliamentarians and twelve categories across the country.
My heartiest congratulations to the test takers, their parents and teachers.
A few days ago, a large tournament was organised at Town Format in Delhi on the occasion of Pariksha Pe Charcha.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their teachers, their parents, YouTube for the recording of this programme.
My dear countrymen, India will talk and it will not be a matter of worship.
Perhaps there is no day in our country that there is no festival or pride ever since, because we have thousands of years old heritage.
Within a few days, Mahashivaratri is coming and this time Shivratri has fallen on Mondays and when Shivratri falls together, our hearts are filled with a lot of sacred thought and devotion.
I have to admit that I have been very impressed with the power of this Divyangtru.
My dear countrymen, I have a unique experience of connecting with you all through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I have faced crores of families every month through radio.
Sometimes reading your letters, talking to you people or listening to your suggestions and suggestions sent on the phone, I feel that you have taken one of your families.
It's a great pleasure for me.
Friends, Election is the biggest festival of democracy.
We will be busy with elections for the next two months.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
He spent his entire life in the field of food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
The Siddhangamathani Pusa and Krishimala.
I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to such a coward.
But today I have something else to say about this.
Imagine, only for one vendor.
If you ever missed the bottom, you should be a man.
I call upon the citizens of the country to enroll and enhance the day-to-day livelihood of the people of the United States of America.

The glory of our heroes, the patriotic legends of our younger generation are immensely useful in diverse ways.
In this month's past 30th December, I entered the Andaman Nicobar Islands.
But it was the 75-year-old war of the kingdom.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the passing away of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Some years ago, there was a request that Netaji would be able to enrich all the failings.
I'm glad we're doing this.
That day I came to the Prime Minister's residence as per Netaji's request.
I am to be informed that Radio Station Headquarters, English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengal, Marathi, Punjabi, Puducherry, Urdu.
VASS was a very powerful territory.
The museum is a Handicraft Exhibition and there is a 450-year-old behaviour painting andart work link.
Here we have been exhibiting excellent craftsmen like Trishul Gill, Raja Ravi Varma, Avanindranath Takur, Jagannath Takur, Nandlal Bose, Jaminiar, Shailja Mukherji.
He made many future paintings.
He has also embarked upon the surveillance of the survivors, and has enhanced the human character through the medium of architecture canvass.
And it is surprising that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had no name for this architecture.
If he thinks of parpainting as well as the people of journalism, he should visualise them and quote them.
Orpaintings have also been exhibited in Russia and America in various parts of the world.
I hope you're going to see the artillery painting.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of Dussehra.

All this has been possible due to the indomitable efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, in December this year we have lost some of our extraordinary countrymen.
Dr. Jayachandran's life was lost in Chennai on 19th December.
Nursamma was a helper in delivery of pregnant mothers and sisters.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, particularly in every corner.
Earlier this year, he was honored with the Padma Shri.
Dr. Jayachandran and Sulagitti Nasamma have many outstanding personalities who have lived their lives for the betterment of society.
When I talk about healthcare, I would like to mention the social efforts of doctors in Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some of my party officials told me that some young doctors in the city are doing free treatment for the poor.
Hundreds of poor people are now benefiting from this camp every month.
The zeal of these doctors and their friends, who are selflessly employed, is really commendable.
Today, I can proudly say that with our collective efforts, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign.
Some people have told me that more than three lakh people have joined the Swachhta Abhiyan in Jubbalpur in Madhya Pradesh a few days ago.
In this Swachh Bharat Mission, students from all walks of life, students from all walks of life, students from all walks of life, students from all walks of life, students from all walks of life, students from all walks of life, students from all walks of life, students from all walks of life, people from all walks of life.

There is a lot of discussion in the media about the other daughter, sixteen Rajni.

He respects his father, Jasmer Singh, who sells luxury at a waterway shop.
Rajni said that he had to admit a lot of sacrifice and suffering to reach this place.

When Rajini wanted to learn boxing to his father, he tried his best to enhance his zeal and fulfil his dreams.
Rosnie Boxing Practice started with old gloves, because his family wasn't in a good condition.
Despite all adversities, Rajini didn't lose courage and taught boxing.
He also won a medal in Cervical.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajni and convey my best wishes to his parents and mother Jasmer Singhji and Usarani for being close to Rajni and encouraging him.
This month, the twenty-year-old Bedangi Kulkarni of Pune has achieved the pride of being one of the fastest Asians in the world.

You imagine, 300 kilometers of cycling every day
His indomitable spirit of cycling is really commendable.
Adversity never stops.
When we hear of such other examples, we also get new inspiration in every moment of our life.
My dear countrymen, there are several festivals like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi etc.
These festivals will showcase the colours of traditional dance, iron will enhance the joy of harvesting somewhere, somewhere in the sky, somewhere in the sky, somewhere in the sky, somewhere else in the world.
Festivals will be organised somewhere, somewhere else will be the festival of sweetening each other with sweets.
All these festivals are different but the purpose of celebrating festivals and these festivals are somehow connected with agriculture and the lives of the people.
At this very moment the sun rises and the sun enters the sky.
Since then, the day begins to grow slowly and the winter season starts.
My best wishes to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters on this occasion.
The unity between the diversity is one of the greatest festivals of India and Ek Bharat.
We can see that these festivals are so closely associated with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not seen separately, but individuals and scholars.
Another beautiful example of our distress with nature is the Festival Calendar.
These calendars also showcase the planets and planets throughout the year.
These traditional calendars show how ancient our relationship with natural and geographical events is.
Based on the speed of the moon and the sun, the lamps and festivals are fixed as per the moonlight calendar.
It depends on who follows a calendar.
Festivals are scheduled to be held in many places on the planets and planets.
All these festivals like Gudi-Podwa, Cheti-Chand and Ugadi are celebrated in accordance with the Moon Calendar, like Tamil Puthandu and Vishakha, Vishakha, Vaishakhi, Paila Vaishakh, Bihu etc.
Many of us are inherent in the main objective of saving rivers and water.
The Chat Parbati river and the pond are associated with the worship of the sun.
In Makar Sankranti, lakhs of people bathed in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals teach us social values.
On the one hand, as they have traditional importance, on the other hand, these festivals inspire and inspire each other in a very simple way.
I convey my best wishes and best wishes to all of you in 2019.
Let us share the photographs of this festival with you all to see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there are many things in our culture that we can be proud of and we can highlight the entire world.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
In many films, this fair has been demonstrated in many ways about the legacy and immenseness of the fair and it is really as rich as the greatness of the Kumbh.
People from all over the world come to participate in the Kumbh.
The Kumbh Mela is accomplished by people of faith and devotion.
Millions and millions of people from abroad are coming together at one place.
The tradition of the Kumbh has been enriched and developed by our great cultural heritage.
Saint-Shatmara has started reaching the Kumbh Mela from now on.
Last year, the UNESCO Kumbh Mela was registered on the Intensive Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, the Ambassador of many countries had seen the preparations for the Kumbh.
There was a national flag hoisting of many countries together.
The Kumbh Mela organised at Prayagraj is likely to bring more than one and a half people to the country.
This can be a great learning expertise for the youth.
I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago, and I saw that the Kumbh's strong preparations are underway.
The people of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic about the Kumbh.
Today, the Kumbh is also emphasizing on cleanliness.
This architect of human faith was locked in the fort for thousands of years so that the pilgrims could not see it even if they wanted.
Now the Akshay Boat's door has been opened for everyone.
My request to you is that when you visit Kumbh, you must share the different features and photos of the Kumbh in social media so that people inspire to visit Kumbh in large numbers.
May this Kumbh of the spirit be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith be the Mahakumbh of patriotism and national integration.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, the Republic Day celebrations, we remember those great people who gave us the Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu.
Fortunately, the President of South Africa, Mr. Siril Ramaphosa, is coming to India as the Chief Guest of the Republic Day.
Revered Bapu and South Africa have an unbreakable bond.
South Africa is the place where Mohen turned into the Great.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started the first Satyagraha and stood firm against casteism.
He had set up a Phoenix and Tolstoy Farm from where there was a voice for peace and tranquility all over the world.
He had the power and inspiration to spend so many years in prison since the worshipped Bapu
Mandela said, God is an integral part of our history because he first used himself on the path of truth.
There is a detailed discussion on the steps needed to strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen.
In this conference, I have announced the introduction of the Sardar Patel Award for National Integration which has contributed in some way to national unity.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his life for the unity of the country.
He has worked for the rest of his life to keep India's integrity intact.
According to him, the country has unity in the diversity of the country.
I would like to pay homage to Sardar Patel through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh on January 13th.
Guru Gobind Singh was born in Patna.
He left his last breath at Nanded in Maharashtra.
Birth Birth Anniversary Patna, Workplace, North India and the last time of life in Nanded.
In a way, the whole of India has received his blessings.
According to Guru Gobind Singh, the biggest service is to remove the grief of the people.
He was accomplished in bravery, valour, sacrifice and reverence.
His extraordinary knowledge was in weapons and scriptures.
He was an architect on the one hand, on the other hand, masterminds from various languages like Gurumukhi, Braj Language, Thiruvananthapuram, Farsi, Hindi, Thiruvananthapuram.
I once again congratulate Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there have been good things in the country which are not widely investigated.
Several events are being organized across the country on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Efficient to create safe and healthy food habits
SWAST BHARAT YATRA is being launched across the country as part of the Eat Right India Mission.
The campaign will continue till 27th January.
India will be prosperous when India is clean and healthy.

Whether it is individual life or national life or social life, the source of inspiration is progress.
Come, let us move ahead with inspiring inspiration, inspiring spirit, devotion, devotional determination, devotional aim, devotional heights, change yourself, change the country too.
Mann Ki Baat November 2019
The 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat was completed today.
Golden Jubilee Episode.
The 50th edition of the letters and phones that have been received this time has been mentioned.
Through the MyGov App, the development work from Delhi's Partukumar, Kamalkumar, Patna has been repeated in the same way by Manika Jain from Delhi, the Government from West Bengal, the musician from Nagpur.
This question is very natural.
Why did Modi bring the radio back when people had almost forgotten the radio
Now the shopkeeper says, listen to this radio.
I heard on the radio, there's talk about the bombing.
The shopkeepers said that Prime Minister Atal Behari Bajpayee ji spoke on the radio about the historic significance of the bomb exploration and nuclear weapons exploration.
I was hoping to see the happiness and dance of the shopkeeper, the people of this region, in the mountainous regions around the snow, these shopkeepers are listening to the radio throughout the day.
I am contemplating the radio's communication reach and its far-reaching impact.
It is natural that when I am the Prime Minister, I will take the help of the strongest connectivity.
Since the month of May 2014, when I started assuming the charge of the Chief Servant, I felt that our country should spread this story of unity, glorious history, valour, diversity, cultural diversity, human rejuvenation, emotions, sacrifices and penance to all the people of the country.
I have reached the 50th episode to read a few letters every month, to listen to the phone calls, to know a lot about the various apps and to share with them, to talk about my own light joy.
The result of this survey is very encouraging.
The Survey says that seventy percent of the audience listening to Mann Ki Baat have heard every episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Most people believe that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced the emotions and thoughts of all sections of the society.
Through Mann Ki Baat, peoples movement has made a lot of progress.
There has been a lot of discussion on Has Tag India Positive.
This is a sweet change in which people are coming forward for social service.
Modi will come and go, but our country will remain immortal, our culture will remain immortal.
These small stories of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
A new motivation filled with enthusiasm will give the country a higher height.
I read letters and feel like this in them and work with them.
Both of these things have been myself and shared with them and shared with you all.
But who knows when these words reach home again.
Whether a government will have so much power to start a scheme like selfie with daughter Philippines from a small village in Haryana, not only from all over the country but also from all over the world.
Every section of the society, even the celebrities, have been linked to this, and the ideals of the society have been demonstrated in a modern language that has brought about a modern generation.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat has been enjoyed, but I feel that 130 crore Indians are always defeated.
Their mind is mine.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government word - it is a matter of society.
There are many aspects of social life in which politics is one way.
Politics cannot be a reflection of a healthy society.
Sometimes political events or political people become so important that the other talent of the society or the other exemplary power of the society is ignored.
It is our collective responsibility to take care of the talent of human beings and other matters of society for the bright future of a country like India.
I believe that the biggest result of the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat is that you are not asking the Prime Minister, as you ask one of your colleagues, this is democracy.
There is also a toll free number - 1  7800, calling there, people record their message in their voices.
I am trying to read as many letters and sounds as possible before Mann Ki Baat.
I heard a lot of phone calls.
Now as soon as the episode of Mann Ki Baat continues, I keep reading your views and thoughts at different places.
That letter isn't just a piece of paper for me.
Besides, I have spent about 40-45 years of my life in one village and in most districts of the country, I have spent a lot of time in every district of the country.
And that is why I can easily connect myself with that place when I get a letter.
I further note some information such as the name of the village, the name of the person.
In fact, the word Mann Ki Baat is myself, but for example, emotions and vitality belong to my countrymen, I want to thank all those who contribute to Mann Ki Baat.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not been able to name Mann Ki Baat till date, but they are not disappointed and keep sending their letters and voices.
I have full faith that your message will come to me more than ever before and will make Mann Ki Baat more interesting, effective and useful.
It is also tried that all the letters that are not included in the Mann Ki Baat programme should also be monitored by the concerned departments regarding all letters and advice.
I also want to thank all the friends of Akashvani, Doordarshan, other TV channels, social media.
Mann Ki Baat is reaching the highest number of people in their hard work.
Thus, they have become Narendra Modi for twenty-three minutes.
I congratulate them for their talents and skills, thank them.
I urge all of you to listen to this event in your regional language.
I thank all those friends of the media who are regularly organising the Mann Ki Baat programme on their channels.
Any political person is not satisfied with the media, it seems that he is very less covered or negative coverage, but the media has taken up a number of topics in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
This journey of Mann Ki Baat was incomplete without your help.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
Normally I say I have no secrets.
What I'm doing is perhaps in every family.
Let me speak in a simple language - I try to make myself like all those youngsters, keep myself in that position and try to match their opinion with a wave length match.
We have some old baggages in our lives, if they don't come forward then it will be easier for us to make it easier.
I don't know how one of them has left their thoughts and confessed to others.
The present young men have a good quality, they never do what they don't believe in themselves, and when they believe in something, they leave everything behind them.
Often people discuss the communication gap between the elders of the family and the teenagers.
But most of the families had limited discussions with the teenagers.
Most of the time you talk about studies or practices, like style, don't do this.
It is also a matter of concern that the conversation is slowly decreasing in the family.
Any media is important if you accept your expectations and do not talk badly.
Through various programmes and social media, I have been having immense interaction with the youth.
I always learn from the thoughts and thoughts of the youth.
Young people have different ideas.
Youngsters are innovative, innovative and indispensable.
Someone said that young students want to work together.
I mean, what's wrong with that
They are superior to Multi-Tasking, so they do it.
If we look around, there will be social initiatives, start-ups, sports or any other sector, there will be major changes in the society.
The youngsters who dared to ask and dream.
If we can give up the ability to decide on the youth and if they openly express their thoughts then they can bring about a positive change in the country and they are doing it.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to Mai Gov website, Vineeta ji wrote that the Mann Ki Baat of this time needs to say something about the 'Sandhya Divas' on 26th November.
His speech is a special day because we are entering the 77th year of the Constitution of India.
Vineeta ji, thank you very much for your suggestion
Yes, tomorrow is the 'Sandhya Divas'.
Let us remember all those great personalities who have created our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949.
It took two years and 11 months and 17 days to complete the historic work of the Constitution.
Just imagine, within three years, these great talented people have given us such a comprehensive and comprehensive constitution.
This is a unique example of time management and productivity even today.
Inspired by this, we are also eager to finish our responsibilities in record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a gathering of the great talented people of the country, and each one of them was responsible for providing such a Constitution to the nation so that the empowerment of the people of India and the poorest of the poor could be helped.
The main features of our Constitution are that we have detailed descriptions of rights and duties, i. e.
The balance between these two things will take the country forward in the lives of the citizens of the country.
If we respect each other's rights, you will be protected by your rights. Similarly, if we do our duty to the Constitution, then our right to protect ourselves will also be fulfilled.
I remember that in the last 60 years of India's democracy in Gujarat, we have taken a transformation on the back of the elephants.
It was a memorable endeavour to consciously awaken the constitution of the youngsters and make them interested in the various streams of the Constitution.
As a democratic country in 2020, we will complete 70 years and will complete 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Come, let us all respect the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
6th December is his Mahaparinirvana Diwas.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I salute Baba Saheb who has given the right to save crores of Indians.
He was under the auspices of Baba Saheb and said that the democratic ideals of India are not external.
There was no new definition for India.
In the Constitutional Assembly, he had made an impression that we have achieved this independence after many battles and that is why we have to protect it with the last gap of our blood.
He used to say that no matter how different the Indians grow, the thinking of the welfare of the country always prioritizes.
Once again my tribute to Babasaheb.
My dear countrymen, on 23rd November, we have celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev has always wished for human welfare.
He has always shown the society the path of truth, action, service, compassion and harmony.
Our country will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev, which will be marked by the nation and spread across the globe.
All States and Union Territories have been requested to observe this day with smoke.
Similarly, the 550th edition of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated across the world.
With this, a train will also be run in all the holy places associated with Shri Guru Nanak Dev.
Recently, when I was talking about this, I remember Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
This gurudwara was widely damaged during the earthquake in Gujarat in 1965, but it is worth noting that the people of the state along with the local people revived the gurudwara.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that the passengers of our country can easily visit the holy land of Shri Guru Nanak Dev at Kartarpur, Pakistan.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th edition, we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat. I believe that my thoughts about the Mann Ki Baat programme have been reflected in front of you for the first time because you wanted to know that.
Our journey will continue.
As much as I can dare you, this journey will be deeper and satisfactory.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of the people, what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Today, I want to say that the feedback of Mann Ki Baat has touched my heart and most people have said that when they listen to Mann Ki Baat programme, they feel that the gods of the family share their words with them.
I am very happy when I came to know that I am one of you, one of you, and all of you have made me bigger. I will meet you all through Mann Ki Baat as a family member.
Your goodness, I'm good too.
Come, let us take this journey forward.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
My wish, you must participate in this race of unity in large numbers.
About six and a half months before independence, the publication of the famous International Journal Time Magazine was published on January 27, 1974.
Time service has given India a design in its lead stories.
There were more than 550 native states.
Though the interest of the British in India was lost, they wanted to keep the country clean.
The Time had written, India is in danger of separation, violence, food crisis, price rise and empowerment, but if anyone has the power to bind the country on the basis of unity, then Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Gandhiji told Sardar Patel that the problems of the states are so frightening that you can solve it.
Sardar Patel really found a way to solve problems and showed the impossible task of keeping the entire country in the path of unity.
Whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad, Tribankur or Rajasthan, Sardar Patel is the only person who is intelligent and in line with the strategy of Rank Policing, today we can see India.
It is natural for us to remember the reverence of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel when we look at our mother India.
The birth anniversary of Sardar Patel on 31st October is even more important because this day, as a revered tribute to him, we will hand over the Statue of Unity to the nation.
The statue, set up on the banks of Narmada river in Gujarat, is twice the USAs Statue of Liberty.
This will be the world's highest skyscraping architecture.
Every Indian can proudly proudly say that the tallest statue in the world is now in India.
I believe that this unique architecture will be marked as a favourite destination across the country.
This was the day when Indian soldiers landed in Kashmir and protected the valley from the intruders.
This historic event is also related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I had an old meeting of the greatest soldiers of India.
In this meeting, Field Marshall meant the time when he was Colonel.
At that time, a military mission was launched in Kashmir in 1947.
The Field Marshal explained how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was disturbed by a meeting to delay the sending of troops to Kashmir. In the meeting, Sardar Patel pointed out that there will be no delay in the army operations in Kashmir and resolved the problem as soon as possible.
On 31st October, our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhis death anniversary.
I salute the king.
My dear countrymen, are there people who don't like sports
Spirit, Stamina, Strength, Skill etc. are very important in the sports world.
All these qualities are the measurements of success of a player.
On the other hand, these four qualities are also important for nation building.
With all these qualities among the youth of any country, they will not only improve the economy, science and technology of the country but will also showcase the country's victory in sports.
Recently, I have two meetings that are worth remembering.
Firstly, I got the opportunity to meet the Para athletes participating in the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
India has created an integral record in winning 72 medals in this game and has enhanced the dignity of the country.
We have won 3 more medals at Mix Event of 13 medals.
You must be reminded that India's performance in Asian films was very good.
Look, in the last few minutes, how many times I have used the best, the most beautiful words.
He was eight years old.
He spent the next eight years in an unarmed manner.
He did the work of cleaning the DTC's bus and washing the roadsides to drive a lifelong drive after unnatural work.
This is the Namami Golden Jubilee of India today.
Not only this, the area of sports in India is gaining such an extension that in the Judo-like event where India has not received any medal in Junior or Sinior Level till date, Tababi Devi has created a negative history in Judo in Youth Olympics.
Hundred years old Youth Tababi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
His father sold a daymaster and mother fish.
There were times when they didn't mean to buy food.
Such situations have also led to the rise of Tababi Devi.
He created history for winning medals for the country.
There are many more such stories, the source of inspiration for everyone's life.
Every young player, his enthusiasm is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, all of you remember that we successfully achieved the FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUP in 2017.
It has also been appreciated in the world's most successful tournaments.
FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUPRACHARD BRING THE Audience.
More than 12 lakh audiences have witnessed the football in different parts of the country and have encouraged young players.
This time India has gained the privilege of the World Cup Hockey Organization in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will continue from 28th November to 16th December.
Any Indian who does not love any game has a different place in his mind.
India has a golden history in Hockey.
In the past, India has won a few times, has won a film once.
India has also gifted some world class players in the Hockey Games.
If we talk about hockey at any place in the world, then it is incomplete.
The magician of Hollywood, Major, is known all over the world.
Besides, Balbir Singh has brightened Indias name in the world from Sinior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Saheed and Udham Singh.
Even today, the Hockey players of Team India are showing success to the new generations of labour and dedication.
It gives the sportsperson a wonderful experience.
When we go to Bhubaneswar, we will encourage not only the Indian team but also the entire nation.
There is a legacy of prosperity and cultural excellence and the people of Orissa must remember and motivate.
Orissa is also a good opportunity for sportsmen.
I also convey my best wishes to the rest of the world.
My dear countrymen, many people are coming forward in the work of social service, they are doing volunteering, it is becoming a great inspiration for the people of the country.
A young man has made a pledge to learn a wheelchair basketball for the basketball in the wheelchair.
Here's the psychology, this is the mission mode acquaintance.
There are people of India who will not be proud of listening to this.
This idea will inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I saw your offers on Mann Ki Baat, I got the opportunity to see a very thrilling voice from Mr. Manish Mahapatra of Puducherry.
He wrote in MyGov, Please recall this time in Mann Ki Baat, how the people of India and their traditions and traditions become the best example of unity with nature.
We need to learn something from the way we commit ourselves to their heritage for sustainable development.
Manish ji, I express my gratitude to you for keeping such a thing in front of the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is one of the things that I inspire to see our glorious past and culture back. Today, the world is discussing environment conservation, particularly in the West, and looking for a path of balanced lifestyle.
Today, our India is not far away from this problem, but we have to commit ourselves to solve it.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship plants and flowers like gods and goddesses.
Bhil tribes of Madhya Pradesh, particularly those of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship trees like Bat, Arjun.
In a desert like Rajasthan, Vishnoi has shown us the path of conservation of society.
They're ready to sacrifice their lives for the conservation of trees, but they're not ready to confess a tree.
The Mishmi-Arunchals denounce their relationship with tigers.
They mean him as their brothers and sisters.
Even Nagaland, the tiger was seen as the protector of the forest.
The people of the Warlin community of Maharashtra regard the tiger as guests, as a symbol of tiger prosperity.
The Kola community of Madhya Pradesh means that they have their own destiny with the tiger, if the tiger does not cook, the villagers will have to remain insignificant.
The Gond of India stops fishing at some places in the Breeding Season.
These places are called the shelters of fish and they have a large number of fresh fishes.
Tribal communities build their homes from natural materials which become stronger and environment friendly.
In southern India, there is a small population in every region of the Nilgiri Mountain, which, according to tradition, makes their settlements locally available.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that tribal communities believe in being very peaceful and united among themselves, but whenever they harm their natural resources, they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were tribal people.
Who can forget Lord Veerasa Munda who fought hard against the British rule to protect their forests.
There are many such examples of tribal communities that teach us how to live in harmony with nature and that our country is obliged to the tribal community for the wildlife that is surrounding us.
Come, we respect them.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, we talk about the problems faced by all those people who have been doing some commendable work for the society.
All those things that seem to be normal but in reality it has a far-reaching impact on the changing mindset and the goals of society.
A few days ago, I was reading about Gurubachan Singh ji of Panjab.
Gurubachan Singh ji's son was married to an ordinary and hardworking farmer.
Prior to this marriage, Gurubachan Singh Ji had told the parents of Kann that they would make this marriage unanimous.
He suddenly said he had a condition.
Nowadays, if you have a condition in marriage, it seems usually he's going to talk about some big chunk, so that the family of Conn's family will fall into trouble.
But you will be surprised to know that brother Gurubachan Singh was a simple white farmer and he told his father that the condition that I am talking about is the real strength of the society.
Gurubachan Singh ji said, You promise me, don't postpone the surplus remains after you have spent the crop on the farm land.
You can imagine how big social power is hidden in them.
Gurubachan Singh ji seems to be very optimistic, but it shows his personality and we have seen that there are many such families in our society who have transformed personal matters into good work for the society.
Shri Gurubachan Singh ji's family has set an example.
I read about another village of Punjab, Kallar Majra, which is near Nawar.
Kallar Majra was at the forefront because the people there did not burn the paddy bark and mixed it with the ground, so that the necessary technology itself was created.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurubachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to the people of Kerala and those places who have been trying their best to free the environment from pollution.
All of you are moving forward in the right direction to the healthy lifestyle of Indian Heritage.
Just as the drops of water generate sea, such small awareness and positive work always helps in creating a positive environment.
India has a special significance on November 11 this year, as the first World War ended on November 11, a hundred years ago.
That is, a hundred years after the end of that terrible destruction and destruction.
First World War is an important event for India.
In fact, we had nothing to do with this great war.
In spite of this, our soldiers fought with Bahadur in this war, played a very important role and made maximum sacrifices.
Indian soldiers showed the world that they were not behind anybody in the battlefield.
Our soldiers showcased their valour in difficult situations in remote areas.
This was aimed at restoring peace.
In the first World War, the whole world saw the destruction.
It is estimated that about one crore soldiers and more civilians lost their lives.
After this horrific war, the entire world understood the significance of peace.
Peace has changed in the last hundred years.
My dear countrymen, there is a speciality in the north-east of this country.
The natural beauty here is immense and the people here are very talented.
Our north-east is now known for the best and greatest work.
It's a place where organic farming has improved greatly.
A few days back, the Sustainable Food System has won the Secretaries of Hon'ble Future Policy Gold Award for promoting long-term foodgrains.
The award was conferred on FAO Arthod Fod and Agricultural Organization.
You will be glad to know that the award for the best principles in this field is equivalent to Oscar.
Not only this, our Sikkim has won the award for losing twenty-five single nominees of the country.
That's why I thank the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, the month of October is coming to an end.
Climate changes.
Winter has come and the season of festivals has come up with climate change. Dhanteras, Deepavali, Bhaifota, Chhat Puja are also celebrated in the month of November.
My best wishes to every countrymen for all the festivals.
I would like to urge you to take care of yourself during the festivals, take care of your health and also look at the good of the society.
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the country.
The country will move as much as you move forward.
