Black box in your car
While the US road planners are struggling with the lack of funds to improve the highway system, many people are seeing the solution in the small black box, which is fitted by your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every miles of vehicles run by the motor-challer and transmits the information to the authorities, nowadays, to revive the old system to finance the US major roads, Washington and State Planning Office has become a controversial effort issue.
Generally, booming work like highway planning has also become an issue of deep debate and live alliances.
You have kept details of the miles driven by you, and possibly the driven place - and then to make use of this information tax bill - the government has got support in favor of allowing them to use these black boxes with librarian environmental groups.
The tea party is frustrated.
The US Civil Freedom Association is also very worried about raising various types of confidential issues.
While the Congress could not agree whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They are searching how they can go to a system in the next decade, in which the driver pays for every miles fixed on the road.
Thousands of motor operators have already taken black boxes for test drive, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is actually a compulsory thing for our country.
"This is not the subject of our choice or not, it is to say that Hasan Ikhrata, who is the executive director of the South California Government Association, who is planning to start tracking every miles fixed by motor operators in California by 2025. Are there.
We are going to change the way we pay tax.
Technology is to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's highway trust fund has almost become bankrupt, which is financed by the payment of taxes made by American citizens on gas pumps.
American people do not buy as much gas as before.
Now the car runs more than a milestone in a gallon gas.
There was no increase in federal tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cent per gallon.
Due to high prices of gas, politicians also avoid increasing one money in tax.
Transport Policy expert Lee Munikh, at the University of Minesota, says, "As far as it is concerned, it is not commendable.
His state has recently installed trekking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the long run, it will work as the most logical option.
Wonx calls it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea is good for urban liberals, because for example, taxes can be changed to change the way of running a car, which can help in reducing jams and reducing greenhouse gas.
The planners of California are eager to this system, while they are developing strategies to fulfill the target set in the state's ambitious Global Warming Acts.
But the Chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip Bill Shuster (A-PA), also considers black box as the most viable long-term option.
In the Region Foundation, independent sellers are also in favor of paying per miles by the driver.
In the Region, Policy Vice President Adrian Mur said, "This is not the only thing that is going to the blind well."
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
This campaign has also been supported by two former US transport secretaries, who in their report in 2011, had gratitude to move forward towards the per-mile payment from the Congress.
The US Senate had sanctioned a testing project of  90 million last year, in which 10,000 cars had joined.
But working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing those people who had to go to work daily or go to the city, the leadership of the House ended the proposal there.
Still, many states and cities are moving forward in this direction themselves.
It has the most interested organ, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the miles duty instead of gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York city is also moving forward in this direction.
Elinois is trying with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 State Transport Departments (Marineland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), along with Eastern Sebord, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support from all places.
In Nawada, where the device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers a while ago, the driver was very impatient to think that the government can monitor their every move.
Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management in the Nawada Transport Department, says, "There was a major problem concerning Big Brother and similar things."
This is not something that people wanted.
With the advancement of the test, NAVA's ACLU had warned on its website: "It would be very easy to convert this device into a complete trekking device."
There is no need to develop a huge, unrestrained technology structure, which must be spread to keep records of every person's daily visit.
Nevada is one of the many states that are making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get the details of how many miles of the car is going on every day, but it is not where and what time it is going on.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology has brought some state agencies to the small California Start-up named Tru Miles.
This firm was not originally in the business of helping state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which the drivers had to pay on their miles.
But the device which is testing is good for the highway planners, because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modem at the appointed time.
Ryan Marisan, chief executive of True Miles, said, "If you do not track the speed and place of people, they will be more interested in adopting this method."
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programs of the state.
There are very little expensive and less interfering methods to do so.
In Oregon, the planners are using different options to the drivers.
They can choose GPS devices with or without GPS.
Or can not choose any device again, but can choose to pay the prescribed fee on the average miles fixed by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this concept can be sold to the concerned citizens by providing more facilities than less in the device.
In New York city, transport officials are trying to develop such taxing devices, which will also have the facility of payment of parking meter fees, "According to their drive, payment insurance will be provided, and other drivers will create a collection of real time speed data, which will be used to avoid motor-challer traffic. "
The city planning document states, "Moters and operators will be attracted to partition due to the benefits received from it."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps all the discussions on payment according to the miles are a big deal.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Gulf region has said that Congress can easily deal with the problem of the bankruptcy highway trust fund by increasing gas tax.
On the drivers of hybrid or other cars, additional time or annual fees can also be imposed, whose vehicles do not use too much gas so that they pay their proper share.
Randy Rentseller, director of the law and public affairs of the commission, said, "When the aspirin can work, what is the need for a radical surgery for him.
If we do this, millions of car drivers will be worried about their confidentiality and many other things.
According to the police, his death has happened due to drowning.
Of course, his friend has been detained by the police for allegedly hiding the deceased goods.
The police has submitted the final report of the investigation of death in the court.
It is known that on August 26, the police had recovered the body of ahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Dariya.

In the report, the police said that the phone and SIM of the deceased were examined and it was found that his phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman told in the interrogation that she has given this phone to her relative Ruhal Gauhar.
Ruhal also lives in Padshahi Bagh and he was a friend of late ahid.
Ruhal went to Jhelum with ahid after Namaz-e-umma on August 25.
ahid opened his clothes and kept all the goods on the edge, while Ruhal went on the other side to drink cigarette.
When he came back, ahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhal searched ahid, but he did not get it.
On this, he picked up his mobile phone, watch and other things and kept it for his use.
He did not tell anyone that ahid has drowned.
Police told the court that ahid's death has happened due to drowning and it has also been confirmed in the post-mortem.
Of course, Ruhal has been detained under section 404 to hide the facts and the luggage of the deceased.

It is notable that Modi has come to Bihar for a consolidation visit organized by the BJP.
The organization of the Santana Yatra is the exercise of killing the people of the people killed in the blasts in Patna on behalf of the BJP.
It is notable that there were seven blasts after one after another during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally on October 27 in Patna.
The intention of Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts was to create a stampede during the rally so that more people are casualties and there is panic in the state.
The motive of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyr by the BJP.
Party leaders have gone on a trip from Thursday with bones and bones from their village.
On November 5, all of them will be flown together in the Ganges in Patna.
Consolidation travel is organized as part of this journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will meet their families after going to the villages of the people killed in the blasts from 7 am on Saturday morning.

The BJP has already announced this financial help.
Encouraged by the blasting victory in the last match, when the Indian team will land in the seventh and final oneday against Australia at M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday, its goal will be to capture the series with victory.
In order to stay in the series after washing two consecutive matches due to rain, India had to win Nagpur vendetta in any situation and its batsmen performed a blast and won the record, so that the team matched 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has achieved the goal of more than 350 runs twice and once again the responsibility of crossing the team will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at the peak at this time and the big goal is also proving to be a bond in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in the tremendous form, but the team will also have a lot of expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, Rohit and the summit have got such a salute added as the team, which is easing the work of the remaining batsmen from concrete partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he gave a great partnership in the opening and gave Virat an opportunity to play without any pressure.
Kohli has so far performed the third number, he is considered to be Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
Rather, many cricket pundits have termed them better than Sachin.
Virat, who is going to be 25 years old next week, has installed 17 second century, out of which India has won 16.
Following the goal, their average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
The top three batsmen of India are in a strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can be harmful to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were flooding badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, he can work as a good wage 'Lifeline' in Bangalore ODI.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially captain George Belly, have influenced everyone by their performance.
They are also demanding to be taken to the Test team for domestic access series against England.
Australia has good batsmen up to 9th.
Besides Belly, Shen Watson, Glen Maxwell, Adam Vogs and James Fockner have made good bats in the series.
However, Phil Hyunge and Aeron Finch have not been able to leave any effect in the opening.
The lack of Michel Johnson in bowling can be huge for Australia.
Johnson, who has been performing spectacularly in the series, has been sent home to prepare for the Asia Search.
BJP National Executive member and Chief Spokesperson Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working a new policy of infiltrating terrorists under the guise of this showing peace.
Referring to the reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan is insisting on the heel peak to infiltrate terrorists around 2000 prepared in its training camps.
For this, he will never let peace on the border.
Pakistan has worsened after the failure of the separatists to spoil the situation on a large scale by provoking people in Kashmir.
Referring to the Pakistani visit of separatists last year, the BJP leader said that ISI Chief Lieutenant General ahir ul Islam, Lashkar, Hizb's gangster Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Saludin had assured that terrorism would be given air in 2014.
Pakistan is engaged in fulfilling this promise seriously.
Suicide attacks in the killing of soldiers on the border, Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand for ending the privileges of the army in the state as fatal, the BJP leader said that such things are also anti-people till there is permanent peace in the state.
They give honey to anti-national elements.
He emphasized that statements of leaders' army, security forces should be banned.
Prepare snow day to help Germany on the American surveillance
Edward Snow Dane, the American intelligence informer, has declared that Germany is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to Parliament if US national security agency and its director Kitha Alexander fails to respond to their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Stro Belle met Mr. Snow Dane Seguru in Russia, where he has been sheltered to talk about testimony in Germany.
The MP said in a letter submitted by Mr. Snow Dane before the media in Berlin on Friday, "However, the result of my efforts is positive, my government believes in disagreement as a party-change, and does not provide any protection, which is trying to criminalize political speech with allegations of punk. "
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Dane said that he believes that he can persuade the US government to dispose of criminal allegations against the international community.
The allegations filed by the US Department of Justice include secretariat and theft of the government's property.
Hans Peter Fredrich, German Internal Affairs Minister, told Online Deit: Shree Snow Dane is ready to talk to German officials, so we have to find ways to make it possible.
The relationship between the US and Germany has come under pressure because the NSA has claimed that the Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone has been bug.
Thomas Operman, MP, who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, takes care of intelligence. He said that if there was a chance to listen to Mr. Snow Dane as a witness, "the relationship with the United States was completely wasted and brought them in danger, it should also be taken.
Mr. Stre Belle, a Green Party MP from Germany published a picture of himself with Mr. Snow Dane on Twitter feed.
He said that two German journalists were on their trip to Russia.
Shristro Belle said that according to the former NSA contractor lawyer, if he left Russia, Snow Dane is not able to return to Russia.

The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with German officials , When the problems of human condition are resolved .
Rontier Airlines will charge carriage on bags
Dontier Airlines plans to charge 100 to store goods to passengers on their plane board.
In the Rantier Airlines, there is a plan to start a charge for 100 for a career on bag and it will charge 2 for coffee or soda, although it announced on Wednesday that passengers can keep the entire box.
New cari-on duty is for bags in overhead bin, so small bags below the seat will still be charged free.
Rontier said that "25 charges will be paid in advance, if the passengers wait to pay if they are on the gate.
Rontier spokesman Kate O'Mailly said that "100 fees have to be obtained to take care of the charge in advances of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him, he said.
Airlines started charge for the first and second check bag in 2008.
Those travelers who are trying to escape from the fees are as much as they can... which is stashed in the overhead box in the carriage on bags, that means there is often less space in this box.
There's a way to bring down for passengers on the fee board.
O'Mailie said that this is not really about raising new charge money.
It's the most loyal customers about Rontier to find out instead of overhead bin has become very difficult.
Travelers who buy tickets in their website of the airline do not have to give this.
This means that the next person in line may have to pay  100 for a uniform bag, while a passenger in line at a frontier gate can get a bag free.
O'Mailie said that the processes of Rantier's website and check in are being changed to ensure that passengers know about the fees before getting the gate.
Rontier's new cari-on fees, will not start until summers though a date has not been fixed.
Travelers often express dissatisfaction about bagage fees and other charges, but the airline prefers them.
They argue that money is spent to handle the bags, and those travelers who want service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are seen as a signal that many airlines are charged enough money to cover the cost of air travel after the deficit years.
Most of them don't even touch the cari-on bag fee.
Spirit Airlinis Inc started the first time three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
With such a fee, other airlines are Hungary's iir, which airline adviser J. Sorensen said, and who tracks the Ad-on-Feace.
He said that Spirit's cari-on duty brings 50 million dollars in one year, which was estimated in the December 2011 report.
A former official of Sorensen, Midwest Airlines recently flew to Spirit and passengers had to face a unusual bag fee on the gate but wondered.
"Bording process that I saw in my airline career was simple, he said.
I hoped to grind the teeth and look out at a fight gate.
"It was full of humility and he climbed it licketty-split."
Rontier is also following  2 fees for coffee, tea, soda, or spirit for juice.
Rontier Nekaha that the passengers who take soda, or juice can keep the entire box, and it'll give free coffee for just once.
It'll still remove the water.
US Airways tried to charge for drinking substances in 2008, but after seven months after the passengers complained, they retreated and followed any other main airline there.
Rontier's passengers don't buy directly from the airline, then this move of Rontier to charge the duty on the carriage-on is his latest attempt to operate customers towards his own website.
Airlines pays online travel seller for this kind of 10 to 25 each sold ticket.
This is the reason why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from those people rather than going through an online travel agency.
Dontier, however, has moved forward in this area.
In September many often started flying miles from half to those customers who bought from these persons from an online travel agency
On Wednesday, it reduced the Milage Award up to 25 percent of the trip miles.
So, a 1000 miles longer trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It is also that they allow to choose their seats in advance for the only passengers to purchase directly from the Rontier website.
In Denver of Rontier, there's a loyal base of customers in your home town, but its business is decreasing and it's losing money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and its flight capacity decreased by approximately 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial consequences released by corporate partner Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Are trying to fix the finance of Rontier as part of the sale of Republic airline.
NSA charged "internal error" instead of hackers to crash the website
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that due to some technical deficiency our website was closed for hours, not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
Intelligence Agency said in the statement sent to the email, "NSA.gov was not reaching for many hours this night, which was due to internal error during the pre-determined update.
This problem will be resolved this evening.
This claim is not true that this obstacle came due to the distributed denial of service [DDOS].
In the evening, the online server trackers had found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and the site for some users is still not reaching.
The NSA spokesman told ABC News that "the interior, sensitive network of agency" did not even have a "conciliation".
The spokesman said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one handicapped group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA website by the DDOS attack.
DDOS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such a large quantity, unless the site is closed due to the server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unfair and the purpose of the attacks is not to distinguish the internal network of the target system.
Formerly very mysterious NSA, which was once named "no agency", has become a matter of discussion and bitter criticism among the common people due to the presence of incidents of a large number of foreign and domestic espionage programs in the last month - which has been collectively dispersed by former NSA contractor Adward Snowden, secreted NSA files with agency and after mystery.
Due to this kind of growing controversy about agency, after the night incident, such speculations were made that this incident was the result of targeted cyber operation.
A beautiful expression was presented according to the story of 'A and Dronacharya' showing reconciliation in the Dwapar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's perspective, a guru is forced to walk on the wrong path by hostage in the daughters.
The drama was inaugurated jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Chairman of the Cantonment Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh in the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College.
In the play, the compatibility of Dwapar era's Dronacharya and presently a professor Arvind's conditions was shown.
In the drama directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Visain, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sammy, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. performed a great presentation with the characters.
The light system in the play was designed by young painter Jitendra C. Raj and set Hemant Kumar.
After this, various awards were given to Vibhutis, who contributed literary, culturally to Apta at the function.
In this, Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, Head of Urdu Department of Charan Singh University, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and painter Jitendra C. Raj were given.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc. contributed to the executive office bearers in making the event successful.
Bombardier's profits fall as aircraft delivery, drop in orders
Canada's airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported on Thursday to drop 15 percent of the net profit, in the third quarter of its train unit and less than that on contract issues and pressure by delivery.
Montreal based Bombardier also did not present an update on issues on the issue of the release of any flight test data for his brand new Series aircraft or its ambitious program to go to commercial service from September next.
Approximately half a month before the first flight of the test aircraft, it has just been blown three times, questioning whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result fell down from the forecast and sent more than 8 percent to the stock stock exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, analyzer share with the National Bank Financial, reduced his rating to demonstrate from death on Thursday, the stock is limited above the next one or two quarters.
"Kamzor aircraft delivery was mostly renowned, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transport, "Dorsen said in a client note."
We'll get a new order for Bombardier Series as the progress of the flying test program.
However, if any new orders are not being announced in the coming months, doubt that the market program will be apprehensive.
Bombardier hopes the airlines can now confuse it at the low end of the market with Boeing and Airbus dominated.

New research has shown that we work with full sincerity and dedication in the morning.
Do not lie to anyone and do not think of stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our mind changes and we start walking against the rule keeping the ideal on one side.
Researchers have given many interesting facts in this research of Harvard University and Youta David Eclus School of Business.
According to researchers, despite not being stressed in work in the morning, we prefer moral values, but honesty decreases due to fatigue or excess pressure as soon as possible.
Researchers used two for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For instance, people had to tell that the point is more on the left or on the right.
Participants were told that if they give wrong answers instead of the right answer, they will be given money.
This experiment was seen that those who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
At the same time, during the use of people from 12 noon to 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave false answers by keeping their asses in mind.
With this, the researchers managed to prove that the greed of money does not make any difference to our honesty in the morning, but as soon as we get in the evening, we stop giving importance to ethics.
This research has been published in the latest issue of psychological science.

Koken's Addi lawyer, who gave secret information about police investigation to Mr. Big, was arrested
42-year-old Basharat Ditta used to inform the notorious criminal Nil Scarboro
The advocate felt that people could find out about the addiction of his confidential drug .
He was sentenced to three years in jail by Liverpool Crown Court
The defendant's top lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid of his drug addiction, people will know about his secret addiction, three years of imprisonment.
42-year-old Barashat Ditta, after compromising due to his cocaine addiction, provided sensitive confidential information about the investigation of his drug trafficking activities to the infamous criminal Neil Scarboro.
This advocate, who was given the title of "Bash", and whose criminals were praised as "Top Brief", was arrested from his house in 2011 after police monitoring operation in Skarboro, which he had represented in the previous Narcotics trial.
Officials had seen 32-year-old Scarborough keeping three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackbern, Lankashire, while he went out with his colleagues for Law Society dinner.
After getting cocaine particles in Ditta's hair, her buttocks, and her credit card, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a regular user of drugs of A category.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to get illegal information about the arrest of two people from Scarboro and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time as part of the main investigation of heroine and cocaine gang operating in Lankashire, Kumbria, Mercede, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 others, who were sent to jail after the police seized cash worth 1.5 million pounds of heroin and cocaine, and more than 200,000 pounds during several raids.
The 42-year-old Ditta used to provide information to the culprits, because he feared that people would not know about his cocaine addiction.
After being found guilty in two cases of disrupting the path of justice after three weeks of trial in Ditta, Liverpool Crown Court, working in the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackband, Liverpool was facing an inadequacy in the Crown Court today.
He had accepted about keeping cocaine in the earlier hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer started when the police came to know that he was in contact with Ditta regularly on the phone from February 2011 while investigating Scarboro.
Two spy followed the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and keeping more than 60 percent narcotic drug under the lawyer's bin in Black Golf Glove.
After the drug was kept, Scarboro Ditta was regularly in touch with the phone, which went out for dinner at Black Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching the house, the lawyer came to know that there was a drug and there was a nine-time dialogue between them.
It was heard in the court that he was found to be a regular user of cocaine in the test when he found a categories of drug clusters on Ditta's hair, buttocks and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said that she was talking to the suspected dealer because she was his client and said that her discussion was "political privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove many credit cards by removing her shoes, but he was seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run office from his house along with his workplace, and his client used to call him at his house for legal cases.
After telling the chief persons arrested, what the detective knew about them, the court hearing said that Ditta used to call the main people of the drug supply series, some of which he had earlier submitted the case.
Annie White on behalf of the prosecution said, "The authority advocate should be very well aware of not breaking the law."
Mr Dittah is accused of misusing his post as a criminal advocate, joining a lot with his specific client.
We are not talking about the general drug dealer, but not about the dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been legal without any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went far ahead of his border with the lawyer-client relationship.
As much as possible, he disrupted the police investigation so that he could continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was insulting not honoring his profession but insulting.
He made very close to certain clients, especially with Scarboro, and he allowed an agreement with his independence.
Ditta denied any wrong work and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, whom I am not, and if I want to provide information to Mr. Scarboro, I do not wait for 15 hours, but I do this work immediately."
But after the hearing, the Superintendent of Lankashire Police Li Helstead said that at the time Shree Ditta started receiving drugs from organized criminals, at the same time she converted herself into a criminal advocate to the culprit.
Because of his cocaine addiction, he made a lot of agreement and became very weak towards the purposes of leading members of organized crime groups, who used him to get important information related to police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of verification, and people should fill faith and confidence.
Mr Ditta has betrayed this belief and has tried to escape under his professional guise.
The serious and organized crime unit of Lankashire examined Shri Dita, in which she was found guilty of three incidents of keeping cocaine and now disrupting the path of justice, which shows our commitment to bring the culprits to the court.
This case should be warned for criminals that no person is away from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cotton.
Twenty other members involved in the gang were sent to jail for 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about him, in which he said that his Fantasi job would be a lawyer for the death penalty client in the US, Mohammad Ali's dinner being guest and inequality should be inspired for his work.

Collson used phone hacking to confirm the secret information
Andy Collson, former editor of News of the World, has been accused that while being the Home Secretary of Charles Clark, he used "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about his personal relations.
Prosecutor Andrew Adis C told Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a wrong rumor in May 2005 that Clark is joining his "fascious special adviser" Hannah Polbi.
It was stated in the court that the newspaper appointed private investigator Glen Mulkyre to hack Polbi's voicemail and keep that male "Nazar", but the callson also called and left his voices.
Mr. Adis said, "The Abhiyan party suggests that Mr. Collson, who is currently editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside the people's house and keep an eye on him, but he keeps writing before the people, see what people react to him. "

The rumor about Clark's transactions was presented for the first time by the Feature Desk of A.O.T.W. when a sexy source in Ms. Polbi had said, "Do not waste your time, it is with Charles.
In August 2006, the tape of Wysmail was seized at least three times from the home from the countrymen, Ms. Polbi's phone.
The investigators also found such entries in the computer of the private investigator, on which Ms. Polbi and his sister were named "Project".
During the period when he was being investigated, information was sought about him by calling anonymity to Ms. Polbi's grandfather.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Navili Turlback and former reporter James Wetherup saw the monitoring of Ms. Polbi's arrival.
On June 18, 2005, through a voicemail, Collson told him: "I have got a story, which we are planning to run tomorrow, about which I definitely want to talk to Charles."
Mr. Adis said that joining the callson in this case is in the parent with other important persons, such as former Home Secretary David Blocket.
The Justice bench heard on Thursday that Collson talked to Mr. Blocket about transactions with a married woman, while at that time she was looking at the case of co-representative Rebekha Brooks, who was married at that time.
Collson and Brooks refused to intervene with other people to hack the phone between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Milkyar, Turlback and Vedarup have accepted phone hacking.

Jems Clapper, director of American National Intelligence emphasized that the US should not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to steal foreign companies' business secrets and enhance American companies their international competitiveness or enhance the line below them in September.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has made a whistleblower, started telling the treasure of his secrets to the American surveillance, the leaders of the European governments and the business world are no longer sure that the director should follow his promise or not.
The American National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , expressed fear of state surveillance .
The last thing came when it came to know that Chancellor Angela Markel's phone was bug, possibly a decade ago.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then the leaders of the trade world are also making potential targets.
Snowden has made deep cooperation transparent between American intelligence services and companies.
I think it would be viable to use these data for mutual benefit .
"Germany should wake up Oliver Grn, President of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies."
According to a survey published by the Consultancy of German companies in July, the US has almost become a big risk now, like China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
In all the records, Mr. Snowden leaked, but there's no evidence that the US has to go to business mysteries of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed the lack of the European Union ' s Internet capabilities , and must try to reduce their dependence on the United States .
The leaders of the business world are doubting this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and gradually open them again...
Hasso Platner, President of German business software company SAP, said, "This is no way.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, then he did not have to die 20 years ago.
Everything is concessional in Germany, from coal to car, farmers.
But IT industry is everything.
Snowden ' s disclosures about American technical reforms and espionage access have proved to be an injury to some companies , which previously believed that the biggest surveillance threat is China .
There is a major change in the Cloud Computing Centre where European officials are more aware that the data collected in the United States are under the jurisdiction and , therefore , potentially sensitive .
According to a survey excluded by a business organization, Cloud Security Alliance, some 10 percent non-US members canceled the plan to use an American based cloud provider after the disclosure about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, SAP co-chair executive officer says, "We saw a new question that had not come to the customers a year ago, "Where is my data stored" And can you guarantee that it will be physically in that jurisdiction
Many German officials argue that the latest report is just confirming whether they already knew: the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data and therefore they should be guarded at every cost.
It is not a matter of surprise that there is economic espionage.
This has always happened.
"This is a topic for many years, and through the original present discussion, do not change anything, Curt Bock, the main executive of chemical manufacturer BAS."
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we also do , because it is in national interest to defend our business
The corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defense system and it is a benefit for the attacker.
For the big companies, the message is being recorded for a long time, whether it is uncomfortable to leave one in the business from home, with a usb stick, or leaving a laptop unnecessarily in a hotel room is uncomfortable to say at least.
Members of the board of Larich Hackenberg, car manufacturer Audi, say, "It is a year old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings because they can not be used as remote hearing equipment.
Germany's CB executives while smart phones are compromising due to risk on foreign tours, advice to consider using simple prepaid mobile.
Prepaid mobile phones were later thrown.
However, it is a matter of concern that small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many companies are the top in the global market in special place.
"Small and medium size companies often warn in a report to protect corporate secrets effectively against lack of experience, personnel and financial resources unauthorized access."
The US has warned other countries about the economic espionage of its own companies.
According to the France The Washington Post, the name of American National Intelligence in February is named in another tire of criminals involved in hacking for the financial information behind China with Russia and Israel.
According to a board member of a German Blue Chip Company, when the matter comes to economic spy, then French is the worst
In an interview, former head of the Bernerd Suarcini French Interior Intelligence Agency URI, explains: "Savels know well that even if they cooperate in the non-terrorist war, they spy on their colleagues.
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we also do , because it is in national interest to defend our business
Nobody foolish.
"The parents of the teenager of Georgia, who were killed in the accident, believe that their son was killed.
A teenager from Georgia whose dead body was found wrapped in the restling match in his high school gym, believes that his son was murdered, this was said by the family's advocate on Thursday.
Valdosta, GA Kentrik Johnson was found trapped in the match standing straight behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
The investigators of the Laundes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson had died in an "annough accident", but the 17-year-old boy's family denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Serpent, who presented Kenneth and Jackalin Johnson, told Fox News.com that "He believes that his son has been murdered."
They do not even trust the death of Sheriff in the said manner.
The sequence said that "he believes that this thing is beyond the logic of physical rule and general intelligence."
They feel that this conclusion is a pretext for the safety of the person responsible for the death of his son or the people.
He said, "He sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned to a bodybag.
US Advocate General Michael Morare said on Thursday that he is doing a formal investigation about Johnson's death, considering that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the reason for death
Did he be killed due to some crime
Muray said these things in a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they take us.
My purpose is to bring the truth out.
He said, "I think environmental reasons are available for a formal investigation."
The urine told the reporter that initial body tests indicate that Johnson's death was consequently due to stable respiratory resurrection.
According to the urine, in the second body test, there was a different reason for death.
He said, "There are many questions that should be answered or confirmed."
Murra also said that if he finds enough evidence to summon a criminal or investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, then he will ask the FBI to do it.
Representatives were not available immediately for comments from the office of Laundage County Sheriff on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the judge of Southern Georgia ordered the authorities to issue all monitoring videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say that they hope that there will be some indications from the video footage how he died.
CDC issues guidelines related to allergy of children for schools
On Wednesday, the Disease Control and Prevention Center issued guidelines for controlling food allergies of children in the school.
For the first time such guidelines have been issued by the US government, because the number of children going to school is increasing due to food allergy.
Now one of the 20 children in the US has food allergy.
CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, cases of food allergy in children have increased by 18 percent.
In this guidelines, it has been informed for schools how teachers and employees should be informed about food allergy of children, and how to handle them in case of any allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested that they should keep the stock of epinephrine to face potentially fatal intensity (Anaphilexis) - which is the auto-injector of APPen Brand, which is commonly used.
The state assembly has recently upgraded the rules, so that the schools can keep the stock of apnephrine in large quantities easily.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It seems that something is kissing in my tongue, "It seems that my tongue has hair, or "my tongue is being bowled."
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose their children's gender unresolved
Germany has become the first country of the European Union, which has recognized the third gender for children born with unclear genitals.
Now the newborn children will not be specified in a routine manner.
According to the new law, parents do not need to declare gender for such children, this law allows them to declare gender "unrestrained or "unrestrained" on the birth certificate of the child.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce pressure on the parents who can take decisions related to gender-describement operations for newborn children, and struggle with discrimination against intersex children.
According to BBC, an intersex person had said years later, "I am a man, not a woman."
I will remain a wounded, stained packed by the doctors.
According to the estimate, one of the 2,000 children every year is such that neither the boy nor the girl.
They are intersexes, part of a group of about 60 situations, which comes under the investigation of the disorders of sexual development, this is a collective word which is used for abnormal chromosomes, genitals (sex or abnormally developed gender.
It may be that Valice sympson is intersex.
Although gender identification is not considered properly, but most experts in United States believe that when gender can not be sustained, then it is better to use the best information to specify gender and to get surgery, if such a job comes, check the psychological and physical development of the child before.
Dr. Jack Dresser, psychologist of New York City, who is expert in cases of gender acquisition, said that the new law of Germany appears to be "good."
Intersex children create moral confusion.
He said, "Some people are in a lifestyle condition for which surgery is needed, but it does not happen with most children."
You can specify gender without surgery, and after that see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a gender will develop in any child is not very accurate.
No person can give a proper answer about why this happens.
This is a kind of puzzle why people are homosexual.
In the report filed before the European Commission in 2011, intersex people have been described in different forms from transsexual or transgender people, because their condition is not related to gender, but it is not clearly related to its organic creation, which is neither a man nor a woman but either jointly or any of the two is clearly defined.
These features can show themselves secondary gender symptoms such as the weight of muscles, the distribution of hair, the breast and length of primary gender symptoms such as reproductive organs and genitals or chromosome structure and hormones.
This report also provides a sympathy about intercepts and transgender individuals facing discrimination in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and biased crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-favourable gender.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark men, women or third genders on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian nurse May-Welbi became the world's first recognised genderless person after winning the legal appeal made to keep life-long "invisible gender status".
According to the Interior Ministry, in addition to M or F in German passport, intersex persons will also have third specification as .
According to the news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighboring country France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers have signed a petition to withdraw gender theory from the school books strictly from this Catholic country.
US website Catholic online has also opposed this law of Germany saying, "When the world is going in such a state where the gender is the option to choose itself, but not sexual activity, we are taking two more columns of civilization in the opposite direction. "
In Maryland, the mother of a newborn child also told Baby one that she would like to see the children being specified at the time of birth.
He said on the website about the upbringing, "The upbringing is very stressful, especially if you do not even know what your child's gender is.
Children need stability and definitivity.
Historically, the children born with both men and women were called Harmaphrodites (Ubhilingi), which was in the name of beautiful Greek God, which was double.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered Ling as a slate, which could be deleted and rewritten.
But now many people are challenging the morality of surgery, they understand that gender delivery is a complex job, and sometimes there may be a mistake from the doctors, who do not know that children will feel about their gender specification when they grow up.
Dresser says, "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called "Manorog Emergency".
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you used to call the surgery.
The present theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitals was presented by Dr. John Money of John Happkins University, who considered the gender as golden.
He created the gender identity word and argued that social and environmental indications - how do parents raise the child - intercourse with the child's genes and hormones determines that he should be identified as a man or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, which is known as John John, their principles became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose gender was accidentally sex during the sex-surgeon (surgeon) that they should get the egg out of the child's full bond and resume it like a girl.
Dresser said, "Mani presented that case as a successful case of destination, but it did not happen."
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back as a man and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
The dresser said that some doctors are still following "their pattern."
But with the arrival of the internet in the years after the year 1990, the persons passing through these gender surgery started coming out, "No happiness with the result."
The same case was with 36-year-old writer of Monatana, Jim Bruce, who was born with Y male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
The doctors did not understand clearly that his gender was small, or his fugitive was big, but they were certain that he could never live "sensitive life" as a man.
Therefore, after some time of his birth in 1976, the external organs of Bruce and eggs were removed by surgery and he was raised like a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
She told ABNews.com, "I knew that I am not a girl."
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At the age of 18, he was going to be a vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and some disturbances, he demanded medical records.
This led to the horrific truth.
I was bound at the time of birth - and no one told me ever.
Bruce was born with DSD, who prevented her body from making enough testosterone, due to which her genitals could not be properly developed.
After knowing the truth, he became a man, he took the dose of testosterone and removed his breast.
Due to surgery, he became barren.
Today, he explains to people about intersex persons in an organization called Interface Project to normalize their perception.
However, the executive director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Whis, Annie Tamar-Matis, expressed concern that German law invites Chippi and Kalanka.
They say, "The activist people think that Germany's law will inspire parents to take immediate decisions and determine the child."
We fear that it will encourage interference.
We think it is a better process to specify male or female gender rather than wait.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only estimate it.
Tammer-Maitis said that his organization supports Australian law because it allows adults to be identified in the third gender.
He said, "The adults should be able to take their own decision about the various genders."
Germany's law deals with specifying it at the time of birth.
This is not the war fought by the newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can take decisions related to their body themselves.
But Pittsburgh's breast radiologicalist Dr. Erlin Baratz, whose daughter has sexual development disorders, and which helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that Germany's law will give power to both parents and children.
Baratzi's daughter Katie was born with men chromosomes, but she was a DSD named full endrogen insensitivity attachment.
Since there was a fault in his entrance, women's symptoms were developed in the cat.
His body is vagina but there is no uterus or ovary.
Now 29-year-old Kati is married and is a resident in the Child Psychology Department at Pennsylvania University.
Although he is barren, but he expects to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
Baratz said, "This law facilitates parents to not make any decisions in the hurry."
It gives them understanding and time properly by some tests before writing men or women.
In this way, you are okay - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely child and enjoy him.
We do not need to get such a surgery in haste, which can not be returned.
He said, "It brings children in the process of taking decisions and frees the illiteracy that inspires parents because they do not believe that they are recovering."
Finally, the child will determine which gender she is more comfortable - and it will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
On behalf of the Tehsil Legal Services Committee Ramnagar, a legal awareness camp was organized in the middle school Dalheer of Ramnagar under the chairmanship of the committee chairman and all the judge Sandeep Kaur of Ramnagar.
In which students and others were given information about the right to education and the law for economically backward people.

Charlie, founder of Like IM Delicious Icecream Company, said: "This is a reliable thing but the production of the early days will be mee 200 to about 1000 grams of goods."
The protein we're using in ice cream will react with neutral Ph in tongue.
As soon as the mouth is hot, the protein will increase the Ph level and the ice cream will shine.
We ' re examining for the last few months and it looks absolutely right to share it on the heloven because it gives wonderful shine effects
This might be the most expensive ice cream that I have made because the shine of jailfish is four times more expensive than gold .
So each scoop costs me around 140 pounds .
Although Iska taste is very good.
Capne is famous for extraordinary taste, including experimental company, beer, paneer, meat and gold leaves based in Charlie's bristle.
But its next composition is going to prove even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.

Heloven 2013: By numbers
When I was small, Helovin was magical.
My sister and I allowed to eat candy, stay quiet and play dress up for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I'm more than a loose

According to NCR, the total expenditure of dress from 6.9 billion to dress expenditure is 1.2 billion
This year, sexy is angry with all the lifeless things.
Women do not have to do Vaishya because they are also sexy foods like pissa, hamburgers and carrots.
I hope for men to make our instagram feeds this year for many pompies, and thanks, for the foolish space men.
According to Google, the most searched dress will be jambis, buttons, robbers and stolen.
I think there is no evil in being traditional.
Last year we we wear dogs dressed and we were not alone with surprise.
According to the NCR, American people will actually spend 330 million rupees for the pet dress.
This is ironic that many Hotdog dogs are with dogs.
When Candie comes, we do not see around.
According to the Nilsen company, Americans will spend 1.9 billion this year.
Heyershi Bars, Lolipop, Milk Dads, Twizlers and Clark bars are around 600 million pounds.

According to American power, actually, there's 1200 officially approved ground houses in United States that produce 500 million revenues. And that terrible good picture that puts your friend on Facebook and that man who licks you and comments on Nais Face.
Finally, talk about Kaddu.
Charlie Brown presented the great Kaddu when we were children, and a Jack-o-Lalton carving is like a Christmas tree decoration - this is something we have done since we were small.
For us from Naseeb, "Baby in A Panchkin Trend" started last year, thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have been carving these guards and not living with them.
According to the US Census Bureau, this year, the US will spend on Kaddu around  106 million.
Jack-o-gradually smiling Lalton may have increased from Elinois on his front porch, which increased from 542 million pounds this year.

George Keravan : Euro Wiggton gave the option to Scotts
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join the entire Europe as a free travel area in terms of membership of the EU.
Passport control on Barvik and stories about the border of the blanket wire on the headline walls.
It is true that the Street Client Paper describes the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although it was not described in the predictably - Headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time in changing their formal rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer the Shageen area, therefore, instead of obtaining what Brussels really want from Scotland, there will be affordable rebate for continuous non-compulsion Brussels.
So, then, A-Kahani.
And the thing that has been stuck so long, it has got settled. First of all, "Independence means passport control baseless news was heard about 40 years ago.
Still, the interesting point lost in resuming this interesting old story.
Anyway, why should you expect to build Europe from independent Scotland
Why should London's Yok be bought for Brussels, especially now
Here is real European news: The great plan to organize Europe is finally stopped.
With the euro crisis, project Europe has officially died.
Dedicated parties are getting strength to oppose the EU in the entire EU or to close the euro as a uniform currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroscaptile Alternative for Germany Party - which has been established this year - suddenly came and received about fifty lakh votes in the September's federal election, and thus effectively excluded Free Democrats (the adjustment of our Lib Dames) from Bundestaag.
The plan to build federal Europe has always been a domestic opposition.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be a common changer.
With the strict rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people have to think that the project Europe has gone far away due to the obstacles imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency.
There was not much role of euro crisis in the high budget deficit of national governments - it was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the Euro system stabilized its members in favor of German exporters - such things that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currency, South Europe finds itself in a harmful situation of productivity compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce salary and public expenditure - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budget and inflation problems, deep European productivity is ill.
To exempt the French and German energy firms on consumers' expenditure - as a result of the green energy policies imposed by Brussels, the European industry doubles electricity for the United Nations and makes four times the gas.
This is a cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Freezing all salary in the world, European Petrochemicals can not save the industry from being affected by cheap US shell gas.
As a result, the spirit of revolt is provoking among the people, especially in France, who was once the leading admirer of the EU.
After the war, the top French politicians had seen the EU as a means to control Germany, and Paris as a means of providing equal billing to Washington in the world.
But Berlin does not need Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, due to which the French economy is staggering.
Results: Marine Lee Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has won the victory by pushing the ruling socialist into third place in the recent by-election.
At present, Front is the most popular party with 24 percent of the vote in France - it is a warner for the British Labor that they can not believe that the dissolution for the left will benefit automatically for the right.
Lee Pen is doing with his newly found fame between French Goras, working class
This party wants to use the EU elections to be held next year in the European Parliament to create anti-EU, universal anti-monetary groups.
If, as much as possible, the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, then such a group can affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My approach is: soon Europe will end the confluence of anti-EU and anti-service sentiment in Europe.
The euro will not be completely over, but it will return to the foot and  (Comprised) nations in any form like Europe, which will be supported by General De Galle.
Germany and some of its favourable economies can maintain Euro, but France and South Europe will resume their currency.
I expect the UK to keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing close relations with the US.
However, the growing interest of Washington in Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all this
We can choose to remain the area of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better work in the loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easy for non-Sunghi nations to work together with other common thinking countries in Europe.
Otherwise we should consider maintaining our economic independence while walking on the path of Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland - indicatively - has been the most successful anti-political campaign in Europe, which opposed the deductions proposed by Labor's Chancellor Elister Darling and then won the wonderful majority in 2011 on the basis of Tori-Lib Dame coalition.
For Scotland, voting for independence at this time will be a reasonable thing, because in that case it will have to accept the rules of interference imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Yovan before time: soon to grow
Research shows that African-US and Hispainic girls get younger life in younger age than their age girls.
Physical change does not mean that the youth is near .
There is no evidence that hormone or any other chemical can be blamed .
Experts believe that obesity outbreak can be a cause of young age
The case of youth before time is not as effective in boys .
Former CNN correspondent Pat Ethriz is a specialist journalist in the health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be worried, if her daughter starts to grow breasts and genitals at the age of 7 or 8
In the annual conference of the American Children Medical Academy in Orlando, Florida this week, Dr. Paul Caplovitz has clarified that this initial physical change is common in American girls, these new trends show.
Caplovitz says, "I spend a lot of time in giving assurance to parents - that it usually does not show immediate progress towards the whole life."
Significant symptoms of development such as breasts, hair of genitals and ears and physical smell are seen before time in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very minor change in the age of Rajodarshan (first menstruation).
In United States, average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
"When the breasts start developing, then in the first rotation, it takes at least two to three years, Caplovitz explains, "Time-time youth in the girls: The guide is necessary to deal with this common problem. "
The most accurate test time for the development of youth.
There is a debate about what is the beginning of the youth, but when there is an increase in breast development before the age of 8, it is called "Bal-aged".
In most cases this process will slow down or stop - whose child doctors can closely inspect.
In case of immediate progress, there may be a need for an endocrinologist to check the prospects of serious problems like tumors or systems.
There are treatments for delaying premature menstruation and other consequences: age-old age of bones, due to which drama can be statured in the form of adult growth and adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on children's age, growth rate, growth rate and emotional adultry.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovites are aware of medicines but accept, "To suppress life can increase practical issues, and girls can feel different from their colleagues."
The second major problem can be understood: Parents do not want daughter of her young age to be a menstruation.
Caplovitz said, "He worry about the risk of the womb, or how he will maintain cleanliness."
A woman whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, remembers, "This was a shock."
Although there were symptoms of this and we also talked about menstruation, but he was not emotionally prepared.
He was scared of his school and returned upset that in his friends, he started the menstruation first.
There are many well-known principles about the reasons for untimely youth.
However, there is no sustainable evidence that hormones in milk or other food items, chemicals in the environment or sexually transmitted messages in the media can be charged.
The boys are also getting the same kind of life as the girls.
Caplovites determine the rule that the main reason for this is the outbreak of obesity.
He had helped in conducting studies on girls from 6 to 9 years of age in 2001, which connects the body's fat with the time of youth.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-US and Hispainic girls tend to get young before their age-old girls.
There are many clarifications of this point.
At the global level, the replication of premature youth appears to be influenced by all things from economic conditions to weather and genes.
Other puzzle: Though the boys are getting the face and the hair of the genitals at a young age, but the whole of the youth is not as clear as girls in them.
Other doctors present at the AAP conference supported the complications of the subject.
Even in children and children, the hair of pimples and genitals has become common.
Dr. Lawrans Silverman, a child doctor at the Goryb Children's Hospital in Morristoun, New Jersey, says, "We need to be careful about how we recognize the actual beginning of the youth."
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child doctor to take opinion about how to talk to their children.
Caplovitz advised, "It may have to interact before the expected time."
If you remain calm then your child will usually respond properly.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.

Big Orders of Jet manufacturers with controversy for seat width .
This month, a competition has been set up for a fight for Dubai Arsho, for the long distance flights, between the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats.
The dispute is focused on the width of the economy class seat in the long flights, not always as given by airlines, but its allocated space efficiency has been claimed by the latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company.
Errabus is expected to give such an industry standard by giving a detailed seat of at least 18 inches -LRB- semi -RRB- in the economy cobbin this week but it should be decided by airlines .
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when after the 17-21 incident , there was a competition to sell a large version of the twin engine of a long distance from the recorded order .
How has the last department of the aircraft been created - especially if seating is 9 or 10 equal, keeping in mind the claims of more capacity, designs of Mini Jambo Jets are being prepared
Boeing says it is  777  which will keep 406 people in 17 inches wide and 10 in one line in a single department .
Airbus says that while combating with A350, it will take 350 people to 18 inches and 9 in equal seats.
Air giants often trade on technical matters through advertisements in the business press .
Now, with Airbus 777 , Dubai is expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Arsho, it is appealing to the public ahead.
It is being seen recently that whatever the start of the Vigyan war has been going on, will you accept it together in a restaurant showing it to Finsero
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said, "Boing regional Turbo is also presenting a long distance flight in hybrids."
As a change, people are getting bigger, but the way to sit is not changed.
According to the figures of the American Health Department, between the 1970s when Boeing 747 jambo ne modern long journey was defined, and the average 40-49-year-old American hell was 10 percent increased.
According to American Health Statistics, the average American men in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept of 1950 when the average periphery of the new name Jet set was narrow .
Airbus says that he has established research commission, suggesting improvement in the quality of sleep of an additional inch 53 per cent in the width of the seat.
Boeing disputed the data of Airbus seat measurement and stated that it does not depend on the decision of the manufacturers how the airlines are balanced between rent and facilities .
It also says, research shows that more than the width of one seat depends on the experience of cabin.
Boeing cabin specialist Kent Crawer said . Actually it tells what they need to do to be successful in providing flexibility to airlines and on those things which are confident .
 They do not want us to tell who they have benefits.
They know better of their business than anyone else.
This fog is about the room for the flyers, but it is an issue for the suppliers to speed up that it can affect the income.
Behind this dispute, the business of at least  700 billion is estimated, the competition of the aircraft order is enough in the coming decades to tie the trajoo of American and European exports.
The report of the riter told that for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually a fighting issue between new jet planes.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that 20 per seat has been working in their new twin engine design, compared to 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Are.
The claim of Boeing performance depends on comparison to 777 designs with 10 , 777 x , original 9 .
The unit cost is now used to comparison with the benefits.
Kevin Kenistan, head of Europe's Airbus passenger facility says, "This is the Boeing aircraft to capture more seats to make our products, and more competitive.
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat-each line cabin is suggested for the current 777 SC that many passengers are in favor of Densar Leave, which can go along with cheap fares.
Cabin Internal expert My Karbi, founder and editor's runway girl network said that the eighteen-inch seat will be very good for the passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is operated by the threat of 777.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list for the airlines to choose from the suppliers.
Jet sellers around the world also take careful measures to check this layouts.
While comforting much, all builders are also giving high density layouts for jet airlines and regional travel.
Airbus is giving 10 equal A350 but it is not sold yet.
But recently, until Airbus emphasized the comprehensive cobbin seats on some of its jet planes to need more cabin facility.
Without the support of other manufacturers of modern jet aircraft, there is no possibility of flying on a new industry stander, but it can distract from the wave of 777  sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine can end the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate fun from smoking.
The only dose of vaccine was capable of protecting the rats from the addiction of negative for the whole life.
Before starting the test on humans, further tests are needed, in which it may take many years, but Professor Ronald Christol of Well Cornell Medical College in New York said that initial signals are positive.
Professor Colonel said, "We hope that this type of vaccine strategy can ultimately help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods present in the market in today's time, but they found that their addiction of Nicotein is more powerful than these existing methods. "
There is a harmless virus in the new vaccine, which has been prepared to provide genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus selectly infects the liver cell, which then starts making a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies search for any nicotine molecule in blood, and prevents them from summoning nicotine inside the smoker by making them ineffective before reaching the brain.
In the test, the vaccines given which were later given nicotein, they continued to do their normal activity.
Researchers say that but the rat which was not given vaccine was "discouraged", it was a signal that Nicotein had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in a magazine called Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier vaccines of tobacco had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to give dose at regular intervals so that the antibodies level remained, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of new vaccine is expected to be very much because the liver cell will make the antibody factory.
Professor Christol said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, then it can be given to the children before the greed of trying cigarettes, so that they can be saved from the addiction of necotine.
But perhaps it will be used by smokers to leave smoking.
He said, "He will know that if he starts smoking again, he will not get any pleasure from smoking due to nicotine vaccine, which can help him get rid of his habit."
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned of need to be done very much.

During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressurized the public tender to start the lease.
The leasemen were against it and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the circular enterprises for lease, from which Obide earned  2.5 million annually, was renewed without lease tender.

Foreign employees on 457 visas can pass through " authenticity test " .
The government is considering a "Primunity Test" for foreign employees on 457 visas, because its purpose is to expand a tough action.
If adopted, then this test will be implemented through a criteria made to stop 457 to be used to fill the unskilled posts in Australia or to bring family and friends in a clarifying manner.
Today a government discussion letter was issued, while condemning the government's dictionary about foreign employees, former Labor MP M.P. Maxine Macus said today that it can crush neighboring countries of Australia.
He told the US India Institute today that "the foreign people are reaching the end of the queue and "the strong rhetoric about the job before the Australian people is very unpleasant repeated at a time, while the unions have demanded a safe labor market. "
Historically, it meant that security should be provided to white workers - and if some people in the area saw the effigy of that historical evidence, then I would not be surprised.
In the discussion letter, the outline of 12 measures has been shown, which was first considered by former immigration minister Chris Boven.
Military Minister Brendan Okoner, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met the officials about smugglers, has implemented five relevant changes, while the remaining are under consideration.
If "Pramanicity criteria" is adopted, then the visa applicant can be examined about whether the nomination is true in such circumstances, in which the nominated person, the person of the person who sponsored the visa or the person concerned or personal partner. "
Businessmen may need to calculate the number of 457 visa holders, because the first businessman who wanted to sponsor less number of employees, took hundreds of people to work.

The British government has announced a study to increase the benefits of Scotland from the US2 rail project.
Work by US2 indicates high speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Barones Cramer told that this project will make Britain one.
Scotland Transport Minister Keeth Brown said that he is very excited by working with the UK government on this project.
In the first phase, the new high speed rail line will be included between London and West Midlands.
Once the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leads.
In June, the government revised the cost of construction of high speed link between London and North England to 32.7 billion and 42.6 billion.
The British government, which was interacting with Scotland Transport, instructed CS2 Limited to consider the possibility of bettering rail ability and travel time for North England and Scotland.
It includes the possibility of reducing or reducing the potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three hours.
According to Barones Crammer: Our goal for CS2 is a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.
We are moving forward with FS2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities of Britain, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be well connected due to US2.
According to Scottish Secretary Elistere Carmical: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown urged Mr. Carmichael to return Scotland to SCO2 Network.
Mr. Brown said: "Scotland is likely to have huge economic benefits from high speed rail, but it will also increase economic burden on Scotland in the entire UK of high speed rail."
Therefore, we are excited to work in the participation of the British government, so that we can check the options for bringing high speed rail in Scotland, creating profits for everyone and fulfilling the glassgo-edinberg line, whose Scottish government is already planning.
I am ready to review the inquiry report with the British government ministers next year and take decisions together on further action.
Air power equipment rules will now be effective in Australia
In spite of the steps taken to soften the equipment regulations in the US, Australian airplanes will have to continue to stop their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
The USS federal aviation administration has left the option to change the American aviation service companies to change their processes so that during the important phases of flight, passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their equipment, provided they are in the equipment environment mode.
Travelers can do so during many flights, but many people do not like to be unable to fly and reach their e-book while landing.
Australian Air Service companies are considering this decision, according to which the US Airways Service companies will have to work very much to fulfill this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Security Authority also said that he is considering the announcement, but emphasized that restrictions on the use of power equipment in important steps of flight in Australia are still effective.
At present, EASA has no specific regulation to control the use of power equipment in the aircraft, the Authority said, "This issue comes under regulations, according to which the airline operating companies have to ensure that the security arrangements are always complete, and the passengers have to comply with the security instructions given by the members of the crew. "
Virgin, who is already interacting with the USA about expanding the use of his in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but he asked to take further action on the regulator's instructions.
The spokesperson said, "We will welcome the review by EASA in terms of allowing the use of electric equipment, because we really feel that it will provide better experience to the customers because now we (Virles in-flight entertainment) is in our planes. "
uantas said that it will now follow the current rules.
It said that "According to our current policy, electricity equipment can not be used while flying and landing, and we do not have any immediate plan to change it."
DLAA decisions apply to American allergies.
Well, we always interest in regulatory developments that can benefit the passengers and we will definitely consider the reasons behind the CAAA's decision and its backwardness.
The effect of this decision will be different on each US aircraft service company and depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airways service companies will need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio distribution from mobile equipment, as well as they will have to amend their rules books, training materials, care-on bagge programs and a brief description to the passengers.
The LDA said that after the authenticity of the airlines of their aircraft, they will allow passengers to capture all the heights, light weight electricity equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will direct the passengers to close their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested keeping heavy equipment safely under the seat or keeping it in the upper coaches while flying and landing.
Poinbrokers silver due to difficulty by middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga is taking cash by giving her gold chicken, ring and swing to pay her daughter's school fees in Ponshop in Bendemier Shopping Center in Singapore.
Mrs Amirthalinga said, "My husband and I have recently bought the house, so all our money is trapped in it."
She says, although she earns  3,000 (2,400 US dollars) as an administrator, her husband also works, but the monthly income of the family remains insufficient.
In fact, there is such a demand in parts of South-East Asia - where domestic credit is increasing - Valumex where they are doing their transactions, this week the third ponshop to be listed on Singapore stock exchange has become.
Keeping jewelery is not the only way to get cash - in the case of Ms. Amirthlinga, 1,300 Singapore dollars - but almost as much as the unsafe bank loan is cheap.
Generally, ponbrokers in Singapore take 17 percent interest every year, which is slightly higher than 15.4 percent introduced by United Overseas Bank, which is a local creditor whose branch is in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers have the benefit of checking credit or not needing proof of salary, and they can provide loans faster than the bank.
Due to the increasing expenditure of livelihood by the families and the increase in domestic and consumer credit, millions of people are facing ponshop in this area.
After five years of global financial calamity, due to strong growth, and simple monetary policy in developed economies, due to cheap credit, due to the slowdown of its economy, families with lower and medium income are approaching Ponshop to fulfill their needs.
This week, Rating Agency, Standards Ange Pears, mainly increasing domestic profits due to increasing mortgages, as a risky factor for the liberty of Asian banks.
It said that in Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in proportion to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top position with 80 percent of GDP, while it was 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are worried about the high levels of consumer credit in Thailand, which has emerged lightly from technology slowdown this week.
On Thursday, the data has shown a continuous reduction in export recession and consumer demand.
In the Malaysian Bank, CIMB, economist Song Seng Won said, "The decisive point is that with the rising prices, people coming from low-class middle to lower class will try to increase their income in every possible way.
In the last two years, historically high prices have inspired people to keep the personal property down, because they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the prices of jewelery of their family.
70 percent of the things dropped in 200 pon outlets of City-State in Singapore are gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of listening is good, let's keep the mother's gold chain, and take it back next month."
Thailand's largest ponshop operator Ezimani has seen 20 percent increase in the number of customers using their outlets in recent months.
There is so much increase in the business of pledging that 15 others like Outlet operators in Valumex and Singapore are planning to expand in their neighborhood, Malaysia, where it has four shops, but is planning to expand outside Asia, Valumex executive director Yah Lee Ching says.
The company will financing it, Singapore Stock Exchange will use 60 percent of Singapore  66 million in Listing this week.
While some discount launders (creditors) have been criticized due to high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that keeping down is not only cheaper than other creditors, but also it directly does not increase the loan.
They say, the masters keep the things that they already have, and forgetting personal assets does not increase domestic debt.
Social acceptance of ponbroking is increasing to obtain short-term and safe financial assistance.
It is not that only financially weak people use ponebrokers.
In Singapore, wealthy people also use Valumex Outlet, they keep dropping gold bars or rollex watches, which can get cash payments up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers from all sections of society.
Ms. Yah says, "They include wealthy persons who need loans for a short time for business venture or investment, or small business who need to complete their cash flow needs."
Sometimes they need money only in a very short time.

Rescue package of  325 million for Taji's health
The Union Government has emphasized that strict conditions are also linked with the defense package of  325 million for the health system becoming sick of Tasmania, which will ensure that the state government can not ruin the fund.
Union Health Minister Tanya Pibersak has announced that the Commonwealth, the island is taking immediate action to resolve the current crisis due to the old population, high rate of genetic diseases and the limitations of the system.
The decision to financing during four years was made after the government's consultation with Andrew Wilki, independent MP of Tasmania.
Ms Pibersak said today, "The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe that it will solve the special challenges facing the state."
The package of  325 million includes an alternative surgery scheme of  31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving the previous collected cases.
It includes money for better care, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of individual electronic health record system in local hospitals after going from the walk-in clinic, hospital in Hobart and Lonsasthan.
Ms Pibersak said, "This investment is in line with the best ways I have told to improve the health system of Tasmania by leading doctors."
The minister emphasized that the government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability rule.
The state will have to maintain the current financing level to get Commonwealth money, and every month it will have to report where additional funds are being spent.
The commission of three members will be constituted to ensure that the state provides as much as possible effective and efficient service.
Mr. Wilki said that the meaning of  325 million will not be much longer, "Although the real improvements should not be made to reach the public health system of Tasmania at a more comprehensive level."
Yet, he praised the government for reacting to his request for immediate assistance, which he had brought before the Prime Minister in early May.
Mr. Wilki said, "I hope the federal help package will prove to be very helpful in separating the state's public health system from the crisis-hit list."
According to the state government, these additional alternative procedures will mainly repeat the recent cuts.

Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms Pibersak should guarantee that one of the rescue packages will not be spent on additional bureaucracy.

The surveillance group said that Syria has destroyed its ability to build a chemical weapon .
On Thursday, the surveillance group said that Syria has destroyed important equipment to create chemical weapons and poisonous gas war material, while a fierce conflict emerged in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the place where toxic agents are considered.
At the same time, on Thursday, the Syrian movement group has said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian civil war started almost three years ago.
This announcement of the Chemical Arms Prohibition Organization has happened a day before the last date of November 1 .
Which the Heg-based organization had decided to destroy the machinery used to mix all chemical weapons production units and chemicals in toxic gases and to destroy the machinery used to fill the war material or to make the "affective".
Particularly the completion of the initial phase of destruction is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious event, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Dumskus by the middle of 2014.
Demolition of equipment means Syria can no longer create new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the weapons and collections present.
It is believed that Syria has 1000 metric tonnes of chemicals and weapons, which includes master gas and nerve agent Sarin.
Britain's position, Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, has reported that this announcement took place when the struggle in Safira city increased on Thursday, about which experts believe that this chemical weapon is a collection center along with the production unit.
The movement group, which described the number of dead through the network of movements in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He has said that 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children, are included.
The government has said that 29,954 President Bashar is a member of the army of Assad, 18,678 fighters fighting in favor of the government and 187 Lebanese Hizbullah is militant.
It also said that the dead have 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the ongoing conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated data since then.
Due to this struggle, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Asad's military team continued to fight rebels for many weeks in Safira, many of whom were related to al-aeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said that people have been casualties from both sides, but clearly did not say anything.
This war shows the danger facing the inspectors of chemical weapons, who have the mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in a very short time.
In a statement to OPCW, working together with the United Nations, it was said that its party is now satisfied and has confirmed - and all the declared important production and mixing equipment of Syria have been seen in destruction.
It also said, "Now no inspection activity is being planned.
At the beginning of this week, the inspectors had said that they have completed the first phase of the confirmation work by going to 21 of the 23 centers declared by Dumscus.
Inspectors said that they were not able to go to two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers have been given tiages and ... the chemical weapon products kept there were sent to other declared centers, which have been inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira is one of those two centers, where the OPC was not able to go to the WW Inspector.
Syria has submitted a plan for the entire destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of OPCW next month.
In a comment issued by OPCW, the Director General of the Group, Mukht Ujumku said, "I salute the firmness and courage shown by the people in fulfilling the most challenging mission done by this organization so far.
This house war, which has been going on for three years, is mainly the government of Assad and its security forces, in which Shia comes out of Islam, besides members of the legend, and the rebel Sunni Muslims have a struggle.

At the same time, these fake papers used to take loans.
After this the real owner of the land used to keep the police and administration's push.
The accused who prepared the fake registry kept an eye on the land of NRIG.

Resent on the punishment of the plotter of bomb blast in Bali
The relatives and relatives of 202 people killed in the bomb blast in 2002, expressing resentment over the punishment given to the plotter of the bomb blast, said that Omar Patek should face the firing team.
Patek, who fled as one of the most wanted persons in South-East Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years for his role in creating explosive device used in the bomb blast.
If parole is given, it can be released in 15 years.
45-year-old Omar was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many were injured.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including the series of bomb blasts in the church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, although they could also demand that the person who is called the notorious "democratic person" as a master person.
This decision refreshed the painful memories of the woman living in Perth, June Corten, who had lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and her co-conspirators a decade ago.
While stopping his tears, he said that Patek should have been given death penalty.
I really feel that he should have got the same punishment as other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Courtin told the AAP, "He should be raised in front of the firing team."
I have to live every day without my grandson and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, at 11 o'clock in the night, the nomination of this club was lost after the bomb blasts loaded in the van standing outside the club.
Peter Hughes was in the paddies bar just 20 seconds before the explosion of explosive material filled with explosive material by suicide bombers.
As a result of the incident of this bomb blast, he went to a month-long coma and died three times while living on life saving equipment.
Shri Hughes says that Patek should have got the same punishment, which was given to three other members of the Jemmah Islamiah terrorist group responsible for this massacre - Amroji, Mukhlas and Imam sea - who were given death sentence four years ago.
In fact, this person should be given death sentence before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep her alive, see, keep her alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding innumerable people, it is not enough to get 20 years of punishment.
Patek is the last person to get punishment from Bali bomb explosives.
He was avoiding being caught for nearly a decade, but eventually in January 2011, Pakistan was arrested in Abbottabad, where the US Army had killed former al-aeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted the evidence that the report revealed that Pak was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an attempt to reinstate the contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al aeda.
Ms. Courtin says, "He did not surrender.
Even today, it is not really sad to hurt so many people mentally.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by festivals in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Courtin said, "This year many tears will flow."
Still, Patek can appeal against his sentence.
FAA: Airplanes can now use gasettes in the aircraft (But cell phones can not call)
The aviation passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, movies, listen to music, but they will not be able to talk to their cell phones - This is under the excessively predicted new guidelines issued by the federal aviation administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
In a news conference, FAA administrator Michael Hurta said that how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
The airlines will have to show how their aircraft complete new guidelines, and how to update the rules to collect training books and devices of their crew members to show the guidelines.
FAA has said that it has already achieved plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic device on the aircraft.
Delta and Jetbulu are from those airlines who have already submitted plans.
FAA said in a statement, "On the basis of the situation of the project, we can easily accept the extensive use of electronic devices.
At present, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices if the aircraft is closed.
They are expected to reach the height of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and do not start them until the Captain is allowed.
Passengers are expected to stop their device again while landing the aircraft, and do not stop it until the aircraft is fully descended.
FAA said, under the new guidelines, such airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic interference, they can allow their passengers to fly by plane, while landing and using devices during taxiing.
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft which have been revised in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at a higher height, they are expected to fulfill these criteria.
The Chairman of the Association of Professional Flight Attendant, Loura Glading has welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work together with airline companies to do so - then it will be a winner for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we have been feeling like Hal Monitors.
Agency said that but serving internet connecting at less than 10,000 feet, email exchange, sending or receiving messages or downloading data will still be restricted.
Travelers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in the airplane mode.
So still there will be no talks with friends, a game associated with online scrabble, is that when the actor Alex Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while staying at the gate in 2011, and when he refused to stop the device, the American airlines removed him from the plane.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be collected because their boom will be concerned about injuries to another person in the cabin.
Selphone calls will continue to be restricted during the flight.
Regulatory rights related to phone calls are with the federal communication commission, not with FAA.
FAA can remove restrictions on some electronic devices while flying and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rosenkon of National Transport Security Board, who is a national transport security expert of CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered to be risky.
Rosenkar said, "Cell phones are actually a serious issue, not only because they can create obstacles in the navigation-related devices, but also because they are in the air because they can create interference in cell phone towers. "
In order to investigate this issue, the Industry World Advisory Committee formed by FAA has recommended last month that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
To reduce the ban from their use, the pressure on the FAA has been increasing in recent years.
Selectors such as Sen. Claire MacCacific, D-Mo have said that there is no valid security reason for prohibition.
It is becoming even more difficult to enforce these restrictions because the use of device is universal.
Some studies also indicate that nearly three-thirds of the passengers forget or ignore the instructions to close their device.
FAA started restricting the use of electronic devices by the passengers in 1996, when the passengers received the report of interference in navigation and communication equipment due to the carrying of FM radio and high technology gadgets of that time.
New airline companies are more dependent on the electrical system compared to the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the FAA to resist electronic intervention.
Airlines has been proposing use of Wi-Fi at the cruise height from the passengers for many years.
The revised aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to the interference.
Hurta said that most airline companies should stand on eligibility norms for more use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic device emits radio transmission of very low power compared to the previous generation electronic device.
For example, e-readers are transmission of absolutely nominal time during the background.
But transmission is strong while downloading or sending data by the device.
Amazon.com is also among those who have taken part in reducing the restrictions on the use of device by the passengers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their entire candle e-riders in the airlines and flew them to test problems but no such problem was found.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed similar feelings about the risk of using the device.
The Douglas Kid of the National Air Travel Association said that he believes that the interference with the device is real, even if the risk is only of the name.
Other members of the committee said that there are reports made by the pilot only in support of the disruption of the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, members of the committee recommended that the FAA pilot should allow the pilot to stop the device when the aircraft is landed in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them the common knowledge facility of people traveling in the latest round of technology.
CEO Roger Do of the US Travel Association said that we are happy that the FAA has recognized that traveling with joy is not incompatible with passenger, rescue and security.

The bird was left back to the jungle by air transport to protect from North Sea Rig
The bird found on the North Sea Oil Rig has been left back from the coast by air transport.
This water rail named bird was sent to Abardin by the helicopter before the Scottish SPA returned to his rescue center in Elloa.

Before leaving, the water rail was healthy and tender.
Is the higher class of Europe ready to do business with Britain
In April, the business for Britain was launched and it was decided to bring the business together and determine what changes do you want to see with UK's employment and prosperity manufacturer EU.
For this, we organized the largest and most detailed survey of Britain's business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK business with the EU.
U-Gov took the idea of 1000 business leaders, who are representatives of Britain's commercial size, areas and places.
The conclusions of this survey can be astonishing for many people.
We found that a large part of the businessmen now want to export out of Europe, and want to focus on those countries which are becoming modern and increasing, while the EU member countries are getting dynamic.
They want the government to give priority to new business relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, not in the long-term and bad process of improving the mysterious institutions of the EU.
When asked about their views about special policy areas such as monopoly regulations to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these decisive qualifications should come back to the Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction about the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of regulation of Brussels is more than the benefits of becoming part of the business sector of Europe - even the huge businessman who traditionally favored the European companies, 40 percent of them agreed on this.
In the end, and most obviously, our survey of professional leaderships found that a large part clearly wants Britain, EU to move forward on the path of business-based relations and treaty change rather than politics.
This conclusion, which was seen in the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are inspiring towards a "strategic change", which will return its lost power to the UK.
It has a very high price - The issue of treaty change for Britain and a better deal has changed 16 percent of the vote in favor of staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt: This survey is a condition that Britain's businessmen support their plan to negotiate on the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect to rehabilitate the current power balance in favor of the UK, making a meaningful change.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming very fast because it is moving forward in the direction of Eurozone, affiliated economy and fiscal association.
Priority must be jobs and increase in Britain, as our survey results show that it means a new focus on business and basic change in the regulation mechanism of Brussels.

Prior to allegations against Jonathan Lord, two employees of YMCA accused of sexual crime, Royal Commission hearing
Before being charged against the Kairingbah Child Care employee Jonathan Lord in 2011, two employees of YMCA NSW have been accused of child sexual crimes.
But in his statement before the commission, he said that "Sometimes the case of child sexual harassment was not found in his organization, the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case, in which a YMCA employee was accused of child pornography offense, and another case in which YMCA Kairingbah Jim Instructor was accused of child sexual crime against children living under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hare, advocate Gel Farnes, who helped the commission, said he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the other case.
He also acknowledged that the statement of YMCA has been done in front of the commission that the external investigation of the YMCA has been done and he has found the YMCA in the case of child safety. Also not accurate.
It is evidence before the commission that the YMCA was notified, and in August this year, it received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the education and community department quality audit.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with the age of 21 with the YMCA, admitted that due to appointing Lord, the management has failed, and failed to ensure that the employees are clearly aware of their obligations related to giving information about child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes with 12 children during the two-year tenure of YMCA.
He was given a sentence of imprisonment for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in YMCA, due to which the employees did not report the violation of child safety by the Lord.
Employees gave the evidence that they saw about the violation, in which Lord spent time alone with children, personally babesiting them, sitting in their lap, saying that they love them and let them play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Oakwell, who was in the supervision of Lord, and had asked for child safety training, because he was worried about his behavior, testified that W.M.C.A. Kairingbah, who supervised Lord, was very threatening and difficult to get most of the time.
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that he was not easy to give information above his manager.
He said that, but his friendship with Lord misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his view to the YMCA NSW. Mandal that Jonathan was about not giving a text to the organization from the Lord incident.
Mr. Hare said that the decision of the employees to sign the confidential agreement immediately after the allegations were revealed was made by the Chief Manager of the Child Service of YMCA, Leum Whiteley.
He said that its purpose was to avoid the adjustment of evidence, but it was not executed "very exciting and exactly."
Stephen Smalbon, a child sexual abuse special professor of Griffith University, said that during the stay of Jonathan Lord's work between 2099 and 2011, YMCA NSW was not a safe organization.
He said that there were serious problems in the appointment, advocacy, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been postponed till December 20.
Blair says they want to return to Britain
Tony Blair said that he would like to become the Prime Minister of Britain again - but he believes that there is no possibility of returning.
In an interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his farewell from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving the post in June 2007 as a leader, Mr. Blair avoided discussing British politics a lot while limiting most of his comments to the role of foreign affairs and the representative of the peacekeepers of the Middle East group.
When asked if he would like to come back to the post of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair was presented by the London Evaning Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, of course, but it is not likely to happen, so ...
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When a crowd of experts performing horse for the best horse of the year was gathered in Cardif, they knew that it would be a challenging competition.
But no person was ready for three-year-old Fanton Kirkland.
Not even did not go to the school and a few months away from taking his first step, this little child and his native Shetland Tuttu Tafi easily completed three phases and received the top award - he left behind his 30 adult rivals.
In the annual competition organized by Suniback Equator in Rudri near Cardiff, the pair that can not be separated - which is lengthy - was praised for the show, behavior and style.

And Toffee gets the highest points for his appearance and personality.
Fanton was given Toffee as a gift on his third birthday in March, and since then he has practiced with this Tuttu of Sheetland daily.
His 30-year-old mother Dona said: "Fanton and Toffee are spectacular couples.
He had to face challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won gold cup and roset.
This was the second time only when he participated in any competition with Toffee, and we all are very happy about his victory.

Ab Well, near South Wells, this small child of Nantiglo village is running on the footprints of his Anti Sheron Hovels, which has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howels said: The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and every person was celebrating happiness and playing the table.
He was running on the sand in the entire colorland, and despite being so small, he did extraordinary work.
Fanton is the crazy cattle - she loves horse, tractor and farm, and she has two chickens which she cares.
The way he has started, he will be very early in the year's best horse exhibition - and I believe he will perform very well.
A spokesperson of the annual horse exhibition said: "Fanton's age is only three years, but he has to control his thumb."
They are very good pairs.
The judges gave points in view of the methods of performance of Fanton and Toffee and their presentation in Show Ring.
He saw a good team work between Tutu and his rider - in this case, Fanton and Toffee were the best in ring.
I am sure that Fanton's lovely clothes have helped him, he was actually looking very different.
"The Chinese newspaper that argues will be revived"
A Chinese newspaper who had appealed on the post office to leave a reporter guilty of defamation, will be renounced, a press regulator said this.
The New Express of Guangjau newspaper gave a virulent public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yongjau.
But after that Mr. Chen accepted the television that he had taken bribe to write a confused news about the part-owned company of the state.
The regulator said that now the New Express has to go through full improvement.
"The order of Sudar came from the Gwangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration."
"A primary investigation showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Eving News Group had published many false reports about the listed company umbrellain from September 2012 to August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that editorial management of the New Express was administered.
It said that it had decided to impose an administrative punishment by canceling the license of Chen Yongjau's reporter.
It had instructed the Yangcheng Eving News Group to make a complete improvement of the New Express, to investigate the people responsible for this in the New Express and to revise the New Express leadership team immediately.
Mr. Chen wrote a lot of articles in the New Express, which blamed financial irregularities in a construction company called umloyon.
After being denied them, his newspaper published two mouthpiece appeals for his release, and said that he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen came to the state television, accepted writing and publishing false stories for money.
He told State Proliferative CCTV that "In this case, I have damaged Jumlain as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the confidence of the people."
I did this mainly because I was greed for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
After the forgiveness of Mr. Chen, the New Express released a mask page forgiveness, in which it said that it had failed to investigate the report properly.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have rejected the blame spreading TV.
Experts say that from time to time, there is a forceful defect and acceptance, despite this, in the northeast of this year, a law had banned officials from binding themselves to blame any person.

US-Mexico drug tunnel was found in its own railway
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between USA and Mexico has been found, in which it has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
US officials have described the tunnel of four feet three feet as one of the most complex secret routes searched so far.
The tunnel is equivalent to the twisted length of about six football pitch, which connects the godown near Tijuana, Mexico and San Digo, USA.
This area is full of similar warehouses, which makes it easier to hide the truck being filled with drugs.

Tax on foreign property owners, end London's artificial position
The Finance Department has officially calculated the CGT measures, but Mr. Osbourne is awaiting the final decision, who in the budget of 2012, houses worth more than 2 million pounds, and such persons who prefer to keep home in a company instead of a different person Had presented stamp duty at a rate of 7 percent.
In the year 201213, the stamp duty received from residential properties in Westminster and Kensington and Chelesa cities was 708 million pounds, which is already more than the combined yoga of Northern Ireland, Wells, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Homber.
Mr. Cook said: "After the increase in stamp duty of high-value houses and the Associated Anti-Avoidens legislation, it is very difficult to debate that there is less tax on high-value property, which has no relation with the effect of the old council tax system. "
He added , But this step has made some foreign investors silent in buying wealth in London and can make the current owners unhappy to sell .
According to the price in Prime Property, Dhanadhya South-West London, the top 5 to 10 percent of the housing market, which is spread from Fulham to Vimbaldan, has increased by 11.8 percent last year.
According to the Sevilles research, regular increase in the values of central London was going on for 5.6 per cent every year, but increasingly appearing to be a little less than the "Gharlu Bazar", because the city's southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and the east (6.5 per cent) are booming.
Scientists have highlighted the topic that what is the relationship between dog's tail movements and its mood.
Last research has shown that happy dogs shake their dumb on the right (with the dog), while uneasy dogs shake their tail mainly on the left.
But now scientists say that partner dogs can recognize this micro distinction of the tail and express their reaction to it.
This study has been published in Journal Current Biology.
Georgia Wellertigra, a neuro-scientist professor from the University of Trainto, said, "In man, it all knows well that the left and right part of the brain is involved in the excitement that creates positive or negative feelings."
Here we have tried to see it in other species too.
He said that in the dogs like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the actions of the left hand and the opposite order, and the two galaxies played different roles in emotions.
To know more about how dogs respond to the unilateral shook by other dogs, researchers watched the other dogs' movies.
He measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We may not take much time to understand why their dumb moves sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other side.
Prof. Vellartigira said: "We introduced dogs with dogs' films - in the shadow painting to deal with other issues in the realistic version or in confusing, and we could see the move of the tail and could present the tail more left or right. "
When the animals saw a passionate dog shaking their tail on the right side (with the dog), they remained completely comfortable.
But when he saw the tail turning towards the left (wise dog's perspective), his heartbeat increased and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, he does not think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience that they should be concerned about what action and not on whom.
He said, "If you have met many times with other dogs, and if they constantly move their tail on one side, then it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react on the basis of that experience.
Researchers say that these findings can provide better information about animal feelings to owners, veterinary doctors and instructors.
Fellow, guest of the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, expert John Breadsho told that this is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for dogs or not.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that when dogs look at an aggressive dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right on seeing the happy dog.
In other researches of the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, "As opposed to the Italian study - when robot dog's tail was moved to the left, instead of being restless, the dogs were more likely to reach it."
He said that this difference was because in different studies dogs were not fully understanding animals or robot dogs in movies.
He clarified that in this, dogs can help the study of the method of reacting to real dogs.
"When there is a lot of evidence from various breasts that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still available - and dogs are not exception in this case, they said. "
However, seeing the easy way their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we may not take much time to understand why their dumb moves on one side and sometimes on the other side.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest class priests in the Catholic Church, their post is only below the pop, and these people choose the pop, so Francis will represent the first group of their individuals, who will eventually help in choosing their successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the Pope election - it comes in the group of 120 Cardinal Electors.
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Fedrico Lambardy said that before the celebration of promotion of new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be organized, which is called Pope-Shabha.
Lombardy said, "Pop Francis has decided to predict its decision to organize the Pope-President of February so that it can be easy to plan other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different countries of the world."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to decrease.
He said that Pope generally, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, the same number of cardinals, and the names of cardinals more than 80 years of age according to their wishes.
Valero said that the next year's pop-summit will be important, because this will be the first pop-summit after France is elected in March this year.
At present there is a kind of prejudice towards Europe and especially Italy.
He said, "It would be interesting to see if the new pops to restore balance, the cardinals also from the rest of the world.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics in South America, but their number in Cardinals is very low.
Cardinals Council by Francis - which is a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose work is to find ways to improve the church, these will be the first cardinals to be selected after being formed.
Earlier, the pops used to take decisions of all things themselves.
Valero said, "Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him."
He said that it is possible to seek advice from Francis Cardinals.
But we have not been in this position before - it is absolutely new.
Valero said that usually Pope gives the post of Bishop to big places, but France was very amazing - so we do not know whose names they will declare.

In some trucks, there may be a reduction in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the Sangh failed to comply with auto security standards about seatback, head restraint.
According to an information posted on the website of the National Highway traffic security administration, "If the vehicle is trapped from the back, then it is possible that the head resistant can not properly protect the driver, which will increase the risk of injury."

Obama's voters' disappointment
I voted for Obama twice in comparison to change
They say that Obama's great efforts have been interrupted due to the policy of hindrance of GOP.
The policy of obstruction can not excuse Obama's website's problems, drone attacks
Obama reminds the year 2008 Campen of what could happen .
Natheniyal P. Morris is a second year student in Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books nowadays.
This is a book about which I think it will encourage me during the second year medical school's distress and will wake up hopeful rays in me.
It has the courage to win its name, and it is a reminder of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I get rid of my patients' slips at night and go to bed, this book takes me into a round in which politics had motivated millions of people and the speech could stop your breath.
Elections proved unilateral, and the news speakers had taken a break to show the historical importance of that time.
My classmates were tears of joy in the eyes, and my parents saved every news paper.
A team of young people were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
During Obama's becoming President in 2008, he had 82 percent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like returning from the world of dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distance, a sad memory of the lost opportunities.
After the first vote was made by me, there was actual change.
Simplifiedly, none of this could imagine it.
I credit Obama with many achievements, from the Afordable Care Act to the return of our army from Iraq, "Do not tell us the end of Osama bin Laden".
Apart from this, I believe that the policy of opposing rivalry has stopped many efforts to move forward to our country: including non-migrant reforms, public options for health care, closure of the base on Gwantanamo Be, other than others.
But innumerous times in which I take the side of the Obama administration before my colleagues and colleagues, this is the end of the answer that I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
Republican's opposition policy is not the answer to the espionage of foreign leaders, nor is the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It can not answer the National Security Agency to collect data about the personal life of ordinary American citizens, nor can it answer the prosecution of people who reveal the wrong actions of the government.
It can not tell the reason for the murder of American citizen Anwar L Avlaki without trial, nor does the public funds and expenditure limits being reduced during President Campen.
It can not answer the conclusions of the report, which says that efforts by the White House to silence the media have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And most recently, it can not excuse the failure to design a simple website even after three years of signing the Afordable Care Act's law.
I do not know if I had expected it.
If at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the governance system could summon the political campaign to bring it forward.
It is evident that the elected office is not a forecasting route, because the anti-political parties and reminder incidents such as the Newton murder case will give shape to our public discussion.
Still, as many examples I have given above, they mostly appear to be elected by the administration themselves.
This thing troubles you most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidature.
Mitt Romani presented a confusing and uncertain option, which did not appear to determine their policies or their posts.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which will be free from the pressure of future elections, will fulfill the hopes about which we have been listening for a long time.
However, while Obama's merit rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return in 2008 through that book.
Seeing him, I remind of their missing promises.
In this week, a part of the book was reading, in which it was described how the Clinton suffered a major loss due to Obama in Pennsylvania Primary.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinate staff that he needs to return to the track, and there is a need to remain verified on his objectives.
They said, "I want to get my mozo back."
We should remember who we are.
Today, after five years, I can not agree more with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are from the Natheniyal Moris.
Clive Pamer claimed that the interest of PM Tony Abbott is a struggle about the ancestral holiday scheme.
billionaire MP Clive Pamer has said that the interest of Prime Minister Tony Abbott is a struggle about the ancestral holiday scheme because his daughters can be pregnant, and can take advantage of it.
The maharthi of the mining sector, which is in dispute about the payment of carbon tax bill of  6 million, has claimed, while he has tried to answer questions about the struggle.
Pamer United Party can control four votes in the Senate, which can be important in determining the reduction of carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Pamer has claimed that only ministers can have a good struggle, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally take advantage of policies.
Mr. Pamer said, "It may be an important interest struggle in the case of ancestral leave, because if any of his daughters are pregnant, then they will have a direct benefit whether they get a holiday or not."
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Pamer as the winner of 53 votes of the Sansheen Coast seat of Fairfax after the fall.
Mr. Pamer demanded the renovation of the counting of elections to speed up the process.
Tony Aut's daughters Franze and Bridget.
Should the results of the election come two months after we have voted
He said, "We should have a better system.
Why can not we have a system in which we fill our details on the computer, vote immediately and we have results at 6:30 in the evening.
Mr. Pamer also criticized the use of pencil to mark the ballot papers.
This is because if a person does not like him, then he can eradicate him
It seems absolutely useless to use pencil in today's era.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently released a joint discussion letter with New ealand.
59-year-old Mr. Pamer said that his policies include the creation of an international airport for the sunscreen coast, and they will take their new work seriously.
Public post is for public service.
He said, "We need no other award than history awards that we can serve the community at this important time."
Thereby, the players had to face problems.
Addressing the gathering held on this occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed strong resentment over the deteriorating law and order in the state.
He said that the fast growing attacks on advocates and their families prove that the culprits have become unconscious.
There is no fear of police and administrative arrangements on them.
Referring to such incidents in different places recently, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, the safety of the common man can be easily estimated.
RBS suspended two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of its Foreign Exchange Department, this information has been received from two people from the matter, it is another indication that the global investigations conducted by the regulators in the suspected manipulation of the currency market are fast moving forward.
Some of the world's largest banks, including BSF Barcles, Dush Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations in the world's largest financial market in which 5.3 trillion is exchanged every day.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended with the investigation of the case that appears to be repeated by the Liberal Interbank Debt Heralforce scandal.
The bank has refused to comment on the suspension and confirmed that the bank has received requests from the regulators for information this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank had said, "Our investigation is going on in this case, and we are fully cooperating with the CA and other regulators."
Last month, the people of the case had said that the RBS sent to the former trader and sent the records of email and prompt messages received from him to the UK Regulator, Financial Application Authority.
This trader named Richard User had left the RSS in 2010, and it is believed that it has been discharged from its current post of the European chief of Forex Spot Trading in J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, chief of European Spot Trading in City, had gone on leave last week, while former senior currency trader in Barcles and BSF was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrong work.
The people of the case told that the accelerated message group of Mr. User includes barclauses and stick group banks.
BSF said that after being told by Swiss regulator, Finma that she is investigating the suspected manipulation of foreign currency market in many Swiss banks, this week she has taken action against some of her employees.
At least six authority at the global level - European Commission, Finma, Competition Authority of Switzerland, Veco, HAV, HAC, and Hog paper monetary authority - Bankers are investigating allegations of their favorable fluctuations in the currency market.
The people familiar with the case told that the USB, City Group, JP Morgan and Credit Suis have also examined internal investigations, or received requests for information from the regulators.
Banks are closely investigating fast messages and emails equal to many years in search of a clue of any wrong activity.
News has created a disturbance in the traders of such areas, which have been among the most profitable persons in the trading unit of investing banks for the last several years, but they have to face the challenge this year, because due to low fluctuations in the currency, opportunities have come down.
Some banks tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the very huge and excessive liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that it is not necessary that it is true.
Senior trader said that despite the excessive magnitude of foreign exchange purchase and sale, the deterioration of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own platform by banks means "You can start affecting the market at a little less ticket price. "
This news came on the same day, on the day credit Suis had announced the service of the trader from his Exchange Trade Funds Desk in London this week, which had lost about 6 million rupees at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with their regulators.
Credit Suis said, "We believe that the trader had worked alone, and it has been controlled."

People have bought lots of gold and silver from utensils in the capital on Dhanteras.
Such purchases have increased by 20 to 30 percent compared to the previous year.
In Shimla, there was a lot of longs in jewelery shops.
There was also a lot of crowd in the shops of utensils decorated from the lower market to Malrod.

It is true that our work can not be done without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for life, but it is not in our interest to accept everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras to Krishna Triodshi of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshiped as the god of money Kuber and death god Yamraj.
Wealth is an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good.
Well done is our feeling towards money.
The money that comes to the welfare of humanity can not be more valuable than any other thing, but the money that has become the cause of ego does not mean.
We earn money from the holy purpose and spend only for the holy purpose.
For the maintenance of the family, wealth is the duty of every person.
Some part of it should also have a sense of expenditure on society, but the tendency to acquire unaccounted collection or yen-ken-profit money destroys our discretion, personality.
The feeling of donation should always be in mind.
A part of the money given by you can also be the basis for someone's lifetime.
We all should think for many people living in a fearless lack of society.
In fact, the meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the menstruation of life.
All people wish wealth and yes and they also get money and yes according to their men.
The same wealth and property are sustainable with which respect is connected.
No criminal can be rich, neither can he consume it properly nor can anyone work for another.
If someone else has money, do not believe it.
The true wealthy is the same who made the path of flowing in innumerable hands of money.
There can be no more use of money than the creation of employment for others.
Another thing, money is not just as currency.
It also happens as love for your health, character, others.
Try that you become the owner of this money.

After the general elections, if the new government continued the policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through ration, then in half a dozen states, these shops will not get kerosene.
The states where the sale of kerosene is to be stopped include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, some states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and North-East are also preparing to close the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry, on two grounds, it will be decided to stop sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states.
The first basis is that electricity connection is being made rapidly in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in the states where most rural families have been given LPG connections.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made strong preparations about this.
Since October 2013, the sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already stopped.
According to sources, under this policy, kerosene quota has been reduced to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
The quota of Punjab was reduced from 2.72 lakh kg to one lakh kg.
70 percent of the allocation of Uttarakhand was reduced to 40 percent of the kerosene quota in Haryana.
Despite this deduction, there is no news of the shortage of kerosene from these states.
The Ministry believes that it is clear from this that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
The price of PDS kerosene and diesel is currently 37 rupees.
This encourages adulterators.
In the states where sales will be stopped through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at full cost in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per liter on kerosene.
The burden of kerosene subsidy in 2013-14 is estimated to be about Rs 31 thousand crore.

This company bought the server for itself by referring to trading on September 24, 2012 in the name of Wintrade.

Call the political pundits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What party did
If its comparative results come, then the question will not come in front of the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever there is a BJP government, efforts have been made to fulfill public aspirations.
This country is witnessing that inflation was less in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man got food for two times.
But when the Congress or its support government was formed, it was not possible to compensate the poor man.
A single leader of the Congress, a single leader of the UPA is not responding to what he did in nine and a half years.
The media of our country can not even reach them.
Congress has become egoistic.
They do not answer the media people too.
Elections are from the Lok Sabha, you answer the public.
Modi attacked Congress leader Kapil Sibal and said, "On the day Modi is being asked questions. When the people bless the BJP in 2014, then every year they will present their work in front of the public.

There can be no orphan in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Congress friends leave balloons on the day they came.
Congress friends, we have given exams 10 months ago.
In democracy, the people take tests only.

Egypt believed in the first president elected independently .
Mohammad Morsi has sworn in as his post, but his victory day hardly ended the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammad Morsi promised "New Egypt" while taking oath as the first independently elected President of the country to replace Hosni Mubarak, who was removed 16 months ago.
On his formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi Arabia has become the fifth President of Egypt after the independently elected first Islamist President of the world, and after the removal of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He sworn in on the banks of the river Neel before 18 judges of the court, who looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
During the formal ceremony shown in the live broadcast on national television, Morsi said, "We are awaiting better future, new Egypt and other Republics."
The fundamentalist group Muslim Brotherhood, who has spent 84 years as an unlawful organization since his establishment, and who has been on the target of the previous governments, 60-year-old Marsi, a trained engineer in the US of the party said that "Today the people of Egypt have laid the foundation of new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and police personnel protected the building and according to local time, after some time at 11 in the morning, Morsi came in the small convoy of cars.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the President separately from the President's smoke, traffic was also stopped for a while so that the convoy of their motor was generally busy, which connects the center of the city to its southern suburbs.
After his victory in Morsi's personal talent, which was ridiculed as a non-constitutional tire of Brotherhood, he was very high and on Friday his speech presented him as not only Islamist but all those candidates who want to complete the 2011 revolution against dictator Mubarak.

His indication was that the list is almost ready.
It is reported that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself will look into the list from his own level.
They will also check whether the opinion of MLAs and MPs has been taken in making the list.
If needed, a large scale reshuffle will be made in the list to give place to the old and committed workers.
The general allegation of MLAs and MPs is that those people's opinion was not taken in making a list of nomination.
The names of people who came a long time from other parties have been recorded in the list, while many important activists active since the party's days have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spon, some make life ideal with their hard work and people inspire them.
In such persons, one name comes from Self-Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, who was posted as a teacher in a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat, was born on December 28, 1932.
Dhirubhai was number three in five siblings.
Five children of the family include Ramanikalal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to leave studies only after high school.
Dhirubhai started helping the house in childhood.
At this time, he used to put a buzzing shop near Girnar, the shop income was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, at the age of 17 in 1949, he reached Eden city of Yemen with a ship called Kabota.
Here, his elder brother Ramanikalal had made all arrangements for him, so he had no problem getting jobs abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954, they returned.
In 1955, he reached Mumbai to try luck by putting 500 rupees in pocket.
And his commercial journey started from here.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani extended such steps that never again looked back.
His name became not only the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani departed from the world on July 6, 2002.
At present, he was a owner of Rs 62000 crore.
At present, his son Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handling their Sultanate.
Like father today, the names of these two brothers are also among international businessmen.
Who does not know Ambani family today
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Neeta Ambani and Tina Ambani.

According to this report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore during the last four years to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Rather, in contrast to Modi's claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004) Atal Vihari Vajpayee's PM, there was a time when it came for two consecutive years (2001-2002) No advertisement was issued by the government on Patel.
Keeping the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182 meter high 'Statu of Unity' statue in Kewadia of Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "Now there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's Jayantis.
While DAVP records show that UPA spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari was asked about Modi's claims, he said that BJP's PM candidature does not talk on the basis of facts.
UPA could not bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
About which Tiwari said that this happened due to economic slowdown that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on the Jayantis and deaths of the members of the Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
DAVP spent 33 crores for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and death anniversary, 21 crores for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crores for Indira Gandhi and 9.38 crores for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When Manish Tewari asked about this difference, he said, "It should not be seen from the point of view of expenditure on advertisement.
Because the price of advertisement depends on many things, including issues like advertising size or advertising rate etc. for that year.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, people who oppose it are trying to handle the legacy of a great leader without knowing it.

To provide free medical services, move forward through soil, rivers and forests
Dr. Georges Well, is providing free health services in the rural areas of Cameron
Well and their team see hundreds of patients every weekend .
In the West African countries , there is not much doctor , there is only one doctor for 5000 people .
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or for someone in other top 10 to make a CNN year hero.
The winning person will get  250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father feeling conscious and unconscious, going to the hospital, which was not properly convenient to help him.
Jamel Well, in the year 1981, the car accident near Cameron's capital Yonde was injured.
Initially, his hand was broken, but an infection increased, which spread to his brain, and he made bloodshed, which affected his remaining life.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgeon in the camera.
If we had money, we would take our father out of the cameraon.
Instead, Vell continued to rotate the very crowded clinics and hospitals with his father and obtained whatever treatment he could get.
Well said, "This is not easy.
You come out of the house at 5 in the morning with the hope that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but it does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can wait in the mouth of death while waiting.
Since the death of Vell's father in 2002, there was not much change in the situation.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5000 person in the camera.
If compared, then there is a doctor for every 413 persons in United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameron can not bear his expense.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in health care in the country belong to the private sector.
Well says, "His only problem is poverty.
And because of being poor, they can not enjoy their life.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Well took a firm resolve to resolve it.
His team of Dr. Georges and volunteers has done 700 free surgery last year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon in Yonde's Central Hospital.
And he started an NGO Escovim, who goes to rural areas on weekend to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his own group of volunteers have helped about 32,000 people.
On almost every Friday, they and around 30 people sit in the van, tied medical supply from the roof and go to such rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes fate is not even with them.
They have to move forward by pushing the vehicle more than once from the rivers and soil.
But when they reach, they really get respect from the heroes: Daatat, singing and dance, and the best house to be presented by the community.
In these villages, free medical service is actually the reason for celebrating, and wealth - with its big smile and infinite energy - it is happy.
Next morning, his team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We are meeting 500 people in every journey.
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other people can get bisakhi, donated glasses or free birth certificates - this document is required in the school but many poor families can not afford it.
In the evening, the party does simple surgery with local communication.
Operations are usually done at school building, town hall or home, after the process, the patient goes to the recovery place, and makes the place for the next person.
The generator of the group publishes in the operation room and the sanitation equipment, and Vell and his voluntary work on Sunday morning and evening.
This is a lot of speed, but the musicians of the village usually help in motivating the party.
Well said, "They keep playing drums all night to wake us up and continue their work."
On Sunday, their party returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - including Cameron's doctors and foreign medical students - have done 700 free surgery last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those whom they help.
A person said that due to free hernia surgery, he will be able to go to work again.
The person said, "This will change the future of my and my family."
In addition to running weekend clinics and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Vell also works in private medical clinics around Yonde at night.
He said that this is his second job which fiscalizes 60 of his non-cooperation work, the remaining part is completed with personal donation.
Self-service, Katie O'Mailie, a second year medical student of Drexel University in Philadelphia, said, "I do not know when they sleep."
They are always in the hospital, or are trying to earn money for their organization so that they continue to run these campaigns.
This is an experimental opportunity for students of medical and nursing like O'Mailie who come from United States and Europe to join Vell's campaign, which they can never achieve in their country.
O'Mailly said, "In the surgery we help Dr. We get tools for Dr. Well or clean blood patches, we have been able to get experimental experience."
You will never get an opportunity to do this as a second year medical student in America.
Self-service students usually spend from themselves to reach Cameron, and they often come with the medical supply of donations.
But after reaching the youth, they come to live, and take the expenses of instructions.
O'Mailie says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameron is never going to end.
For Well, almost the same work burden is not difficult.
Helping other people to live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are things that give them a lot of joy.
Well says, "I am very happy to do this work."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm smiling people, to reduce their pain.
See the website of Escovim and find out how to help.
You would not believe but this is true.

Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he should answer Modi.
It is your duty to answer the public.
Clearly, Modi was responding to Sibal who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants his controlled environment where he gives his speech and does not talk to the journalists to avoid questions.

Speaking through video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said, " There is no question in this that the President, I, and other people in the government really knew about some things happening with the automatic pilot, because if you look back, then the second World War, and the difficult years of the cold war, and then, of course, it was in 911.
He has become the first high-class member of the US government, who has admitted that US spy has crossed his border, but emphasized that no one's rights have been misused.
He said: "In some cases, it has gone far ahead inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to clarify it for the people and is now reviewing intensely so that no person has the sense of misuse.
