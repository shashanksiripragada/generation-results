What's the mind, October 2019
My beloved countrymen, Namaskar.
You're all happy with Deepawali, we've been told here.
In Deepjeotrinmosthy in the enemy's destruction.
How beautiful a message.
At present, Deepawali is celebrated in different countries of the world.
Especially in this festival, not only the Indians are involved, but the governments of many countries, the citizens of that country, the social organization of Deepawali celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
A kind of India is formed there.
Friends, there is a different attraction of tourism in the world.
Our India is a country of festivals, there is a great opportunity for tourism.
We should try that whatever Holi, Deepawali, Wonum, Pongal, Beihu, all this festival, and this pleasure contains people of other countries and other countries.
We have so many festivals in every state, every region - the people of other countries are interested in this festival.
That is why Indians living outside the country are very important for the improvement of tourism in India.
My beloved countrymen, I've set up in the last 'Man Ki Baat' program, I'll do something different on this island.
I told you, let us all celebrate Indian women's strength and their success in this island, that is, I respect India's Lakshmi.
Just after seeing it, the specific media is furious about unexpected inspiring stories.
Warangle's coriander Ramesh, Namo Appe wrote, "My mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took charge of five sons.
Today we're five brothers in a good life.
My mother is my God.
Everything I have, if he sees, he is a sympathy of India. "
Romeshji, your mother's pleasure.
Tutter's sensible husband says he has a smile of Major Khushboo Koyar India, the daughter of the bus conductor and she led the women's forces of Assam Rifles.
His daughter is India's Lakshmi, who has the strength of poetry.
She was proud that her daughter took a very good picture, and took a better place in the clutches.
Meghala Jain again wrote - a 92-year-old woman has been drinking water to go to the Gwalior railway station for many years.
Meghalaji, this sympathy of India has been very impressed by the foolish nature and cruelty.
A lot of such stories have been shared.
You must read, take inspiration and share something around yourself.
I'm sorry to all these sympathies of India.
My beloved countryman, the famous poet of the seventeenth century, Sachi Honnamma, wrote a poem in Kannada in the seventeenth century.
That feeling, that all of India's Lakshmi, whom we're telling, perhaps the seventy-seventh century of its glory.
How beautiful words , so beautiful imaginations have been expressed and how high ideas are in this poem of the Kannada language - Peninda Permegandunu Himavanantu , Peninda Brighu Perchidunu Peninda Johnkaranu Jabaddenu , meaning Himavananthu i . e . the king of the mountains , for his daughter salvation , for her daughter salvation , and for her daughter salvation .
Our daughters have a strong introduction to our society through our glory and the great work of these girls and the bright future.
My beloved countrymen, 12 November 2019, on this day, the 550th festival of Sri Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated throughout the world.
The effect of Guru Nanak Devji is not only in India but in the world.
In many countries of this world, we have learned brothers who have completely dedicated their lives to the ideal of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can never forget about my visit to Vancover and Tehran.
There's a lot of talk about Sri Guru Nanak Devaji that I can take part with you, but that's why it's going to take a lot of celebrations.
He always gave up the service work on everyone.
Guru Nanak Devji believed that the service work was invaluable.
He fought firmly against social curse like untouchability.
Mr. Guru Nanak Dev-ji, gave his message to the world.
He was one of the most travellers of his time.
He went to many places and wherever he enjoyed the hearts of everyone through his sympathy, emperority, pureness.
Guru Nanak Devji has traveled to a very important religious place.
It is said that the famous Sadhu of Assam, Shankardev, was also impressed in his ideal.
He also travelled on the holy ground of Haridar.
During his visit to Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji solved the problem of water there.
In the lighter, Gurunakdevji-Kyugurgit, is a famous place called Gurunak Jira Sahib, which reminds us of his words.
During an admiration Guru Nanakji had also traveled in the north Kashmir and its surrounding areas .
Because of this, there is a strong relationship between the followers of Sikhism and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji had also gone to Tibet and he was also confessed in the form of ' Guru ' .
He also traveled to Uzbekistan and he was worshipped there too.
And at a time of admiration, he traveled to Islamic countries widely, which are already in Arab, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He lived in millions of human hearts, that man, with full faith, obeyed his advices and did it even today.
And this journey was organised for the celebration of Guru Nanak Devji, 550th Lok Sabha festival.
There, all those princes, with the Golden Temple vision, get a chance to possess Sikh heritage and culture.
He was a great man who tied the country to unity.
Like the surdar Patel, there was a surprising ability to gather people, just as those with whom there was a miraculous difference, they were able to coordinate with them.
Even the surpassing patterns of hungry, seriously watching and watching the testers.
About this literally, he was the Man of Dettel.
Nearby, he was also supposed to be a synthetic skill.
He was particularly supposed to make plans and plans.
When it is read or heard about the performance of the surdar sergeon, it can be found how excellent the orphanage was.
In 1921, tens of thousands of representatives from all over the country joined the Congress General Assembly.
He's sure nobody's suffering from water.
He contacted the farmers and asked them to make a khadi bag.
Review, that's why the sale of fertilizers increased.
The country will always be grateful to the Serdar Patel to play an important role in the Constitution Council.
He does important work to ensure our fundamental right , so that there is no possibility of discrimination on the basis of caste or community .
Friends , we all know that as the first self-esteem minister of India Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done the historical and important work of uniting the ruins and regions of this country .
There was a speciality among the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels that nothing had left his sight, he had a sight everywhere.
On one side, as his eyes were focused on Hyderabad, Junagadh and other states.
Likewise , the Lakshadweep of the south far and wide had not stopped its goal .
In fact, when we mention the effort of the surdar Patel, we discuss the role of this country only in some specific corner.
Like Lakshadweep for a small estate also he played an important role .
Immediately after receiving this news , the surdar Patel immediately took a stern step without calling .
He sent instructions to the ancestors of Mudalia , Arkat Ramswami Mudaliar and Arkat Laxmanswami Mudalia that along with the residents of the trekkers the flag hoisted the national flag there immediately .
Terrago is made immediately as his instructions and the wishes of engraving the neighbouring on Lakshadweep are fulfilled .
After this incident the brother-in-law of Sardar Patel Mudalia says that they personally ensure that all kinds of help is available in the development of Lakshadweep .
Today Lakshadweep is making a very important contribution in the progress of India .
This is an attractive tourist destination and place .
I hope you're going to visit these beautiful islands and their seas.
My dear countrymen, on 31 October, 1971, the Statue of Unit, built in memory of Sardar Saheb, was sacrificed to the whole country and the world.
This is the world's longest human idol.
In the height, it doubles America's Statue of Liberty.
The longest statue of the world fills the heart of every Indian -LRB- in the form of Indian -RRB- with the pride of heart when it is thought that the longest statue of the world is established in our country -LRB- in our country -RRB- .
The head of each Indian becomes high in spirituality .
You will be happy to know that in one year 26 lakh tourists had come to see the Statue of Unity idol .
That is , everyday eight and a half thousand people enjoyed this statute of unity .
The faith that is in their hearts for the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has been expressed this itself .
Now there many attraction centres like cactus gardens , butterflies , wild safari , child nutritious parks , unity nursery are continuously developing and this is why local economy and improvement is happening , people are also getting the opportunity of many new kinds of workplaces .
Professional training is also being given in homesteps or homes for the opportunity of guests .
Local people have started the farming of dragon fruits now and I am firmly convinced that it will become the main source of their biography .
Friends , for the country , for every state , this statute of unit can be a subject of study for tourism .
We can witness how a place can become a world famous tourist center within a year where people from all over the world come .
Transportation arrangements , staying places , presence of guides , environmental arrangements - every one after another is improving .
Very big financial progress has started and local human services are being developed as needed by tourists .
The government is pursuing its responsibility.
Friends , is there any such Indian who does not feel proud to know that a few days back time magazine has placed this Statue of Unity in the world 's 100 best tourist spots .
I hope you all will go to see this statute of unit after extracting some distance from your valuable time , but I want to know that every Indian who comes out for a journey , he goes to the country at least fifteen places of the country and stays there at night .
Friends, you know that every year 31st October is being celebrated as national unity day from 1947.
This day refers to our country's unity, integrity and security to be maintained in any way.
Even today, "Ran for Unity" is being organized.
This will help people from all sections of society.
Running is beneficial for both mind and body.
I hope all of you will participate in October 31 - for the unity of the country and to keep your body healthy.
My beloved countrymen, the surdar Patel, tied the country in the form of unity.
This mantra of unity should be made to strengthen the mantras of unity at every level in a specific country like India.
Our society has always been very active and cautious to strengthen my loved countrymen's unity and concerns.
There are many examples around us that are working for this purpose.
But many times their words get very quickly from our memory.
Friends, I remember the month of September 2010 when Allahabad High Court Ram gave birth anniversary.
My dear countrymen, on October 31, the former Prime Minister of our country, Shrimati Indira Devi, is also killed this day.
I'm offering my reverence to this day, my dear countrymen, if every household, every village is sounded, from east to west, from north to south, every corner of India, if a story is released, then it is clean.
Every person, every family, wants to tell every village about my joyful experience of cleanliness, because this effort of purification is to be accompanied by hundreds of millions of Indians.
That's why it's worth 100 million Indians.
But there's a pleasant and thrilling experience.
I hear and I want to hear you too.
In such a difficult situation, it's not a matter of less gallantry.
In such a terrible situation, our terrible soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country from the semi-military, but they are also running a clean sycan campaign there.
There's so cold that nothing melts.
In such a situation, it's an important task to separate the embryo.
We all know that Siachen is a ship that is the source of rivers and pure water.
Clean India's expedition in such a place is to ensure pure water supply for those in the lower areas, along with the water of rivers like nursing and shivak.
My dear countrymen, the festival is a festival that raises a new consciousness in all of us.
And in Deepawali, especially in some new ones, there's nothing to bring from the market.
I was once trying to do the local things.
If we find things we need, we don't need to go to Tahsil.
I don't need to go to the district if you get it.
As much as we're trying to buy local things, Gandhi 150 will change you to a great festival.
And I always request that we don't know what we're doing, we should buy something that we've got in our pockets.
Even in this Deepawali, many of you bought something before Deepawali, but there are many of them who think that after Deepawali, things might be cheaper.
So there'll be a lot of people who're still buying.
So I'm asking you to come and ask why we're interested in local things, or not.
Look, we can also play an important role in successing Mahatma Gandhi's dream.
I'm telling you a lot of good luck about this recipient of Deepawali.
We use baji as everyone in Deepawali.
But sometimes there's a strange fire.
Sometimes it gets hurt.
I request all of you to be careful and celebrate the festival with great indignation.
I don't have many good wishes.
Thank you so much.
What does it mean, September 2018
Is there any Indian who doesn't feel proud of our armed forces, our army's soldiers
Yesterday only a hundred fifteen million people of the country celebrated the Parakram festival.
We recalled the incident of "Surgical Strike" in 1960 when our troops shook our country in the name of proxy wire.
Our armed forces organized demonstrations in different parts of the country, so that the lion could feel the masses, especially the youth generations of the country, how capable we are and how our soldiers threaten our lives to protect the countrymen.
Like the traditional festival, the youth of the country possesses our magnificent heritage of armed forces.
We inspire to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also took part in a program at Yodhpur in Rajasthan.
It is obvious that our troops will give them all a sword that will destroy our country's peace and prosperity.
But with respect, and not in exchange for the country's superior power.
India is always committed and dedicated to maintaining peace.
In the two-twoth century, more than one million troops sacrificed their lives for peace, the war with which we had no connection.
Our eyes never fell on any other country's land.
It was our responsibility to Shanti.
Just a few days ago, on September 23, we recalled the soldiers of Mahishur, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lansar on the occasion of the Haifa war, who freed Haifa from the aggressors.
This was an extraordinary testimony to our soldiers for peace.
Even today, India is one of the highest number of troops in various peacekeeping forces of the Nation.
For decades, our armoured soldiers have been clothing blue helmets and playing an important role in the world's peace system.
My beloved countrymen, our air power is not comparative.
Fly Past, where our airspace has a glimpse of excellent architecture and energy exhibition.
On 8th October we celebrate 'Byusena Day'.
In the 1947s, when Pakistani invaders started attacking, this airspace ensured that Indian troops and combat operations reach the battlefield at the right time to protect Sri Nagar from the attackers.
Even in the war of 1965, the airspace gave the enemy the right to the enemy.
Who doesn't know about the 1971 Bangkok issue
In 1999- Aircraft also played a very important role in liberating Kargil from the analysts.
In Tiger Hill, the airspace destroyed them by continuously bombing the enemy's valley.
Whether torture and rescue, or emergency management, the entire country is grateful to them for what the airspace is worthy of.
Aircraft contributors with the help of the country, in the face of natural threats like Tufan, Jhanzha, Bunna, or awesome pimples.
In the country, Gender Equality has established the airspace to ensure the equality of the women and the male and the daughters of each of their departments.
Now, with the Aircraft women's 'Shart Service Commission', I'm giving the opportunity to choose the alternative of the Permanent Commission, which I announced from the Red Fort on the 15th of this year.
India can tell the pride that there is not only men's strength in the Indian armed forces, but women's participation is also increasing day by day.
The whole country was worried how to save her.
You must know a brutal, courageous and virgin soldier of the Prince Tommy navy.
The first Indian who was traveling around the world with a small boat without any modern technology.
For 80 days, the Golden Globe race in the south of the Indian Ocean was in a terrible sea storm when it was moving fast.
I told you to enjoy doing this kind of adventurous thing...
I pray for the fastest recovery of Ablas Tommy and hope that his courage, this gallantry, this strong imagination - the strength to win this fight - the inspiration and enthusiasm of our country's young generation.
My beloved countrymen, the children know what the significance of the day of October 2.
This year, there's one more special significance.
For the next two years, we've been going to pursue a variety of works on the world for the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi's thoughts and thoughts have reached the world today.
Dr. Martin Luther's King Junior or Nelson Mandeller, every man has power from Gandhiji's imagination, they have fought a long struggle to gain equal rights and respect for the nation.
I want to discuss with you about the greater work of worshipping babuji in today's 'Anything' programme... which all the countrymen need to know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi began to enumerate some thoughts as a constraint program or a 'strategic program'.
Later, when freedom struggle became stronger in 1945, Gandhiji made a revised reflection of his thoughts.
The ancestral ancestral farmers, the people of the village and the people's brothers' rights, safety, cleansing, education, etc. have their thoughts in front of the countrymen, which are also called Gandhi Charter.
Private Bapuji was a journal.
Disappearing with man, the specialty of the babuji to adopt man, which was in his own nature.
This is what Mahatma has experienced as the most valuable feature of Gandhi's personality.
He gained the countrymen that they were important and necessary for the development of the country.
He gave this achievement the form of an universal movement that was his best contribution to the freedom struggle.
Every section of the society dedicated itself to Mahatma Gandhi's sacrifice in freedom struggle.
Dad gave us all an inspirational mantra, which we know as the magic mantra of Gandhiji.
There Gandhiji said, "I'm telling you a trick, whenever you feel doubtful or arrogant, remember my thoughts.
You look at the poorest and weakest man you've seen in life, and ask your mind how much you're thinking of taking steps.
I mean, will it gain millions of hungry and untouchables
That's when you'll see that your doubts are sounded and the secrets of ego.
"My beloved countrymen, Gandhiji's trick is even more important.
The economic power and purchasing power of the country's growing medieval world today is enormous.
If the poor man gets that benefit, then my joy will increase manifold.
Remembering Gandhiji's trick in the next day, whenever we buy something, we must take care of Gandhiji's birth anniversary, we must keep in mind that every buying of us is good for some countrymen and those who have sweated in the product's production, who have invested in their vengeance, everybody gets some benefit from them.
This is Gandhiji's trick, that's Gandhiji's message, I believe you can bring a small step into the life of the poorest man.
Likewise, today, we may think that through this little work and in the economic progress of my country, we can make big contributions to enable poverty to fight against poverty.
And I think it's the real patriotism of today's time, that's a reverence to the work of the priesthood.
Like you think of buying khadi and handicrafts at any particular ceremony.
Two days later, we'll celebrate and celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri.
As soon as Shastriji's name is higher, we have an unlimited faith in the Indians.
His simple personality always fills every countrymen's mind with pride.
He was very soft from outside, but he was strong.
The "Jai Jawan Jai Kishan" mantra was the circular of his great personality.
During the brief work of nearly a year and a half, he gave a mantra to summit the success of the youth and the farmers of the country, which is the result of his untouchability to the nation.
Crores of people took part in this expedition... and I'm very lucky to give a clean work to the children in Delhi's Ambedakar school.
I went to school, which was founded by the ancestral dad.
School kids, college students, NCCs, NSS, youth organizations, media groups, corporates, all of them gave a clean work.
I'll introduce all the cleansmiths to the countrymen.
Come on, let's hear a phone call, "Namskar, my name is Shaitan Singh.
I'll thank you for your phone.
My beloved countrymen, 'Swachh Bharat Mission', are not only in the country but also a success in the world, which everyone is discussing.
This time India is going to organise the world 's largest cleaning conference - ' Mahatma Gandhi International Pleasure Conference ' i . . Mahatma Gandhi International Convention .
From all over the world, the officers of the Ministry of Pleasure and experts from all over the world will come and divide the experiments and experiences of pureness.
It is inevitable to ensure the freedom, peace and justice of regulated, suffering and divided people.
On October 12, 1993, he thought that the 'national Human Rights Commission' was formed.
NHRC's fifteen years will be completed in a few days.
NHRC not only protected humanity, but also helped to grow in spiritual honour.
Our favourite leader, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee clearly told us that humanity is not a foreign idea.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, the ideal principle of the Vedic era is decorated with "Built sweet".
NHRC has created a widespread awareness of humanity, and has also played a proud role in preventing its use.
This commission has created an atmosphere of hope and trust among the countrymen in this journey for twenty five years.
I think it's a healthy society, very promising for monetary values.
Now, the state humanitarian commission has been formed closer to work on humanitarianism at the national level.
All these princes gave us a guarantee, we know the guarantees.
Come on this year, we'll be sure to organise Run for Unity in our villages, towns, towns, towns, towns.
This is the right way to recall the surdar sir, because he worked for the country's unity forever.
I'll ask all of you that on 31st October, through "Run for Unity", we make this effort to bind every class of society in the form of unity, and that will be the best faith to him.
For all these holy festivals, my dear countrymen, Navaratri, Durgapuja, Vijaya Dashmi, I'll introduce you all to a lot of good luck.
Thank you
What's the mind, August 2018
Today the entire country is celebrating the Residency Festival.
It's very nice to know all the countrymen in this renaissance
This festival of Rakshabandhan symbolizes the love and faith of sister and brother.
For centuries, this festival is a big example of social harmony.
There are so many incidents in the history of the country when a protective source has been tied to the bonds of faith in two states, or people of different religions.
Just a few days later.
The air will be heard in the sky... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
It's a different joy to roam in Krishna's color.
In the different coasts of the country, especially in Maharashtra, boys have started making arrangements of Dahi-Handi.
I'm grateful to Chinmai that he took care of this thing.
Friends, the day of recognition is celebrated as the Sanskrit Day.
I would like to congratulate all those people who are engaged in protecting this great heritage, carrying forward and reaching the people.
Every language has its own importance.
In every field of life, there is a great deal of knowledge in culture and literature.
Whether it is science or knowledge of the system, agriculture or health, architectural or architecture, or architectural, organisation or environment, the mantras of fighting with challenges like global warming are also described in detail.
You'll be glad to know that all the people of the village of 'Mattu' in the Shivmoga district of Karnataka have chosen Sanskrit language as a conversation today.
You marvellously knowing one thing that culture is a language in which the words can be built.
We'll use English quotations to weigh something, sometimes bullshit.
But those who know the words of Sanskrit, they know how few words the correct explanations of things can be made through these well-known words of Sanskrit.
"Actually, if a teacher gives a letter to his disciple, there is no such thing or wealth in the whole world, by which the disciple can squeeze the debt of the teacher.
We always recall the great philosopher and the former president of the country Bharat Ratna Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan for the purpose of the education day.
In his birth anniversary, the teaching day is celebrated all over the country.
I know the joy of all the teachings of the country, and immediately recall his dedication to science, education and students, his dedication.
My beloved countrymen, our farmers, who work hard, bring the news of rain rejoicing.
"When we've seen a terrible monster, how he harassed the life of Kerala.
In such a difficult situation, the whole country has come closer to Kerala.
Those who lost their loved ones in this danger, let us know the deepest condolences of those families.
What has been damaged, maybe it will not be completed any day, but I'd like to fill up all those troubled family members, 125 million countrymen are with you on the shoulders of this rare day.
I pray, those who are injured in this natural danger, get better.
I'm sure that the life of Kerala will be quickly normal by filling up immense life and courage.
The way it ruins life, it's very unfortunate, but in this evil day we regain humanity.
From Kachu to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everybody is trying his best, so that in the areas where the danger has become terrible, it is the Kerala or any district or region of India, the life of all those places is natural.
People of all ages and people with all kinds of work are increasing their help.
Everyone thinks how to divide the sufferings and sufferings of the people of Kerala, so that it's ruined.
We all know, the armed security forces are the hero of the rescue operation in Kerala.
They took all kinds of ways to save the hypocrisy.
Air Force, Navy or Army, B-S-F, C-I-S-F, and A-F, have jumped into rescue operations and transportation.
I'd like to mention the hard work of the END-R-F.
The way they worked in confrontation with these dangers, they demand special praise.
The power of the NDR-F, their responsibility, the ability to bring the situation to life, has made a faithful assignment to all the people of the country.
Dear countrymen, we've seen the suggestions sent for this time to read, the most people who wrote about it are our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Bajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Witness from Sonipat, Pravin, brother of Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banarjee from West Bengal, many more people from Akhilash Pand from Katihar in Bihar and asked me to tell me about the various aspects of the life of 'Narendra Modi Mobile App-A' and 'My Gov A Atlaji'.
On 16th August, the country and the world's people got the news of Atlaji's efforts, everybody's deep regret.
He was a nationalist who abandoned the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago and went far away from active politics in the last ten years.
He wouldn't have been very special about the news.
The sneeze, reverence and regret of all for Atlaji, is the circumambulator of his great personality.
This country will always be grateful to Atlaji for bringing Good Governance to the mainstream.
I want to tell you about a more specific example of Otlaji's great personality... that's the political culture that he tried to bring about changes in the Political Culturue and the attempts to improve the political culture... and the future will be sure.
India will always be grateful to Atlaji for "Accountant Resolution Agreement 2003".
This revision brings two important changes in our country's politics.
The first is to limit the Ministers of States to fifteen percent of the total seats of the Assembly.
Atlaji brings about a change in this system, resulting in the synthesis of money and wealth, efficiency.
Atlaji was the only one who changed the situation and initiated a healthy and smooth system in politics.
Atalji was a real patriot.
In 2001, Atalji packed the budget in the morning at five in the evening.
Another 'Azadi' we get at the time of Atlaji's work through the creation of Indian Flag Code.
It's going to be done since 2002, so that the tricolor can be extracted in public places.
Ordinary Indians get a chance to excite the national flag.
In this way, he brought our favourite triangle to the masses.
You have seen how Otlaji has changed the vote procedure, with a bold step in the election of the people.
My beloved countrymen, whenever there is a discussion about the Parliament this time, the obstacle is spoken, but when something is good, it doesn't seem to be a special discussion.
A few days back, the Parliament's reshuffle is over.
You would be happy to know that the Productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 percent and the state level was 74 percent.
Trying to exclude the party's self-sacrifice and to make the most useful of all the transformation operations, the result was that the Lok Sabha 21 and the Rajya Sabha passed 14 bills.
Parliament will be reminded of this reversal of social justice and youth.
In this conference, how many bills have been passed for the betterment of the youth and the ungrasser class.
You all know, for a few decades, the SCST commission was demanding the formation of OBC commission.
To ensure the rights of the Angersar class, the country has fulfilled the imagination of the formation of the OBC commission this time and gave this institution a comprehensive right.
This step will help the goal of social justice to go forward successfully.
The work of passing the revised bills to safeguard the rights of the peninsula and the peninsula tribes has also started in this session.
This law will protect the people of SC and ST classes more.
At the same time, it will protect their oppressors from the atrocities and increase their faith.
The women of the country cannot afford any kind of injustice.
The culprits of this fugitive will be at least 10 years of age, raped by 12 years of age, and the fugitive will be supplied.
A few days ago, you may have been in the newspaper, a court in Mandsore, Madhya Pradesh, just two months after hearing a two-month hearing, heard two convicts in the crime of raping a naval.
Even before this, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh, gave a five-day hearing to the culprits.
A court in Rajasthan also gave such a fast plea.
This law will play a constructive role in denying the case of crime against women and girls.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
The 'Tin Talak' Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha, though it wasn't possible to pass this session in the Rajya Sabha... and I want to reassure Muslim women, the entire country is with all the powers to give them justice.
When we come forward to protect our country's selfishness, it's possible to change the life of poor, backward, relieved and discredited.
Everyone in the reshuffle session has found an ideal.
I'm thanking all the country's resources.
My beloved countrymen, at this moment, a millions of patriots are obliged to the Asian Games.
Every morning, in the newspapers, televisions, news, social media, there are some Indian players' medals.
Asian games are still going on.
I'm greeting everyone of the medals I have won for the country.
Those who are still in the race, they'll know a lot of good luck.
The players of India, especially Shooting and Wressling, are now doing a good show, that we couldn't make good results before all the games, our players are taking medals like Wushu and Rowing.
These are not mere medals, it is the courage of Indian sports and Indian competitors to touch the sky and their dreams.
The number of our girls in the list of medal winners for the country is an epic.
Even the youth who won the medals are 15-16 years.
It's also a good sign that many of the players who have won the medals have come out of the famous village and muffle, and have done this success in hard work.
On 29th August we will celebrate ' Gazirakudi Day ' , for this purpose I enjoy all the players of the sports , along with this I will offer my tribute to the magician player Shri Dhanchandji .
My request to all citizens of the country, you all sports and pay attention to your fitness, because healthy India will build a rich and prosperous India.
When India is fit, the bright future of India will be built.
Once again, I congratulate the Asian Games Medals, and the other players on the same side.
But the Vrihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur of Tamil Nadu is the place where this unforgettable union of architecture and engineering is seen .
Everyone is astonished to see the eleventh century 'Rani Ki Bao' in Patan of Gujarat.
It's an experiment for engineering across India.
There are many engineers in India who have imagined the inappropriate and established examples in the Engineering world.
Our great engineers have a jewelry in the heritage store that makes people amaze today.
He is Bharat Ratna Dr.
In that part of the country, he is sufficient, and all the other parts of the country recall him with great respect and respect.
In his memory, on 15th September, Engineers fled as Day.
Following his footsteps, the engineers of our country made their free identity in the world.
In 2001, when I talk about the incomplete credit of the Engineering world, I remember the incident of the horrific earthquake of Gujarat's Kutch.
He was joking to see me, see this is my house.
Well, it's Bhunga.
My house saw three earthquakes.
He was very proud of this... and I think many years ago our engineers used to build houses in the local environment and conditions that would protect the people.
Now, when we celebrate the Engineers' Day, we have to think of the future, we have to organize workshops at different places.
Would we have to learn new things when we change
You need to learn
The world is fighting with natural danger.
What will be the new use of structural engineering here
What's his course
What should the students teach
I'll enjoy you all with this idea.
I'll talk again.
What is the mind, July 2018
The human thoughts are inspired.
You must have seen in TV that 12 boys in Thailand went to a group of football players and their coach to a cave.
It takes usually a few hours to go to the cave and get out of there.
But that day the fate of the goddess was different.
When they entered the cave, there was a lot of water accumulated in the mouth of the cave due to heavy rains.
All the efforts are made to know where those girls are, where they are, how they can be brought out.
But I want to see this whole incident in some other way.
The government there, the children's parents, family members, glory, the citizens of the country, have shown each of them an integral act of peace and patience.
Everyone has been involved in this mission.
Everybody's useful. I think it's a matter of learning and self-esteem.
Parents don't feel sorry or mother didn't drop her eyes but not.
Everyone's patience, restraint, the calm use of the whole society is really a lesson for us.
In this operation, a soldier from Thailand's navy has to give life.
The whole world is astonished that despite such a dangerous situation, rescuers worked with courage and patience in the blind dark cave.
The incident shows that when man is connected, there are many wonderful things.
That's what we're gonna need to concentrate on ourselves in a quiet mind and work for it.
A few days ago, our country's famous poet Neeraj was trying.
poet Neeraj's specialty was hope, trust, strong imagination and confidence.
The poet Nierj can give us a lot of strength, inspiration to all Indians.
He wrote, "As soon as the blindness is removed, as soon as the breeze is burnt, the darkness will be removed."
July and August are very important for farmers and all the young people.
Because this is the time when 'Pic Session' for colleges.
Like truth, millions of young men go out of school and go to college.
February and March, the test, the question-written... and on April and May holidays, Result, the future life's direction and the career's choice.
July is the month when the young men moved on their own life, when the fountains moved from the Koschen to the cut-off.
The attention of the students goes from home to the hostel.
Students enter the "Presser" skull from the skulls.
I believe my young friends are very excited and happy about the beginning of college.
For the first time, get out of the house, get out of the village, get out of a safe environment and make yourself guide.
All these young men leave their homes and take life to a new way.
There's no way out of books, I need to study, but I need to continue to find out the little one.
Old friends are very worthy.
All the young men who go out of their homes, find out the place where they know about the people, language, culture.
I'm starting a new chapter... and I'm glad to the new ones.
His dad has been supposed to be the family's foolishness forever.
In that situation, I congratulate hopefully for this success.
There are so many sorrowful family students who have shown something about their hard work and attention in resistance, which inspire us all.
Like Delhi's Prince Kumar, whose father, D-T-C's buschelor, or Kolkata's poet, who studied under the light of the footpath, Afrien Shaikh, the daughter of Amedabad, whose father is Auto Chalan, the daughter of the schoolchildren of Nagpur, the son of Hariyana Chokidar, Kartik or the son of the magician of Jharkhand, Ramesh Sahu.
Since the birth of Gurgaon's responsibilities daughter Anushka Pand, the victims of hereditary diseases called Spanish Moscular Atopsy, all of them have achieved their strongest imagination and sympathy to show all the obstacles to the world.
Looking around us, we'll get so many examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives me strength, inspiration.
My beloved countrymen, a few days ago, I saw a news, in which I wrote, "Modi's dream was successful.
"When we read the information inside, we know how our youth is trying to change the life of ordinary people through the smart and creative usage of technology.
This was the case... once in America's 'Technology Hab' San Jos, I asked them when I was discussing with Indian youngsters, so they thought how to use their talents for India and did something out of time.
I called for Brain-Drain to replace Brain-Gain.
Two I-T professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Bajpayeeji, confessed to my challenge.
Using their professional skin Yogishji and Rajneeshji together made a 'smart village app ' .
This app is not just connecting the people of the village with the world, but now they'll get any information or information on their mobile.
This AP-A village's telephone directory, News Secson, Events List, Health Center, Normation Center.
This app works very much for the farmers, the App Fichar, the FACT rates in the Kisans are working in the market to sell their products.
Santoshji, thanks for your phone
It's really a wonderful festival in Puducherry.
Friends, an academy of sixty-six months, which was on July 23 this year, fled with the smiles of Pindharpur.
Pundharpur is a sacred city of Kolapur district of Maharashtra .
Like Santa Gyaneshwar and Santa Tukaram, the sages are kept in the palanquin and dancing in the name of the God of Bittal towards Pudharpur.
Bhagwan Bittal, who is also called Bithoba or Pandurang, has reached there for his sight.
Lord Bittal deserves the poor, helpless, the suffering.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana have great faith and devotion to this God.
You go to the Bithova temple in Pundharpur, there is a different experience of magnificence, beauty, spiritual happiness.
I request the craftsmen of the 'What' program, if the opportunity comes, you must get the experience of the renovation of Pindharpur.
Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram, such a number of monsters are still teaching ordinary people in Maharashtra.
Like Vood or Abhang, we've got advice from them of harmony, love and fraternity.
The society can fight with faith against blind faith, we get this mantra from here.
They have shown the right way to society at the right time, and it has ensured that the old curiosity of society is removed... with the idea of consciousness, patience and comfort among mankind.
Just like that was a great majesty, a folk kid who has put a deep impression in many Indians' minds.
We celebrate Tilkji's birth anniversary on 23rd July, and remind him of his devotion in an August 1.
Mankind Tilak was blessed with courage and confidence.
He had the power and intelligence to show the mistakes of the British rulers.
The British got so scared of the folk kid that he had complained of treason three or three times in a year.
I'm telling you about a specific thing about the idols that he has in mankind and Amedabad.
In October 1916, when Lokmanya Tilkji came to Amedabad, think more than forty thousand people were involved to welcome him 100 years ago.
After that the municipal corporation decided to establish a memorial of the great Tilak in the famous Victoria Garden described by the ueen of Ballabhwai Patel Briton .
Generally British rulers are very unsatisfactory about this and the artists there are often proposing to build a memorial named ' Smaru Hela ' .
But the surdar sir, he'll resign, but he'll leave the guy's memorable statue of Tilak.
Finally, on 28th February, 1929, inaugurating the statue that invited Mahatma Gandhi.
In that grandfather offerings, the worshipper said that only one person could not find as an Amedabad Pursubhasam Mayor, he got a power with which the statue of Tilak was established.
My beloved countrymen, this statue was established by the Sadar Patel, one of the specialities of this statue is that the people of Tilkaji are present here under this statue, "Swaraj is my birth rights."
The English had to hear this written as God's instructions.
The first public Ganesh Festival started in the industry of Lokmanya Tilak.
Even if the Cervical Ganesh festival grew rich in traditional faith and organisation, society became an effective medium to create awareness, unity, equality and sympathy.
Now, in the streets of a city, Ganesh Mandapa is seen.
All the families of that street together organise that Ganesha festival.
This is a unique opportunity to our youth, so they can achieve a special power like organisation and ladership and develop them in their own way.
My beloved countrymen, I said last time, I'm going to recall Lokmanya Tilakji, even now you celebrate the Ganesh festival with great fanfare but celebrate the festival.
From the idol of Ganesh, his decoration, worship materials are all environmental.
Who dedicated his life so that the countrymen can breathe in free India.
I'm talking about Chandrashekhar jokes.
There's none of the Nazoians in India who can't be inspired to hear this poem... .. . . .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .... ... ... .. .. .. .. ... .. .. .. ..
Chandrashekhar had inspired many youths to bravery and freedom.
Azad kept his life alive, but never lost his head before the foreign rule.
This is my privilege that there was a chance to go to Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once more, I'm telling two great children of India, Lokmanya Tilakji and Chandrashekhar Azadji, faithfully.
A few days ago, the junior Christian Christian Christianity in Finland has historicalized India's armoured daughter, Kishnakanaya Hima Das in a golden jinn at a 400 meter race in the world athletics champion.
The country's and one daughter's unity are terrifying my letters and e-mailing me from Indonesia, now there's preparing for Asian Games.
I'm writing the e-mail alone... who's in an athlete's life... when he shook the telescope and I'm proud that I showed it.
Oneness, we're all proud of you.
His success is because he has made his challenge through success.
In the road accident in 2003, the lower part of the body of the terrible integration, but the girl did not lose courage and strengthened herself.
I'm telling one voice, yogesh Katuniaji, beautiful Singhji for their courage and struggle. I'm greeting.
You better move, play, improve.
My beloved countrymen, many events of history for the past months, are full of events, but sometimes the diseases in the house for weather.
I'm very happy for all of you, for this past month, and for a hundred years of celebration, to wake up the inspiration of the nation.
I'm gonna be together again.
Thank you so much
My dear dear one, once again, you've been lucky to face all of you in this event of "What Watt".
A few days ago, there was a historic cricket match in Bangalore.
You may have realized that I'm talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
This was Afghanistan's first international test match, and the pride of all Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
In this match, two birds showed the best sports activity.
A leader of Afghanistan, Rashid Khan, played very well in the IP-AL this year, and I remember the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashrafgani, wrote to me in his Twitter: "The people of Afghanistan are very proud of taking their hero Rashid Khan.
I'll thank our Indian friends, who made a stage to show our players the sports activity.
The best of Afghanistan, Rashid represented him. "
He wrote a treasure in the cricket world, and he enjoyed it a little, "No, I don't want to give it to anyone."
This match must be memorable to all of us.
Though it was the first match, it's normal to remember, but I'll remember this match for one more thing.
The Indian team has done a job that is unprotected all over the world.
While taking the Indian team trophy, what could we do with a bidding team
While taking the Indian team trophy, Afghanistan team calls the first international match, invites them, and calls together.
What can happen to Spottsman Spirit and Spottsmanship, we can feel through this incident.
The best way to expose the sports society and find out the talents of our youth.
I don't like two teams from India and Afghanistan
My beloved countrymen, on June 21, there was a strange sight in the fourth guy.
Whether Brazil-European Parliament, the chief office of the United States in New York, the Japanese Navy's warship, people are working everywhere.
For the first time, the historic function of Yoga was held in the North Arabia, and I was told that many assignments were made by the Demonstration women.
India and China have joined together on the high peak of Ladakh.
If people from all over the world participate in the event of the Day of John with so much enthusiasm, why don't India have a lot of enthusiasm
Our warriors from the airspace have snatched everyone from the sky at a height of 15,000 feet.
It was worth seeing, they didn't sit in the winds, swimming in the air.
Schools, colleges, offices, parks, high houses or fields of sports, everywhere.
A scene in Amedabad was surprising, where around 750 biography of biography, together, collected the records.
I'm Mani, today's Yoga Equalness, Revolution works.
Wellness's attempt is being carried out by Yoga, I hope it's going forward.
Gradually, a lot of people will choose yoga as part of your life.
"Thank you for your phone.
Do you know, Kbirdasjiken went to Imghar
"He is the orthodox protector who can know the sorrows of others.
Those who don't understand others' sorrows, he's foolish.
Kabirdasji gave a special emphasis on social harmony.
"Bairi Koi Nehi in Jagam, which is cold.
Give me this pulp, please.
Kabirdasji says, "Are you sure you're a sinful sin.
His unprecedented sword shows the same effect even today, now when we talk about the whole poet Kabirdasji, we remember his fault.
"This is the greatness of the guru and the greatness of the guru, a guru of the world.
Who has guided millions of people to the truth, which has been inspiring humans from time to time.
In 2019, the 550th Lok Sabha festival of Guru Nanakdev will be celebrated.
It's a history that has been involved in Punjab.
In 2019, the terrible event of Jalianwala Bagh, which is going to be completed for 100 years, was the incident that ruined humanity.
On 13th April 1919, somebody has forgotten the black day when all the limits of insensitivity of power were shot on innocent, innocent and innocent ordinary people.
This miracle is going to be completed 100 years, but we'll always remember the holy message that this incident has given, that is, nothing can be solved through violence and harmony.
Peace, jealousy, sacrifice and sacrifice always conquer.
My beloved countryman, Delhi's Rohini, Sri Raman Kumar's Narendramodi, wrote on the phone app on July 6.
Ramanji, thank you very much first
It's nice to see your interest in history in India.
You know, last June 23, Dr.
It's probably a few people know, in 1937, Dr.
In the invitation of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore spoke in Bengal at the Conversion of the Kolkata University.
That was the first example when a person spoke in Bengal at the Convention of the University of Calcutta during the British regime.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first industrial minister of India and in a sense it was established the strong foundation of India's progress in the form of artistic and strategic forms of India, which stood on a strong foundation and stage.
In 1948, India's first industrialisation was based on its plan and far-reaching.
Dr.
Muazarzi's dream was that India would be self-sufficient, prosperous and prosperous in every field of art.
He wanted to focus on India's artistic art and with him on MSMEs, utensils, clothes and utensils.
He got the financing and organisation set up for the proper development of cotton arts and microscopes, because I'm all in 1950 from 1948.
Shama Prasad was a big contribution to Mukherjee.
He was very emotional about the progress of the West.
The West has been protected as part of India even today because of his thinking, misconception and activism.
Come on, we recall this oneness of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and let's try to move India through sympathy and fraternity.
My dear countrymen, I had a chance for the last few weeks to talk to all those people who have been benefited from the various plans of the government through video calls.
I got a chance to come out of the file and listen directly to the man's face.
People have told you about their imagination, happiness and sorrow.
I think it wasn't merely a government program, but it was another kind of Learning Experience... and what could be more fond of what I've seen in the face of the masses at this time
When I heard a common man, his simple words, simple funny, my feelings, it would touch the heart.
I knew how the girls from the remote remote village community center were helping the village's elderly, from the pension to the common man's passport.
A sister from Chhattisgarh is doing business of making icecreams from him, with hundreds of youngsters in the country like Ajan Prakash, going to the neighbouring villages and supplying medicines to the slopes.
The young man who was searching for a job two or three years ago in West Bengal, now he is not only running his business with success, he has done his job to 10-15 people.
In Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa, school students are working on important things like West Management at the school's technic lab.
There was a story of innumerable feelings, there was no corner of the country where there was no sign of success.
I am happy to think that through the success of the government in the entire program, the power of the common man, the power of the country and the country, the power of India's dream, the power of imagination.
There are some people in the society, unless they say that they don't talk about depression, they don't work for unbelief, they don't find ways to break instead of the throne, until they get peace.
In such an environment, when ordinary people talk about new hopes, new enthusiasm, their success is not the government.
A little girl from a small village in a remote corner also carries inspiration for 125 million people.
I'm grateful to the countrymen.
You've joined 40-40, 50-50 lakh people with this video bridge program and gave me a new power.
I'm thanking you once more.
Well, this smell is my feeling.
In fact, Bangalore's corporate professionals, the I-T engineers, together created a 'sufficient prosperity trast' and activated this trash to double the income of the farmers.
Through this trust, those who are connected to the farmers, have built plans and have been trying hard to increase the income of the farmers.
How can biological farming be done with the new methods of farming and how can other crops be flown immediately with a crop - all these trainings are being provided to the farmers with the help of these professionals, engineers and technologists.
Earlier, all the farmers who were dependent on only one crop, so that the crops would not have been good and not even profited, they are not only feeding much of the crops today, through this trace they are getting good profits.
The crop will be good when good species of seeds are used separately for this.
Women worked for this Seed Bank, and women are also connected to it.
My beloved countrymen, the GS-T facility is going to be completed for one year.
"One nation One Tax", which was the dream of the countrymen, was realized today.
If I have to cried to someone for this arrangement, then I'll give this creed to the kingdoms.
GST is a beautiful example of 'co-operative federalism', where all the states decided to keep in mind the welfare of the country together and that's why such a large tax reform system has been implemented in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GS-T Council have been held and we can proud that people of different political thoughts, representatives of different states and separate state representatives, have been elected to the GS-T Council till date.
There were 17 different types of taxes in the country before GST, but after the system was started, the same system is in the country.
After the GS-T came, check posts were closed and this increased the speed of transportation of products and other products, not only saved time, but also in the logistics areas.
J-S-T is probably the world's largest tax program.
In India, such a large Tax Reform has been successful because the people of the country have taken this facility, and this genetic power has ensured the success of GST.
It is generally believed that such a larger size program will take 5 to 7 years to be properly renovated in such a large country with a huge population.
But the excitement of the true countrymen, the flow of the country's satisfaction festival and the partition of the people's power is that within a year, this new tax system has built its own place, the situation has been achieved and is also revising itself through the necessary input system.
This is a great success, which has achieved 125 million people in the country.
What's the mind, May 2018
You must remember, a team of six women condenses from the Nestens has been traveling over the past few months.
Whose name is Nabika Sea Parikrama, I want to say something about it.
This six daughters of India returned to India on 21st May more than 250 days through 'I-A-S-V' Tarini, and the whole country has told them their warmth.
Several oceans and some seas have crossed about 22,000 nautical distances.
It's a strange thing all over the world.
Last Wednesday, I had a chance to meet these daughters, listen to their experiences.
I'm once more enjoying these daughters for adventurous work, to increase the fame of the Navy, to increase the honor of India, especially the daughters of India, not only in any part, but also to bring this message to the world.
You must have seen new information about Mount Everest-Jews in the last few days.
On 16th May, five tribal students from Chandrapur in Maharashtra will be drunk, Pramesh Ale, Umkata Madavi, Kavidas Katmod and Vikas Soum. They won the world's highest horn.
They start training in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Le Ladakh from the month of August of 1970.
They were chosen in "Mission Shaurya".
And they enjoyed the everest in the name of the country.
I'm intimately greetings to these little students of Chandrapur school.
The recently sixteen-year-old Shivangi reader has won Everest as the best Indian woman in Nepal.
Ajit Bajaz and his daughter Dia Everest won the first father-son's shoe.
Not just the young people are winning Everest, but on May 19, Srimati Sangeeta Behl also won Everest.
Some of the Everest climbers are those who are not just expert, feelings.
This work is very promising, just about the purity of the neighborhood... and the responsibilities of the environment.
I know all those brave heroes, especially the daughters.
A lot of people from different areas will come forward to support this thing.
In the context of "Fit I India", I believe we'll play as much as we play.
In social media, people are sharing videos of their Fitness Challenge, where others are checking and challenging them.
I believe it's a very good process and this kind of challenge encourages us to keep ourselves fit and others fit.
My beloved countrymen, you've heard something about playing games from me many times in 'Mann Ki Baat'.
"Chhobi Jadabji, thank you for your phone
These games were special parts of the summer holiday.
There are two traditional sports.
There's also outdoor and Indor.
One of our country's characteristics may be seen somewhere in these games.
The same game is known as different places.
It's playing on the Square board of 8 or 8, with bitch or brass.
Its name is Attu in Madhya Pradesh, in Kerala, Pakidakali again in Maharashtra, Champal in Tamil Nadu, Dayam in Tamil Nadu and Changpo in Rajasthan.
Even if the people of different states don't know each other's language, they're just watching the game
That's the game that is seen everywhere in the village.
That too... but it is known by different names across the country.
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gautilla or Karabilla.
In Orissa, it's called shooting, it's called Bittidalu in Maharashtra.
The traditional sports that helps our physical power to enhance our logical thinging, concentration, awakening, swelling.
And these are not just games, they teach us the values of life, stabilise our teaching goals, gain strength, create team spirits, help each other.
A few days ago, I saw that our traditional sports were involved in improving the development and interpretational skills of civilized personality in business management training programs.
At the same time, we are aware of our culture and tradition.
Some games make us aware of society, environment.
Now, school, neighborhood, youth should come forward and encourage these games.
We can build a museum for our heritage games through the CroudSourcing.
The video of this game can be made to show how to play the rules of the game.
Animation films can also be made so that our new generation can know about these games, play and grow, my dear countrymen
This time's theme "Beat Plastic Police".
We all make sure that we don't use Polythene, Low Grade plastic and the harmful impact of "Plastic Polyusion" on our nature, wild life and our health.
I'm asking you to see all the information from World Environment Day's website wedindia2018 to try to use it in my daily life.
It's fatal, wealth damaged.
All this is the result of the change in the first Weather Pattern.
Mahatma Gandhi has spoken this for his whole life.
India today speaks of Climate Justice, the COP has played a key role in the 21 and Paris deal, we have accomplished the whole world through the International Solar Alliance, a good idea to fulfill Mahatma Gandhi's dream behind all this.
On this day, we think we can do it to make this world more clean, more green.
How can I go further on this path, what can I innovate
The rain is coming.
Now we can plant trees in the records, not only planting, but also take care of them until the tree grows.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
Everyone remembers June 21, not just you-I, but the whole world remembers June 21.
The world is now celebrated as ' International Yoga Day ' on 21st June and it is universally recognized that preparations for this festival starts a few months earlier .
There is news that preparations are being made to celebrate June 21 as the International Yoga Day all over the world.
Encouraging courage that always saves us like a father.
Forgiveness makes us feel as if she feels her own child, mental peace becomes our permanent friend.
Bhartohari said, by doing regular yoga, truth is our child, pity, our foolishness, self-confidence, the world works to defuse our patience and knowledge.
When there is so much power, this yogi usually wins all kinds of fear.
Once more, I'm asking all the countrymen to take the great heritage of John and build a healthy, happy and equitable nation.
My dear countrymen, on 27th May, India's first Prime Minister, Pundit Jawaharlal Nehru's thrill day.
I'm punishing Punditji.
In the month of 1857, the Indians introduced the English to their power.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were inspired by wrongdoing.
Regrettably, we have been calling the 1857 incident as a rebellion or sepoy rebellion.
In fact, this incident wasn't just a little, it was an attempt to hurt our self-esteem.
This virgin Savarkar himself wrote that what happened in 1857 was no electric, but the first fight for freedom.
The virgins of London's India House collaborated with Savarkar with its fifty-fiveth Jittismaroh.
She was a servant of both clothes and scriptures.
Basically, hero Savarkar, known for his struggle against Bahaduri and British rule.
But apart from this, he was also a poet and a social reformer who always emphasized solidarity and unity.
We have a strange description of Savarkar-ji, our favorite, favourite Atal Bihari Bajpai-ji.
Savarkar poems and revolutions, both of them have been brought together.
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was a brave revolutionary.
Our daughters, who were once forced to quit the house-to-house from the slaughtering snakes of the evil ones who are quitting the jobs of salai today.
Our daughters, full of hope and faith, I know the goodwill of the future.
They have shown that if there is a jealousy of doing something and you are grateful for that, you'll get success in the troubles, and it's not just a sign, but you'll see it every corner of the Hindustan.
If you look around you, you'll see how people lose their problems.
You feel that whenever we go to a tea shop, there's tea and get satisfied, some people have discussions and discussions.
This discussion is also political, social, films are also about, games and players are about the country's problems - the problem will be solved in such a way, but most of the time this discussion is limited to discussion only.
He organizes education, health and food for all the children coming to school.
He kissed the darkness of their life.
"Tamso Mother Jyothigamy: "Who doesn't know this adultery, but he has shown it to keep the discovery.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and all over the country.
There will be a lot of guarantees around you.
There may be a lot of things.
Come on, let's take a positive psychology.
It's so hot in June that people wait for rain and look like a window in the sky.
Some time since today, people will wait for the moon.
To see the moon, it means to have a headache.
At the end of a month's fast at Ramadan, the celebration of the Christian festival is a symbol of the beginning.
I believe everybody will celebrate the Christmas, especially the children will have a good choice on this occasion.
I hope the celebrations of Christ will strengthen our bonds in society.
I don't love everyone too much.
My beloved countrymen, thanks to all of you.
What's the mind, April 2018
Recently, Australia was organized from 4th April to 15th April to 5th April.
71 countries of the world, including India, participated in it.
When such an event happens, thousands of players from all over the world participate in it, imagine how encouraging it could be

But I want to hear what I hear from these players.
The exhibition of India in the film games was very good, and it was accomplished.
Manika Batra has won all the medals in the event.
Manika Batra is the first Indian woman to bring India to personal Table Tennis.
The 15-year-old Indian shooter, Anish Bhanwala, has been named as the youngest player of India in golden jewellery.
In India's only sensible movie movies, you have won medals in 'Para Power Lifting'.
It's important for the games that women players have won most of the medals.
Whether Squash or boxing, or shooting, women's players showed their sympathy.
At the end of Badminton, two Indian players Sina Nehwal and P.
V.
The whole country has seen this game.
The players in Games have come from small towns from different parts of the country.
We've crossed a lot of obstacles and reached this place.

A few days ago, I saw that some young girls from Delhi are supposed to be unhealthy and unhealthy children, these young men started a funny program to teach Delhi's neighbours and kids.
Initially, they explained to the survivors of the streets and the little boys who worked... they were also involved in this developmental work.

Dear countrymen, I'm often listening, fighting for water will start next day.
Everyone says, but we don't have any responsibility
Water conservation is not a new thing for Indians.
It's not the point of reading the book, so there's no need to know any special language.
Our ancestors have seen it in the past.
They gave the most importance of every drop of water.
They made a new way to save every drop of water.
You'll see somebody going to Tamilnadu, there's a lot of temples where architectural systems, water supply systems, water surveillance, surveillance, etc. are available.
In the temples of Manarkovil , Chiran Mahadevi Kobilpatti and Pudukottai big scripts are seen .
Even today, many bourgeoisie is known as the step wells tourism area, but they really prove to be a brilliant proof of the water conservation of our ancestors.
You must go to Rajasthan to see the Moon Bauri of Jodhpur.
This is India's largest and most beautiful bourgeoisie, one thing we need to remember is the largest bourgeoisie in a place where the water is very fast.
April, May, June-July will be the best time for water conservation and the excellence of access to the water conservation.
We can spend the water supply facility from the Manrega budget.
In the last three years, there are many attempts for water conservation and water conservation.
About 32 thousand crores of rupees have been spent in the construction of water conservation and water conservation in ' Manrega ' budget every year.
I can say, "18, 55 per cent of 64 thousand crores, that is, 35 thousand crores of rupees have been spent in the work of water supply.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of agricultural hydroelectricity has benefited a lot through this water conservation and water supply.
About 40-45 villages have been working hard.
I'm gonna say, April, May, June, July and coming, we can take a lot of responsibility for water supply and water supply next day, we can take some plans and show some things.
My beloved countrymen, when it comes, there comes a lot of news from all around the country, letters come, calls.
But the people don't know anything about the Philosophy that can save the Normalpurskar BJTA with Rabindranath Tagore's Peaceful, Beautiful and Integrity.
Please, you'll talk about this in the 'What' ceremony, so that the common man can know it.
In his writings, he had a unique impression on all things, Rabindranath was a talented person, a strange imagination personality, but he could always feel a teacher inside him.
He wrote in Geetanjali, who has as the recognized as the responsibiliti to impart it to the students, i.e., he's responsible for knowing, and he's also responsible for asking students to share that knowledge.
The spirituality of keeping the light is that when a man is insistent, he can feel someone else's hungry.
When he's thirsty, he'll feel the others thirsty.
This is the time to recall the teachings and messages of the Peigmber Mohammad.
His life's teaching makes us comfortable and bravery.
Once I asked a pigmber, "What work is the best thing in Islam
"Peigmber said, "Anybody should feed the poor and the poor and the poor people, and maintain the sympathy with everyone without knowing.
"Peigmber Mahmoud was faithful in knowledge and cruelty.
He didn't care about anything.
He said, the jealousy fulfils the knowledge.
The Peigmber's gentlemen believed that if someone has more things than required, then you should give it to someone who needs it, that's why Rumzan has a special significance.
In this holy month, everybody gives donations to the poor.
Peigmber Mahmoud believed that the person's holy soul was not rich with him.
My beloved countrymen, Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We must be proud that India is the country of Lord Buddha, the idol of Karuna, service and sacrifice, which has guided millions of people in your world.
This intellectual reminds us of the great duty of the imagination and imagination of Lord Buddha and his way to show him.
Lord Buddha's motivation of patience, peace, patience and emotion.
This is the same human value, the most needed one in the world today.
Dad Saheb.
The Ambedakar was very strong to say that he had a great inspiration from Lord Buddha in his social philosophy.
He said, "My social filmsoffy may be said to conditioned in three words
"Whether the people of the country are involved, suffering, regretted or disinterested, the Father has strengthened the people of this region through the Constitution.
There can be no more examples of Karuna.
For human sufferings, this arrow of Lord Buddha was one of his greatest qualities.
We found all Asians in the inheritance of Lord Buddha.
In many countries of China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar etc., Buddha's traditions are associated with the teachings of Buddha, and that is why we are building the circumference of Buddhist tourism, which connects the important places of Southeast Asia with the special Buddhist regions of India.
For the whole world, I pray for blessings to the princes, so that we can fulfil our responsibility in the form of a peaceful and cruel world in his ideal.
Today we recall Lord Buddha, you will also listen to the statue of the Lafing Buddha, which says that the Lafing Buddha brings luck, but very little people know that this co-service is also associated with an important event in the history of India's safety.
Maybe you think that 'Lafing Buddha' and the forces of India can have any connection
You must remember, on May 11, 1998, 20 years ago, Tatkalin Prime Minister Shree Atalvihari Bajpayeeji had spoken to the countrymen who gave the whole of the country a message of pride and joy.
A new self-confidence was awakened by the Indians all over the world.
That day was Buddhapurnima.
On 11th May, 1998, atomic tests were carried out in Pokhran in the western part of India.
He's been completed twenty years, this test was done on the day of Buddha's blessings.
India's test was successful, and if one thing was to say, India was able to exhibit its strength in science and technology.
We can say that day is marked as a day of exhibition of his military power in history of India.
Lord Buddha showed the world that inner strength is necessary for peace.
In this way, when you can become strong as a country, you can live peacefully with everyone.
The month of May 1998, it is not important that atomic tests were carried out in that month, but the way it was possible is more important.
This incident showed the whole world that India had the potential of great scientists to reach new goals and heights in front of a strong leadership.
Autalvihari Bajpayeeji gave a mantra, "Jay Jawan Photogether Kisan Physics."
Today, when we are going to celebrate twenty-five years on 11th May 1998, we have to go to the modern India Garhwal with the mantras of Atalji 'Jay Science' that we have given for India's strength growth.
We have to make our strength part of India's power.
And then, seeing the journey that Atalji started, we can get a new joy, new tranquillity.
My beloved countrymen, "What's going to happen again, I'll talk more.
What is the mind, March 2018
On January 26, the representatives of the countries in the Asian community came here and brought together different cultural groups.
It's very proud that most of them have established 'Rayan' before us.
That is, not only in India, but also in the countries of the Asian clan in the world... the same inspiration and influence of Rama and Ramayana.
My dear countrymen, I've got a lot of letters, e-mails, phone calls and reports from you every time.
I read what MyGov wrote about the launch of 'Online Course' of Commol Cold Sanskrit.
I'm very glad to see this discipline of Sanskrit as well as being an infrastructure worker.
I told the Investigative Department to give you information about this.
I'm supposed to think about how to take this proposal of Commol Tucker forward, all the sources that are working with Sanskrit.
In 'Narendramodi App', I read the opinion of Shri Ghanshyam Kumar of Barak village of Nalanda district of Bihar.
It's really important that you've expressed the wrath in the geographical water level decreasing.
And the 'yellow land' can only be when we take care of every animal living in this land.
You've been asking for water for animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal-ji, you think I've reached all the cattle friends.
Mr. Yogesh Bhadresha says, I'm telling you something about the youth's health.
According to him, in comparison to other Asian countries, the youth of our country are physically weak.
A few days ago, the renowned president of France, Kashi, wrote Sri Pacific Kumar of Baransi, all the scenes of that journey touched her mind, ignoring her.
He expressed his interest, all those pictures should be published in the video social media.
Pacific-ji, the Indian government has shared all the pictures that day in the social media and "Narendramodi App".
Angha, I want to tell all the children like Josh that if all these letters are sent to them, my whole day's drunken, hard work flies.
All these letters, so many phone calls, sweethearts, all I can read, and there's a lot of things that touched my heart.
They wrote about their tests, describing the plans of the holidays, even in this summer, they thought of animals and birds.
The farmer's brothers and sisters have sent me letters about the work that is going on all over the country with 'Kishana Mela' and farming.
Some cautioned citizens have advised me about water supply.
We have a lot of letters about our culture and traditions in the season of the festival.
When I read your letters, I can know that Ahmed Ali, a recipient from Assam's Karimganj, has made nine schools for the poor children who are in their own will, the country's immense will.
When I hear Kahini, Dr. Ajit Mohn, a doctor from Kanpur, who roamed through the footpath and treated the brothers and sisters of the footpath and gave a free medication, pride to the sympathy and humanity of this country.
Ten years ago, due to lack of medical treatment, Kolkata's taxi driver Saidul Laskar's sister is killed.
That's how many inspired things lead to the identity of my country.
Today, we see Indians all over the world.
Today when the name of India is highly respected, the birth of children and children of this country remains hidden.
My dear countrymen, the farmers will be very important for their brothers and sisters for the next few months.
Because there's a lot of letters about farming.
This time I saw the video of the program that I discussed with farmers friends at the Doordarshan 'DD Kishan' channel, and I realized that the Doordarshan 'De Kishana' channel should be seen by all the farmers and should use agricultural advice in their own fields.
What if Mahatma Gandhi's words, or Shastriji, Lohiaji or the prince's singing, or the devil's goddess, were all considered to be an important part of this country's economy and life.
Sri Lalbahadur Shastri always gave importance to the protection of trees, plants, wilderness etc. and the requirements of the better agricultural process.
Dr. Ramamohur Lohia spoke of the public awareness of the best products for our farmers, better settlements and to ensure all these things and to increase food and milk production.
In 1979, Volunteer Charan Singh applied for the use of new technology and new discovery of the farmers in his speech, emphasizing the need.
Our Meghalaya farmers produced records in comparison to the last five years in 2015-16.
They've seen that if the goal is stable, there is complete self-confidence, if it's reproached, it's possible.
Today, the technicians have met with hard work.
This gives a lot of energy to the agricultural producers.
I saw the letter that came to me, many farmer friends wrote about the MSP and they want me to discuss it with them.
Brothers and sisters, this year, a big decision has been taken to give farmers the price of crops.
It's fixed that MSP for the specific crop, at least one and a half times the sex.
Besides, the farmers should pay for their crops, and the work on the Agricultural Marketing Reform in the country is going on.
The local market in the village, the pilot market in which the world is connected to the market, is underway.
Farmers will be involved in the APMC and e-NAM platform by upgrading the country's twenty-five thousand rural hot infrastructure to sell their production so that they don't have to go far away.
I mean, such arrangements are being made to concentrate on any market in the country from one-sided field.
My beloved countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi's celebrations will start every year.
How will the country celebrate this festival
Ask you, you'll share your thoughts with everyone through Mygov.
What can happen to the Logo of Gandhi 150
All the work related to health was already in charge of the Health Ministry.
Professional Health Care is very cheap and easy.
Everyone individual, family and society will be benefited from it as much as we're aware of the Preventive Health Care.
The first condition of keeping life healthy is clean.
Besides, it's going to work hard to create a health welfare center across the country.
Yoga has created a new identity in the world as "Preventive Health Care".
Yoga promises to be both healthy and powerful.
This is a consequence of all of us, that Yoga has grown up today as a public movement and has reached home.
This year ' International Yoga Day ' is not left for June 21 and 100 days .
In the last three 'International Yoga Day', all the people in every country and abroad participated with great enthusiasm.
Even now, we have to ensure that we join ourselves and encourage family members to join everyone.
In a new and intelligent form, children, young and adult people, men or women must be popularized.
The country's TV and electronic media are doing different functions.
But can you make awareness of yoga as an expedition from now on to ' Yoga Day '
My dear countrymen, I'm not a teacher of yogasans, but I'm yogwasi.
Some people have made me a teacher of yogasan through their own thoughts, and have made a three-di animated video of my yoga.
I want to share this video with you, so we can exercise asanas and pranayams together.
Whether health care is uninterrupted, in every possible way, sufficient efforts are being made for the people to get cheaper and easy.
Today, more than three thousand people's medicine centers have been opened in the entire country, where more than 800 medicines have been sold for less time.

A year ago, Dr. Ambedkar spoke of Indian art.
He thinks artism is a powerful medium, which will result in the income of the poorest man from the country's poverty.
Dr. Ambedakar dreamed: India would once be a powerful center of work.
Today, when McChinindia proceeds with an efficient success all over the country, his dream visibility is our inspiration.
India's position in world economy is now like a bright star, and the most foreign investment is that of FDI India.
Universalism is now looking at India because we are now becoming the center of investment and new tradition.
Dr. Ambedakar was deeply faithful in self-reliance and self-reliance.
Even a man in the country doesn't live in poverty, just like Dr. Ambedkar.
It would have been sure to believe that poverty cannot be distracted by the priests.
Today projects like 'Mudra Yojana', 'Start-up India', 'Stand-up India' are making youth-technicians in our country.
Like him, a far-reaching man said that the rivers and valleys would be partially working committees for water supply and use.
Today, the historical history of the country's waterways and ports has started.
The new ports and the old ports are being built on different seashores of India.
In the decade of the 1940s, when the World World World World Second, the Cold War between the two powerful powers and the trouble of the part of the country, Dr. Ambedakar imagined the spirit of India or India.
He knew the importance of Federalism or maternity system, and he felt that the centre and the kingdoms had to work together for the progress of the country.
Today, we have been dedicated to collaborative United States or cooperative federalism at every level of nation and state and competitive collaboration with the United States.
The most important thing is Dr. Ambedkar's inspiration to a number of people like me in the country's backward community.
The pictures of India are completely different: such a India that is of the Ambedakar who is poor, who is the following man.
The birth anniversary of Dr . Ambedkar is being arranged from 14th April to 5th May for 'Gram Swaraj Abhiyan' throughout the country.
The nationwide campaign will be in rural areas, poverty and social justice programs.
I'm supposed to request you to take part in this kind of expedition.
My dear countrymen, in a few days there are many festivals, Parban: Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Ester and Vaishali.
Remember the sacrifice and penance of Lord Mahavir.
The life and vision of Lord Mahavir, the propagator of Ahimsa, inspiration to us.
I know all the people of the country, Mahavir jyanti enjoys.
Once Ester came, we think that Jesus gave us the word of Christ, who wanted humanity to be peaceful, listened to equality, justice, pleasure and mercy.
Once again, I'll tell you a lot of good news about all the festivals that come to you
What is the mind, February 2018
We've seen that the colour of the sea looks blue, but we know from the daily experience of the people that there is no water.
Have we ever thought that the sea, the water becomes colorful
This question came to mind a young man in the 1920s.
This question was a great scientist in modern India.
When we talk about science, Bharat Ratna sir C.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for the best worker on the brief of light skating or radiation.
His discovery is known as "Raman Effect".
We celebrate every year 28th February as "General Science Day", because this day he discovered Light Skating, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind, scientists like Satendra Nath Bose, are the glorious of India.
The famous particle named Satyendra Nath Bose, was also named as Boson.
I had a chance to take part in a recent function in Mumbai... and I've got a function to inaugurate the "Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence".
It's very interesting to know what's going on in science.
With the artificial intelligence, it is helpful to create a bottom, butt and uncontrolled machine.
Nowadays, through self-florning, various machines are smuggling their intelligence.
Etechnology can be used to improve the lives of poor, vulnerable and helpless people.
In this ceremony of Artificial Intelligence, I wanted scientists to know what kind of artificial intelligence can be found to facilitate the lives of Brothers and sisters
Can we get better predictions about naturalism through artificial intelligence
Can the artificial intelligence simply facilitate the lack of health care
A few days ago, I used to go to the inauguration of the I Creat program in Gujarat's Amedabad with the Chief Minister of Israel.
There's a new young man said he's a digital instrument where if someone doesn't talk, he's got to be scared and you can talk like you can talk to a person you can talk to.
I think we can use artificial intelligence in many ways.
Science and technology Valuneutral.
You don't have the price.
Any machine we want to do.
But it depends on us how we want to work from the machine.
Tomselva Edison, the analyst of Light Bolb, has failed many times in his work.
Once he's asked about it, he said, "I have searched ten thousand ways to don't make lights," the orthodox addison made his inefficiency his strength.
In the event, it's a good luck that I've lived in Aurobindo's workplace today.
As a revolutionary, he challenges the British administration, fights against them, stands on their rule.
In this way, he replied about every life like a great sage, finding the answer and guiding humanity.
It's important to ask the truth again and again.
On the occasion of "National Science Day", I congratulate our scientists and all the people involved in science.
Friends, at the time of the contract, Disster has a lot of messages about this.
Srimanarbindra Singh from Pune sent his comments on 'Narendramodi Mobile App' on the auctional sep.
He wrote that the artillery and construction work in our country is not the best substantial.
If we are not aware of safety in everyday life , if we are unable to gain protection then it is even more difficult to ensure safety system during any major danger or adverse effect .
Most of the accidents will be seen if we quit natural misconceptions, but the consequences of our misconception.
If we are aware, if we take necessary rules, we can save our lives, we can save ourselves from a bigger accident.
Sometimes I noticed that there are several instructions for safety in the field, but that rule is not entirely sufficient.
My request is that all the municipalities, municipalities have a fire brigade, they can go to school at least once a week and drive to school students.
There will be two advantages: the habit of being careful and the new generation's boys can learn a lot.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority, that is, the NDMA, leads all over the country to overcome the misery.
A project called ' Apada Mithra ' has been started to give training to self-sacrifice in cyclone or wildlife districts .
Training and awareness are very important.
Till two-three years ago, Lu or Hit Wave... thousands of people die every year.
Since then, NDMA organises the Workshop on the Heat Wave encounter, drives to increase public awareness.
We've got good results in all the composite industry.
The number of deaths due to the intensity of the inflammation in the riots is almost 220.
From this it can be understood that if we give importance to safety then only we can stay safe .
I want to honor all of them, who are present at the scene of an accident and help the victims.
The number of such names - unknown heroes is not less .
In addition to the dangers - you are always in the Fireand Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Para-Military Force and armed forces, who rescued others from the danger of their lives.
A few days back this exercise that happens under the leadership of India - participating in India and other BI MSTEC countries i . . Bangladesh , Myanmar , Sri Lanka , Thailand , Bhutan and Nepal .
We all heard them many times.
But today if someone asks us on the plane, where is the thing, where the life jacket is, how to use it, etc. I'm sure nobody can answer it.
If we become aware of our safety then the security of society is also included in it .
My beloved countrymen, this time's budget was emphasized on the production of Wasteto Wealth and Vasteto Energy through biogas in the village.
For this efforts have started and its name has been given ' GOBAR Dhan ' i . . Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Research ' .
The objective of this GOBAR Dhan plan is to clean up the villages and to create income and energy from it by converting the remaining defects in the fields after the cattle and cultivation of animals and animals into compounds and Bio-gas.
Any European country and knew the boar of animals and other biological eventually used to create energy.
But in India it wasn't being fully used.
In the ' Mission Village ' project of clean India we are moving towards this direction respectively .
The goal of making use of bio-agas dependent energy products has been determined for the bouquet of animal bouquet , ruins after agriculture , defects of kitchens .
Through the ' Govar - wealth ' plan the encouragement of rural farmers , rural brothers and sisters of rural India will be given so that they see Goans and vegetables not only in the form of infestation but also as the source of life .
The use of biogas to cook and power generation will increase selfishness.
This facility will help to increase the income of farmers and animal husbandry.
There will be a chance of new programmes in areas like Vastecolation, Transpartation, Bio-Gas sales.
To activate the ' Govar Dhan ' project properly , an ' Online Trading platform ' will be built , which will connect the farmers with buyers so that farmers get the right price of Goar and agriculturuvaste i . . agricultural leaflets .
I'll request encouragers, especially the sisters living in the village, to come forward and create self-help groups, organize the cooperative committee to fully use this opportunity.
I'm inviting you, come on, you also join the movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs... to change your village's insects into wealth and to make cow money from Goa.
But we came to know of an unusual attempt in Raipur of Chhattisgarh , and that is , the first ' Barjya Mahotsav ' organised in this state .
The purpose of this magnificence organised by Raipur city was to increase awareness about cleanliness , to create awareness about the various methods of ' creatives ' of the city's powerful substances and to reuse the garbage.
In order to exhibit the importance of energy management and cleanliness in this museum , I am very happy to the people of Raipur city , entire Chhattisgarh and the government and administration there .
The International Women's Day is celebrated every year on 8-east.
Several kinds of events are held in the country and the world .
That day through the award of ' women ' power prize ' in the country all those women are honored , who have done incomparable work in various cases in the last few days .
Today the country is moving towards the leadership of women leaving women development .
Today at this moment my husband seems to be a queen of Vivekananda .
Independents . This thought of Swamiji , a hundred fifteen years ago , shows the feelings of women in Indian culture .
Today it is the duty of all of us to ensure equal partnership of women in every social , financial life .
Today our women's power has introduced self-confidence and self-confidence through their work.
They were moving ahead , along with taking the country and society forward and taking them to a new height .
Finally this is the dream of our new India , where women are equally participants in the powerful , powerful and strategic development of the country .
A few days ago, a person gave me a great advice.
He suggested that on 8 . March , the women 's day there are various kinds of events in the festival but what programs can be organised to honor those mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village .
This number is not small. Only 15 lakh women have been organised and a month has been running the cleaning mission.
In this campaign starting from 26 January , 1971 , in just 20 days , these women established a new example by making 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets .
14 lakh women , 2 thousand women Panchayat representative , 29 thousand water friends meaning water friends , 10 thousand women , clean women and 50 thousand women .
You can imagine how big it is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women 's power , clean India campaign is such a power , which will make the pursuit of cleansing in everyday life in the form of a common man with force .
Brothers and sisters, just two days ago, I saw in New Jewel that Elephanta reached the three villages of the island seventy years after Independence and showed so much joy and enthusiasm among the people there.
You know that Elephanta island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai.
This is an important tourist destination.
I feel strange to know that even if it is near Mumbai and there is such a big center of tourism, there is no power in Elephant even after so many years of independence.
For seventy years, three villages of Eliphanta Island - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Senthbandar, the darkness that was spreading in the lives of the people there, all this darkness was removed and their life was surprising.
I'm greeting the administration and the people there.
I'm glad that Elephant's village and Elephant's cave will be lighted in electricity.
This is not just a power, but a new beginning to develop.
My loved brothers and sisters, a few days ago, we celebrated Shibratri.
The importance of the color of the Hollywoods is that of the Hollywood burning the evil into the fire on this day.
On the day of Holi, sit together in all the memories, enjoy each other's happiness, joy, a beautiful moment and a compassion for love, unity and fame.
My dear countrymen, thank you so much
And two days earlier we celebrated the General Institution Day in Somnath .
In history it was first that the top leadership of the ten countries was present at that festival .
My beloved countrymen , Sri Prakash Tripathy has written a long letter to me at ' Narendra Modi Ape ' today , he expressed his wish , I touched the topics of his letter .
He wrote, Paula French Foreign Minister imagined the death day.
In Calmbia aeroplane accident he has taken us away from us but the millions of young people of the world have been implanted .
I'm grateful to Brother Prakashji for starting his long letter with the statistics of imagination.
If there is desire and strong promise , if you are happy to show something , nothing is impossible .
In the creation of different parts of the boys many scholars of the country have achieved a great contribution .
Lopaamudra, Gargie, don't know how many names
Today we talk of ' Save Batty ' , Beti reading ' but hundreds of years ago in our scriptures , Skandhpuran it has been said that we are synonymous , synonymous , synonymous .
That is why women in our society are feeling importance .
And that is why, in our society, women have been given the honor of strength.
This woman power keeps the whole country , all the society , family in unity .
Sri Prakash Tripathy has taken many more examples after this .
He wrote , our adventurous defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman's 'Sukhoi-30' warfare will inspire him.
Three adventurous women think Kanth , Mohan Singh and Avani have become the driver of the four-wheeler war flights at present they are training to run the ' Sukhoi-30 ' war plane .
Today there are many such areas where women are staying before everyone . Our women 's power is showing something or the other .
It has also been joined in the form of ' I-book ' on the Narendra Modi website .
Today women have an important contribution even in the ongoing historical changes of the country and society .
Today, when we're discussing women's power, I'd like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women's powers maybe you think there's a connection between them
Matunga station of Mumbai is the first such railway station of India where all level workers are women .
Women workers in all the departments.
He may be a commercial department, a railway cop, a ticket supervisor, announcing people, more than forty women workers, including point porson.
Today our male power is giving leadership from the front .
When the tribal women talk , everybody knows that a picture comes out , there will be jungles , the hearts of the mountains will be there , there will be an eye view of the children moving forward .
But in Chhattisgarh our tribal women , our male power has made a new picture in front of the country .
The Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh which is among the Maoist-affected areas .
Hingsa , atrocities , bombs , guns , pistol painters have made a terrible environment there .
Adivasi women living in such a fatal state are making their self-confidence by running ' I-rixa ' .
In a very short time all the women there have become partners of this process .
On one side as they are making their capacity through self-confidence , along with this they are also changing the pictures of the Maoist-affected areas .
And along with this special strength is also possible in the work of environment conservation along with everything .
I am also appreciating the district administration there . from giving training to the district administration is playing an important role in the success of these women .
We're hearing again and again, people say, "There's something that doesn't lose our existence."
Whatever negative negative negative negative negative negative neglects, describe what is necessary for its reform.
And the speciality of our society is to keep a continuous process of social reform .
The identity of any living society remains in the process of its self-confidence .
Several centuries of universal efforts against social misconception , misconception are going on continuously in our country personally and socially .
Through this campaign attempts are made to create awareness against social curse like child marriage and panaprath .
He was embraced in the state in connection with fighting against evil registrations like Panprath and Bala vineyard .
The youngsters , mothers and sisters filled with childhood , old age , enthusiasm and wrath have quieted themselves in this fight .
Starting from the historical Gandhi Maidan of Patna , this human range continued to mix up to the border of the state .
In order to divide all the people of the society into the development process of reality it is necessary to be free of this kind of negative situation .
Come let us all recommend together to remove such misconceptions from the society and build a new India , a powerful and capable India .
I am applauding the people of Bihar , the chief minister of state , the rulers of the state , every person in the human range for the departure of such special and comprehensive matters with the goal of social welfare .
My favorite natives , Sri Darshan from Mysore in Karnataka wrote in ' My Govt ' , for the treatment of his father every year six thousand rupees would be spent .
He was not initially aware of the Prime Minister 's John Medicine Scheme .
But as soon as he was able to know about the disease center , from there on getting the medicine the price decreased up to fifty percent .
He expressed his desire , as if I spoke about this while talking to the mind , so that a lot of people get information about it .
Since last few days many people have written me about this .
I have also seen many videos , social media as well as those who are taking the facility of this plan .
And when I know such things, I'm very happy.
Have a deep sweetness .
And I also liked that this feeling came in the mind of Shri Darshanji , the facilities he had received , as if others were also found .
Because of this the common man , especially the person who is forced to take medicines everyday , is getting financially benefitted .
The life-saving medicines bought from here are prepared according to the standard of the World Health Organisation .
This is the root cause of getting good quality medicines cheaply .
Today more than three thousand public medicine centers have been established in Deshjura .
Not only medicines are getting cheaper in these but also for private industries a new chance of daily routine has been created .
The prime minister is available in the Indian public medicine center and hospital ' Amrit Stores ' cheap medicines .
The only purpose behind this is to provide health services of quality and strategic value to the poor person from the poor of the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be formed .
My beloved countrymen have shared a picture from Maharashtra in Shri Mangesh ' Narendra Modi Ape ' .
That picture was such that my attention gets attracted towards that picture .
This picture was , a grandson joined his grandfather with ' Clin Morna River ' in the Safai campaign .
I got to know that the citizens of Akola had organised cleanliness campaign to clean the Morna river through ' Swachh Bharat Abhiyan ' .
The Morna river used to flow only twelve months earlier , but now that weather is dependent .
The second thing of sadness is that the river was filled with narrow grass and snakes .
The rivers and its surroundings were getting frustrated in abundance .
That is why an action plan is created by engaging and one day before Makar - Sanskrit , at the first stage of ' Mission Clin Morna ' at four kilometres in the area of fourteen kilometres on the banks of the Mornna river two shores are made .
Even on 20 January this cleaning hydroelectricity is carried out in the same way and I am told that till the Morana river is completely clean , this campaign will be going on every Saturday morning .
Through this it is understood that if man takes stable sympathy to do something then nothing is impossible .
It is possible to bring a lot of big changes through genetic movement .
I know all the citizens connected to the people of Akol , the administration of the district and the ancestors of the region , to make this work as public envy , you know this effort very much enjoyment .
You have also heard many discussions about my favorite countrymen , Idaning Padma-Purskar .
Discussions have attracted attention towards this in the news paper and TV .
But if you see the matter with little care then it will be proud of you , because of what kind of great human beings are among us and naturally it will also be proud of how today the normal humans of our country are reaching this height without any supervision .
Every year there is tradition of giving Padma-purskara but in the last three years its entire process has changed .
Now any citizen can choose any person .
Due to the complete process being online cleansing has come in it .
It is said that the selection process of this award has changed completely .
All such persons have been given pucca - pucca which are not seen in big cities , newspapers , TVs , programs .
Now there is no identity of the person in the field of award , the importance of his work is increasing .
You might have heard about Sri Aurobindo Gupta.
He is making sports from the things that have been thrown for four decades so that the child can increase the confusion towards science .
His efforts are that small people in which from useless things towards scientific experiments .
For this on going to three thousand schools of different regions of the country , watching the films made in 18 languages , the young people are being implanted .
One such story is of Sitawa Jodhati of Karnataka .
He is not called the goddess of ' Mohila power ' .
For the last three decades in Belgaum he has done great work for changing life of innumerable women .
He had dedicated himself as a goddess only at the age of seven years but then he joined his entire life for the welfare of the goddesses .
Not only this , he also worked wonderful for the welfare of the team women .
You can stay on hearing the name of Bhajjhu Shyam of Madhya Pradesh . Shriman Bhajjhu Shyam was born in a very poor family , tribal family .
He used to do a small job for life saving but he had the desire to make traditional tribal paintings .
Today he is honored not only in India but also in the entire prophet .
His pictures have been displayed in many countries like Netherlands , Germany , England , Italy .
The statue of Bhajjhu Shamji shining the name of India abroad has been accepted and it has been given the Padmasri honor .
You will be surprised to hear the story of the tribal woman Laxmikutti of Kerala .
Laxmikutti teaches in the area of Kollar and still in the jungles of tribal areas in the midst of shadow huts .
He has prepared five hundred sweet medicines depending on his memory .
He has the skill of making medicines of snake bites .
Lakshmiji has been served every person from his knowledge about this herbal medicine .
Marking this unknowing personality he was honored with Padmasri for his participation in the society .
Today we are keen to mention another name . West Bengal has also been laid for the reward of the supreme mistry of sixty and seventy years .
Subhasini Mistry is such a woman who has eaten utensils in the house of other people to make the hospital sell vegetables .
When he was thirty years old , his husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident implanted him to make him a hospital for poor people .
Today in the hospital built by his hard work thousands of poor people are being treated freely .
I'm sure we have many sorts of sorts of sorcerers, women and women, who don't know, don't know.
Sometimes in schools , colleges such people should come to know their experiences .
There should be some effort outside the award to the society also .
My dear countrymen , every year on 9 January we celebrate Pravasi Indian Day .
This is the day on which worshipped Mahatma Gandhi had returned to India from South Africa .
Today we celebrate the festivals of Atut Bandhan among Indians living in different parts of India and the world .
This year on the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas we organised a function , where the invitations of all Indian genetics and fairs living in different countries of the world were invited .
You will be happy to know that in this program Indian genetic cultural and fair has been joined with Malayalam , New ealand , Switzerland , Portugal , Mauritius , Fiji , Tanzania , Kenya , Canada , Britain , Surinam , South Africa , America and many other countries .
Our Indian genetic people who are living in different countries of Europe working with the protection of the community , some are associated with Ayurveda , some are enjoying the mind of society through music or poetry .
I would like to thank the European Union for this explicit work , to give the acceptance of Indian genetic people and to tell the people of the world through them .
On thrice January , the renowned Bapur Punya - thithi , who had given us a new way .
These were not just basic elements .
Even at present we can see in every step how appropriate the message of the father was .
If we imagine that we can walk on the way to the father's side, what can be more than that if we do
My dear countrymen , I finish telling you all about two thousand eighteen years of good wishes .
Namaskara .
What's the mind, December.
This is the last festival of the year, and what a strange concentration, the last day of the year of 2017.
This year, I have shared a lot of things with you for almost a year.
Is this a wonderful letter written to you in the 'What' ceremony, the comments and the maternal grandfather always fill me with a new emotion.
And just a few hours later, we'll change the year, but this significance of our message will continue.
In the last New Year, we'll talk a lot more new, we share a new experience.
Your father knows the new year, a lot of enjoyment and greetings in the year of 1981.
Just a few days ago, the celebration of the Palit Hall Christmas.
Even all over India, this festival is celebrated with great joy.
At this time of Christmas, we think of Jesus' teaching and advice, and the most emphasis on Jesus' speech is to serve.
This service is also observed in the interview.
Ramkrishna Paramhanshedev has also said that Shiva is serving lives in knowledge and human values are all over the world.
Dear countrymen, this year was Guru Govind Singh-ji's 350th Prakash festival.
On the other hand, the Guru, the poet, the philosopher, the great warrior... all these sorts of poets have consistent inspiration to man.
Injustice and injustice have been surpassed against oppression, and has shown a way to get rid of the bonds of caste and religion.
And in this effort, though he had lost a lot in his personal life, but he never gave up his mind.
Every minute of his life was full of love, sacrifice and peace.
Come on, we're committed to the teaching of Guru Govind Singh and his great life, and we'll inspire his ideal in our life.
You must be surprised to think that the new year comes every time and Pailajanuari comes every time, what's going on with it
The whole of India is waiting for you to be grateful to the one-fourth century.
You're very proud of yourself.
The greatest power of supremacy.
Because, remember, you can also play an important role in the creation of one and a half centuries of India and it will start from Pailajanuari.
On this occasion of "What," I wanted to convey the power of a strong youth, full of life from 18 to 25 years of trumpet.
I believe it will be the dream of our New I India, filling up the skills and strength of this life-style full of life.
The new India we have spoken of the next day is racism, patriotism, hatred and hatred-free India.
Uncleanness and poverty free India.
New India, whose wheels will be strength, unity and harmony.
Turn a way for yourself, connect those you are connected to, and let's go, if you are rich in this way.
Think how do we plan before 2022
Mahatma Gandhi gave rise to the movement of freedom.
My young men, this is the claim of this time that we also give the dream of a variety of magnificent, prosperous India into a movement.
Today, there's a lot of chance for young people.
From Skill Development to Enovation and Enterpreneurship, our young men are coming forward and successful.
I'm gonna want to think about how to find out all these options in this "New India Youth" in one place, and create an arrangement about it, as soon as the sixty-eight years of age is finished, he can easily deal with this world, and in such a situation, he can get the necessary benefit.
Dear Desperate, I talked to you about the IPGTV in the earlier "Man Ki Baat" ceremony.
Nothing is impossible for a person with positivity and enthusiasm.
Even in English, everyone says - Pasimism Leedstu Wickness, Optimism to Power.
I had previously asked for the 'Man Ki Baat' program to share his positive moments in 1947 and welcome him in a positive atomsphere.
I'm very happy that the Social Media platform, "Megv" and "Narendramodi App" shared the most positive responsibilities of humanity.
Lacs of millions of people with the "Petition India Hashtag" have reached more than one and a half million people.
The transition of the PGTV, which has started in India, is spread all over the world.
The Towet Orespence that came was really inspiring.
It was a pleasure.
Some of the countrymen discussed the events that had a specific impact on the events this year.
Some people have shared their personal achievements.
 My name is Minu Bhatia.
I stay in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Fase One, Delhi.
 My name increases Joti Rajendra.
And he dies in an accident.
We know what happened to us at that time.
We were very beneficial with this help from the government, and we managed to take care of the situation.
 I'm gonna smell my name.
By our village, the National Highway was built in 1997 from different villages.
Two incidents that our Indian soldiers have done - one of the surgical strikes of the Pakistanis that destroyed the Ugpantha lunching pads and immediately docked our Indian soldiers to test the expedition.
 My name is not Satis Baiwani.
Over the past forty years, there was a problem of water in our area, depending on the pipelines built for the army.
Now we have a pipeline.
So in 1997, it won't be our big one.
Likewise, there's a lot of people who work at their own level so that many people's lifestyle changes.
In fact, this is the New India that we are building together.
Come on, we enter in 1971 with all these little joys, start the new year and take a firm step on the goal of 'Puzitive India'.
When we're all talking about PGTV, I'm gonna have to share one thing.
I've been able to know about Tupar Anjum Bashir Khan Khan Khatk's inspirationary jewelry.
He came out of hatred and hatred and topped the test of Kashmir's Administrative Service.
You must know that in 1990, the prostitutions burned his native house.
There was so much that Hingsa and Ugrepantha had to leave their family in their paternal house.
The hungry climate around a little child was enough for blindness and tiredness in the heart - but the strangeness didn't let it happen.
He never left hope.
Today, he is not only in Jammu and Kashmir but also inspired the youth from all over the country.
Anjum proves that whatever the situation is bad, the clouds of depression can be destroyed through elegant work.
This weekend, I've been in touch with some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
As long as I've done with those daughters, I have inspiration from myself and this is the strength of the country, this is our youth, this is the future of my country.
My beloved countrymen, only in our country, whenever the world's famous religious places are discussed, it's very natural to have the foundations of all the temples in Kerala.
In this world famous temple, millions of faithful people are present there every year in the blessings of Lord Ayappa.
Where there is such a large number of faithful people, where there is such a great significance in the place, how big challenge can the cleansing system be
And especially in the mountains and jungles.
P.
A police officer named Vijayan started a program called 'Punyam Punkavnam' and started a clean campaign to increase awareness about cleanliness.
He's a pilgrimage until he works for cleanness, his entire journey will not be completed.
There's no small difference in this campaign.
Every pilgrimage is part of the worship of God in some way or the other part of the cleaning of the pilgrimage.
Every morning there is a strange scene of this safai and every pilgrimage takes place in it.
He can be a celebrity or a rich man, or a big officer, or a great pilgrimage - everybody participates in the function of Purniam Punkavnam and he has to go on to work.
The countrymen have many examples.
This cleaning expedition was carried forward in Sabarimala, the Punyam Punkavnam succeeded and the Savith Yatra took part in it.
And we swear that when Bapur is 150th birth anniversary, we'll do something to give him a clean India gift.
Efforts are being made at a relative level all over the country for cleaning.
A large number of people are participating everywhere in rural and urban areas, and changes are being targeted.
To examine the progress of cleanliness at the city level, the world's largest server will be organized from 4th January to 10th March next year.
This work will be done among about forty million people in more than four thousand cities.
Pleasure app will analysis for use and reconciliation of the service sector.
It'll be seen today that every man in the city is involved in the process of cleansing the city and it changes into the habits of the city.
My beloved countrymen, something seems to be very small in sight, but it becomes far away in a society.
Today I'm referring to a similar incident in this program.
After decades, is this injustice to tens of Muslim women
Well, the Muslim women of our country don't give her the right.
I'm very happy, our government has taken care of it.
Our Minister of Minority Affairs has taken necessary steps in this regard and has changed this 70-year-old tradition.
Today, a Muslim woman can go to digest without the maharam and I love that now about 1300 Muslim women have asked for the release of the maharam and from different parts of the country - Muslim women from all parts of the north India - have expressed their desire to get lost.
I suggested to the numbering technological militia that women who want to go to Haj alone, as if they got permission.
We'll try to get equal rights like our women, and get equal chances to take part in the way of progress.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, a historic day of our country.
But on 26th January, 2018, we have to pay special attention.
It never happened before in India's history.
The year of 1970 was known for the Irish countries and India.
' Asian ' completed fifty years and 25 years of India's collusion with the countrys of Sulsian-earch countries.
It is very proud to us to meet the ten great leaders of the world on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, this is the climate of the festival, although our country is a miraculous country.
Perhaps there's no such day, that day there's no pride.
We've been following Christmas recently, and the new year is coming forward.
New year brings happiness, prosperity and happiness to all of you.
We all proceed with new industries, new incentives, new hopes and imagination and nations.
The sun rises in the month of January, and the song makar Sankranti is celebrated.
It's a tradition of nature.
On one hand, every parable is connected to the natural territory, but the way to pursue these instruments of nature in our culture full of specificity.
All these birds flee from 13 to 17 January.
The name of this mountain is different but its depths are the mixture of nature and agriculture.
I'm glad to all the natives for all the changes.
Once again, you've enjoyed everyone in New Year 1981
What's the mind, September 2019
There's probably no one in India who doesn't remember him either or honor him.
He's a testimony to all of us and a testimony to various events in the country.
This 28th September he completed the ninth year.
I'm so lucky to talk to the wizard on my phone.
This narrative was exactly the same as a younger brother spoke to his elder sister with a very fool.
Latadi, please.
I'm talking about Narendra Modi.
Peace.
I called for this because now on your birthday I'll be busy on the airways.
I'm late on 28th night, and even on 29th morning, you'll get out of your birthday.
Okay, okay.
Lataji: The age is very big, but the blessings of those who grow up with their work are very big.
Yeah, but I think that's my parents' blessings and blessings of all the cattle.
Modiji:..
I'm so glad when you proudly said your mother was 'gujratti'...
No, I don't want to hurt you more because I can see you and know how much work and how much you work.
How much we have to think.
When you brought your mother's daughter-in-law, I sent a man to her, to take her blessings.
My mother was very happy to see your love.
Once more, I'm very happy about your birthday.
But I was so busy that I couldn't get up.
Yeah, yeah, of course.
My beloved countrymen, with the Navaratri, the fasting of the festival will once again be filled with new incentives and imagination.
Speak to the season of the festival
For the next few weeks, the festival will be joyful and exciting.
The house will be filled with happiness.
But you must have seen there are many people around us who are devoted to this festival.
And he says, "Blindness under the lap."
Maybe this prophet is not just talking, it's an instruction, a vision, an inspiration for us.
Think, some rooms are light on one side.
On the other hand, in front of him, some people lay dark in the house.
In some houses the sweets are destroyed, and in some houses the children are sweet.
At least, more or unnecessary things than homes can be delivered out.
In many cities, the startups of young friends of ENGO are doing this.
They collect people from their homes, dress, sweets, food, and then find out the victims and get them to the stuff.
Can we sleep that darkness under the lamp with complete awareness and imagination in this season of the festival
Lakshmi is welcomed in the tradition.
In our culture, girls are considered as Lakshmi, because girls bring luck and prosperity.
This year, can we have a public work to honor girls in our society, villages, cities
Can we keep the work of honoring all these sympathies of India in this island
There are many daughters around us, a lot of wives who are doing a good job.
Somebody is working to read poor kids, someone is making awareness about cleanliness and health, someone is serving the society through doctor-injinia, and is trying to get somebody wrong.
Our society will be proud of these girls' acceptance and respect.
Well, the work of honoring them is in the country.
One more thing you can do is share the more in social media about the credit of these girls and use "Hashtagbharatkilaxmi".
Like we all had a big campaign called 'Selfie With Doter', which spread all over the world.
My beloved countryman, I have already said in the 'Mann Watt' program, a funny advantage of this is that I'm lucky to talk to a number of people unknown or indirectly.
A few days ago, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, Alina Tyang, sent me a very attractive letter.
I'm Roeing, in Arunachal Pradesh.
I'm very nice to read, I think it would be very useful for me to fall before the work test.
I liked a lot of this book, but I also noticed that students have a lot of suggestions in this book, but there is nothing in this book for readers and teachers.
Then see, my young friends also have the confidence that the country's leading servant will have to talk about something.
My little student friend, thank you for writing letters first.
Thank you for reading Ekzam Warriors two or three times.
If I can take time for new versions, I'll surely try to talk to the readers and teachers.
But I'll put a request to all of you.
Can you help me
I must consider them.
I'm gonna think about it and I'm gonna try to write in my own language.
It may be, if your advice comes in large numbers, I'll be sure of my new version.
So I'll wait for your opinion.
We'll thank our little student friend Arunachal Alina Tyong again.
My dear countrymen, you know about the works of the Prime Minister of the country through TV, through the news papers, and talk about busyness.
But you know I'm a common man like you.
I've heard that statement and I saw the match.
Twenty-three-year-old Donald Mediterranean's synthesis and feelings are like impressing everyone.
I must have been affected.
Shortly before that folk, he was finalized 19 times by Grandslam winner and Tension's Legend Raphael Nadal.
In that situation someone else would have been sorry and disappointed.
He praised his opponent after losing the final after the hard encounter and established a glowing pattern of Sportsman Spirit.
On the other hand, Champion Nadal also praised Daniel's game.
In the same match, the defeated players' morale and the victorious use of the players are both learned.
If you don't listen to Daniel Mediav's speech, I'll request everyone, especially the youth, to see the video.
It has to learn a lot of things for every age, every situation.
Even the moment that grows up to Har-jeet, all this moment teaches us, Har-jeet really doesn't mean.
My beloved countrymen, especially my young men, just for your good what I'm saying.
Tark-Birk, it's going on, but it's necessary to solve the problem before it's adjusted.
Otherwise the problem takes a bigger and it becomes a toxic thing to solve it.
If we're aware of the root, we can save a lot.
I think I must tell you something about a need for my young friends.
We all know how dangerous the drug of tobacco is for health and it is difficult to stop it once it becomes desperate.
Tomatocheronicotine is intoxicating.
In childhood, the development of brain is also damaged by the intake of this tobacco.
We all know these things, but today I want to tell you about a new thing.
You know, the recently prohibited India-Cigarette.
A separate e-cigarette from ordinary cigarette is an electronic equipment.
A kind of chemical smoke is produced by heating liquid substances with necotine in e-cigarette, through which necotine enters the body.
We know about the danger of ordinary cigarettes, but there's a misunderstanding idea about e-cigarettes that it is not harmful.
The smell like ordinary cigarette is not used, so it uses aromatic chemical.
We're sure he tried in a family even in a father's chain smoker that none of the family smokes.
And the little cigarette of Chenwari, stay away from the bird.
There's no smoke about the cigarette, those who are selling, buying or seeing, they all know that the cigarette is harmful.
But the e-cigarette is completely different.
There's very little awareness about this.
The ordinary man doesn't know about the harmful aspect of the e-cigarette and this is why the transparent-cigarette is in the house.
For many times, children in front of their parents are showing magic games, without fire, smoke out of their mouths, eating e-cigarettes, and the elders handle them.
You know, we can understand the smell when someone's eating cigarettes around us.
Even cigarette packets can be understood through smell.
But it doesn't happen to the e-cigarette, young people know, unknowingly, or in the Fashion Statementhes, they rotate it in their bags, middle of the books or in their hands.
Young power is the future of our country.
Responsibility on e-cigarettes has been imposed so that this new instrument of intoxication does not blame our country, not destroying the dreams of the family, not destroying the lives of the children.
Anyway, this drug disease cannot snatch into society.
I'll ask all of you to abandon the smoke and stop suppressing any confusion about the e-cigarette.
You must remember Fit India.
"Fit India" means but it's not just going to gym twice in the morning and evening.
The name of saving from all these misunderstandings, but Fit India.
I believe you don't feel bad about me, but you don't feel good.
My beloved brothers and sisters, it's very lucky to us that India has given birth to all the great personalities, not for themselves, but for others.
Our India, our fools are very nice.
Many human jewels have gifted this country.
One such humanity is being honored at Vatican City on October 13, which is a matter of pride to all our country.
That day Pope Francis, you're going to announce Maryam Thressia as a cent.
Sister Maryam Thresia is a sight of the unlimited contributions made to human cells at the age of fifty years.
I once more congratulate Sister Maryam Threasia - and I congratulate the Indians, especially my Christian brothers and sisters for this success.
My beloved countrymen, not just India, it is pride to the whole world that today when we are going to pursue 'Gandhi 150', and at the same time, 130 million countrymen have been able to completely stop the use of Single Use प्लास्टिक.
The way India has played an important role in environmental protection, the entire world's attention is now on India.
I'm sure that the campaign against Single Use Plastic - on October 2 will cover you all.
People in different places have their own contributions to this campaign.
But our country's youth started a unique expedition.
Her work attracts my eyes and I'm talking to her and try to know and understand her new plan.
Maybe he's gonna use these things to other people in the country.
It was new to me when I first heard the plugging word.
Perhaps this word is used a little overseas.
Hello Rippudamanji, I'm calling Narendra Modi.
This will not only take care of our health, but the world can protect our mother's health.
I believe the 130-country countrymen go to this target and our country will move 130-coat footsteps to form an unusable plastic free India.
Ripu Damanji, thank you many more times
My beloved countrymen, preparations are going on all over the world on October 2, but we want to take 'Gandhi 150' to the right path.
I want to enforce my life in the welfare of the country.
This is the best India of all our dreams, and therefore, every year October 31, we organise a race for unity in the entire country.
My dear countrymen, maybe you think on August 15 I told Red Fort that you would go to fifteen places in India between 2022.
Get at least 15 places and try to stay there for a night.
You see India, understand, feel it.
We have diversity.
There is a holiday on the occasion of Deepawali, so everybody goes out, so I request you to go to the fifteenth place of India.
Some of the responsible agencies of the world determine the progress of tourism in the unprecedented countries, you will be happy to know that India has developed a lot in the 'Travel and Tourism Community Index' and it is possible for all of you to help.
It's possible, especially because it understands the importance of roaming.
I mean, we're going a long way this time, if we try more, we can achieve a second place in the entire world in the past 75 years of independence.
My beloved countrymen, for all of you, you'll be very happy on the occasion of this unique India festival.
It must also be seen that in the days of Deepavali, there is no fire or no human being damaged.
There's a lot of nice one more time.
What's the mind, November
My dear countrymen, bow down to all of you
What's the mind, October 2017
Deepavali's six days later, Palit Mahaprabhu Chat, one of the most powerful festivals in our country.
Where every thing is considered traditional from dining to feeding.
Absolutely connected with the immense and supremacy of nature.
On one side, the sun and water, at the supremacy center, on the other hand, the bamboo and the utensils and the roots made up of the silver and the silver, the idols connected to its worship.
The significance of pureness in our life is also invisible.
Before six, the journey of the whole city, along with rivers, wells, ponds, surroundings of Khanakhand, pujastra, i.e., the valleys, all the people together with great enthusiasm.
Sun binding or split worship - environmental protection, disease relieving and admonition .
There is also a reason behind this method of eating more than a prasad that ruins the imagination, this imagination that obstacles the progress of a person.
It's very simple to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the effects of the wind, I believe that what the wind is tied up with the people of the country.
Take examples of khadi and handlooms.
You must be enjoyed listening to this, you've got so much sale in one store in Khadiar Handloom.
During Diwali, the sale of khadi gift coupons has shown an increase of six hundred and sixty percent.
Pollution of khadi and handicrafts has increased by about ninety percent this year in comparison to last year.
It looks like youngsters, elders, women and every age-long man and handloom.
I can imagine how many families, poor families, hospitalised families have benefited from this.
And we talked about "Khadi for Fashion", but over the past few years, I can tell you that 'Khadi for Nation' and 'Khadi for Fashion' are now taking that place, 'For Transformation'.
In the life of a poor man from the poor poverty, Handloom has changed the life of a poorer man than the poor and becomes a powerful tool to make him stronger.
It's playing a big role for the village.
Mr. Rajan Bhatt wrote in the "Narendramodi App" that he wanted to know about the experience of my lamps with the security forces and he also wanted to know how the security forces reinforce.
Mr. Tejas Gaikwad also wrote the Nrendramodi Appearance: What can we do to get our home sweets to the defence forces
We also think of our semi-resistant forces.
We also think we need to reach the sweet country's jewelry.
You've all spent the Deepawali in a lot of grief.
Deepawali brought me a special experience.
I have the privilege of reconciliation with our heroic defense forces once again.
This time, the Guerrez sector of Jammu and Kashmir will be unforgettable for me to celebrate Deepawali with the security forces.
To protect our resistance forces from the difficult situation facing the border, to dedicate, dedicate and depart, I respect each of our defense forces from all the countrymen.
When we come to the rescue, when we get the chance, we must know the experience of the jewels, we must hear the glory of the guys.
Many of us don't know that our defense troopers are playing an important role in establishing peace in the world, not just the border.
The nation's peacekeeping forces are enlightening India's name all over the world.
A few days ago, on 24th October, the United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world.
The efforts of the nation to establish peace in the world, everybody remembers the impressive role.
And we accepted the 'Busudhaib Kutumbakkam', that is, the whole world is our family.
And since the beginning, India has been making active contributions to the nation's most important industry.
You must know that the proposal of the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter begins with both words 'Wi the Pepple'.
India has always emphasized the equal rights of women and the live example of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
Its initial sentence was proposed, it was 'Ol Man and Burn Free and Equal', which was replaced by India's representative Hongsa Mehta, and later it was 'Alhiuman Beijings and Burn Free and Equal'.
Though it seems to be a very small change, we have a vision of health care.
The most important part of India in UN Ambraler is India's attempt to defend the peace of the Nation.
India has always played a major role in the United States' peace and education mission.
You already have a lot of people who know this first time.
More than six thousand defendants have defended their contributions to the peace of the Nation.
At present, nearly seven thousand soldiers of India are engaged in the protection of the nation's peace and this is the third highest number in the world.
By the east of 1997, almost fifty people have their contributions in the world's seventy-seven peacekeeping efforts.
All these efforts are being carried out in different parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Cango, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan.
More than twenty thousand patients were treated at the Indian Army hospital in Kango and South Sudan and the innocent people were rescued.
India's defence forces not only protected the people of the country in a different country, but also conquered their minds with peace.
Indian women played a very important role in the peace process.
Very little people know that India is the first country to send 'Mahila Police Unit' to the peace process of the National Constituency in Liberia.
And see, this move of India has been inspired to all countries since then.
Then all the countries started sending their "Mahila Police Unit".
You will be proud to hear that India's role is not only in the field of peace, but also in India's training of the 85-ddden peace security force.
From this soil of Mahatma Gandhi and the Great Word, our survivors are sending a message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peace-security campaign is not exactly possible.
Our security forces go to work everywhere.
They have to understand different situations and different cultures.
Remembering him, the hearts of all the countrymen are filled with pride.
He was the only member of the peacekeeping force of the National Union - the heroes who were honored with the supreme chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchandji is one of the Indian peacekeeping forces who received a special recognition of his work in Cyprus.
In 1989, at the age of 72, he was appointed an army commander at the mission of Namibia, who served him to ensure Namibia's independence.
The Indian Army's former-prince, Themeyya, led the peacekeeping forces of the national territory in Cyprus and established itself in peace.
India is always taking a message of peace, unity and harmony as a messenger of peace.
Let us believe, let every one live a peaceful and equitable life and move forward to build a better and peaceful future.
My dear neighbors, our sanctuary is decorated with all the glory of this Indian year, which has served humanity freely.
Sister Nivedita, whom we live, knows as a devotee of faith - he is also one of these great gentlemen.
Margaret Elizabeth was born in Nobel Ireland, and then gave her the name 'Nivedita'.
"Nivedita" means one who is completely dedicated.
He later showed his name the best glory.
Yesterday there was a birth anniversary of systrophy.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his life for the poor and the poor.
Sister Nivedita, she was suffering from the oppression of the old kingdom.
The British tried to embrace Indians not only physically but mentally slavery and slavery.
We've always tried to reflect our culture.
Bhagni Nivadita is the glory of Indian culture.
Resisting the national consciousness, awakening, helping the people in accumulation.
He turns around in different countries of the world and is against oppression of Sanatan religion and philosophy.
Famous nationalist Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati would be cynical for his special poem 'Pudumai Penn', NewWomen and 'Nari Shaktikaran'.
It's said, the source of inspiration was Bhagni Nivadita.
Bhagninibetta helped great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
Through his writings and various conferences, Mr. Besur is very helpful in examining the test and in propaganda.
This is a surprising beauty of India - where the spirituality and science of our culture is sufficient to each other.
Sister Nivedita and Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bastu - The beauty of this feeling.
In 1899, seeing the magnitude of the fatal plate in the Calcutta महानगर, Shayi fell into the corner of human death.
Sister Nivedita, describes her health, comes forward in the Rasta Ghat, Nardama Safai campaign.
He's the woman who gave her a life-saving life to the poor and unhappy man.
"It's comfortable here, Sister Nivedita, who has given her everything to India.
Undoubtedly one of the most universal truths.
This will be our optimistic personality if every Indian learns from his life and follows the path of his guided service.
Thank you for your phone.
First of all, I know all the kids, we've been very happy about the Shishu Day celebrated at the birth day of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the most important part of the creation of India, the hero of the next day.
Your concern is perfect... that all the diseases that were seen earlier in adulthood, are now seen in childhood.
It is surprising to hear that children are also victims of diabetes today.
But now our lifestyle has changed a lot.
Nowadays these diseases are called lifestyledisorder.
The main reason behind the infecting of all these diseases in young age is the deficiency of physical labor and change in food habits .
Both society and family must pay attention to it.
If you consider this, you don't need any unusual or dangerous changes.
What is necessary is to take care of little things and do it under their habits.
I want family members to try carefully to make children feel like playing in the open field.
If possible, the elders of the family will also take part with them.
The children may be used to use stairs in the lift.
After dinner, let's take care of the whole family.
India ' . Yoga will help us to create the habits of our youth and youth healthy lifestyle diseases and to prevent lifestyle diseases .
Yoga is easy because it can be taught simply.
I don't need a special instrument.
There is a lot of testing about this as a result of diabetes control.
Immers is doing a lot of work on this, and the results that have been found so far are very promising.
Ayurveda and yoga should not only be considered as the method of immunity , it should be made part of daily life .
My dear neighbors, especially my young friends, have been happy for a few days from the world of sports.
It's good for India to be like Hawki.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikant won the Open of Golden Mark and glorifies every Indian.
After Indonesianopen and Australian Open, it won his third superficiency.
I congratulate this young man for his success and for the glory of India.
Friends, this month FIFA Under-17 World Cup has been organized.
The teams of many countries of the world came to India to participate in it and the sports of the world marvelled us.
I also had a chance to see a match.
Everyone from the players was very excited.
World cup is a big event, where the world's attention is on you.
I was amazed at the enthusiasm, swimming and grief of young players.
World cups have been arranged well and successfully and all teams showed their best hatred.
Even if India cannot win it, the players of India have won everyone's mind.
India and all over the world have enjoyed this festival, the entire football tournament was very funny for the soccer lovers.
The future of the football is very bright and its predictions are getting.
I'll reassure everyone, their colleagues and all the sportsman general.
If my beloved countrymen, "Swachh Bharat", if I write to them, I have to talk about this cleanness every day.
Some small kids are trying to get a lot of efforts, and sometimes there's a success of the young people's team afort.
Somewhere there's an innovation about cleanliness, and now there's an emotional News to any official work.
A few days ago, I got a big port, where there is a description of the renovation of the Chandrapur Fort of Maharashtra.
The entire team of NGO, called Ecological Protection Organization, carried out a safai campaign in Chandrapur fort.
They sent me both before and after Safai.
I am shocked to see and I think those who are surrounding the dirty, stinky environment, think they can see the pictures of this moonlight... and I will tell them how the work, hypocrisy, zeal and livelihood of the younger sections of the Ecological Protection Organization are reflected in the picture.
Seeing them, the despair of yourself, the unbelief will go away.
For cleanness, this poetry is a strange example of beauty, sympathy and pursuit.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
Historical safety and preservation are the responsibility of all the countrymen.
I thanked all the employees of the Ecological Protection Organization and all the citizens of Chandrapur.
My dear neighbor, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak on 4th November.
Guru Nanakshudhu is not the first teacher of the Sikh community, he is a Jagdguru.
He thinks of the entire human cultivation, all race and property.
The woman's endeavour and strength has been forced.
Guru Nanak Deva has traveled 288 thousand kilometers and in this pilgrimage he has spread humanity message.
He joined men, led them to the path of satisfaction, sacrifice and work.
He didn't just say anything in his mouth, in his life, in his own work.
He started the lungs and transmitted the service to man.
If you eat in the lunch in the lunch, you'll get awake.
Guru Nanak has spoken of three meditations of a literary life, possessing the name of the universal, working hard and helping the dangerous.
Guru Nanak also wrote 'Guruvani' to propagate his wife.
The 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak will be celebrated next 2019.
Come on, we're trying to get out of life with the sword and teaching.
My dear neighbor, and two days later, 31 October.
We all know, he wrote the plans of modern India.
We can learn a lot from this great child of India.
Sardar Vallabhvai Patel worked for India as an instrument.
I ensured millions of Indians in the clutches of a state constitution.
His supervision gave me the power to cross all the obstacles.
He stabilised a goal and went through that goal in full swing, staying forward.
He said, "It is only a man who can do the work of insisting on the country, who sees the dream of a nation where all human beings have equal rights."
I'd like to make this window of the Sardar Vallabhvai Patel eternal.
He said, we cannot change the diversity of nation and community, every woman and male of India should decide the future of love and mutual love and harmony.
The origin of Sadarsaheb is still the exaggeration and strength of our New I India Vision.
And that is why his birthday will be celebrated as the International Unity Day.
Unfortunate the contributions of our country to give an integral form.
On October 31, the birth day of Sardar Saheb will be arranged across the country, where the child, the woman, the young man, the prophet.
I request you all, you're everybody to run for unity.
My loved countrymen, after Diwali's holidays, you've returned to a new imagination, new instincts in your daily lifetime.
All the people of the country want to fulfil all the dreams.
What's the mind, September 2017
Three years have been completed through the window to do the window.
This is the 36th festival today.
Most of it encourages me.
And I'll take you half an hour a month, but the humans continue to get their words for thirty days.
And what has happened to them is a simple idea of the government's sensitivity, so far and far off of society, to pay attention to them.
And that's why the three-year trip to "What Watt" is a journey to the countrymen - to think of them, to feel them.
And perhaps I'm very grateful to the countrymen for the opportunity I've made to tell the common man of the country in such a short time.
I'm often supposed to remember what I think in the vaata.
Acharya Winova often says, non-surgery, act.
I don't know, now three years later, social scientists, university, researchers and generosity experts will analyze it.
Take plus-minus of every thing, and I believe that this judgement will be very useful in the future for the vaata, a new consciousness, a new emergence.
And once I told you, we should think about eating as much as we need, we won't destroy it.
But then I've seen that there's so much letter from every corner of the country, so many social organizations, many young people have been doing this before.
And then I saw how many people came forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
Once I've seen the Selfie With Doter of a Panchayat chief in Haryana and I'll put it in front of everyone.
Not only from India but from all over the world, 'Selfie With Doter' starts a big campaign.
A few days ago, I was sitting with the Indian government's tourism office.
Uncredible I sent the phones where I went to India.
From every corner of India, lakhs of pictures have become a big treasure of those who work for a single tourism.
The smallest events create a big movement, what I feel in the Watt.
I'm interested today, because when I think it's been three years, how many things have been going on in my mind for the last three years.
The country is moving every minute to go to the right path.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the better of others, for the better of society, for the better of the country.
On my three-year trip to 'Man Ki Baat', I know it from the countrymen, I learned.
For any country, this is a huge wealth, a great power.
And I've seen a lot of attraction to the donor and I'm normally saying nobody's gonna have to eat.
But there's a lot of fabrics, why not eat it
The house may be silver, rumours, curtains, and it appears that the young people have grown up to the treasure.
The sale of khadi has increased and there is a direct connection with the poor people's livelihood.
Two-thirds are released in the mines of October, so many can be released.
I'm gonna say once more, we'll take the campaign for the khadi, and we'll go ahead.
I'll burn the lamps of Deepawali in the poor's house, and we'll work with this idea.
The poor of our country will get a power from this work, and we must do it.
And in order to increase the interest of this manure, the workers of the fertilizer sector have been encouraged to think newly about the people associated with the Indian government's mankind.
How will the new technology bring, how will the productivity grow, how will it bring the power and handicapped tail
The old heritage, which had been closed for about 20, 25, 30 years, can be revived.
In Uttar Pradesh, at the service of Baranasi - a khadi Ashram in Sevapuri was closed for 26 years, but it was resurrected today.
There's a lot of methods.
A lot of people have a new chance of routine.
The Khadi and Village Training Centre, which is closed in Pumpore in Kashmir, has been resumed and Kashmir has a lot to give it.
Now, to start this training center, the new generation is getting a help to build, wear, create new things, and I feel like the gifts they gave at the time of the big corporate house Deepawali.
People are also giving one another food as a gift.
We're all feeling how it's easy to move.
My beloved countrymen, in the last month, we all imagined together and we finished that Gandhi Jayanti will celebrate the cleaning festival all over the country for the past 15 days.
I'll involve myself with cleanness.
Our faith is that the President has started this work and the country has joined it.
Old, man-male, city-gram everybody has been part of the cleaning campaign today.
When I talk about the imagination, we can see how this cleaning mission is going through the imagination path.
I'm sure some people are working to stick.
This time I saw one more thing - first, we'll clean up a place, secondly, we can't make any place in the witchcraft, but if we have to make purity habits, we need a genuine change in our thoughts.
This time a lot of races were organized in the 'Cleanliness Service' campaign.
More than two and a half million children took part in the competition for cleaning.
Thousands of children have been painting.
They've published their own vision about cleanliness.
Whenever you talk of cleanliness, I've never forgotten to express my gratitude to the people of publicity.
Our country's electronic media, print media, how many services can be carried out in the country, we're watching the 'sufficient service' movement.
Just a few days ago, somebody attracts me to the 18-year-old young Bilal Dar of Srinagar.
From the age of 12-13, that is, last 5-6 years, Bilal has been working with cleansing.
The largest lake in Asia near Srinagar is also cleaning plastic, polythene, used bottles, dirty rings.
I'm glad that Pauronigum Bilal didn't just make Brand Ambassador, they gave Bilal a car now, uniform, and Bilal went to other places to teach the people about the cleansing of the people there, reflecting them and not leaving the reflected fruit.
Bilal's age is inspired by those who are interested in cleanness.
I'm enjoying Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we have to confess that history is born in the womb of history, and when we talk about history, it's natural to remember the great men.
The month of October to remember many of our great men.
Sardar Patel from Mahatma Gandhi, born a lot of princes in the month of October, who led us in the twentieth and one-twentieth centuries, showed us the way to walk and for the country who had suffered a lot.
When former President of India Shriman Abdul Kalamji spoke to the young people, he often talked about the rural development of a variety of countries.
He used to mention that work in deep intimacy and he himself went to the village to observe this work of many things.
Remembering these princes, they don't have any benefit, we remind them of the way forward, so that they get the right direction for the future.
I'm sure I'll tell you about the surdar Vallabhvai Patel.
We're very simple to say: India's specialty between diversity.
We're proud of diversity, but what do we ever try to realise our variety of characteristics for that species
I want to repeat all my countrymen in Hindustan, especially to tell my young people that we are in a waking condition.
Please feel the disintegration of this India, touch her, get her glory.
For the development of your intermediate personality, our country's specificity plays a big participant.
You go abroad, I don't mind, but sometimes you'll see your home
The people of North India don't know what is in South India
Do not know the humans of western India what is in East India
Our country is so special.
Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalamji - whenever they visited India, they awakened a new inspiration for the country to see, understand the country.
All these great ancestors roamed around.
They tried to know and understand India in the beginning of their work.
I tried to make India self-sufficient.
Cannot we also learn the rules of different states of our country, different communities or clans, traditions, their dressing, food, as a student, to understand, to lead lifestyle
The value addition in tourism will happen only when we are not just as a viewer, we will be able to take, understand and adopt the specialty of all those places like a student.
I have a chance to go to more than five hundred districts of my own Hindusthan.
It's also experienced night staying in more than four and a half districts.
Today, when I take care of this valuable responsibility of the country, the experience of that journey is very useful.
That's why I get a lot of things to understand.
My request to you, the unity of the varieties in this India, not just as a slogan, but to get this treasure of our power.
If you eat a kind of new food every day, you'll not repeat it.
This is the greatest power of our tourism.
I'd like you to get out of the house on this holiday, just for a little change.
You're gonna get a lot of trouble.
What else can happen to the bigger teacher than that
Normally, from October to March, the time is ready for tourism.
If you meet the people there, send their pictures.
It's not merely a cosmetic or architecture, but it's not just a natural beauty, but also a couple of things about the life there.
Write all the best connections to you and send them to Myagav, "Narendramodi App".
I have seen one thing that if you can be the seven best tourist destinations of your own kingdom in order to improve India's tourism industry, every Indian must know about these seven things of his kingdom.
If possible, we'll go to the seven places.
Can you give any information about this
You see, if everyone in the same state sends all these information, I'll tell the government to scrutinise them, and make publications about the seven Common things that came from every state.
That means how to improve the tourist destination from a kind of human implication.
In the same way, the seven of the seven things you've seen in the entire country, you want to see someone else, you need to go there, so you need to send the names of the seven places you like, MyGov, Narandramodiapp.
The Indian government will work on it.
The government will accept the decisions made by you, making films, making videos, creating publicity literature.
Come on, join me.
From this October to March, you can also be a big guarantee in the improvement of tourism.
I'm inviting you.
My beloved countrymen, as a man, a lot of things touch my mind, dragg my mind.
I have a deep impact.
Because I'm a man like you.
A few days ago, perhaps your vision was attracted - a surprising example of women's power and patriotism.
The Indian army found two virgins in the name of Lieutenant Witness and Niyi, they're not a nice virgin.
Excellent reason that the husband of taste and enforcement was martyred to serve mother and sister.
We can imagine what kind of mind will be if the world is lost in this young age
But the martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadak's wife, Swati Mahadik, fought against this difficult situation, and joined the Indian army.
He trained hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to fulfill his husband's dream.
In the same way, his husband Mukesh used to work in the heroic position in the two armies and when he died for the motherland, he decided to remind his wife's rule and he was also admitted to the army.
It's very simple for each country to show respect to these virgins on this woman's strength.
I'm very pleased with these two sisters.
They made a new inspiration to millions of people in the country, a new consciousness.
There's a lot of love for those two sisters.
My beloved countrymen, this time between Navaratri festivals and Deepawalis, there is a great opportunity for the youth of our country.
World Cup of FI FA under-17 is happening here.
I'm sure you'll hear the songs of the football all around.
Each generation will be attracted to the football.
There will be no school-class field in India, where our youngsters will not be seen playing football.
Come on, when the whole world comes to play on the ground, we haven't made this game part of our life.
My beloved countrymen, the Navaratri festival is going on.
Mother Durga's time.
The entire environment is full of pure smell.
On the occasion of this grand festival of Navaratri, I wish the countrymen a lot of congratulations, pray to the mother's power, to reach the new peak of success in order to fulfil the hope and desire of the common people of the country.
The country's ability to deal with each challenge.
The country can grow faster, and in 2022, 75 years of India's independence - the attempt to fulfil the freedom struggles, the simplicity of 125 million people, the simplicity of the country, the simplicity of many men and simplicity, and the simplicity of the simultaneous simplicity of five years, we have started our journey, the mother-in-law blessed us.
I don't love all of you.
Festivals, glorify enthusiasm.
What's the mind, August 2017
My beloved countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patelji, which is dedicated to the unity of the country.
Since ancient times, our ancestors, who have reinforced all the valuables, Ahingsa, have lived with our lives.
"Ohissa Param Dharma" - It's coming from childhood, I'm telling you.
I told the Red Fort that the glasses would not be buried in the name of faith, it might be communal beliefs, faith in political thoughts or any person can believe in any tradition.
Nobody has the right to take the law in the name of faith.
Dr.
Dadsaheb Ambassador has the right to obtain access to every person's constitution that has given us.
I want to reassure the countrymen, against those who have taken the law, who go through Hingsar, who don't give any government or country to anybody or community.
Everyone has to be instructive to the law, the law will judge him and the culprit will have to be slain.
Even our festivals are special.
Many of our festivals are directly connected to farmers and malignant siblings.
Today I'm talking about the festival, so first I want to tell you "Machamy Dukkdam".
Yesterday's 'Sambasmeri Festival' has been celebrated.
In Jain society the festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra .
Absolute festival forgiveness, ahimsa and Maitri.
And this is also called 'Party-Bani Festival' and on this day there is a tradition of enjoying each other as 'Michami Dukkdam'.
Besides, we're in our scriptures... "Sorry Virtue Bhosanam" means a pardon semen.
My dear countrymen, now Ganesh Chathi is being celebrated with great enthusiasm and indignation all over India.
And when Ganesh Chathi's words came up, the public genocide comes out normally.
This great festival of Ganesh Chathi lasted for 10 days.
And we know this greatness as a symbol of unity, patience and purity.
On this occasion, every countryman knows that there's not a lot of genocide.
Now the 'Onam' festival is going on in Kerala.
Among the many colorful festivals of India ' Onam ' is a major festival of Kerala .
This festival is special for its social and cultural importance.
Hisam Festival reminds of the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
And now this festival has become a center of attraction for tourism.
Besides, I'll tell the countrymen that the newlywed festivals of Gujarat or the ruins of western Bengal have become the main attraction of tourism today.
In other festivals of our country, there is a lot of chance to attract foreigners.
That's what we can take in the next day, we have to think, Vaiki
In this festival, Id-ul-juha will flee soon.
I know all the people of the country, I'm not very pleased and happy with Eid-ul-juha
In our family life, festivals and cleansing are partially connected.
Preparation of the festival begins with cleanness.
It's not new, but it is very important to turn cleanness into a social way.
Cleanliness is not only in our homes, in every village, in every city, in our kingdom, in our country - this cleanness and festival must be tied in a sufficient way.
My dear countrymen are changing the definition of modernization.
Nowadays this new dimension has been new parameters.
You'll see at YouTube, nowadays the children are making idols of Ganesh on the ground.
Three years ago, the cleaning mission that we started, the next two are the third year of October.
At such a time the officers of the Jamiat-ulema-e-Hind on the Dhanara of Banaskantha district of Gujarat have taken the entire task of cleaning and cleaning of 22 temples and three mosques affected by the flood.
If this attempt to dedicate cleanness becomes a permanent part of our nature, then where can our country reach
My beloved countrymen, I'm asking you to come again, once again, the guys started propagating 'Cleanliness Service' from October 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti.
I create a clean environment all over the country.
And whenever we get the chance, we'll find the chance and make it possible.
Give me the work.
On the day of the holidays or on Sundays, work concerted.
Go to the neighbouring neighbourhood, go to the nearby village, give it an offensive.
I apply to all the NGs, Schools, Colleges, Social-Scientific-Raj Natural Netrugs, Government Amla, Collector and Panchayat chiefs, Doss create such a famine fifteen days before Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary, so that Gandhiji's dream India is realized.
Drinking water and clean mantra, Mygov.
Installs a department where you can list your own name and family name after you made the toilet, which you helped in this work.
My social media friends can drive some creative propaganda in the world of Vertuyal, which can actually be inspirational.
Through the Drinking Water and Cleanliness Ministry, the 'Peace Syndication of Pure Siddhi' can be organised under the campaign, films of low-level and painting competitions.
You can write articles in different languages and this race doesn't have a specific age.
Three of the participants in this competition will be selected and repeated at the district level and three at the state level.
I'm telling you, you can take part in the cleaning campaign.
Surely take some step for cleanness.
Several crores of cattle and millions of people, sometimes through letters, sometimes sent messages or phones, sent messages to me a sufficient gain and rare wealth.
It's a big opportunity for me to know the thoughts and minds of the people of the country.
I'm more waiting for you than what you're waiting for.
I'm very interested because I can learn a lot from you.
I'm trying to see you as much as possible, listen, read and know.
"President, I'm telling you aparna from Pune.
I want to tell you about a bunch of mine.
He's always trying to help people, but he's got a conversation I'm surprised to see.
I was dying with him once to buy it.
I saw him buy a two-hour bucket, spending 450 rupees for Pitzer.
And then, to go to Mel, he hired Autowala for five rupees.
He did the same work while buying vegetables in the way of return and saved four packs.
I felt so bad.
We spend a lot of money in the big shops, but we'll bow down with our labour simple brothers and sisters for a small amount of money, we'll trust them
"My belief, after hearing this phone, you've not just been aware, you've decided not to make such a mistake.
You don't think when someone comes to selling things around us, comes to return, we work with a small shopkeeper, vegetable market, sometimes with auto-rickshaw... whenever a great man comes to work, we need it, we don't need it.
And when people like us go to eat a big restaurant, don't see what's written in the bill, I'll take out the money immediately.
Not only that, I don't want to buy saris in the showroom, but I don't care if you work with any poor.
Two rupees, five rupees don't have any differences in your life, but have you ever seen how deep your little behavior hurts him
Madam, I'm grateful to you, you gave me a message by calling such a heartbreak.
I believe they'll surely abandon it if there is a habit of this behavior with the poor among my countrymen.
My beloved young friends, on 29th August, celebrate the entire country as "Terror Creation Day".
This day is the birth day of great hockey players and hockey magician Major Dhanchandji.
Well, his contribution is invaluable.
I'm reminding this because I want the new generation of our country to be associated with sports.
Sports can become part of our life.
If we are the world's most native, then we must pay attention to the field of play.
Things mean physical fitness, mental alartness, personality enhancing.
Sports from one another is a precious habit of mixing the heart.
Our country's younger generations can come in the world of playing and today I want to take care of the computer that the playing field is more important than the plate station.
Play films in the computer, but in the field outside, you'll see it with the football.
Perhaps playing cricket in the computer, but playing cricket under the sky in the open field is different.
Today the situation is such that children return home and start watching cartoon movies and otherwise the mobile game gets scorched and then the mother has to speak very carefully - when will you go out
The time was changed, she was a time when the mother told the son when you would come and today it was a condition to tell her mother, Dad, when would you go out
The young friends have made a "sports talent search" portal to explore and develop the sports sports sports surveillance, where any children from all over the country who have achieved some credit for the sports - he can upload his biodata or video at this portal.
The Silected Emerging Players will give the synthetic training and the magician has been lunching it tomorrow.
Good news for our youngsters that on October 6 to 28, India's Fuffy Andara Seventeen World Cups are going to be organized.
The world's twenty-four teams are going to make India their homes.
Come on, let's welcome our young guests from the world, enjoy the game, make a suitable environment in the country.
When I'm talking about playing today, I'm sure it's a marvellous event last week, and I want to share with the countrymen.
Some of them were born in the Himalayas, some of whom had never been connected to the sea.
Six daughters in our country who work in the Navy - their emotions, their encouragement will inspire us all.
This six daughters, with a small boat - I-A-S Tarani, will come out to the sea.
The name of this expedition is 'Nabica Sea Parikrata', and they will reach India a few months after the world's tour.
Sometimes it'll be only forty days.
Sometimes we'll spend thirty days in the water.
This brave six daughters in the midst of the ocean waves, and this is the first thing in the world.
There are no Indians who will not be proud of our daughters
I know the feelings of these girls, and I told them to share my thoughts with the whole country.
I'll make a separate arrangement to think of them in the "Narendramodi App" so that you can read them.
Because it's a brave admiration, it'll talk about your own thinking, and I'll be happy to let these girls come to you.
I'm so glad about these daughters, thanks to one and a half.
My beloved countrymen, on 5th September we all celebrate 'Shikshaka Day'.
The birthday of the former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan-ji.
He was the president, but he made himself a teacher over the whole life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was a life dedicated to education.
A teacher's glory is to awaken the mentality of creation among his students and enjoy knowledge.
Can I start a campaign in a Mission mode
When it comes to transportation in our country, just as the mother of the family thinks of the teacher's role in society.
Teachers have a great role in transformation.
In every teacher's life, there's a stransformation carpenter of some student, and we're making a public effort.
The country's transformation will play a bigger role.
Come on, 'Teach to Transform' - we move forward with this mantra.
My name is Dr. Anita Awasthi.
I am connected to the Indian Research Center of Mumbai's resident and Howard University.
The plan started with a dream on August 28, 1947.
Tomorrow, on 28th August, the Prime Minister John Dhan Yojana will complete three years.
30 million Indians participated in this plan and opened their first bank account.
The number of new academic citizens more than the population of many countries in the world.
If you have money in the house or in the pocket, you're interested in spending.
In the Prime Minister's Reproductive Plan, the poor people of our country have paid about 65 thousand crores.
Once again, in the Prime Minister John Dhan Yojana, who opened the acquaintance, got the facility of insurance.
"The Chief Minister's Lifestock Birth Plan, the Chief Minister's Defense Birth Plan," has created a new self-confidence in that poor man's life today with just one and three rupees premium.
In many families, when this poor man was naked, the family chief died, that's a premium's sufficient two hundred rupees.
Representatives have told me a lot of encouraging consequences of the benefits of the common man for the insurance, the 'Rupay Card', the Prime Minister's Memorandum.
My dear countrymen, you know, "Missie Dukkdam"
What's the mind, July 2017
Human minds are very pleasant for humans in the rainy season.
Animals, birds, vegetation, nature, everybody gets born in the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a terrible look, it's realized how dangerous the water is.
Nature is our life-threatening, our patriotism, but sometimes the natural misery of floods, earthquakes, its magnificent shape becomes very devastating.
The changes in the climate cycle and the consequences have a negative effect.
In the past few days, natural misery has to bear in some parts of India, especially in Assam, north-east, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal.
It's being observed in the flooding area.
Comprehensive rescue operations.
Wherever possible, the colleagues whom I have in the cabinet are going to reach.
The kingdom is also making every effort to help the people who are buried in their own way.
Social organizations, cultural organisations, citizens who want to work, are trying to help people in this situation.
Agriculturalism, animals, circuits, restaurants, electricity, communication systems are all affected.
Especially for the destruction of the crops and fields of our rich brothers, we have made plans, especially the agricultural insurance companies that can take a positive role, so that the limesetlement of the farmers can be very fast.
People are talking about their far-reaching.
Even before the rainy season, the entire government work was prepared by Mock Drill in most places.
The team of NDRF was employed.
Gradually, we have made ourselves so that we can do our jobs according to the predictions of the rain, so that we can get rid of the losses.
Whenever I'm ready for the Wind, I'll see my country's citizens more than me.
This time there's so much letter to GST, so many phones have come, and people are still happy about GST, asking questions.
A phone I want to listen to you, "Namsky Prime Minister, I'm telling you the Gorg from Gurgaon.
I'm very impressed to hear your comments in Chartered Accountant Day.
That's why in our country, Goods and Service Tax has started today.
I'd like to listen to you.
Thank you.
"It's almost a month since the GST starts, and the results are visible.
And I'm glad that whenever a poor man writes the letter, how the price of the poor for GST is reduced, the things are cheaper.
In the north-east, far-flung, mountainous areas, a man living in the jungle, is telling the first thing that he was scared, but now when I learned and understand it, I think the work has been very easy.
Business has become very easy.
And the most important thing is that the traders of the graduates are growing.
Now I see the impact of the GST on the Transportand Logistic sector.
How the truck's coming up.
As a result, there is a strong smooth transition, so that there is a strong migration, new registration, and thereby creating a new faith all over the country.
And sometimes, orthodox, a man of management, a man of Technology, must put the use of GST in India through their research as a model for the world.
It'll be a Case Study for different universities in the world.
Because such a big change in measure, to join the millions of people, to pursue him with his use and success in such a large country, this is the key to success.
The world must be studying about this.
GST has been used, every kingdom has participated in it, every kingdom has its responsibility.
All the decisions have been combined with the kingdom and the center.
And the result is that every government's primary objective is that the GST doesn't exert pressure on the priests.
I'm thanking a lot of thanks to all the mantras, all the offices, central and state government workers involved in this work.
GST is an excellent example of the success of India's evolutionary power.
This is a historic.
This is a social reform campaign.
I'm serving millions of countrymen once again to successfully make such a big effort.
My loved countrymen, the month of August Movement.
Yusuf Meh's Ali.
What happened to our new generation winner on August 9, 1942.
In 1857 to 1942 how he concentrated himself with the hope of Indian self-esteem , how much he had to bear , how much he had to bear .
This was the time when in every corner of Hindustan, everywhere in the city and in the village, all the people of the educational and uneducated, drunken, arms together with the shoulders, the 'Bharat Leave' movement was violent.
On the advancing of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians dedicated their lives to the struggle in Kareng Ya Marang.
On 9 August, Mahatma Gandhi, after calling for the 'Bharata Leave' movement, when the British seized all the big leaders and then came forward to the mobilization.
Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayan is the leader of the second generation.
In 1920's non-cooperation movement and in 1942's 'Bharat Charo', Mahatma Gandhi's two different forms of movement.
The faces of the unbearable movement were the same, then the situation in 42, the intensity of the movement increased so much that the great ancestors like Mahatma Gandhi also gave the word "Yamreng in Kreng".
All this was behind the success of the people, the people, the people, the people and the people's struggle.
The whole country fought together that day.
I sometimes thought, gathering the cards of history and seeing it as if India's first freedom struggle was 1857.
The war, which began in 1857, has been going to some corner of every minute in 1942, and in the long run, it gave rise to a fast demand for freedom in the heart of the countrymen.
Every man is asked to do something or the other.
The generation has changed, but the intensity of their imagination is nothing.
One man has come, joined the struggle, a new group has come back, they have joined the struggle in the same way, and have attempted to make the British empire free of cost.
From 1857 to 1942, this trick brought Andolan to a very high level in 1942, and the poison of 'Bharatcho' was so bad that it could go to the British in 1947 in five years.
From 1857 to 1942, the slaughter of freedom was close to every countrymen and from 1942 to 1942 - this five years of imagination remains due to the gain of freedom of the country.
This was five years old.
Now I want you to join this process.
In 1947, we were free and today in 2017.
It's almost 70 years.
The government has come, it has gone.
Treatment has been created, changed, improved.
Everyone has made their own efforts to get rid of the country's problems.
In order to increase the income of ordinary people in the country, there is a constant effort to overcome poverty.
Responsibility has increased.
On 15th August of this election, we will follow as the information of the Sankalpর্ব and when freedom is 75 years in 2022, we must serve that synthesis.
Since 1942, five years since 1942, as the country became the creator of freedom, 2022 - this five years of India's future creation could have been a crucial rain, and it must be done.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of independence.
A syndrome that we'll see in the next five years.
Come on, technologically bring the video post, blog, registration, new ideas.
This guy has to be given the shape of a guy.
uit I India uiz's competition for young friends in 'Narendra Modi App'.
This uiz race is an attempt to familiarize the youth of the country with the glorious history of the country and the heroes of freedom struggle.
I'm glad to have a lot of proposals from every corner of the country to discuss what should be said on August 15 last three years.
I'll try to discuss these proposals as long as I get on 15th August.
I'll finish it in 40-45 or 50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I'm talking about something else today.
Social and economically associated with India's economy.
It should never be finished.
Our different festivals, the festivals are not just for joy and joy.
Our festivals, festivals, in fact, are directly related to the economic life of the poorest person in the country with each of our festivals.
After a few days, Rakhi Bandhan, Janmashtami, then Charankanesh Festival, Chauth Chandra, Anantha Chaurasi, Durga Puja, Deepawali will come together and at this time poor people will get some chance to grow.
There's a simple joy with all this.
If you talk about the economy, it's a few months before Bandhan Yusuf... ..and hundreds of families get ready for a small family business.
Suti, silk sounds are different types of shoes, and nowadays people like to keep homemade.
Hundreds of thousands of businessmen join a festival in this way, a person connected with the rubbish manufacturing, a sale-based sweet businessman.
Build small soil lamps, with those poor families, but the islands are directly related.
Today, when I'm talking about the economy of the fair, festival and the poor people associated with it, I want to talk about the environment.
Sometimes I thought I was more aware and active than me and I've achieved that.
Awakening citizens have written to me about last one month's exposure.
They have asked me to say that as long as I speak to Ganesh Chauthi in Deco-Friendly Ganesh so that people like the ganesh made of the earth, make plans.
Lokmanya Tilak started this great tradition... this year's 125th anniversary of the public Ganesh festival.
125 years and 125 million countrymen.
Lokmanya Tilak Ganesh started the festival in front of the idea of social unity, awakening society, social reform.
Come on, we also recall him this year's Ganesh Festival organized the race, the discussions, etc.
Come on, let us deal with this festival with the economy of the poor, the joy of our festivals will be the economic festival of the poor, the economic fun, that must be our endeavor.
I'm telling all the countrymen a lot of good news for coming.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that in education, in economic fields, in social fields or fields of sports, our daughters are shouting in the country, reaching the top of new success.
Our countrymen are proud of our princes, we are honored for them.
Just a few days ago, our brothers showed great humility to the women's cricket.
This week I had a chance to meet all these players girls.
They had a sword on their faces.
I told those girls that I had a different value.
I've seen such a thing that if India's players are failing, the country's angry players are also sufficient.
Some people say something that breaks the foolishness, some of the things that are very painful.
Not all this, girls counted what they did, gave them their honor.
I'm watching a beautiful change in it, and I told these girls that you see, this luck is just yours... that you didn't succeed.
The match is jewels or jewels, you've won the minds of a million people.
Truely, our country's youth community, especially our girls, are doing a lot to brighten the country's name.
My beloved countrymen, I want to remind the next movement once again, I want to recall it on 9th August.
Every countrymen, every country's citizen, will guide them for five years to fulfil their vision.
Come on, we walk together, we'll do something.
The country's fate, the future of the country will continue to go ahead with this faith.
What's the mind, June 2017
Weather changes.
This time it was too hot.
But fortunately, the rains continue to follow their footprints.
In some parts of the country, the rain has started.
It's feeling comfortable in the cold wind after the rain.
We've all seen that whatever excitement or regret in personal life or public life, the arrival of rain, but changes our minds.
Today the chariot of Lord Jagannath Dev in the different parts of the country is fleeing with great enthusiasm and joy.
Today the Rath Yatra festival of Lord Jagannath is celebrated in some other places of the world.
The poor people of the country are specially connected with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor man.
Very little people know that there is a word in English language ' Jugernaut ' which means a beautiful chariot whose speed can not be stopped .
Original means that this word has come from the Lord of Jagannath.
From this it is understood that the people of the world accepted the importance of this journey of Jagannath Dev in their own way.
Everybody's very happy with me on the occasion of Christmas-ul-Fitr.
Come on, we're all gonna bring the country forward with a joyful treasure with an inspiration from this festival.
In this episode of Ramzan, I could know about a very imaginative house in Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
In this small village, he slaughtered thousands of Muslim brothers and sisters.
This Ramzan decided to make a toilet together in the month of the village.
They've been given 17 lakhs of rupees as a help from the government to build a private toilet.
You'll be glad to hear and wonder that in this holy month of Ramzan, the Muslim brothers and sisters of the government have returned those 17 lakhs of rupees, they say, in our defecation, we'll be ready for our money.
This can cost 17 lakhs of rupees for other services.
I am thanking all the villagers of Mubarakpur in this holy month of Ramadan for this change in the occasion of social development.
Everything of them is very obsessive.
The biggest thing is that they made Mubarakpur a free place of defecation.
We know that three states of our country - Sikkim , Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared free of defecation in the free place.
This week Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared as 'free defecation' in the free place.
I'm particularly grateful to the rulers and people of this five kingdom to finish this work.
We know very well that we have to do a lot of work in personal life or social life.
If I'm wrong with the writings of my hand, I've been trying to fix it for a long time to be careful.
This way, changing physical and mental conditions.
That's the same thing.
Some bad habits have become ours.
Everybody has to attract attention.
I'll remind you of inspiring events.
I'm glad that cleanliness is no longer a government program.
It's taking the mobilization of ordinary people in society.
When people connected with the administration take this work with the people's participation, the power generally increases.
I think the best thing in the past is that I want to tell you.
This incident is in Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
Their goal was to build 71 gram panchayats ten thousand family toilets in 100 hours.
My beloved countrymen, you'll be glad to hear the livelihood and local administration have successfully completed the work of making 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 thousand villages have been freed from defecation at 'Unfree' place.
In, through letters, all these suggestions come in the airbase.
It is important to be aware of democracy and this is why it is necessary to recall the incident that hit the democracy and encourage the hypocrisy.
On June 25, 1975, a black day that no Indians can forget.
The entire country was transformed into a single prison.
The voice of the opponents was stabbed.
Eminent leaders of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan.
The trial system couldn't get rid of that terrible situation.
The newspaper was completely unusable.
Students from today's journalist world remind the people working on democracy of the black day and consistently encouraging awareness of democracy and this effort must continue.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also alive.
Attalji wrote a poem in the rainy season, he describes the mental condition of the time in that poem.
We have to make this heritage more powerful.
My beloved countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud of the world today.
On 21st June, the whole world was united.
From the sea to the mountain, people welcomed the sun's rays in the morning and evening.
There's no Indian who's not proud of it
It's not that it wasn't just before, but when it's tied up to yoga today, Yoga is the reason for the world's oppression.
Almost all the countries in the world have enlightened the aim of this yoga.
On the one hand, where China has manufactured the "The Great Wal of China", on the other hand, two thousand and four hundred meters above the sea level, Peru's 'Worldheritage Site' has joined the maturity.
In France, Iphil Tower's shadows have been used.
More than four thousand people joined the Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates.
The Indian-Afghan Friendship Dam on Salmabandh has given India a new gift of friendship .
In a small country like Singapore, there was a seventy-seven ceremony and they launched a campaign all weeks.
The National Union has published ten patterns on the International Yoga Day.
In the leading office of the National Union, the union has been run in the presence of a journalist.
The nation's staff, the world's dyplomatres, each part of it.
Once again, Yoga has created world records.
About fifty thousand people in Gujarat's Amedabad made a world record together.
I'm also a chance to participate in the function.
But I'm lucky to join the rain for the first time.
Our soldiers, whereminus twins, fifteens, forty degrees are in the temperature, even in the Siachen.
Whether we have armed forces, B-S-F, I-T-B-P, C-R-P-Fhow, C-I-S-F, everybody has joined together with their duty.
On this day I said that three generations, because it was the third 'international Yoga Day', so I told three generations of the family to join together and share their phones.
Some TV channels took this thing further.
I've got a lot of photographs, some of them have been picked up by Nrendramodi.
"A few days ago, I had a chance to go to a very dearest place.
It's been a good event for a few days in Kerala, in the field of P enforcer Foundation, people are encouraging the reading of books, so "Riding Day", "Riding Manth."
I had a chance to go to the beginning, and there I was told that we don't break flowers, books.
I love it.
This time I also remembered the thing that went away from my focus center.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I made the government a custom that we wouldn't break it, or we'll give it to you or we'll welcome it.
She'll be rumoured to eat the khadi's grown-up.
As long as I was in Gujarat, it was the habit of everyone, but when I came here, I lost that habit.
But he went to Kerala and roamed the habit again.
And I'm going to foster the government again.
We can gradually create a nature.
The flower breaking age is very low.
Once we've got to get out of hand.
But if I give you a book, it's part of the house, even as a family member.
I went to London, Britain's queen, ueen Elizabeth invited me to eat.
As long as it's been, the ueen Elizabeth has taken care of Mahatma Gandhi's romance.
And I'm gonna see him very happy.
When I was watching, I didn't know if he wanted me to touch once.
The gift of Mahatma Gandhi has become part of his life, has become part of his history.
I believe that these habits don't change the night and sometimes it's a criticism.
But it should be highlighted, it must be tried.
Now I can't tell you I'm gonna go somewhere and somebody's gonna break the flower, and I won't tell him, I can't do it.
But whatever it may be, there will be discussions, but it must continue to talk, it will slowly change.
My beloved patriots have a lot of work to be the chief minister.
I have to be drowned in the files, but I made a habit of myself... and I read some of the letters I found, and I got a chance to save contact with ordinary people.
Different types of people write letters.
It's already a letter that you know.
Arulmozhi, a housewife in Tamilnadu, that far south, wrote a letter.
What you're writing in that letter - I thought I could take care of my world, to take care of the children's study so that there's something economic in the world.
Likewise, I took some loan from the bank in the 'Mudra plan' and started working to get some goods from the market.
I mean, I mean, the government has started a system called "Government E-Marketplace".
So I registered myself in that arrangement with exploration.
Anyone who wants to supply anything to the government can want to supplement the dustbin, the table, the tear, the tear, the table - you can register whatever they want to sell.
He wrote, first I gotta get rid of the 'Mudra plan' and started my business... and then I registered all my sales in the E-GEM, and then I got the order from the Prime Minister's office PMO.
It was an unknown news to me, I wanted to know what PMO wanted to buy
He told me, he bought a breadth of thermos and got a 1600 pamphlet.
Yeah, that's the Empowerment.
It has transparency, evolution, an entrepreneurship is also growing.
Government-Market Place - GEM.
I want those who want to sell something to the government as if their numbers are growing.
I understand the unique example of the Minimum Government and the Maximum Governance and its goal is Minimum Price and Maximumese, efficiency and transparency.
My dear neighbors, on one side, we can be proud of joining, and then in the space science that can be proud of the success.
This is India's significance, Yoga is on the ground of our country, and our country is in a far-reaching space campaign.
India has been successful in science.
Today India is not only in the earth but also in the interior.
This furnace has already produced 30-tie nanostallites with Isro Cartosat-2 Satellite.
In all these satellites, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America, apart from India, have almost 14 countries.
And from these nano satellites in India, in the field of agriculture, there will be a lot of useful information for the eradication of natural misconduct of farmers.
Just a few days ago, we all must remember the successful expedition of ISRO GSAT-19.
Imagine how much our scientists have achieved in space research.
On June 19, Mars Mission was a thousand days.
You all remember, for this Mars mission, we successfully tried to establish theorbit in and his instruction was treated for six months.
Its work was six months.
But what extraordinary skills of our scientists have crossed a thousand days after six months.
Our scientific journey to this one thousand days is giving the best success to our space research.
Our young generations are enlightening their skills, their physical ability to enhance the country's name with their universal meditation.
That day, India's Badminton players in Indonesia and Spain have increased the honor of the country as a champion.
I'm enjoying this retiring Srikanth and his coach.
T.
The sports plays a special role in the development of personality.
Sports sports plays an important part in the development of the public personality.
There is no shortage in the country.
If the family's sons and mothers are swimming to play, they should be succumbed.
Once again, the Ordinance, the rainy season, the joy of festivities gives speciality to this time.
What's the mind, May 2017
When I talk to you today, the holy Ramzan month has started.
In the month of Holy Ramadan, I'm telling all the people of the world, especially the people of the Muslim community, in this holy month.
During Ramadan prayer , spirituality and mercy are given special importance .
We are very lucky Hindus - our elites have made a tradition that the Indians can proudly proud.
We can proudly possess a hundred twenty five million countrymen that India is the people of all the communities of the world.
This is such a country that goddesses or natives who worship the idols or who are idols , opponents of idol worship , all kinds of thoughts , all kinds of worshipping techniques , all kinds of traditional people have given the trick to live together .
And religion, sects, thoughts or traditions, whatever, gives us one message, peace, unity and solidarity.
This holy Ramzan will be helpful to take this stream of peace, unity and sorrow for months.
I'm telling you very well once again.
Last time when I did 'Man Ki Baat', I used a word, especially the Nazoians told me to do something new, to come out of the rest zone with a new feeling.
And this is the age to survive in this way... a little risk, it's hard to sustain.
I'm glad many people gave me feedback.
Everyone encouraged me to personally speak to me.
There's a message that I can't read everything, I can't hear the message sent to everyone.
But I have seen what has come in my sight , someone is trying to sing , someone is listening to the new musical instrument , someone is trying to teach new things using YouTube , someone is trying to learn new languages , someone is cooking , someone is learning dance , someone is learning drama , someone writes that they have started writing poems .
My studies were almost closed.
That's why I tried to read in this holiday.
When I started reading about freedom struggle, I realized how many struggles have to be fought for India's freedom, how many freedom fighters have spent years in jail.
I've been inspired by Bhagwad Singh, who has done a lot of things in his life.
That's why I'm asking you to tell you something about this today.
I'm glad today's young-women are intending to know about our history, our freedom struggle - those who sacrificed life for our country.
I went to Andaman Nicobar a year ago.
I went to see the cellular jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of the gambler.
Sage Savarkar had written a book on the birthplace of Manji sitting in jail.
I used to write poems on the walls of the prison.
He was locked in a small house.
There was so much trouble for freedom.
When I read the book on the 'Manji birthplace' of Savarkarji, I inspired to see the cellular jail.
There's a light and sound show that's very inspiring.
There is no such kingdom of Hindustan , no such speaking person who did not enjoy Kalapani for freedom , in the prison of Andaman - find his life in this cellular jail .
It's only after you go there, if you get a chance, you must go to the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle.
My beloved countrymen, 5-e June first Monday.
And this year the theme of the United Nations is ' Connecting To Nature ' .
Otherwise if you say ' bak to basics ' .
And who said something better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi often said, "One mustcare out a World One will not see", that is, our duty is to think about it, be cautious of it.
Once you're tired, there's a new life in the fresh air opening the doors and windows of the house.
When the five ghosts that our body is formed , the five ghosts are contacted , then from you there is a new life , a new ghost in our body .
We all saw it, but he didn't think of it, we couldn't put it in a rope in a formula.
Then you must see that whenever you get together with different natural conditions, there will be a new consciousness within you.
And that's why we must have our own expeditions across the world to join nature on June 5.
We'll get some results of what our ancestors have done to protect the environment.
If we protect the environment, our next generation will get its fruit.
Weed - This world and the environment are considered to be the source of energy.
We're told here: Mother Earth: son Ahm Prithvibah:
Web-A says that the sacred one among us is for our world.
The earth is our mother and we are her children.
If we think of Lord Buddha then one thing comes out that the birth of Mahatma Buddha , his knowledge and his Mahapranivana - three were in the tree .
But we need him to be associated with modern discussions.
I have news from different states this time.
As soon as the rain comes, almost all the kingdoms start a big campaign to plant trees.
Crores of trees are planted.
The whole world celebrates this day as ' World Yoga Day ' .
In a very short time on 21 June this ' World Yoga Day ' has achieved extension everywhere , is taking care of people .
On one hand many powers that create distinctions in the world show their deformity , at this time the World Yoga Day is a major contribution of India .
Through Yoga, we tied the whole world into one source.
The way Yoga connects the body , mind , intelligence and soul together , the same way Yoga is also connecting the world together .
Consumption of opposite medicines and cutting off days - in this situation Yoga exercise has a big role in getting an unconscious life .
Yoga is not just one exercise , health is enforced , it is possible to feel this mixture in body , mind , judgement and by the only yoga exercise .
Two days ago, I wrote a letter to the government of all the countries of the world, all the leaders.
Last year I announced some competitions related to yoga, and I announced some awards.
A funny offer.
He said - this is the third international yoga day, I request three generations of the same family to exercise together on this third international yoga day.
Whether it is cough or grandmother , grandmother , mother - father , son - daughter should exercise three generations together , and upload its pictures .
Yesterday , today and tomorrow , a lucky mixture of this will show a new direction .
I'm thanking for this offer, and I think we've been launching the campaign of Suffie with Daughter, and creating a pleasant experience, the pictures of these three generations of yoga, the entire country and the world.
You must be ' Narendra Modi Ap ' - through which ' My Gov ' - where three generations of people are doing yoga together , these three generations will send me pictures together .
This will be tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow, which will be a beautiful tomorrow's guarantee.
I'll invite you all.
There are more than three weeks left for international yoga.
Start habits from today.
You also propagate about comfortable yoga for three weeks , spread , care for people .
It's the movement of a kind of representative healthcare.
I'll invite you all to participate in this.
From the day you gave me the job as the chief server, and I had the chance to talk to Lalkilla about my first August 15, that day I told you about cleanliness.
From that day onwards, I have come to different parts of India.
In Modiji, TV and social media, I'm often watching wherever you are going, all the people there are paying special attention to cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people have accepted purifying publicity as a mission on your advent.
Smalls with the elders are also aware of cleanliness.
Many times small and big , seeing the jewellery they barred them .
From the Kashi Valley, the cleanness you started, has taken the face of an invoicing movement through your inspiration.
You said right, wherever I go, there is a governmental sufficiency work, but nowadays there is a festival of cleanliness in society.
But when this phone call came, I also thought and saw that yes, it's okay.
The rest will be ready to welcome the Prime Minister, but it will be the first to be clean.
It's going to enjoy any people self-reliant.
I'd like to thank everybody for insisting on this cleanness.
Somebody gave me a proposal.
Well, it's a funny proposal.
I don't know if I can do that.
Modiji , when you go to any instrument then tell me , if you instruct me then what kind of cleanness will be , how many tons of furnaces will you give me a gift , on that basis I will fix my going .
Dude is very good, but I have to think.
It's okay that the movement must be done, and the gift will clear a few tons of journals instead of other things.
How many people we'll save from illness.
How big humanity will work.
Once I can accept it as ' wealth', we'll have a new way of Waste Management.
Start-up - The youngsters associated with it will come forward with new plans, the new instruments.
Hopefully, these four thousand cities will be dried up in the dry dress blue Dustbin-A and the wet dress green Dustbin.
Embroidery of kitchen , like vegetable skin , bright , eggs open , leaves of trees - all these wet decorations - Green Dustbin - A .
All these things that take place in the field of agriculture , if the color of eating is green - then you will remember what to do with green Dustbin -LRB- what to do -RRB- .
And the rest of the decorations like unnecessary paper , iron , card board , glass , clothes , plastic , polythene , rubber and other metal things which have to be recycled in machines are generally not used , they have to be used in blue Dustbin .
I believe we can make such a habit, and we have to take new steps to purification, and we can fulfil the dream of Gandhiji's cleanness.
Today, I want to mention a word with pride that if a person is supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be, then how big a movement can be created.
Pleasure is the same thing.
In the past, you've heard a news... the magnificent Barsova Beach of Mumbai has become a clean, clean Barsova Beach today.
But it wasn't sudden, a citizen changed the pictures of the Barsova Beach, working for 80-90 weeks... by removing thousands of tons of dirt and making Barsova Beach clean, clean, beautiful.
And the versova Residentevolunter took over its full responsibility.
One person, Mr. Afroz Shah, is very powerful in this work from October 2015, and gradually many more people are involved in this work and it takes the form of a movement.
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has denied Afroz Shah for this work.
That's the first Indian who was awarded the Champions of the Arth award.
I knew that the local women gave the most leadership to this work.
They mixed the fish to create awareness among the masses, every street, every home, and they've inspired everyone to do this.
I'm intimately greetings to all these mothers and sisters.
I'm also greeting the rulers of Jammu and Kashmir for a beautiful information that makes a block out of the open space.
My beloved countrymen, the present government's last three years of work, are being discussed in the paper papers, in different TV channels, in the social media.
Three years ago, you gave me the chief servant.
People from all over the society have analyzed it.
This is a good tradition for democracy.
I'm also thanking all those people who gave critical and important feedback, get a chance to rectify them in the work of misunderstanding, deficiency.
For an aware nation, this criticism is very important for an aware nation.
My beloved countrymen , I and a little citizen like you because of which the effect of the good and bad effects of a small citizen is seen in me as well .
There are hundreds of families who wrote this to me.
As a simple man, as a little citizen, it has a special impact on my mind, this incident encouraged me.
I'm grateful to Akbar.
Come on, we're all gonna love nature in this environment.
I'm telling you a lot of good news.
What's the mind, April 2017
My beloved countrymen, Namskar
And we've seen a lot of things that enjoy kids, the greatness of the young generation, the foolishness of the elders.
Every time the input of the "Mann Ki Baat" is analyzed his books under the government.
What kind of advice, what's the complaint, what's the feeling of people, etc.
On the whole, people's nature suggests to others.
On the train, if someone wants to go to the bus, then you can say that immediately.
But when I tried to see them carefully, I got upset.
Most of the people have sent advice, trying to reach me, who really did something in their life.
They tried to do something good according to their own strength, strength, strength and chance.
And when I understand it, I think all these suggestions are not simple.
All this came from the survival of the people.
Some people think they're working where they're working, and they're getting out of this thing, so if they're listening to those things, then they can create a comprehensive form, it can make many people useful.
Not only this, when I mention anything, I remember all this and very happy.
I've never been able to imagine that we have been working in our country for a long time.
For a few years, I knew that some social organizations have been working on this, but my country's young people have been working on this.
Many have sent me a video.
There are many places where the roti bank is being run.
People put their roots on the root banks, store the vegetables, and the poorest people are, they collect them for themselves.
Those who are giving, they love, and they don't even think they're small.
The way it works through cooperation in society, it's his example.
The last day of the month of April.
Paila May was recognized as Gujarat and Maharashtra.
On this occasion, the people of the two kingdoms are not very happy to me.
Both the states have been trying to reach the new goal of development and have been involved in the development of the country.
And in both the kingdoms, the princes come together and their lifestyle in every field of society continues to inspire us.
We must imagine our kingdom, our people's country, their society, their cities, their families, to reach the height of the two states, that is, 75 years after Independence in 2022.
The plan should be taken to implement this sympathy, and all citizens must enhance the help of this work.
The warmth in our country, it's time to feel in March-April.
When I was consulting people in Kiwat, I suggested what should be done in this summer and gave it to humans.
It's all about it, it's not new, but it's useful to think again at a specific time.
And I've noticed that the family's little ones are doing this.
Once they understand why the water should be filled, they go to see if they have water in the pot ten times a day.
And see if the birds are here.
I think it's going on a game, but it's really a strange way to wake up the boys.
In our country, we live together with animals and birds, colored in their colors, yet we must put more emphasis on their conservation.
When I was the Chief Minister in Gujarat, a hundred years was completed by Sayidna Saheb, the religious leader of the Bohra Samaj.
He lived for 103 years.
And for a hundred years, the Bohra society runs a big campaign to save the slaves through the Burhani Foundation.
I had a chance to switch off this mission.
About a thousand bird feeders spread them to the corners of the world.
Guinness Book of World Records has made this expedition.
Sometimes I was so stunned that I'd forgotten to give some water before them in the summer.
Young friends, I want to talk to you.
Sometimes I think some of our young people are funny to live from the rest of the zone.
Their parents also reinforced them in a single hat.
Some people go through the best resistance, but most of the people live this life.
Now the test is over, a lot of plans have been made to enjoy the holidays.
It's very funny to get warm in the summer.
But I want to talk about how to take your holiday as a friend.
I believe some people must work for me and tell me.
Sometimes seeing something on TV, listening to it to a booking or to a well-known person and feeling it on yourself.
Well, testing can be sufficient, just like to get out of the restzone.
We're middle family, happy family.
What friends, do you ever think I'm gonna take a ticket to the train's second class room and take a 24-hour trip.
Sometimes you feel it, I don't mean to repeat it, but do it one-and-a-half.
In the evening, take your football, take a volley or other sports surgeon to go to a deserted town.
Play yourself with those poor boys, you'll see, you'll never get this fun of playing in life.
When the children who live in society will have a chance to deal with you, do you think how big changes will come in those children's life
This experience will tell you a lot.
A lot of self-reliant organizations are working on this service.
Sometimes there are many summary camps organised by the personalitidevelopment, which leads to a variety of developments.
If you're taking part in the Samar camp, you're doing personality development courses, you're free to go to the people of the society who've been devoted to all these courses, teach them what you learned.
You can learn how to do all this.
We regret that technological interference has come to reduce the distance, but the consequence is that there are six people in the same house, but the interference between them has increased so much, which is imagined.
Everyone is busy somewhere else through a new process.
Staying together is a reform, that's a power.
Secondly, I want to tell you skills, you don't want to teach something new
I'm trying every kind of fruit, I'll lose myself.
Sometimes we're scared, we're not going to be robots.
A little bit of emphasis can be made to improve skills.
Staying away from technic, somebody learns musical instruments, somebody learns Tamil, Telugu, Assam, Bengal, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathy or Punjabi, five to five to five sentences... how different are we in our country... if we look around.... somebody finds friends.
If you don't know, swim, take pictures, you can't be a good picture, but you can try something on the paper.
You want to learn to drive the car, sometimes you want to learn the auto-rickshaw
You see these new experiments, its skills will give you enjoyment and you will get rid of the life that has been enclosed.
Get out of mythology, do something, guys.
This is the chance to make life.
You're wondering if all the tests are finished, then you'll learn to go to the new career, but you won't get the chance.
You're gonna be in trouble again, so I'll tell you, if you're gonna learn to teach your magic, then learn at least the magic of that.
Keep showing your friends magic.
Try to know something that you don't know, you must be benefited.
The human qualities within you will be awakened... and there will be a lot of steps to improve.
I'm telling you, I can't imagine what we can learn and see the world.
New places, new cities, new towns, new villages, new areas.
But when I'm going before I'm gonna see the rituals there, and there's something like meditation, understanding, discussion among people, asking, all this is done, but the joy of seeing that new place increases.
Stay in the same place for four days.
Go to another place and stay for three-four days.
You can learn a lot from this.
Where did you go
You use the Hash Tag Incredible India to share your experience.
Friends, this time the Indian government has given you a good opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from Nagad Lenden.
They need cash.
They started to believe in digital companies.
But if someone refers to someone else or uses someone else and that new man refers to mean three times, you'll get the money to do this.
Your account will get ten rupees from the government.
If you take 20 people a day, you'll get 200 rupees in the evening.
Businessmen may also have income, students may also have income.
This plan is on October 14, it's your fault to build a digital India.
Now the red wind is gone, so nobody can say that the red monkey is in the mind, it's probably out.
I got an interesting phone call.
This phone shows the danger, but this phone shows that the ordinary people didn't like it at all, they felt a distance.
"Namsker Prime Minister, I am telling Jabalpur, Shiva Choube from Madhya Pradesh.
I want to tell you something about the government's Red Bacon Light Ban.
I don't have to burst in traffic jams, and I don't have to wait for anyone.
I'd like to thank you so much for this.
Pe's grandfather is also cleaning up, thank you for this.
"It's part of the government's system to burn the lights in the car.
But we have to avoid this idea from our minds.
We all have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that our history must remind our culture, our heritage.
That's why we synthesis power, inspiration.
This year, we're supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be.
Century is considered to be enough for the world's native country, but India is such an important nation that we have a chance to remind her of thousands of years or more.
Thousands of years ago, he took the order to enter their temple and succeeded.
We're so lucky that some of the great ancestors were born in the country to contradict the evils of all ages.
In the fastest celebration of the Santaranjacharya, we can take inspiration from him to achieve the concept of the source of power for social unity.
Tomorrow, Pyla May, the Indian government is showing a pattern in the memory of Santa.
I'm reminding Santaranjucharya of faith, I'm promising.
Dear countrymen, tomorrow's Payla May date has another significance.
In many places of the world this day is celebrated as a religious day .
And when the workers talk about the day, the workers and the serpents talk, I'm gonna remember the words of Babasaheb, this is normal.
Very little people know that we are grateful to Dadasaheb Ambassador for the help of the workers who are honored today.
Father's role in working welfare is unforgettable.
Today, when I am talking about Dadasaheb's compassionate and peaceful Ramanujacharya, I also remember the greatest saint and socialist of Karnataka, Jagatguru Basbeshwar.
In the twentieth century he discussed the work and work of workers in Kannada.
He said in Kannada: "Kay Koy Kailas."
This means that you can reach Shiva's Alaikailas through hard work.
Today, when I talk to the workers, it's very simple to remember Dattopant Tangdi.
My beloved countrymen, we will follow Buddhapurnima a few days later.
All the Buddhist religions of the world celebrate the festival that day.
And in India, the journey from war to Buddha is a unique symbol.
Especially for our neighbouring states.
Consider collaboration between the neighbouring countries of India - their development may also happen.
There's a lot of work on the international level.
In the next 5th, India will launch 'Dakshin Asia Satilite'.
The chances of this satellite will be specially helpful in the economic and other development areas of Asian countries.
Among them, the measurement of natural resources, telemedicine, education, innovation and mankind's involvement, and this satellite of South Asia will help us in the progress of the whole world.
In order to enhance cooperation with the entire South Asia, there is now an important step towards India - an invaluable gift, a suitable example of our obligation to South Asia.
I know all those countries in South Asia that are connected to this Southeastern satellite project for this special effort - my good wishes for them.
What's the mind, March 2017
Most families in every corner of the country are busy testing their children.
There's some comfort where the test is over, and where the test is going, all the families are still under pressure.
But once I'm gonna tell you that last time I've heard what I told the students about what I said.
You must use those things at the time of the test.
On 26th March.
On March 26, the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
Historical fight against injustice, the wonderful victory of the Bangladeshi people under the leadership of Bangladesh.
Today, on this great day, I'm very happy to give freedom to the Bangkok citizens and sisters.
And I imagine that the Bangladeshi progress, development, and the Bangladeshi people will also assure that India will be a powerful partner, a good friend of Bangladesh and we will join the shoulders to provide peace, safety and development in the entire region.
We're all proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memory, the heritage of our two countries.
The Bengali music is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
A very interesting fact about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is that in 1913 he was not only the first person of Asia to be honored with the Nobel Prize, but also gave him the title of Nighthood.
And when the British sworn in in the Jalianwala Bagh in 1919 , the navy of the navy was among the great men who were sweet and at that time when a child of twelve years had a deep impact on this incident .
Friends and fields... with a new face to the boy's life... the ruinous killing of Jalian Walbag.
And in 1919, 12-year-old boy, the glory of all of us, the honourable glory of all of us.
Three days before this , on 23rd March , Lord Singh and his companion Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know that the events of March 23 - Bhagwad Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru were not satisfied with the service of Bharat Maa .
All the dreams of life were sacrificed to India's mother's release.
And that three virgins are still our inspiration.
We can't describe the sacrifices of Bhagwan Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
The entire British administration was scared of these three youths.
They're prisoner, right on the day of Fansi, but they've been worried about what they can do with them.
And so on March 24, where it was fascinated, it was 23rd.
It's been hiding. It's not normal.
And after that the British slapped their dead body in today's Punjab.
A lot of years ago when I got a chance to go there, I felt the component of that land.
And I must tell the youngsters of the country , whenever you get a chance to go to Punjab , go to the tomb of Lord Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru , Lord Singh and Batukeshwar Datt .
At this time, the foolishness of freedom, his intensity, his wrath grew.
On one side, the virgins like Bhagwad Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru inspired the youth.
On the other hand, just 100 years before today, on 10th April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi acted in Champaran.
This year Champaran fulfilled hundreds of years.
In India ' s freedom struggle Gandhi thoughts and Gandhi style , its appearance was seen in Champaran for the first time .
This was a change in the entire movement of freedom, especially from the point of view of the moral system.
This festival , architect of Champaran , archer Satyagraha , architects of the factory in Ahmedabad , and in all these there was a deep impact of Mahatma Gandhi ' s thoughts and style of work .
In 1915 Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, on the picture of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds, we cannot value Champaran Satyagraha.
Imagine a man who came back to Hindustan in 1915, worked only two years.
And Champaran Satyagraha was the same where Mahatma Gandhi ' s consolidated trick , Mahatma Gandhi ' s strength to know the drains and dresses of Indian society , Mahatma Gandhi ' s instruments against the British administration , the creation , inspiring , bringing an unknowing person to fight , a unique power was exhibited .
So we can feel the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think of Gandhi a hundred years ago, that champion is a satyagraha of Gandhi, then entering the organs of the lifetime that champion is really a deep study for a person.
We can learn from him how hard we have to work and how Gandhi did.
And he was a time when Tabd leaders whom we heard, were Rajendrababu, Acharya Kripalani, sent everyone to the village.
On one hand if you fill the jail then on the other hand put yourself in the construction work .
A wonderful balance was between Gandhi's style of functioning.
What can be the meaning of reality, what can be unsuccessful, what can be the meaning of inconvenience in front of such a big empire - Gandhi presented a complete new ideal through a successful presentation not only through words.
Everyone's happiness in the world - the unprecedented effort to root this mantra for the country, to show something for the society will fulfill the dream of all the princes who gave life to the country's freedom.
And in this twentieth century there are any Indians who don't want changes, who don't want to be participants in the progress of the country.
A new India - New I India-Ray seeds will be produced by a hundred fifty-five million Indians.
There are many people who go to the hospital regularly to serve the patients.
Our country is the service of Ratn Garva and the Lord of Johnsevai - this thought is our birthplace.
If we see this idea as an organization, then we can understand how big it is.
If there is a discussion on the issue of India, there is a different opinion and perspective that comes up, it is very simple and unnecessary.
But it is also true that if the entire countryman imagines and takes the prescribed steps to realise it, then the dreams of the new India can be successful.
It's not necessary that the work must be done in budget or government spending.
If every citizen imagines that they follow the traffic rules , follow their own destiny , keep the use of petrol and diesel in the week at least one day , then through this small step we will be new I .
I'm gonna see the dream of being square... and I'm gonna tell you, everybody follows his own citizen's religion, follow the tales.
This way, the creation of a new India can be signed.
Tomorrow 2022 - this is going to be the sixty-five years of India's independence.
I'm calling you, come, let's imagine your life and take part in this journey from Swaraj to Suraj.
My dear countrymen, I want to thank you today.
Bhima App started two-and-a-half months ago, but almost one and a half people already downloaded it.
We have to go ahead to fight against my favorite countrymen, black money and corruption.
You can't even imagine, this way you can be a big participant across the country, reflect yourself against black money and corruption.
A few days back ' Digidhan Mela ' was organised for public education and awareness .
Approximately two and a half lakh people have received certain awards for enjoyment and seventy thousand people have received certain awards for traders .
Come on, we're gonna join this attempt to lose the use of Nagad Lenden and NOT.
My dear countrymen, I'm glad that whenever you want advice for 'Man Ki Baat', there's a lot of condolences.
But I figured that there was no interest in cleanliness.
I think the cleanness is necessary to understand the common man.
I'll go through a river every day, where people throw a lot of errors and destroy the river.
This river is coming through Rispana bridge and our houses have flown along .
To keep this river clean, I went to the neighborhood and told people, I missed it, but there was no special advantage.
I'll request you to send a team here or publish this thing through the newspaper.
Brothers and sisters, you see how hard a girl from the eleventh class is.
How crazy he sees the dirty fucking fucking fucking river
I think it's a good signal.
I just want 125 million people to be angry with the depression.
Once there is anger, unsatisfaction, we can do something in the campaign against the depression.
It's a good thing that Gayatri has expressed his anger, suggested me and told me together that he tried a lot, but failed.
Since the movement of cleanliness has started, awareness has increased.
Everyone is connected to it in a positive way.
It took a movement.
The hate of the fury is growing gradually.
Whether man is aware, actively participants, organisations, it has its own importance.
Seriously this movement is possible.
It's hard to work, but we have to do it.
I believe that the awareness of the country's newborns, boys, students, youths, is indicating a better regulation.
Today I'm supposed to tell all the people who are listening to Gayatri, as if Gayatri spoke to us all.
I don't have half of my belly, and I'll leave it there.
We've ever seen how disappearing we've thrown the fools we've eaten.
Have you ever seen this if you don't get digested then how poor people can fill the stomach.
There's nothing to explain about it separately.
Normally when mother feeds small children in our house then she says , take as much as you can eat .
There are some attempts in this morm, but in spite of this, indifference, social inequality.
This is injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if there is a synergy, the family will also have a financial advantage.
It is good for the society to think , but this thing is such that families will also get relief from it .
I don't want to say anything about this, but I want to grow awareness.
I know some young men who are involved in this kind of movement.
The newborns of our country work like this.
This kind of people will be found somewhere in all the states of the country.
Their work can add to our inspiration, so that we don't digest food.
We'll take as much as we eat.
This is the way to change.
And those who are healthy , they always say - keep plate too empty , keep stomach too empty .
When we come to health only then we say , 7th April ' World Health Day ' .
Till 2030 the National Union Health Coverage i . e . "Health for all."
This time the National Union has given special attention to the depression on the World Health Day on 7th April.
According to a hissev, more than fifteen million people in the world are victims of mental depression.
The problem is that most of us are victims of this disease, but we don't understand it, and maybe it's funny to talk openly.
I want to tell my countrymen, there is no depression that cannot be freed from him.
When he creates a psychological exercise, he starts getting rid of it.
First of all, depression - don't suppress him and he needs expression.
With your friends' parents, with brothers and sisters, open your mind to the teacher... what's going on inside you.
Did you ever think that man was doing this
You should be sure, this is the first symptom of depression.
If someone wants to stay out of the middle of everyone, keep in mind - don't let him be alone.
Let's stay with those whom he likes to stay.
Hey, Hullod, encouraging him to open his mind in funny words, find out what he's hiding in his heart.
In diseases like diabetes , like physical weakness , insensitivity reduces the consciousness of the human being , weakens courage , reduces the strength of fighting lifestyle , destroys all our lifestyle .
You'll come back to your confidence if you start to solve other problems with service.
If you can select yourself with others , you can serve and if you can do it in abnormally , see if your mind gets lighter in exercise .
Yoga practices, but the best way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is an extremely effective method for freedom from psychology , freedom from patience and happiness .
Every year 21 June ' International Yoga Day ' is celebrated .
If you have to give some advice on ' International Yoga Day ' then send me all these thoughts through my mobile app .
As much as you can write poems , songs , keep writing so that a glimpse can come in common man .
Now I'm gonna say something to my mother and sister.
A few days ago, the Indian government has taken an important decision.
That's why the Indian government has taken a very important decision.
During the pregnancy of working women , during pregnancy , during pregnancy and pregnancy -LRB- pregnancy -RRB- the maternal holidays that were given during pregnancy were 12 weeks .
There are only two or three countries in the world.
When these children grow up, the country's wealth.
The New Year Festival is different in different parts of our country.
In Maharashtra ' Gudi Pawa ' , ' Ugadi ' , ' Sindhi ' Chati Chand ' , ' Kashmiri ' Navreh ' , ' Avadh ' , ' Judi shila ' in the Mithilla of Bihar , ' Satwani ' festival is celebrated in Magadh in the New Year .
The vast country is in India.
I'll give you all the joys of the new year
Thank you so much
What's the mind, February 2017
The bird's artillery brings a funny joy.
Not only flowers, but fruits are bright in the branches of the trees.
The results of the summer harvest are also seen in the spring.
Likewise, in the field of yellow mustard yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow.
The red flower of Palash signals the arrival of Holi.
Amir Khasru describes this time of climate change.
He wrote: Out of the forest, the mustard is blowing, the pushing cockel is calling, the well-kuy.
When the color of joy in nature, when it touches the jealousy of jealousy, humans also enjoy that.
Bastar-Punchami, Mahashivratri and Holly Festival color the life of man.
And so he said I'm telling you something about 104 satellites and interceptor missiles.
Shobaji thanked you so much, you reminded me of the pride of India.
Whether fighting poverty, protecting themselves from illness, connecting with the world, technologies and science have proven their role.
On February 15, 1970, a glorious day in India.
Our scientists have raised our heads to the world.
And we know that in a few years Isro was completed with some unprecedented success.
Mars Mission, on the wild planet, established a world record for space expeditions just after the success of sending 'Manglayan'.
India's first country to create history by sending 104 satellites together.
And it's a pleasure that this is the 38th serial launch of P-S-L-V.
It's not just ISRO, it's a historic success for the whole of India.
This cost of ISRO showed a strange specific specimen of space worldwide, and that's why we praised the scientists of India in the world openly.
Especially my farmer brother's sisters will know how much water is in our country, how to use it, how to look into it - our new satellite cartosat 2D will help in all this.
We've sent some photos to our satellite room.
That's what you're doing.
It's very funny for us that our young scientists, our women scientists, who led all this campaign.
This rare collaboration of young men and women is a very glorious aspect of Israel's success.
I appreciate the Georgian scientists of Israel on behalf of the countrymen.
For ordinary people, they have always set out the purpose of using masculine science for the nation and have created new credits every day.
Our scientists, they don't appreciate Tim as much as we appreciate.
Shobaji has another question and it's related to India's security.
India has completed the successful test of Ballisticinterseptor Missile for defense.
In Interception technology, Balian has supplied success by hiding about a hundred kilometres from the ground at the time of his testimony.
This is one of the most important achievements for defense.
When I see a new technology, we're happy to see a new scientific success.
And asking has played a big role in the development of human life.
And whoever doesn't let him ask as a question, he also transmits in him, finds a new request, creates a new request.
And that's why asking is the reason for a new discovery.
They're not quiet until the answer is found.
And if we see the stream of human life for thousands of years, we can say that human life is no longer a complete breakdown.
Rehabilitation is impossible.
The universe, the laws of creation, the effort to know the human beings, continues.
New science, new technology is born of him.
And every technology, every new form of science, gives birth to a new age.
My beloved youngsters, when we talk about science, talk about the hard work of the psychologists, I recall what kind of fountain should I say that the younger generation should be attracted to science.
There are many scientists in the country.
Today's scientific information about a permanent change in the life of the next generation.
When science researches and discovers some of the common man's needs, and how the discovery comes to the masses, the science becomes a common man, then science becomes great.
This is where I saw an introduction to our daily poor masons.
All such inventions were found from this race.
Different services are going to accelerate technology.
It's an integral part of life.
India's digital transactions are increasing.
Especially the youth society is getting rid of the digital payment from their hands.
I think it's a good symptom.
The "Lucky Graphic Organisation", the "DG wealth business plan" has a great deal.
It's almost two months, from these two plans, 15 thousand people are getting one thousand rupees per day.
A lot of people got one lakh rupees in this plan.
You've got more than four thousand businessmen.
Mahishur's Shreeman Santosh has made a happy news of 'Narendramodi-App' that he received a thousand rupees in the 'Lucky Grahak' plan.
Then I think you should shove with you what the brilliant sage has written.
I'm so glad to know this, Santoshji, your name and work both have enjoyed us all.
On one hand, as he's driving, the other is an ambassador of the "Lucky Grahkozone".
The passengers of the car are also conscious of the digital system with indignation and in that enthusiasm, many more have started taking part in the digital system.
A young monk from Maharashtra is worshiping Namada in the form of a posterior family in the form of a card , i-wallet and discussing his feelings with his friends about how happy they are about this.
One lakh rupees are specially important for him and he is encouraging others to take it to a mission.
This work plays an important role in a fight against corruption and black money.
Give me a memorable one.
A few days ago, Dadasaheb's 125-year-old life was lost.
Remembering him, you teach at least 125 people to update Bheem.
Teach how to deal with it.
So I want to say, we have to strengthen the foundation that Dr. Dadasaheb Ambadkar founded.
We'll go home and get everybody to the 125 million people to get 'Bheem' app.
For the last three months, this movement has been going on, its success is being achieved in many villages and cities.
My beloved countrymen, there are many contributions to agriculture in our country's economy.
The economic power of the village gives strength to the country's economic growth.
Today I want to tell you a joy.
Our farmer brothers and sisters worked hard and filled the food.
Our country's farmers' hard work has produced most of the grains this year.
It's all kinds of information that our workers broke all the old records.
This year, the way the crops were flooded in the fields, every day it looks like Pongal or Vaishali festivals.
This year more than seven million tons of food has been produced in the country.
Our last jewelry was written, eight percent more than that.
It's a wonderful achievement.
I would like to thank the farmers of the country.
I'm glad the farmers of the country heard the poor, about two and a half million hectare of pulses have been grown in the land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service of farmers to the poor.
I resisted a request from my country's farmers, brothers and sisters who worked hard, produced the record amount of pulses, so they were of my special thanks.
My dear countrymen, in our country, some programmes are being carried out by the government, by the society, through various institutions, through the organisations.
Something or the other appears to be a kind of clarity.
Seminare in the shutdown of the Telengana state, the simplicity of purity has been straightened.
On 17th and 18th February, the Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organized in Hyderabad.
The six-house toilet pit has been cleared and the officials showed how to use the TwinPit Toilet.
They also showed how difficult this new method is to defecate, and there is no other discomfort or complicit mental obstacle until it is cleared.
We also do small sufficient work, just like we can clean the toilet pits.
A Standard Twoin Pittoilet for six members is over five-four years.
Our farmers are well aware of the NPK.
Different government departments and different ways of purification.
For the first time in March, women and children's development ministry and the same tribe will be involved in the promotional cleansing campaign.
On the second side of March, another two constituents will run 'Naupravana Mantra' and 'Jalsampad, River Development and Ganga Reorganization' constituent cleansing campaign.
We know that when any citizen of our country works in particular, the whole country gets a new power, the self-confidence increases.
We all welcomed the way our Dibang players did in Rio Parlippics.
India lost Pakistan in the 'Blind T20 WorldCop Final' held this month and developed the country's gloriously by becoming world champion.
I'm reassuring all the players of this team.
The country is glorified by the success of our two friends.
I don't always know that Dibang brothers and sisters are accomplished, strong cheerful, courageous and imaginative.
We'll always learn something new from them.
Whether it's for sports or space science, the girls of our country are not behind anywhere.
They moved in their feet and glorifies the country in their own success.
A few days ago, our female players won rare medals in the Asian Ragbisevens' trophy.
I'm greeting all these players.
The movement is fast moving.
It's not just a government option, it's now a social consciousness and public education campaign.
Ordinary people have joined this project in the last two years.
All the flames that are being found from every corner of the country are compelled to think of ordinary people and men's minds are changing the old customs that have been going on for years.
It's really funny when news is that the festival has emerged at the birth of the daughter-in-law.
This kind of emotional thinking towards Kanyasantan shows the way for social acceptance.
I came to know that the 'Cuddalore' district of Tamil Nadu was compelled to shut down the militia by running a specific operation.
So far, more than 175 battalions have been closed.
More than 55-60 thousand bank accounts have been opened in the 'Success Prosperity Plan'.
In the 'Har Hall Dastak' program in Madhya Pradesh, every village is being organized to teach the daughter-in-law in every village.
"Your children are trying to encourage the students to go to the school again without finishing their education through the "Your school" campaign.
The new imagination is also linked to it.
It has been changed according to local requirements.
You're actively connected to it.
I can know something from you.
What's going on in the world, the poor people of the village are coming to me to think.
I'm very grateful to help you.
What's the mind, August 2019
Perhaps our ancestors decorated our climate, economic structure, social orders in such a way that there is no calmness in society.
In the last few days, we celebrated a lot of festivals.
Yesterday, Sri Krishna's birth anniversary has fled to the whole of India.
Sri Krishna is a person who has created innocence, new inspiration and innocence in every festival even after thousands of years, which is our imagination.
He can still be an example of any problem, inspiration.
Anyone who can find a solution to the present problem from Sri Krishna's life.
On the other hand, even though such a great personality can be said to be ready to work in the desert.
Sometimes climbing up the mountains and sometimes stopping the food... as if it's all about it.
Today, when I'm talking to you, I'm heading towards two mouths.
A surprising mouth, another surrounding mouth.
Sudarshan Chakradi Mohan leaves the banks of Yamuna river and goes to Dwarka town on the seashore of Gujarat and spent the last day of his life in Delhi on the banks of Yamuna, the mouth of the sea.
In that situation, a few thousand years ago, Sudarshan Chakradhi used his own intelligence, courage and imagination to get rid of the war.
My dear countrymen, I'm talking about Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary.
On the Porbandar seashore, which we call today Kirti Mandir, was born only on October 2, 1869, only a person born in 1869, who had shown human history a native path, created a new creation.
He served those who weren't given the reward of Mill's wealth.
He considered to serve poor, helpless, sick, hungry and hungry persons as the most talent of his life.
He used to serve the leprosy in order to prove the wrong ideas of the common people about the leprosy so that others might be impressed.
Anybody wherever he is, whenever he gets in danger, Mahatma Gandhi would leave to help him.
He didn't just emphasize the service, he knew the importance of the self-sufficiency that served.
The word 'Seva' can only be achieved if it is done with joy, then it becomes 'Seva parent religion'.
But as soon as the real joy is 'Swat Sukha', this idea is also uninterrupted in the service.
It's easy to understand Gandhiji's life.
In the life of Mahatma Gandhi, the person and society, humanity and humanity were the only concern.
Africa's Phoenix Farm - Whether this is the Tolstoy Farm, the Almighty Ashram or Wardha, he gave importance to the community mobilisation in the development of society.
My life's most lucky luck is a chance to go to the various places of Mahatma Gandhi's faith.
With Gandhiji's serving, he also gave importance to complications.
We want to use these two ideas of social service and social violence, community publicity and community mobilization.
Will we come and go. Can we accept it
There's no obstacle, if he works in the mind of the whole self-sufficient self-esteem.
My dear countrymen, I went to Gujrat's dandy a few months ago.
A number of programs, competitions, demonstrations, etc. are being organized in the next day.
I'll give you a good news.
In this, Haripura panels were specially entertaining.
You remember the Congress session at Haripura in Gujarat, where Subhas Chandra Bose was nominated in the history of Congress Presidential election.
This is a beautiful past of Art Panels.
In 1937-38, before the Congress Haripuri session, Mahatma Gandhi invited Nandlal Bose, the then president of Shantiniketan.
Gandhiji wanted to show the lifestyle of people living in India through artificial, and may be exhibited during this Art Work session.
This is the Nandlal Boss whose artwork of the Constitution.
The Constitution gives a new identity.
This church of his artistic art has also immortalized Nandlal Bose with the Constitution.
Nandlal Bose checked the villages around Haripra and then produced some particles about rural India.
This precious sculpture was discussed in Venice.
And once with Gandhiji's admiration of a year, I'm asking every Indian to envisage something or the other.
For the country, for society, something else needs to be done.
This will be our beautiful, truthful and real reverence to Bapu.
You mother of India, you must remember that for the last few years, we have launched 'Cleanliness Service' campaign across the country for two weeks before 2nd October.
This year it will start from 11th September.
This time we need to put a special emphasis on plastic.
This campaign is encouraged by all kinds of people in the society.
Many of my businessmen put a placard in a storehouse, where Kharidder is written, as if he came with his throat.
It can also save money and show its partnership to protect the environment.
This time, on October 2, when Bapur leaves for half year, he will not be able to surrender to India alone in open space, on that day a new mobilisation platform will be set up against the plastic.
I want to ask all sections of the society, everygram, muffle and city residents, and ask for a jeopardy, that this year's Gandhi Jayanti may possess our India to get rid of the plastic jungle.
Let's flee as a special day on October 2.
It can be called a cycle.
It can also be used as burning.
There's no need to be seen here for inspiration, none bigger than Gandhiji can be inspiring.
My beloved countrymen, our culture, a vessel of knowledge.
Today, I want to touch a very important thing with a culture, it's a matter written in the past, but it still has great significance.
The fools call stones as gems.
Our culture has a lot of importance of food.
Even we have converted food information into science.
We all need a balanced and nutritious diet, especially for women and newborns.
Man is fighting against malnutrition in a new and entertaining way.
On the day of the crops, the sabikas of Anganwadi collected a pearl from everyone.
This food was used to make hot food for children and women.
That's why those who donate will become a caretaker citizen and social worker.
After that, the person dedicates himself to this objective and becomes a soldier in this movement.
Liquid food is not solid food.
In Gujarat, in 2010, it was decided to give a sufficient food to the child in the non-proliferation program, so that the human mind gets aware of it.
It's a very important industry that can be taken everywhere.
In many states people celebrate the 'third meal' campaign.
If there is a birthday, a good day, a memories in any family, then members of the family go to Anganwadi, school by making tasty, nutritious food and the family members feed their own children, share their joy in everybody, which increases fun.
This way, a strange mix of service and joy can be found.
Friends, there are so little things that our country can fight against malnutrition.
Today due to lack of awareness ' malnutrition' has influenced both poor and rich people in the family.
Possession expedition will be celebrated throughout the country in September.
You must join this campaign, collect information and join a new idea.
If you can save two men from malnutrition, then our country will also be saved from malnutrition.
This time, when I'm supposed to think about "What vaat", I was convinced that there will be a lot of questions on this matter and that's it.
The last few weeks, wherever I went, and whom I saw, the 'Man Vs Wild' episode took place.
Through this episode, I have been alone with the youth of the world, not only India, but I have never thought that there would be a place in the minds of the youth.
I never thought that our country and the world's youth looked forward to how strange things.
Last week, I went to Bhotan.
That's what I feel.
Tiger, Laion, I am astonished as a living creature that can make people glad about how much.
My firm belief is that people now want to know the steps taken by the Climate Justice Oclean Environment.
Is this admit later
Look, there's no secret.
Some people have questions about this, so I'm eradicating this mystery.
It's not really mystery.
I used to say Hindi but he listened to English. That's why talking would be very easy and that's the work of technology.
After this show, I think many people are discussing Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also go to Nature and Wildlife's nature and wildlife-dominated places.
I've already said, I'm telling you again, you must go North East.
You're gonna grow up.
On August 15, I asked you all to go to 15 places of India for 10000 tourism in the next three years, watch, discuss, take families, spend some time there.
Your life, your imagination will take place.
Last month, it was lucky to trigger the country's consignment.
Do you know how many tiger numbers in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
A few years ago, half of it could have been very painful.
The Tiger Summit took place in Russia's St. Petersburgh in 2010.
Here, a vision was taken to regret the declining number of tigers in the world.
The imagination was to double the number of tigers all over the world in 2022.
But this is 'New India' where we have completed the target very soon.
We doubled the number of tigers here since 2019.
Not only the number of tigers in India, but also the number of producted area and community reserves.
When I was telling the tiger, I also remembered the lion of Gir Aryan in Gujarat.
When I was in charge of the Chief Minister, the lion's dwelling place was stored in the jungle of Gir.
Their numbers were decreasing.
We've put a lot of attention on the guerrilla.
In 2007, I decided to employ women guards.
It is possible to improve the tourism industry through the survival of circulation.
In the context of nature and wildlife, we just have to stand on protection or conservation.
This time we're gonna have to think about compassion or sympathy.
Can anybody forget the historic description of Swami Vivekananda in my favorite countrymen, 11 September 1893
This young Indian sensor's brilliant description was woken up among the world's people.
Where the subsequent India was in the world, Karuna's grandson, in the world of September 1893, it is compelled to discover a new India in the words of great husband Vivekananda.
Come on, Swimming Vivekananda has seen the shape of India, the power that we knew.
On this occasion, we're going to start the nationwide Fit India Movement.
We have to keep ourselves fit, make the country fit.
It'll be a very attractive expedition for all old and old.
But today I don't know about it in detail.
Wait for 29 August.
Apart from this, Dosses for October Totaly Dedicated Plastic.
With our power, we'll be in the process of keeping home and around plastic free.
I believe this expedition will create lights in the social media.
Let's start this campaign with a new incentive, new imagination, new energy.
I waited for your message and advice.
Whether it's lighted with the joy and service of the interior, our way.
Thank you so much, Namskar
What's the mind, January 2017
The Constitution of India, the right of citizens, the right of citizens, our commitment to democracy, that is, the reform of the next generation, the recognition of democracy, the responsibilities of democracy, the recognition.
But it isn't going to be the widespread discussion of citizens' duty and citizens in our country.
I hope every minute, every minute, as fast as it's put on the right.
On both sides of right and duty, India's manoeuvre can proceed.
Tomorrow 30-January, our worshipped Punya Tithi.
On 30th January, we celebrate the morning at 11.2 minute joy, pay homage to the martyrs who give life to the country.
As a country, as a country, on 30-th January, at 11-two minutes of reverence, we must become a normal habit.
I congratulate the virgins and members of their families who have been honored with the virtual gallantry awards on the earliest evening of the Republic Day.
Among these awards are ' Kirti Chakra ' , ' Shaurya Chakra ' , ' Param Special Service Medal ' , ' Having Service Medal ' - many departments .
I specially want to appeal to the newborns - you're very active in the social media, can you do a job
This time, who was awarded this honor, look at the Internet and enjoy their members and get them to your friends.
When we know in detail about their courage, biography and sympathy, as we are wonderful, there is proudness and inspiration.
On one hand, when we were happy with the news of January 26, Yuryah and Uddinna, our soldiers in Kashmir, who were stable in the security of the country, in their gallantry.
I convey respect and respect to these virgins, please.
My young friends, you know well, I'm listening serially.
January, February, March, April - this month every family is tested.
A half of the world's children are tested, but the whole family is under pressure from the test.
Family tension, student tension, teacher tension - a very strange psychological environment is seen in every world.
And I always felt that I should come out of this and that's why I want to talk to the young friends in detail to the Esmperor.
When I announced this, many academics, experts, students sent me messages, sent questions, consulted, spoke of pain, references, references, and after seeing all that I thought I wanted to share with you today.
I have a message on the telephone from the creation.
Anyway, the question has been raised, but the same question is surely in your mind.
The test must be a joy.
It's been worked all year, it's a chance to tell you, it must be a festival of enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
You have to decide that you think it's presumption, no please.
And when the festival takes place, the best in us comes out.
At the time of the festival, society gets its strength.
During the test, there must be an atmosphere of festivals in families, friends, around.
The whole family must fulfil your own role in successing this festival like a team, see how soon it changes.
The truth is that from Kashmir to Kanyakumarika, in some way, Arunachal from Amreli is just testing and testing for three to four months.
Every year, we're responsible for this three-four months, according to the traditions of their own nij-nij, the environment of their own families, and it's a festival.
And so I'll tell you "Smile More Score More."
And you see when you're joyful, you feel comfortable, you feel comfortable.
A year ago, you remember all the scenes of Teacher in Clasroom.
Sometimes we don't see the test in the right direction.
Then it seems that the test is a question of life-throwing.
The test means that you've been studying for the whole year.
J.
The brightness of the film.
He wanted to join the airspace, but he was unsuccessful.
Imagine if he would have been disappointed after this failure, would he have gone to the dynasty, would India get such a big scientist - a president
Because of this, not just the races have grown in the neighbourhood, the tension has increased.
I want you to know about the current situation and future of education.
What will be your real guidance in life is your guided knowledge, your skills, your self-confidence and imagination.
You think he's a good doctor, so you need to go to him.
When you go to a Namiukell, when you knock on a big case, do you look for his marksheet
You see his experience, his words and success.
That's why sometimes this number's understanding goes into our right way.
You can see that whenever you run for numbers, you find the easiest way and pay attention to certain things... but you're getting out of the carriage.
And that's why sometimes it happens to be very unsuccessful in the test, but we have to face failure in life.
Reach has raised one more thing, that's race.
It's a very big mental conflict area.
In this way, we can give an example of Shachin Tendulkar.
Friends, in every case of life, especially when you're going to test, look at it, if you've given two hours for the maintenance, have you done it for three hours
In the past, when you think of getting up, it was too late, can you get up at the right time
Mr. S.
He used to help me in this way.
My mother couldn't pass the 10th class examination but if she didn't get help, I couldn't have passed the CBSE test.
Beautiful, you said right.
You must have noticed that the number of women is higher than those who ask me.
If you learn to confess once, then there's a lot of problems going to be solved.
If you don't accept it, you'll open the way to get rid of this problem.
Hope makes the road difficult.
Confessing the present situation, there is a chance to open the solution.
So confess whatever you have.
Look, you'll be free of burden.
We discuss the weight of small children's school bags, but sometimes I don't know what the parents expect, the school bags are more than the school bags.
Many years ago, a well-known man was in the hospital because of heart attack.
Actually, we go to the sick person and create a fear in his mind about the disease.
I wanna talk to the audience that sometimes we're with the little ones.
Did you ever think that during the test, I'd give the children a smile.
You see, the situation will change.
I got a funny phone.
The gentleman didn't want to say his name.
If you hear the phone details, you can understand why the person doesn't want to reveal his name.
"Namskar, Chief Minister, I did something in my childhood that I didn't say my name.
I tried to duplicate once in my childhood.
I've had a lot of time to think about what I'm going to do.
I could get the same number if I spent that time for studying.
When I tried to duplicate, I was caught and I had trouble with many friends around me.
I'm telling you that again.
Then where will you reach
Remember, you're looking for your own streets, creating real resistance.
I've seen that some people use all their talents and use the creativity.
"If I talk about playing at the time of the test, then everyone will say, "How is the Prime Minister
Because the ordinary man thinks that the guys are dressed in sports, they'll be unconscious of studying.
Besides the brain, the rest of the body must be active.
If you take a break for five minutes, you'll feel that you're feeling a lot more interested in reading.
I don't know if everyone likes it, but I'm talking about my confidence.
Once a folk song came to meet me.
He asked me how long did you sleep
I want to go, brother, are you a doctor
He said, "No, no, you don't tell me, it's related to your throat to give you this fool.
If you sleep properly, you'll get your breakfast course too.
I didn't think of my sleep and throat.
He gave me a simple token.
Don't forget this, so that your feelings will be dissatisfied with me.
Otherwise, the day the marksheet comes, the witnesses will see my reflections instead of you.
Well, it's gonna work when we're sleeping.
Mental, intellectual, sports sports to keep your body sluggish.
Let's go with this mantra.
Dear neighbors, this year's 1st February is completing the Indian Coast Guard forty years.
On this occasion, I'm grateful and thankful to every staff and army of the Coast Guard for their duty to the country.
Our coast guards have secured their pride among the world's four best coast guards with 126 warships and 62 flights built in our own country.
"Ayam Rocksham", the mantra of the Coast Guard... reminds us of our coast guard army's resistance to protect the ocean borders of the country.
Last year, the Coast Guard had instructed them to keep our country's seashore clean and that work was carried out by thousands of ordinary countrymen.
Our women's pilot officers in the Coast Guard, and they'll be able to handle the hovercraft.
Business Rituraj.
Saraswati is worshiped on the spring-panchami.
For the order of electricity, it's used to worship.
Not only education, but also the festival of gallantry.
"The color of you is a desert thief..."
I enjoy the interior sweetness of the dwellers in this spring.
My loved ones, "Man Ki Baat", have filled the program with a lot of colorful ideas.
In the last month, my sword was heard in the geographical language after the description of my sword.
This is a great success.
It was written by the countrymen from far off places.
I'm telling them a lot of enjoyment for this self-provoked effort of the window.
What's the mind, December
I don't love you all in Christmas.
Today to get service, sacrifice and sacrifice in your life.
The killer Jesus said, "It's not useful for poverty, we accept it for them."
There's a lot of stories about this.
Lord Jesus once stood by a template trading.
A lot of rich people came and donated a lot.
Just then, a poor widow came and donated two copper money.
If you look at each other, you don't take any money as a sword.
The birth day of Mahamati Madanmohan Malabazi, the Indian people's imagination and self-confident talents showed a new direction of modern education.
On his birthday, I'm very devoted.
Just two days ago, I had a chance to inform a lot of evolutionary work in Malbaji's peninsula Benares.
In ' Benas Hindu University ' - I also laid the foundation stone of ' Mohammad Madan Mohan Malaba Cancer Centre ' .
This is a cancer center for the entire region, not just the East of Uttar Pradesh, but also the benefits of the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today, India's Prime Minister Bharat Ratna is also the birthday of Atlavihari Bajpayeeji.
This country never forgets Atlaji's contribution.
Our country's heads are also higher in his leadership.
Dalneta, Sansad, Minister or Prime Minister - Atlaji made an ideal in every role.
On the day of Atalji's birth, I know my commendation and pray to God for health.
I was lucky to work with Atlaji as a worker.
The picture of many memories is in front of the eye.
I've shared an old video when I visited this morning... and I'm gonna see how it was raining on a small comrade.
As a big day gift, all the people of the country are going to get the benefit of two plans today.
Everyone wants to understand and learn each other.
To encourage this, the Indian government is now undertaking an incentive of graduates and small businessmen in order to enhance the strength of mobile banking.
The plan to encourage the graduates is - the name of ' Laki Grahak Yojna ' and the plan of the businessmen ' - ' DG - Dhan Diamond Performance Scheme ' .
And on 25th December, as a gift to Christmas, 15 thousand people will get one thousand rupees in the account through the "Dr" system.
Today, not just one day, this plan will last for 100 days.
This award will be available to 15 thousand people every day.
In 100 days lakhs of families will reach a gift of crores - but they will be worthy of this gift , which are ' Mobile Banking ' , ' I-Banking ' , ' Card ' , ' UPI ' .
Use the digital lending methods like "USSD", etc.
The 'DG-drunk business plan' is for the businessmen.
As the businessman involves himself in this plan, the graduates will also be involved in cashlessing their business.
Businesses will also be awarded separately and the number of those awards will be thousands.
Those who can buy more than three thousand rupees, they don't have access to this award.
Unemployed people can use the Feature phones and simple phones with the USSD and finish the price, all of them will get the awards of this plan.
People from the village will be able to win this award by saving them through AEPS.
The children of ten or twelve classes in your family can teach you this method well.
It's simple. It's easy to send homes apps from a mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, I'm glad to know how to use technology in the country, how to use e-payments, how to do online payments.
In the last few days, the cashless business has increased from 200 to 300 percent.
The Indian government has taken a big decision to encourage this method.
Businessmen can easily imagine how big this decision is.
All the businessmen who exchange digital exchanges will spread online payment methods instead of nags in their business, they'll be released in their income.
I know that the Assam government has announced 10 percent disposal of property taxes and trade licenses of digitization.
The rural bank branches have decided, at least two digital transactions from 75 percent of their graduates from January to March will be paid up to 50,000 rupees from their government.
Until March 31, if a village gets 100 percent digital transactions, it has been announced by the Assam government to give 5 lakhs of rupees through the best Panchayat for DG-Transkshan scheme.
For the farmers, the Assam government has decided to give 5,000 rupees to the first 10 farmers in the 'Digital Kisan Shiromani' project, who will fully follow the digital methods for the purchase of seeds and sar.
I'm greeting the Assamese government and also greetings to those states that have taken this kind of industry.
It's funny that GNFC's sales are 27 percent in comparison to last year.
Brothers and sisters, in our economy, we have the importance of unconstitutional areas in our daily life.
Most of these people are paid money, money for work or payment in cash, and we know that the workers are also borrowed.
In place of 100 rupees, 80 rupees are paid, when 80 rupees are paid, 50 rupees and all these workers are discharged with many other facilities, including health insurance.
But when cashless payments are made, the money is straight into the bank.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easy for us.
Countries like India must be the most advanced.
Our youngsters have improved a lot through the start-up.
This digital-andolan is a golden chance, our young generation must take a new idea, with a new technology, as much as it can take with new techniques.
We have to be in full power to liberate the country from black money and economic corruption.
My dear countrymen, I'm asking people before every 'Mann Wat' program, you're sending your advice, telling your opinion and this time thousands of opinions have received advice from 'Mygov' and 'Narendra Modi App'.
The author of the second clan, who has raised the importance of all this, such a good work, work for the country's good, such a sacred work, but the way it is against... how the new way is being adopted.
Mr . Gurumani Keobal has written in ' My Gov ' - this step is worth admiring for losing rash in black money .
As a citizen, our discomfort is right, but we are cooperating in the fight against corruption that we are fighting.
We play a military role in the war against corruption, black money, etc.
The same idea comes from all the corners of the country.
We all can feel it.
Actually, these are the Agent of Change.
I want to thank everybody for another reason, not only the problems they have suffered, but those who are trying to distract ordinary people.
Not only this, some people gave their senses, powers, creativity to these swords, swords of the swords.
I know this power of the people hundreds of times.
Janta Janardhana is God's genius, thank God.
I thank the people of the country for taking part in this great excitement against corruption and black money.
I wanted to have a comprehensive discussion about political parties and political funding as the fight against corruption and black money is going on.
Those who are saying that political parties have a lot of barriers - they're wrong.
This government is the government of reproduction.
On the other hand, I said on the first day - on 8th, it's a wonderful fight.
There are many more information coming from the general citizens.
The success we find is basically due to the awareness of the masses.
Can anybody imagine how dangerous are the aware citizens of our country to open their masks
If you get your help, this fight will be very easy.
There's one third of the letters you're sending me, which's a lot of numbers.
They say Modiji doesn't stop, don't get tired, take as hard as possible.
We have to win this war, there is no question of tiredness.
We've brought it out and we've made the Benmy property law very hard.
The law will play his role the next day.
That's our primary duty for patriotism and sensitivity.
In the past, India has established itself with glory in the world economy.
According to the World Investment Report published by UNCTAD, India has reached the third place in the 'Top Prespective Host Economics'.
The Global Competition Report of World Economic Forum has improved India's 32 steps.
Similarly, the World Bank's 'Laxistics Parformance Index-Children's 19-page progress was spoken.
The same type of other reports involves India's fastest improvement.
My dear countrymen, this time the Parliament session created heat among the countrymen.
They've got their anger in different ways over the Parliament's activities.
The president and the vice president also expressed their heat in this regard.
But sometimes there's something good about it, so it's joyful.
There's a good job in Parliament's Haihalla, which doesn't see the common man of the country.
Brothers, I'm glad to say this today that a bill regarding the goals that the government is going on in front of Dibang people has been accepted in Parliament.
Our government is responsible for the Dibang people.
My Divang brothers and sisters have added more power to this effort when Para Olympics has won four medals.
This win has not only increased the honor of the nation, but their strength has wondered the countrymen.
Like other citizens of the country, our brothers and sisters are our invaluable wealth and strength.
I'm glad tonight that due to the passage of this law, there will be more jobs for the Dibangs.
The preservation limit for government jobs has been increased to four percent.
In this law, special arrangements have been made for the education, facilities and complaints of the Dibangs.
The government has introduced this new law, according to the impressions of the nation.
A number of such crews have been created for the Dibang people for the first time to get the right opportunity and justice.
Thalassemia, people suffering from Parkinsons are also involved in this class.
My young men, there are reports from the field of play in the last few weeks, so we're all glorious.
It's normal for us to be proud of being Indian.
Indian cricket team has won 4-0 cases against England.
Some young players' performances are very fantastic.
The test captain didn't just do a good batting, he gave a good leadership.
I'm enjoying a lot of favors and joys to all of them.
Well, even after 15 years, we've got a good news.
I'm enjoying these youths for their success.
This success is a good signal for the future of the Indian Hockey team.
Last month, our women's players also got great success.
Indian woman Hockey team won the Asian champions trophy, and a few days ago, India's women hockey team at 18 Asia cups received black medals.
I'm intimately greetings to all the cricket and hockey teams.
My beloved countrymen, in 1970, may be a new hope and enthusiasm year.
What is the mind, November 2016
We all celebrated Deepawali last month.
Every year, like this, I went to the Chinese border to reinforce Deepawali.
I have celebrated the Deepawali festival in the higher areas of the Himalayas with the I-T-B-P.
Every year I go to the border, but the experience of the lamp is completely different.
They were full of jealousy and not only did I see a strange reaction of the countrymen who have sent joys to their joy.
When I saw these things, what a wonderful imagination he was supposed to be, amazed.
But we don't think we don't think that at the time of the Deepawali festival.
On the contrary, it seemed as if I was in the celebration of Deepawali with 125 million Indians.
Dear Desperate, the inner, pleasure, love and joy that have been transmitted into our army's joys, shouldn't you be alone in Holi-Deepawali
You want me to appeal, come, as a society, as a nation, as part of nature and nature... whenever there is a tradition or festival, we'll take care of the wars of our borders in some way.
When the nation becomes united with the army, the strength of the army will also increase to 125 million times.
A few days ago, the heads of all the villages of Jammu and Kashmir met me.
Oranzammu-Kashmir came to attend the Panchayat conference.
About 40-50 people came from different villages in Kashmir Valley.
It's been a long time to talk.
Even if they came to know some claims for the development and development of the village, the current situation in Kashmir valleys, law and order, the future of the children, also came out.
A few days ago, the board was accumulated in Kashmir and about 95 percent of the students were sitting in the school.
In the board's examination, I am clear in the part of the students and students that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are responsible for the development of the bright future through education.
I'm thanking students not only for these teachers, but also for their parents, teachers and all-round rural heads.
My beloved-boys, when I asked for a discussion with the people about this time, I confess, everybody proposed it.
Everyone wants me to tell you something about the notes of five hundred thousand rupees.
At 8:00 in the night of 8th November, I told the nation a great expedition for the right development of the country.
As I decided and told you that decision, it was not a common decision, it's a tough step.
As soon as I announced the decision, I warned that the effect of this proposition was so impossible that it would take at least 50 days to get out of it, and then we could go to normal conditions.
It's not easy to recover from the disease that has spread over seventy years.
125 million Indians believe in their country's irresponsible faith and perfect faith that they are partisan for the country's progress.
That's why we'll be successful.
And when it comes to humanity, they're getting more active.
When the local bank employee's ears, they immediately reached Tataka in the public gentleman's house.
Not only that, he arranged for treatment.
I am surprised by this incident.
They're taking different ways to save their black money.
One request, don't play with the poor man to fulfil your individuality.
Your injustice is connecting to the poor man's records, you're not after the investigation, these poor men will be trapped, they're gonna suffer.
The most harsh rules have been made to bring Benmimism to life, which is being actualized all the way.
I am a common citizen of the district headquarters of Madhya Pradesh, sustainable and rural Tirli.
Your five hundred thousand notes are very promising.
My request is, "What awaits", where ordinary people have welcomed your move to the nation's progress even when they faced a lot of trouble.
Thank you inner. You said that the day is coming, but no one could think you could take such a big step.
Five hundred and a thousand notes and you have taught the corrupt black markets.
Every citizen of India doesn't have a big day.
So I'll thank you once more.
"When this kind of information is heard through media, common man and government sources, the work of work increases a lot.
People went there and ate it, and after two to four days, when they returned with breakfast, they finished the bill.
This is the strength of my country, where primacy and sacrifice are the main.
The news was spread all over the world when I used to talk to you.
Many countries of the world have also learned the use of tea-bithk words.
But I didn't know if there could be a cha-back
I'm informed that there's a wedding in Surat on November 7th.
In this wedding, the paternal uncles arranged only tea for the invitations, otherwise there was no food and poultry program, because they lacked cash money because the notes were closed.
The birds also supported this... with this kind of marriage, they have established a pattern in the fight against the mercenary and efficient traditional corruption and black money.
When the signal comes, man finds a new way... one of the events of Drekiyajuli village in Assam on TV.
The village's tea workers and the tea workers are getting a weekend.
The four neighbours bought together and made payments for two thousand rupees.
You know very well that the poor man puts at least two days ago.
Only fifty percent of every municipal text.
But after this announcement on the eighth, the old notes of the people fall into the grasshoppers.
Seventy-four cities have been hisseved, in the past year, three-and-a-half-three thousand crores of rupees were collected, you'd be surprised to know that there was thirteen thousand crores of rupees a week
We've got a lot of valuation that we're looking at.
Brothers, village and peasants are the spinal cord of our country's economy.
Even when we're adjusting every citizen, I'd like to congratulate the peasants of the country especially when we're suffering from this change in economy.
I've been calculating the seeds of this year.
I'm glad to see that the pomegranate, pulses and sesame have increased the number of pomegranates this year since last year.
Even in all resistance, the peasants took out new ways.
Some important decisions have been taken from the government, where the soldiers and villages are being given priority.
Some of our country's businessmen also make a routine opportunity and join the economic development.
For them, I took a very important decision in the past year... and the small shopkeepers of the village, like the city's largest malle, would trade for twenty-four hours, and no law would stop them.
"Mudra" plans have been sufficiently used to pay their loans.
Millions of rupees have been given to all these small businessmen through the 'Mudra' project, because innumerous people who are involved in this small business, keep their millions of rupees online.
But due to this decision, it's normal for all these young people to get complicated.
You should also download the bank's app on your phone.
POS Machine for Credit Card and learn how to deal with non-notes.
You've seen, big calls continue to trade through technology.
Likewise, a small businessman can also lodge the car with the simple "Userfrendly" technology.
There's no possibility of any violence. There's a chance to spread.
I'll ask you to join you to create a cacheless society.
You can take full banking facility on the mobile phone for commercial proliferation and keep an arrangement without the cash not transaction.
These are technological methods, which are safe, safe and fast.
I want you to help only succeed this expedition, but not to give you your motherhood, I believe you can lead this change.
I believe you can finish through all business transaction technology in the village.
I want to tell the labour siblings that you have a lot of regrets.
It's written in the paper that one bean and what is given in hand is another.
Sometimes it was found that there was a standing outside, he had to be partaked and forced to accept this resource as part of life.
In the new system, we think that the bank has your accounts, maybe your traditional means the bank in which the minimum majuri's chariot is fled.
You've got enough money, nobody's cut.
Today I want to talk to young friends.
We say that India is a country in which 65 percent of the population is fifteen years old.
You, young and young men of my country, I know my decision has been lost to you.
I know that you support this decision.
I know that you'll have a lot of contributions to take this thing forward.
But, guys, you're my real army, real friend.
My young men, can you help me
Just stay in touch with me, it won't work.
You have the idea of the world today, not the old generation.
It may be that your elder brothers in your family don't even know that Aurma-father, Kaka-Kakima, mother-in-law, probably don't know that much.
You know, 'App Kejnis', 'Online Banking', 'Online Ticket Booking'.
It's very common for you and you use it.
But today our dream is 'Kashles Society'.
It's not possible for a hundred percent of the castles society.
But once we're in touch with the Las-Kash Society, the goal of the 'Kashles Society' will not be incomplete.
And I want your active cooperation, time and imagination, and you'll never disappoint me, I know, because we all want to change the life of the poor people of Hindustan.
You know, for 'Kashles Society', how much chance is today for digital banking or mobile banking.
Every bank interrupts online.
Every bunker has his own mobile app in Hindustan.
There's every bunkerny sweet.
Walt's white meant - Y-Manibag.
There's a lot of cardpaws.
Under the reproduction plan, India's millions of poor families have a y card, which was used very little.
Since the eighth day, he's been using a lot of poor people and it's growing almost three hundred.
Like the pre-paid cards are available on the mobile phone, cards are available for banknotes.
And this thing's so simple to send your Whats Appearance.
Castronsphere can also occur in the phone that is available with ordinary features.
Whether smoke or vegetables, milk, news papers, tea, sprouts, everybody can use it in an unnecessary way.
And I've also tried to simplify this system.
All the banks are working on it.
My young friends, even after all this, there's a whole generation that's unfair to all this.
And you are, I know that this great job is active.
What kind of circumcisive massage you give - Slogan, poems, stories, cartoons, new imaginations, laughter and smiles... and on the face of Challenge, the younger generation seem to have created power, it seems as if the specialty of this Indian year is that in a warfare, poetry was born.
That's how we're going through such big changes... the basic creativity of yourself.
But my beloved young friends, I'm telling you once again, I and I believe you need your help in this work, you'll do this to the millions of young people in the country.
Do one thing, you promise that you'll be a part of the 'Kashles Society'.
Use the technology you've got on your mobile phone.
Not only this, every day, half an hour, one hour, two hours, at least ten families will know how to use this tech, how to download your bank's app, how to spend the meaning in your account, how to give it to the Dodokander.
How business can be done to teach the shopkeeper.
You would like to enter this 'Kashles Society', out of the square of this noat, that my great enlightenment, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to release people from misery and trouble.
I'm inviting you - Come on, not just assimilation, we're the soldiers of this change and changes.
We will take this fight to free the country from corruption and darkness and there are many countries in the world where the young generation has changed the lifestyle of the nation and it will mean that the changes that the young men and youth bring, they revolutionise.
A mobile system called M-PESA, used the technology, named M-PESA, and today in the area of Kenya, the entire business and marketing has taken place in this area.
This country has created a big revolution.
My young men, I'm back once again, and I'm telling you that you take this campaign forward.
Every school, college, university, ENC-C, EN-S-S, I invite you to do this at a personal level.
You've seen that the most popular artists at this time are carrying out the cleaning mission.
My dear countrymen, now you're thinking through "Manki Watt", through your thought letters, reaching the "My Govt", "Narendra Modi App" and keeping me in touch with you.
Now at the time of Belgai, what's the vaat, but after the end of the broadcast, it's going to start in the official language.
I'm repleasant to the window, the new industry that they took, wherever Hindi language was introduced, the countrymen would get the opportunity to join it.
Thank you very much
What's the mind, October 2016
My dear countrymen, you don't have a lot of Deepavali.
The festival of Deepavali is celebrated with enthusiasm and inspiration at every corner of India.
India is a country where festivals are seen in some part of the country for 365 days.
We have easily accepted a lot of changes in the festival, according to the time and society.
But already we can see one thing that in India this year, the entire journey of the festival, its depths, its impact on every person - all this is linked to the same original mantra - to the group.
An effort is being made to spread to the universe from Periyazmaz to the limited thoughts of man and personality.
And it can be done through this festival.
Sometimes festivities in India seem to be very glorious, but they also have an idea of what seasonal festivals and what to eat there.
What kind of crops are happening to the farmers and how the crops are connected to the festival, what kind of reforms should be considered for disease free, etc., our predecessors have mixed with the festival in a scientific way.
Today, we're thinking about the world's catastrophe.
Nature has become a matter of concern.
In India, this tradition of festivals makes nature and love stronger, from child to child, makes every man more cheerful.
And science indicates what kind of changes comes in the waters of the sea in full moon and incompetence, which has an impact on the nature and its impact on the minds of man.
That is, so far, our holidays have been a tradition of the parents, connecting science with the universe.
Today, when we're celebrating Deepawali festivals, as I said, every festival of ours is educational, brings a sense of education.
This festival of Deepavali gives the message of 'Tamsoma Jyotirgamai ' from darkness to light.
Social oppression - Personal oppression shadow of the oppression, liberation from darkness to light.
One thing we all know is that any corner of India goes to the corner of Dhanihar or Great Great Deepavali, where every family's cleaning expedition is going on.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
The government of any place in the world, the Parliament, the rulers and all of them become part of the Deepawali festival.
Singapore's Prime Minister shared the picture of the Deepawali festival with great fanfare all over the world through Instagram.
Singapore's sixty-six women members, Indian saris, stood outside the community and the pictures were spread in the social networking site.
And all this is for Deepavali.
On every street in Singapore, Deepavali festival is held everywhere.
I mean, this is the daylight festival, the world inspires everyone from darkness to light.
At the time of Deepavali, the news of the accident, the news of the fire, the news of the immortality is very worried.
And there's a discomfort when Deepawali, the doctors and all the families in Deepawali go home to celebrate Deepawali festival.
It's not empty, Govardhan Puja, Brother Photo, from profit-panchami to Kartik-Purnima for a long time.
It's a great festival that lasted for four days.
But there's one significance - this festival gives a deep message to society.
It is proud that all the people of the world worship the sun.
Chat Puja is a festival where the next sun is worshiped.
There's a big social message.
I speak of the Deepawali festival, talk of Chhat Pujo, this is the time to thank all of you, especially to thank the countrymen.
In the last few months, all the incidents that have happened, each of our army's survivors gave up everything.
As soon as I'm concerned, the army's survivors have a special effect on the sacrifice, meditation, labor.
And that's why I thought this isolation was to be dedicated to the security forces.
I called the countrymen to take part in an audience called "Sandesh To Solajers".
But today I want to say that there are no people in India who don't have indispensable love for the soldiers of the country, who are not proud of the security forces.
The way man reveals it will give the countrymen more power.
We can't imagine the survivors of the security forces, how powerful a message gives to you.
Whether it's the Indo-Tibetan police, the Assam Rifles, the Navy, the foothills, or the airspace, or the Coast Guard, I can't tell everyone the name, and I don't know what's wrong with our soldiers.
When we revive, somebody in the desert, somewhere in the Himalayas, somewhere in the Himalayas, somebody is protecting the ship, somebody is protecting the airport.
I really want to show thanks to the countrymen.
The artist, who gave a message through the art, produced photographs, alpnas, cartoons, whom Saraswati's grace was poetry.
I can imagine how proud it is for my country's soldiers.
"Sandesh to Solagers" - There's a lot of message in this hashtag.
Mr. Ashwani Kumar Chouhan has written a poem, I want to listen to it.
I'm celebrating the festival, compassionate, telling you today, it's possible that you are.
"My beloved countrymen, father's houses and father-in-law-in-law, many of the family members of the army, a sister, Shivani sent me a telephone message.
Come on, let's hear what this soldier's family say: "Namskr chief minister, I am called Shivani Mohan.
In this Deepawali, "Sandesh to Solawars" shipping started, our Fauji brothers got great enthusiasm.
My family is a military family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and maternal uncle were an army officer.
The army officers we have on the border, and all of the Army Circle have made a special impression.
I mean, with the Army officers and the soldiers, they have to abandon their wife and the whole family.
"My beloved countrymen, it is true that the soldiers are not just on the border, but they are aware of their awareness everywhere in life.
Our adventurous soldiers will emerge in love with life, in my sight, that I want to tell you what I want to tell you.
This discussion shows that some families aren't able to build a homehouse due to lack of money.
"Development has made the 57 families get their pockets through a thousand rupees.
This is how Himachal Pradesh has become a free state without open defecation.
Nobody goes there easily.
These young men take their bricks, cement and other materials to make the toilet, walking on their feet all day.
In Gujarat, more than a hundred and a half municipalities and corporations have been declared to be free of toilets.
Ten districts are also in this list.
My beloved countrymen, the public has planned a lot, and if there's a better plan than him after the first plan, you'll have to leave the first.
But usually nobody pays attention to this.
There's no need for kerosene at all the houses in our country.
But the government's looking for arrows
I heard that seven or eight districts of Cerosin were free from the sergeant.
The way they took it, I think the entire kingdom would become very smooth kerosene.
My beloved countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi always guides us all.
What the country is going to do, how it is considered to be a vision of his mother-in-law.
Gandhiji says, "When you plan, recall the poor and weaker classes of the country and then think you're going to do, don't you get any benefit from these people, don't they have any harm
We need to take one step after another to get rid of the problem.
Anyway, we're gonna have to overcome the difference between the boys and the girls in society.
This opportunity is an example of the distinction of our daughters in Indian society.
Millions of children get rid of the vaccination.
The vaccination of Mission Indradhanus is such an expedition in which the children who are suppressed are also able to get rid of the terrible diseases.
The village will be dark in the twentieth century, that doesn't happen.
And that's why the village's getting rid of the blind, the mission to get power in the village is going on successfully.
Working before the blessing time.
Efforts to free 5 million families from smoke, this campaign is going on successfully.
Small, small shopkeepers, vegetables, milk sellers, chickens tend to penetrate the supplements of tears on the loans of the masses.
Money plan, stand-up plan, John Dhan Account - a successful campaign to get rid of all these good men.
Through the base card, it means direct access to the bank, direct financial facilities to the real proprietors.
It's time to get rid of the poor people's life.
My loved countrymen, on October 31, the great ancestors of this country showed the solidarity of India who gave birth to life and made it - the birth anniversary of Sadar Vallabhwai Patel.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the prince of the country's solidarity guardians, on the other hand, the full moon of Srimati Gandhi.
Excellency, you know that on 31st October, the birthday of the Serdar Patel.
Serdar Patel is a person who has given his life-long indiscrimination and I think that's successful.
He collected Sascal, and we can tell the fate of the country, or say that Gandhi was killed that day.
And we all know what happened to the country after his death.
Excuse me, I want to tell you how we can shut down the misfortune.
"Deadsman, this is not one of the sorrows.
A surdar-surdar Vallabhvai Patel, history witnesses the history of the Egyptian, the great work of collecting the country after the charity has been done by Sardar Vallabhvaipatel.
But it is also sorry, that the surdars have sacrificed their lives for unity, fought, the main objective of unity of the country was to be a victim of many dissatisfaction, but never leave the unity.
But in the birth anniversary of that surdar, thousands of surdars, thousands of surdar families, were hanged on the way to death after the murder of Mrs. Gandhi.
The prince who spent all his life for unity, on his birthday - on the day of the birth of the surdar, on this page of history, troubles us all.
But in these contacts, we have to take oneness mantra forward.
The power of the country alone in diversity.
There are many languages, nations, numerous numerous, numerous foods, but unity among these diversities - this is the strength of India, the specialty of India.
Every generation has a responsibility, every government's responsibility, an example of unity at the corner of the country, to develop the country's unity policy.
We protect ourselves and ourselves from the hypocrisy.
Serdar Saheb has given us a India, all of us are responsible for making the best India.
The root of unity strengthens the glory of making India the best.
At present, sometimes we heard the name of Aamul.
Today with every product of pomegranate, people from all over India and India are also known.
But only a few people knew that the far-reaching Sardar had imagined to create a Union of Co-operative Producers.
The district of Kheda , which was known as the district of that time - emphasized this idea in 1942 and its real form is in front of us the universal example of what Sardar Saheb did today for the happiness and satisfaction of the pomegranate farmers.
I'm paying tribute to the surdar.
On this 31st October alone, wherever we are, we'll recall the surdar sir, we'll communicate with unity.
My loved countrymen, after this island, Kartik Purnima is a part of the light festival.
Guru Nanak's teaching is for the entire humanity, only for India, the right direction for the entire humanity.
Serving, truth and everybody, this is the message of Guru Nanak.
Peace, unity and harmony were his roots.
Blindness, blind belief, a mission to free society from humility was in every word of the gentleman.
I'll commemorate Guru Nanak from the end of the heart in a happy light festival.
My loved countrymen, once more, this island deserted by the soldiers of the country, you're not very happy at this island.
Your dream, your imagination can be successful.
Your life is full of joy, I'm telling everyone this niceness.
My dear countrymen, bow down to all of you.
A few days ago, we lost sixty-six brave children of the country in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I pray to all these armed soldiers and offer my reverence.
And so I'll tell my countrymen the same day I told you, I'll repeat that the culprits would be able to get rid of it.
My dear countrymen, we trust our army.
We are proud of our army.
I want to talk to the citizens of Kashmir in a special way.
The citizens of Kashmir are well aware of the anti-national forces.
And the truth that you understand, Amni has separated herself from that power and started walking on the path of peace.
Every mother-in-law is fast and full-time, all school-class.
Farmers also want their fruits to reach all the markets of the country.
And in the last few days, business began to run.
We all know... peace, unity and harmony are also our ways to solve ourselves, our path of progress and our development.
For the next generation, we have to cross the new peaks of the development.
I believe we'll find a solution to all the problems together, find a solution and make a better way for the wealthy generation of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of this administration.
To maintain law and order, the administration has to make some arrangements.
I'm gonna tell the defendants that we have the power, the law is there, the law is necessary to maintain the law and order, to give a life of comfort and peace to the common citizens of Kashmir.
Sometimes people of different thoughts possess other ideas than what we think.
I have a chance to know a lot in Soshilmidia today.
From every corner of Hindustan, there is a chance to know the imagination of every kind of human being and it increases the strength of democracy.
A few days ago, Harshavardhan, a student of eleventh class, sent me another kind of conscience.
He wrote, "After the Ugrithvite attack in Uri, I'm very distraught.
I was already asking what I can do for patriotism.
I'm sure I'll read three hours every day.
I'm gonna be a worthy citizen of the country.
"Wi Harshavardhan, in this climate of aggression and at such a young age that you can think of it, that's my bliss.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastriji tried to reach this idea of the country near the world.
And he inspired the ordinary man through the "Jai Jawan, Jaikishan" mantra, showed how to work for the country.
The red bahadur sciaries showed what the country's exhibition was in the voices of the bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi also used movements, when the movement was intensifying, he used this intensity of movement to further organise constructive work within the society.
We all can take care of the army, the people living in the administration will take care of themselves and we will take part in this country's patriotism and take part in some organisational work, then the country will reach the new world.
My beloved countrymen, Mr. T.
S.
Kartik wrote me through the Nrendramadi app that all the athletes in Para-Alympics had created history and won their Joe Humans'print.
You're not just two, but you're building an emotional attachment from every person in the country to the athletes participating in Para-Alimpics.
Perhaps our perspective of para-allimpics and our players, from the point of view of humanity, has completely changed our perspective towards the bankers.
And I can never forget this thing from our winner Deepa owner.
When he got the medal, he said, "I lost my handicappedness through this danger.
"This thing has a lot of strength.
This time, Para-Alimpics took ninety athletes with three women from our country.
If you comparison to other games, physical efficiency, sports tricks are a big deal of things - will power, sympathy.
You'll be glad to know and it'll be surprising that our players showed the best four medals - two of them are gold savings, one silver medal and a brilliant medal.
Devender Jhazharia, a golden treasurer, snatched the corpse again twelve years later.
Twelve years old, it's very hungry once it gets gold.
But Devender showed that the condition of the body, the growing age, never let the snake salt and he brought it to golden life after twelve years.
He wasn't from birth.
Because of electric doubt, he's lost one of his hands.
You think the person who gets golden and fifteen years of age, how big he has done in his life.
Maryappan won gold medals at Thangavelu Hijamp.
Thangavelu loses his right leg just five years old.
Greatness couldn't obstacle to his skin.
He didn't come from a big city, nor did he come from a clean family.
In the age of one and a half, who fought with woodenness, gave the country a medal in the power of skeletons, even though the physical problem is.
The name of Athletedipa owner has been associated with you.
Varun C.
Batty won the bronze medals in the hijamp.
The medals of Para-Alympics have been important in our country, in our country, in our society, around us... all these medals have done great jobs for our sightful changes to the brothers and sisters.
Very little people know how the distributors showed up in Para-allimpics.
A few days ago, there was an Olympic competition in the same place.
Not only that, I was shocked when I knew that those who didn't get any medal, ran shorter time than those of the ordinary guys who found gold... and once more, I'm giving a lot of greetings to our players.
In the next day, India is moving on a way to create a smooth plan for para-allimpics and its development.
My beloved countrymen, how surprising I am in Newsari last week.
I had this very sensitive moment.
The Government of India organised a Mega camp for the Dibangs, many of them have been worldwide.
There's a little girl with me, Gorishadul, she's not seen in the sight, she's from the jungles far of Dang district.
The Indian government established a world record on the ground, which is very important.
In eight hours, six hundred Divybangs, who didn't hear, had machines to listen to them.
The incident took place in Ginnes Book of World Records.
Three-thirds of the world records by the Dibangs in one day are supposed to be close to our countrymen.
Dear Desperate, two years ago, we started 'Clean India Mission' at the renowned Bapur Birthday on October 2.
That day I said, cleanness, cleanness, we need our own nature, every citizen's duty must be a bit of hatred, a bit of hatred towards uncleanness.
Tomorrow 2-4 October, when two years are over, I can believe that 125 million countrymen's hearts have increased consciousness.
I told you, walk a step forward to cleanness, today we can tell you, every one has tried to move forward.
I mean, the country's 125 million efficient cleansing.
That's why everybody may be ordinary, ruler, government office or roadgate, bus stand or railway station, school-class, dharamshala, hospital-in-law, poor farmers of villages - have made some contributions for cleanliness.
Friends of the Ganamadam have also followed the sovereignty.
I think we're still going far away.
To be healthy, for the honor of the citizens, especially for the honor of the mother and the mother, we have to stop the habits of open space.
And that's why an expedition of Open Defecation Free (ODF) has begun.
I went to Gujarat recently, where the officials told me, Poorbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will reach the ODF on October 2 this year.
Those who have already succeeded in this purpose, I know the greetings of those who are trying to get success.
My request to the countrymen is to free our country from this problem for the health of the little children.
Come on, we'll communicate and move forward.
I'm young friends who are used today, especially to start a new project for them.
Everyone has the right to know where the cleaning mission is in your city, that is why the Indian government has given a telephone number - 1969.
We know Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
And in 2019, we're gonna pursue Mahatma Gandhi's sardhashatvashi, that is, 150th generation.
In this number of 1969, you can call and not only know the statistics of the construction of your city, but also ask you to make a new toilet.
You, especially the young generation, take advantage of it.
The Indian government is also calling upon the Corporate Warlord to come forward and invokes such professional youths to sponsor those who want to work for cleansing.
They can be sent to the districts as 'Swachh Bharat Kamire'.
And so with the cleaning mission, we have to move forward to the Wasteto Composite.
Chemical surgeons have been told that they buy the compounds that have been created from Waste.
The farmers who want to go to Organic farming, add their necessary fluids.
Those who synthesis the health of their land, those who think of the health of the soil, who have been destroyed by the use of chemical surplus, even if they need some such surpluses, they can supply them.
Mr. Amitav Bachchan has joined the brand as an ambassador for this work.
I'm sure there's a new news about cleanliness.
One day I pressed the news- students from Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and carried out a consciousness campaign in the construction of the toilet.
The Indian government has also created a calendar for one year in its different sections.
Each department is enhancing importance on cleanliness for 15 days.
My request to ordinary citizens, all these government departments, if you're in touch with him in any way, you're also involved in this campaign.
This time about five hundred cities of one lakhs of population.
That's why every city's people have a feeling that we're behind, we'll do a good thing tomorrow.
There's an atmosphere of competition in the purifying.
I hope all citizens will join this campaign.
Tomorrow 2-4 October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and the red maiden.
The clean India Mission's completion of two years.
I request Gandhi Jayanti to buy something or something prepared from Khadi till Deepawali.
Even now, I'll request every family to buy something from the khadi, to burn the lamps of Deepavali in the poor house.
Though the next 2-4 October is Sunday, but can we take part in the cleaning expedition somewhere as a citizen
You should do some work for at least two-four hours in the work of cleansing and share one of his photographs 'Narendra Modi app ' .
If you have a video, you can share it.
With this joint effort, this mission will get strength, it will get a new speed.
Come on, we'll recall Mahatma Gandhi and Red Bahadur Scientists and do something good for the country.
Dear countrymen, there is a different joy in donating life to make some acceptable aspects, a wonderful happiness.
In the past, I have seen that when I asked for abandonment of virtue on gas, the way the ordinary man gave up is a very terrible event in our national life.
Some youths of our country, small organisations, people from the corporate world, students of students and members of some self-sacrifice organizations will combine in some towns from October to October 8.
We'll have to reach people with different food stuff, dressing and dressing.
When I was in Gujarat, I saw that our officers went to different families and collected the old plays in their homes, and the children there were in the worst settlement.
It's really nice to see all those poor kids playing.
I think in all towns where Joy of Giving Week will be celebrated, there will be an unprecedented youth, help.
This festival is a festival of donation.
I'm intimately enjoying those young men who are doing this.
Dear Desperate, on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pundit Deendayal Upgradation and the birth anniversary of today.
How can the poorest person get the benefit of the development
Water in all hands and all the lands - these two words didn't express his financial thoughts.
With his birth, the country will celebrate the year as a poor welfare year.
The society, the government and all others have to be careful about how the results of the development will be achieved. That's why we can free the country from poverty.
Dear Desperate, on the day of Vijayadashmi two years ago, I started the 'Man Ki Baat' ceremony.
Ordinary people of the country have always joined my mind, which has always been published in the "What Watt" program.
I'm glad to all the cattle for the two years of the festival... how you encouraged this program, sacrificed strength, blessed.
I'm also grateful to the Akashwani that they didn't just propagate the ceremony, but in all the languages, they tried to bring this program to the curtains.
I'm also grateful to all the people who wrote a letter to the 'What Watt' program, suggesting, publishing the faults of the government machinery... and the Akashwani made a special show about all these letters, the government workers' programme to solve problems in Samilkar.
That's why the vaat is not just a minute, but a new medium of social change.
What else could be the reason for anybody's greater satisfaction
That's why I thank you, thank you for making it a success.
My loved ones, Navaratri and Durgapuja in the next week, the festival of Vijayadashmi, the celebration of Deepavali.
Navaratri or Durgapuja - This worship of power must be the worship of the unity of the society.
It'll be a festival to join each other.
That'll be the means of the real power and then we can combine the victory festival.
Come on, let's worship the power, let's go with the mantra of unity.
Tomorrow, 29 August Hockey's magicians' birthday.
This day, "Teastern Creation Day" fled home all over the country.
I'm supposed to remind yourself of his contribution.
He played an important role in the golden jay in the Olympic Hawk in India in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
We all know the name of Broadman.
He talked about meditation, 'he scores goals like runs'.
Consciousness was a terrible mood and a living mosquito of the countrymen.
Once at a match in Kolkata, the opponent hits with a hockey stick on the head of the gangster.
The match is over and only 10 minutes left.
Meditations make three goals in that 10 minutes and say, I'm gonna get hit.
My dear neighbor, whenever the time comes, there's a lot of advice in My-Gov Portal or Narendra Modi.
Sriman Ajeet Singh wrote in "Narendra Modi App", please, "What will you tell the people about their participation in education and sports, because they have glorified the country by winning the medals in Revolution.
Mr. Shachin has written a request to you, and now you must remember the worker of Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa.
One of them is North India's and one South India, one of the east India, one of the other parts of India.
It seems that the women of all over the country have taken their blindness to brighten the name of India.
"My-Gov" portal has written a teacher, we could have made better results in Olympics.
He says, Honor Moddy sir, first thank you for winning two medals in Rio.
But I'd like to take care of you in this case... what was the best thing to participate in our many contests
Its answer is - "No".
And today nobody else can do better than you.
This is how Srimansatya Prakash Mehra wrote in the "Narendra Modi App", "What should we emphasize on extra educational programmes, especially in children and youth.
Thousands of people showed the same idea.
It's not a way of denial that we can't show results as expected.
In some cases, it was also possible that our players couldn't even get to the extent that they saw in the field of sports.
And in the medal list, we're the only two medals.
But even if we don't get the danger, we'll see it, we're gonna see it for the first time.
Look, in the shooting, our census has placed the fourth position and the medals have been discovered for a very short interval.
In Jimnastics, Deepa worker has also performed a very good activity and has the fourth place.
But how would we forget that he was the first Indian woman in Gymnastics to be eligible for the Alimpics and for the final festival of Olympics
It's almost the same thing happened in Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna jute.
Athletics, we showed good results.
After 32 years of heat, Lalitawabar got the ability to play on track and field finals.
Boxing-Obikash Krishna Yadav reached the court final, but he didn't get the bronze medal.
A lot of players, such as Aditya Ashok, Dattoo Bhoknal, Annu slaves, who have performed a very good game.
But my loved ones, we have to do a lot more.
What we've come here, so if we do it, we'll be disappointed again.
I've announced the formation of a committee.
We're gonna go deep into the streets of the world where the sports are going on.
We'll make a roadmap of how we can do better.
We planned to think of the results by 2020,2024, 2028.
I'll also request the kingdoms to make such a committee and look at us in the game.
I'll also request the organizations associated with sports that you do 'brainstorming' in private.
Let the kingdoms define their own suggestions.
We have to prepare the oldest and I believe we're 125 million natives, 65 percent of our lives, and we're gonna get the best results in the sports world.
My dear one, on September 5, the teacher's day.
I spent a few years in the teacher's business with students and spent time as a student.
I learn a lot from these little boys.
I have 5th September teaching day, as well as educationists.
But now I have to go to G-20summit, so I'm supposed to express this feeling of my mind today.
As much as the mother's place in life as the teacher's place.
This time, after Rio Olympics, the story of Pullela Gopichas is being discussed again and again.
He's a player right, but we got the best testimony he was.
I see Gopichand as an excellent teacher than a player today.
And on the Teacher's Day, Pulela Gopichand, his meditation, his self-dependence for playing and his disciples' success in his own way.
We always feel the role of a teacher in all our life.
5th September, the President of India, Dr.
On the birth day of Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji the country of Arsara celebrates this day as a teacher day .
He's always trying to live as a teacher.
Not only that, he always used to say, "Good teacher is the one in whose students never lose.
Dr. Radhakrishnanji has shown this wonderful life, even after being a nationalist, to live as a teacher.
I sometimes feel that I remember a lot of my teachers because he was in our small village.
I can tell you today that a teacher of mine, who is now ninety years old, has come to me every month.
If you have a photo with your teachers, there is a good incident with your teachers, you must share it with everyone in the "Narendra Modi App".
Look, the teachers in the country are very important to see from the students' point of view.
My dear neighbor, the Ganesh festival will take place a few days later.
Lord Ganesh removes all the fools and we all want our country, society, family, all people and their lives.
Whenever we talk about the Ganesh festival, it's very strange to remember the name of Lokmanya Tilak.
Lokmanya Tilak gave the Ganesh festival a public shape.
Through the Sarvajan Ganesh festival, he made this religious festival a festival of national consciousness, making a festival of social reform.
Everything that influences social life through the Ganesh festival should be discussed so that society becomes new in the new power, new in order to enjoy this time.
But in the same way, the folk guys who gave the script - the prince's right to birth - that's all the center of discussion.
Nowadays, not only Maharashtra, Ganesha festival is celebrated everywhere in the country.
Especially young people started preparations with enthusiasm for this festival.
Some people are still fond of following the idea that the festival started.
Discussions on various issues, creation races, alpna races are organized.
Everything that affects our society in the surroundings of the statue is presented beautifully.
In this everybody's Ganesha Festival, a number of people's training is being carried out.
Lokmanya Tilak 'Swaraj gave us the prestige of our birth.
But now we live in free India.
Now we'll say at the Ganesh festival, Suraj is our right.
We'll go on the way to Suraj, Suraj will be our basic demand.
Can't we go ahead with this mantra
Come on, I'm calling you.
Festival is impossible for us to live, but we have to change it according to the promise of time.
This time, many people wrote me a lot about the festival and the fortnight.
They're particularly worried about the environment.
A person named Shankar Narayan Pacific said to me, "Modiji, do you explain to everyone through the original ceremony that they use the Ganesh idol made by the Pushkarni of the village without using the plaster of Paris. "
Protecting the environment, rivers and pesticides, and the safety of the smallest living creatures that are in the water from contamination is the service of God.
Lord Ganesh.
So we don't build a statue that creates a discord.
I don't know how you're gonna take these things to me, but I'm not talking alone, many more.
Environmental Ganesh Festival - This is also a social service.
There's still some time left.
Now we have to stabilise that those old families who build the idols, if they make the idols of the Pushkarni or the river, they'll get a chance to grow.
And after the festival, they'll go back to the source and save the environment.
I'm telling you all about Ganesh Chathi.
My loved one, Bharat Ratna Madar Teresa will be honored in the title "Sant" on September 4.
Mother Teresa had spent his entire life in the service of the poor man of India.
It's very simple for all Indians to be proud of the title of this mother Teresar.
To participate in the event that will be held on 4th September, a representative group of officials under the leadership of our foreign minister Sushma Swaraj will be present there.
We can always learn something from saints, sages, muni and minorities.
I hope we'll drink something new, we'll learn and do something good.
The power of the people is considered to be the form of God.
In the past, the Indian government has made a successful attempt to connect ordinary people to the Gangasafai campaign for the clean Ganga associated with the five kingdoms.
The village chiefs present in Allahabad have taken the oath by keeping the mother-ganga witnessed, they will now stop the habits of defecating in the open place in the village, run the expedition to make the toilet, do not let the Ganges go, join the Ganga Safai campaign completely.
I thank the Indian government for all the ministers and ministers who made this program possible.
I'm also thanking the Chief Ministers of the Panch state, who joined the general public in the Ganga Safai campaign and took an important step.
The boys and girls from seven to seventeen years have worked.
This letter has an emotional effect that after getting the letter, whenever the students came to school, they gave letters to some parents school teachers, they would give them a toilet to the house in a specified date.
A sixty-six-year-old daughter-in-law of Koppal district of Karnataka is sitting in truth against her family.
When the village's chief, Mahmoud Shafi, can possibly swear that Mallamma is making a sacrificial for the toilet, he pays 18 thousand rupees and makes it a week.
The village chief, like Mahmoud Shafi, is really worthy of the girls like Mallamma.
How can the road be made to solve the problem, that's the power of the people.
My beloved countrymen, "Swachh Bharat" is now the dream of all Indians.
It's a vision to anyone.
And some Indians have chosen it as their guys.
If the Government of India is concerned and all the people are being told to create a movie for two or three minutes, "Swachh Bharat" and send this shortfill to the Indian government.
The details of this will be available on the website.
It will be a race and the winner on the day of Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October will be rewarded.
I'm telling TV channels, you're making such photographs.
My beloved countrymen, India is always trying to keep our relations with our neighbours deeper, easier, alive.
A few days ago, an important event took place. Our patriot Manav Mukherjee enjoyed the Channel 'Akashwani Maithi' in Kolkata.
Now, maybe many people think the president will suppose a radio channel
But it's not a common radio channel, it's a very big step.
We're in the neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and the West are carrying the same cultural tradition today.
So on one side, 'Akashwani Maitri' and on the other, 'Christ Baitar'... they will enjoy different functions, and on the other side, the Bengali speaking people will enjoy the functions of the sky.
He has made a big contribution to human communications.
The recognised president inaugurated it.
I'd like to thank Bangladesh as well as those who joined it.
I'm sweet to the friends of the window, they're also playing their role in foreign policy.
This kind of event gives new energy, gives new impressions, and that's the source of something to do for the countrymen.
I got a letter a few days ago, which drew my mind.
He wrote this letter, almost a mum, a retired teacher of the chicken year.
If not, he used to deny his name in the letter, I was very interested in telling you all.
He wrote in the letter, "When you applied to snatch the gas, I quit the gas, then I forgot it.
"Orders, you know, I tried those who gave up the gas, sent a letter to them, and a representative of myself was present to the letter.
I'm trying to write more than a million letters.
It's not worth a few thousand rupees, it's important that this mother's emotion, she and her mother's blessings of millions of mothers and sisters help the future of our country, powerful, dependent.
My dear neighbor, last year we were very worried about the ruins, but in the next month, we're suffering from perpetual floods.
Some places in the country have been flooded many times.
State governments, central governments, local administrative institutions, social institutions and citizens.
But there's something that we need to remember.
Those small boys who are trying to create discomfort in Kashmir, must have to recognise these innocent boys.
My loved ones, our country is rich in great, variety.
Thank you so much today
I had a chance to spend some time with the young friends of Delhi this morning.
I believe that every young man's jealousy will spread all over the country in the coming days.
We all know that in a few days we've been going to organise the greatest summit for world-class sports.
Rio will be repeated in our ears.
Today, in Delhi, the Indian government has organized a big and beautiful race for "Run for Rio", and live, play and play."
I'll do something to encourage our players anywhere in the next day.
I'm also a countrymen like 125 million patriots, as a citizen, will be with you to encourage all these people.
Come on, we'll be able to pursue their efforts as much as we can glorify each other in the coming days.
When I'm talking about Rio Olympics today, a poem read a poem by Suraj Prakash, a student of Punjab Central University.
Maybe there are many more poets who have written many poems, perhaps someone will write it in every language, but I want to enjoy the poem that Surajji has taught me.
A young man, Mr. Ankit, reminded me of the death anniversary of Abdel Kalam-ji.
In the last week, the country and the world's faith in Kalam-ji's journey day.
As soon as the name of Abdul Kalam-ji is called, science, technology, technicians, architectural images of the future are in front of us.
And he wrote that what is your government doing for Abdel Kalam-ji's dream of prosperous people
If we put an old tech out of research and discovery, we'll be out of this world's changing age.
And that's why the government has taken a lot of arrangements for new generation science, for the development of technology, research and discovery.
So I say, "Let us innovate to" - Come on, we're in the next research.
And when I say "Let us" to innovate, then AI M means Atal I
If we have to drive the next generation, we'll have to deal with this work.
And that is why the Indian government has taken the initiative to create Atal Tinkering Labs.
Well, if we have a strong and efficient researcher, there is a setting up to bring him to a sure goal to find out, to renew him.
As you need to create a new research, there is also a need to improve the old geography.
We need to find technological solutions to this problem everyday.
We've informed the young generation of today about the Atalgrand Challenges, if you have any problems in your eyes, find technologies to solve it, research, discover, tell us.
If the Indian government is able to find such a new repercussion in order to solve our problems, then the creator is specially encouraged.
I'm happy that people are very interested in this.
When we talked about Tingering Lab, we asked for more than thirty thousand schools, and when we spoke of the Incubation Center, we asked for more than four thousand educational and other institutions.
The state government and the central government, together with the shoulders, are intimate efforts for the helpers of the flooded people.
Though there is some trouble for rain, the minds of every man are swollen in the rain, because we are in the center of all economic pictures, rain and farming.
Sometimes there's a disease that we have to admire lifetime.
Well, if we are aware, be careful, be careful in the face of the disease, so it's easy to save the throat.
Try to be careful of little cleanness, be very careful, try to be safe.
Pay special attention to the children and don't think that dengue is just bad, but it's not right.
Glad, dengue spreads first in rich Ellaka.
You're sure you're watching the television, but sometimes we're supposed to use it.
I want to attract your vision, the countrymen who are interested in others.
Life is so familiar, so there's a race in it, so sometimes it doesn't have to worry about it.
I'm sick, so I think I'm gonna get well soon, so I'm gonna get some antibiotics.
I can get rid of the disease immediately, but my beloved countrymen, the practice of eating antibiotics can cause serious problems.
Maybe you've relaxed for a while, but we should stop eating antibiotics with doctor's advice.
The bacteria that cause tuberculosis and malaria are quickly transforming into one of them so that the medicine works can be destroyed.
In medical terms it is called antibiotic registration .
That's why you should use antibiotics.
You must take care of it.
When we talk about health, I want to add another thing to it.
The pregnant mothers in our country think of their lifetime sometimes.
About three women are pregnant every year in our country, but some mothers die during childbirth, sometimes mother dies, sometimes or children, sometimes mother and child.
It is true that in the last decade, the maternal maternal mortality rate has decreased, but still it is not possible to save lives of many pregnant mothers.
Blood deficiency in the wombs, infections during delivery, high blood pressure... sometimes nobody knows how to destroy his life.
Keeping in mind all this the Indian government has started a new campaign for the past few months - ' Prime Minister's safe motherhood campaign'.
According to this investigation, on the 9th day of every month, all pregnant women can be tested in government health centers.
It's possible to save the lives of both mother and child, and I would like to tell the sensitivity of the genetics, you can't get the date of the month, the date of the nineth month, and the payment of the poor mothers
My doctor's brother-in-law can't they envisage the poor for twelve days a year
My loved countrymen, today the world changes, world warmth, specially concerned about the environment.
During the war in Kurukshetra, Lord Shree Krishna spoke of trees in the battlefield, and in the battlefield, we can guess the importance of thinking of trees.
In Geetha, Lord Krishna says - I am absorbed in all trees.
According to scientific methods, "Nasti Mulang Anushodhang" - There is no tree that has no medicinal properties.
The tree that donates, crosses him like the trees.
That's why the parents who talk about their welfare, put a good tree and reinforce it like a child.
Whether our class-Geethah, wise rituals or Mahabharata's Anushasan Parva - are some of the present generations, who have shown this vision of scripture in their work.
Within a few days, I feel the example of a daughter of Pun, Golden - she touched my heart.
In the Mahabharata Anushasan festival, the trees also serve children's rituals, the golden only served to fulfill the demands of the society, except for their parents.
The daughter-in-law of Narayanpur village of the son-in-law of the state of Maharashtra has married her grandchildren to the Maruti Mahatra in a visionary way.
Other temples can also start the tradition of planting trees instead of Prasad in this rain.
Currently, in order to build a house in India, millions of rupees of wood carts have to be exchanged from abroad.
If we plant plants on the side of our food, you can also sell them after 15-20 years of government permission.
This can be a new source of your income, and to save India from wood supply.
In the past, many states have carried out a lot of expeditions for this rainy season, the Indian government has already passed a CAMPA law, making more than forty thousand crores of rupees through this ice.
The state of a desert in Rajasthan - so much of the forest and enjoyed planting fifty lakh plants .
It's not a small thing to plant fifty lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who knew the land of Rajasthan would know how hard it works.
Andhra Pradesh has also taken aim of increasing the greenery of the state by 50 percent in the year 202029.
The central government's Green India Mission, through that plan, the railways are green.
There's a bright cylimate of the forest-mahotsav in Gujarat too.
This year Gujarat has celebrated many projects called ' Amban ' , ' Ektavan ' , ' Shahid forest ' as forest-houses and has been campaigning for crores of trees .
I can't mention all the kingdoms, but I'm worthy of praise.
My loved countrymen, I had a chance to go to South Africa a few days ago.
It's my first trip, and whenever it goes abroad, there's talk of bitterness, art-building, discussions about safety, ever witnessing "Mu"... it's all happening.
But I had a single pilgrimage to South Africa.
Whenever South Africa is considered, it's very strange to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandeller.
As soon as the words of jealousy, love, forgiveness come to the world, their eyes glitter in front of us.
I went to the Phoenix Settlement, my southern African tour, known as 'Sarboday'.
The train on which Mahatma Gandhi traveled, when John Mohndas was gained to become Mahatma Gandhi, I was lucky to travel through that train from Peter Maryrg station, but I'm telling you, I had the chance to join the great men who have lived for everyone's equality, for everyone's sake.
Even after so much penance, they didn't see what they needed to get.
Geetha's reference to the talents I've seen in them.
I'll remember that meeting forever.
There cannot be a big mantra for any society or any government.
Think of everyone equally and think of everyone. That's the way leads us to the bright future.
We want a beautiful life, kids want a good future - every one's needs different.
"Prioty" may be different, but the path is the same, and that path is harmonious, comfortable, equal chance, equal thinking to everyone and thinking to everyone.
Come on, we feel proud of those Indians who have lived in South Africa as well as our roots of life.
My loved countrymen, I thanked the artist Burma, he told me about a thing.
Prime Minister, I'm calling artist Burma from Bangalore.
Within a few days, I've been in a report of the newspaper that a foolish woman was killed and succumbed to his suicide by losing fifteen hundred rupees.
I'm very sympathetic to a woman's family.
I want to know what you're thinking about this catastrophic and e-mail.
"Forget some guys with money.
A new way of squareing through technology, which is spreading around the world.
On the one hand, the technology has played a bigger role in economic development, and on the other hand, the people who abused him have also come down to the ground.
You've forgotten sometime, because they're so beautiful to write your letters as if it's real.
Building a fake Letter pad and knowing your credit card, debit card number and your bunker's account is empty through technology.
This is a new kind of smoking, digital smoking.
We have to stay away from this kind of fool, awake, and we'll have to take care of it with the friends and friends of the Massage Aleniz.
Our friends also bring people from their own area, meet me, talk, they're talking about their problems.
But I have a good experience recently.
Some students from Aligarh had come to me.
You've picked the best picture at the station.
Not only this, we've built a virtual garden in search of the plastic bottles or oil cane.
In this way, they gave a completely new form to the nerve station.
If you ever go to Aligarh, you must see the station.
There's a new feeling.
Some changes can be made to the masses, that's his example.
Thank you for doing this kind of work in the country, especially thanks to my associates of Aligarh.
My loved countrymen, when the rain comes, the season of the festival starts in our country.
Festivals will be held at different places in the next day.
In the temple, the festival will be celebrated at the shrine, and you will also go to the festival at home.
Watching is an important festival for us.
Like last year, cannot you give the country's mother-father the 'Prime Minister's Safety Birth Plan' or 'Journal Birth Plan' on the occasion of maintenance
My loved countrymen, there are many of us who were born after Independence.
I was the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in the free India.
On August 8, the 'Bharatchacho' movement was reported, it's 75 years since it's going to be 70 years of independence on August 15.
We're enjoying freedom, the pride of being a free citizen... that's enough to recall all those people who brought this freedom.
75 years of 'Bharat Leave' Movement and 70 years of independence can introduce new inspiration, and it can take time to take a good deal for the country.
I hope you'll do something different in the inspiration of self-determination.
And nowadays the technology has become so sweet that you can enjoy anything that you can give me, and I'll invite you. Come, I'll recall the life of freedom fighters.
Every man plans a lot at the time of the holiday.
And during this holiday, my climate, so I think I'm tasting.
Sometimes it feels better if you have some time to sleep in the afternoon.
But this time the horrific heat struck all around.
It's very simple to think of the countrymen.
And all the places of water collection are decreasing due to the continuous exhaustion of them.
That's why there's an attempt to do something about the very sensitive and water conservation everywhere.
A few days ago, someone told me that the village Panchayat and his subordinate villagers gave great importance to the need of water in the village of Ahmadnagar district of Maharashtra.
They decided to leave all the crops that are needed for water in all the crops of Akh, Kala.
It's not easy to hear how easy it looks.
Everybody's imagined how big
If a factory uses water and we talk of shutting down the factory because the water is being used, you know what the result will be.
It's true I'm talking about a small village in Hibrad, but there's a lot of villages like that.
I'm enjoying all these villagers for this kind of good work.
I am told by a john that the Gorava village panchayat of Devas district of Madhya Pradesh tried to build a farm reservoir.
They built almost 27 agricultural reservoirs.
This led to the increase in the global water level, the water rose to a great extent.
I'm gonna tell you, they're more interested than the railway.
Man's nature is, as far as the dangers are concerned, as if it's a good news, it's dangerous.
Since there was 110 percent of the rainfall in place of 106 percent, it seems as if there was a message of great peace.
It's still late for the rains, but the news of good rains has made a new impression.
Farmers need soil, they use crops in the field.
Now we can't get the dune from the village's pond and pour it into the field
And the wound will also be good and his water supply will also increase.
Sometimes in the cement bed, sometimes the water can be stored in the bottom of the sar.
Water levels will grow, water will come in our well.
So as much water as possible.
Well, the water of the village will be in the village... and if we do something, it's possible for a joint effort.
So today the water is very good, it's going on, but the next month, we've got time.
Shriman Kumar Krishna asked the ' Maya Gave ' - can the Ganga safari campaign be possible for our lifetime
How many governments have come, how many projects have been made, too much money.
And so it's very simple to raise this question in the minds of millions of people in the country like brother Kumar Krishna.
The Ganges introduces our roots and the Ganges enables us to revive us.
As the Ganges flows, the country's economy also has a new proliferation.
A gentleman brought us to the Ganges, but he needs millions of fools to save it.
This work will never be possible without the social help of the public.
We need to be change agents for its cleaning and cleaning.
There are many projects under the government.
Efforts are being made to take full support from the kingdom on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to connect social and selfish organizations alone.
Several steps have been taken to prevent pollution through environment polluting and factory.
Everyday there is a large quantity of drainage in the Ganges.
In order to clean this jungle, Baransi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc., the trash skiimmers are cleaning the water with sowing water.
All local organisations have been informed and requested to keep this work on and regulate the cleaning of the jungle.
I was told earlier, wherever there is a better attempt, it is possible to clean the jungle from 3 to 11 tons per day.
So it's okay we're gonna be able to clean up a large quantity of flame.
There are plans to install Trash skiimmers in one more place next day.
And its subsidies will soon be understood by the Ganges and Yamuna coastal people, an effective plan for the pollution control of pulp and pap, pap, disitillary and sugar industry.
Pulp and Paper Industries are almost completely blocked from the factory of the Bablack Liquor.
All these things prove that we're moving towards the right goal and awareness has increased.
People are also providing financial support for the cleaning of the Ganges, due to which this work is going on very well.
My beloved countrymen, April 24.
This day is celebrated as ' Panchayati Raj Din ' in India .
Today, the Panchayati kingdom was started in our country.
And today the Panchayati kingdom in the country is working successfully as an important unit of democracy.
On 24th April, we celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Father Ambedkar, and today on 24th April, "Panchayetti Raj Day".
This is a beautiful concert, the most important part of our constitution is our village.
He inspired to do this important thing to connect the village with the constitution.
From April 14 to April 24, his birthday, India's expedition has been carried out from Baby village for ten days.
This is my privilege that on 14th April, there was a chance to go to Mahu on the birth day of Dad Ambedkar, and I had the chance to pray at that holy place.
Today, on 24th, in Jharkhand, where most of the tribal brothers and sisters are, I'll celebrate 'Puncheti Raj Day' today.
I'll talk to all the Panchayats of the country once more at Bella 3.
This expedition worked as a foolish sensitivity.
At the same time, all these villages in India have been running for ten days, so it looks very low.
I'm greeting all the state governments, for the villagers.
You have taken this opportunity to further strengthen democracy for the development and prosperity of the village in a very fundamental and new way.
And that's why we'll be able to get enough fruits on the village's stomach.
Shermila from Mumbai has spoken of her thinking.
- Chief Minister Namskar
I'm talking to Sharmila from Mumbai.
You have questions about the education of my school and college.
Like in education, reconciliation has been needed for many years.
Today, if parents have a single dream in every family, then it's a child's teaching.
I'm gonna talk about the house.
This idea for children's education in a country like India, their imagination of plenty of education, a great power.
I want to increase the idea of a better education to the child... and more awareness is necessary.
That's why I'll request all the parents and parents to discuss school programs with the children for a long time.
And if you think of something, go to school and talk to teachers.
This surveillance will help us get a lot of breaks in our education sites.
And it must be possible for everyone to share.
Every government in our country gave importance to education and they tried in their own way.
And it is also true that for a long time, we had a focus on the educational institutions, the spread of education, the school-colleges, the teachers and teachers, and many children coming to school.
We've done a big job for teaching.
Now we have to emphasize the qualitative education.
A good education through literacy campaign - this must be our main objective.
So long, it was necessary to calculate the circumvention.
Now it is necessary to examine the success of education.
Till now, how many students have come to school.
Full, filled, filled - this mantra was burned forever.
But now we have to pay attention to the children who come to school to give them good and worthy education.
You saw the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to force Success.
It's okay, there's a lot of way left.
But if we decide 125 million people, we can cross this path too.
But Sharmilaji's point is that we want to change our minds.
You must have noticed that some work has been done outside the traditional idea in the budget.
In the budget, ten government universities and ten innocent universities were told to be freed from government bonds and they were asked to know what challenges are they to be the best university
India's universities can compete with other universities in the world, and it is also necessary to do such a race.
With this, education is as important as efficiency.
That's why technology will play a bigger role in education.
Technologies of far-reaching will make our education easier.
And I believe I can understand the results in the far-reaching future.
Recognised Prime Minister, Namskar
I'm from Bijnor to Meena Karnwal.
Young people have an important role in playing with writing today.
They need to have multiple mentality and good leadership qualifications, so that their civilization can be achieved.
I want you to ignore a lot of young people, and I want the government to encourage more and more NCCs, NSS and Indian schools and Guide.
You sent me so much of the proposal that I also agreed to talk to the NCC, NSS, India Scots and Guides, before I talk to you.
I arranged a sitting in repeated requests and proposals for you, in which NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guide, Red Cross, Nehru were the chiefs of the youth centres.
When I asked them whenever they met before, they told me, when the country was free, they first attended such a seat.
Now I've picked up some of these things before them.
I told them, why don't our young men take part in the water supply during this summer
There's something like that with them.
I see this as a matter of lightning among us.
You must have suggested that the political situation in our country has come to an extent that there has been a lot of talk about this in the last few elections - how many parties will give gas cylinders
On the other hand, the economics spoke of reducing gas subcDs.
Some committees have also proposed to reduce gas subcDs.
It's all experience.
I said this kind of thing, but today I want to say, I'm proud of my countrymen.
Hundreds of families quit the gas subcD.
And this is not a million families.
I see some of those who left the subsidie, some retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers - such a middle-wing or low-middle class families.
But heses showed that more than 80 percent of the families who left the gas subsidies left the gas subsidies and left the gas subsidies by standing in line with the distributor.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government leaves a little in the tax, then the government's appreciation is heard on the weekly TV and the newspaper.
In our country, the subcD is considered to be the right.
But one crore families left the subcD.
I'm telling hundreds of punishments to those millions of families all before, because they have forced political leaders to think newly.
The world's economics, who do this, propagates this kind of economic equation, even outside their concern.
Sometimes I think we declare no ticket tester on this railway route today.
We can test many such tests.
If you trust the people of the country, you can get expected results.
Anyway, it's your own opinion.
It cannot be a government rule, but we can create this kind of environment.
And this environment is not making any political leader, the country's only family created this environment.
All braking news is bad.
Isn't there anything good around us in this country of 125 crore population
Please change this situation.
He used to talk again and again.
A few days ago, I wrote a letter from the paper that they shouldn't publish any defamation news on Monday.
And everyone wants the common man to get the right and good news.
It's true that if any famous person speaks good words, selects good words, shows them goodly, the effect that can be seen more than that.
Good news inspires to do good work.
It's okay, it's gonna be worse than you.
If the lamp burns, the darkness will be removed, it will be
Perhaps you know, this is why a website has been opened by the government - transforming India - this website shows hopeful news.
This is not just a government, ordinary people, you can send some good news to this portal.
You can also join it.
Rabbiji, you gave a good advice, but please don't get angry with me.
We're all gonna work together, we'll try to talk to the constructive point, we'll try to reach the architectural point.
The specialty of our country is Kumbhmela.
Kumbh Mela can be a center of attraction for tourists.
Only a few people in the world know that millions of people have come to the coast of the river for so long.
In a calm mind, this fair is concluded in a calm environment.
This incident, in a historical perspective, in the sense of event management, creates a bigger narrowness in the vision of ordinary human partnership.
For the past few days, I've seen some people uploading pictures of the lions.
I want the Indian government and the state government to organize a race for these pictures.
And tell the people to upload a better phone.
He said, we've put a special emphasis on cleanness, and cleansing is not just in this circumference, but they want people from Kumbhmella to take a message of cleanness.
I assume this Kumbhmela is a religious and spiritual fair, but we can make it as a social union.
I can build it as a cultural area.
It may be a chance to reach the village in a better synthesis.
My dear countrymen, I'll meet you once more on this great day of Panchayat Raj, thank you all so much.
What's the mind, July 2019
Well, there's always a request from me and from your side for the air.
This time I've seen a lot of letters, comments, phones, in which many stories have been found, I've got advice.
I think you're taking my test.
In spite of this, your words go to the jurisdiction of the Watt, and I want to take part with you once again.
You must remember that last time I discussed a book on the story of the boyfriend and we decided that if someone's books, we'll share something about that book with everyone through the NarendramodiApp.
I've seen a lot of people, different types of books have been shared there.
I'm glad to see people discuss a lot of things like science, technology, new motivation, history, culture, trade, self-reliance.
Some people suggested me to talk about some more books.
But I have to confess one thing that I don't know when I read too much books.
But I think we should take this experience for the past one month.
I want this book to become an active stage for the corner, readers and writers.
Friends, I think I've touched this thing before, "Jal Defence", but today I feel that this water conservation was the same thing as your heart touched before I told you, the common man was fond of it.
I feel that this water has just dragged your countrymen's mind.
There's a lot of effort in the country to save water.
Humans are distributing information about various traditional methods.
Mediazal has started a lot of innovative publicity on the preservation.
Because of this, not just the land damage and crop damages are being stopped, but the fields are also getting water.
You'll be glad to know that the beauty of the north-east is the first state of the Meghalaya, the country, which has sacrificed its own water supply or water police.
I'm greeting the government there.
There's a lot of fairs too.
We can use these fairs to save water.
People from all sections of society come to this fair.
We're here to organize a show, dramatically dramatically, and the water conservation will be arranged with the festival.
That's why you want to listen to a few children today.
These are Nidhi Baipatu, Manish Yoshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devadharkar, Anant Tewari, Prati Nag, Arthur Deshmukh, Aryanesh Ganguly and Hrithik Ala-Manda.
You'll be proud of what I say about them, and you'll also have a thrill.
We all know, "Kansar" is a word that fears all over the world.
It seems that death is standing in the brink.
But these ten children didn't just defeat a fatal disease like cancer in the war of life, with them the name of India in the world.
We often see that a player is a champion after a tournament wins or after a medal, but this is a rare experience where he has been championed before he has joined the competition and then a champion of life.
This month the World Children's Winners Games was organized in Moscow.
Sports like shooting, grandfather, swimming, race, football, table tennis are organized.
This ten grateful champion of our country has won medals in this tournament.
Some of them have won more medals.
My beloved countrymen, my belief, you've been proud of the success of India far away from the sky.
Sanjay Haripura from Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P from Telangana.
Like Arvind Rao, many have written this about 'Narendramodi App' and 'My Gov' from different coasts of the country and have expressed interest in discussing 'Chandran-2'.
In fact, from the point of view of space research, 2019 is a good year for India.
Our scientists carried out 'A-Sat' in March and then this moonlight-2.
It's not possible to discuss such a big and important news as "A-Sat" at that time.
In just three minutes, the "A-Sat" missile was capable of hitting satellites 300 kilometers away.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve success in this specific region.
On July 22 last year, the whole country has seen how Chandravan-2 from Sriharikota has been in front of the intellectual.
All those pictures of the successful excavation of 'Chandran-2' have filled the countrymen with glory, strength and happiness.
"Chandran-2" means a special type of mission.
We should trust our talent and power.
You'll be glad to know that 'Chandran-2' is a complete Indian industry.
It's Indian in life.
It's completely a foreign mission.
The way our scientific records are strange in the day and night, all the technological problems are properly lunched to the moonlight-2.
We also face such a tempoorry setback economic complicity in our life.
But always keep in mind that we have the ability to cross this barrier.
I'm very sure this 'Chandran-2' will inspire the youth of the country to create science and newness.
This is the ultimate truth that science is the way to develop.
We're now waiting for the month of September in great interest when two lander snakes and rovers descend into the moon land.
Today I want students of my country, a charming race for my youth friends, and I want to tell you something about a possibilities, and I want to invite young and young people of the country to a quiet composition.
Asked to surround space and interior, India's space mission, science and technology are the key points of this questionnaire, what to do to lunch the rocket, how to send a planet to the room or what can we know from this satellite or satellite, A-Satki.
I'll request my young friends to take part in this queue communication and make it more remarkable and memorable.
That winner, it'll be a historical event in the life of those gratitudes, but for that you have to take part in this uiz competitiveness, get the highest number.
My dear countrymen, you'll keep watching one thing, you've speeded up our 'What Watt' cleaning expedition at different times.
All the efforts that are going on for cleansing have always been inspired by the Wind.
The journey that began five years ago, with the help of everyone, established a new standard of cleaning.
It is true that we haven't been able to achieve the ideal situation in cleansing, but the way in which a cleaning expedition has been achieved in public places, the result of 130 million countrymen's will.
But we won't stop at all.
This movement has now risen from 'sufficiency' to beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching a message from Mr. Yogesh Sini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Sinny is an engineer who left the US job and returned to the country to serve Bharat Mata.
He took charge of making Delhi clean, not just a few days ago.
He started the work of beauty with his team from Lodhi Garden's basement.
Through 'Strite Art' they are decorating many areas of Delhi with beautiful pictures.
From the overbridge and school walls, when he shook the huts and dresses, many more started coming forward and the work was going on.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with a street painting during the Kumbh fair.
I knew that Yogesh Sinny and his team played a bigger role in this work.
There are no words in the color and lines, but the paintings made up of them are more meaningful than thousands of words.
Even in the "Cleanliness Expedition", we'll continue to demonstrate this beauty.
It's very important for us to try to create a wealth from the decoration of the Wast to Wealth.
I mean, we need to go to make gold from the fury.
My dear countrymen, I read a charming comment at 'My Gov' portal a few days ago.
The comment was from the Sopian district resident of Jammu and Kashmir, Brother Mahmood.
He wrote, "It's nice to hear the event "Man Ki Baat".
I'm very happy to know that I play an active role in organizing our state Jammu and Kashmir's Community Mobilisation Program Back to Village.
The ceremony was held in June.
I think this program should be organized every three months.
With this, the event's online monitoring must be arranged.
I think this is the first such event where the public had spoken directly to the government.
Brother Aslamji, after reading the message he sent me, I'm interested in knowing about the "Back to Village" project, so I read in detail about it, and then I think it should be told the whole country.
The people of Kashmir are interested in being associated with the roots of the country's progress.
They also knew if the villagers were getting government services.
How can they increase their income
Some more things were added to make the program more attractive.
"Khello India" program was organised in children's activity.
The programme was distributed to sports surgeons, cards and temporary tribes and tribes.
Financial literacy camps were opened and stalls were given under the government office in agriculture and plantation.
This is how this event turned into a development festival.
This was the festival of John Partnership, the festival of John Jagaran.
The ordinary people of Kashmir were quiet in this development festival.
Any officer was so surprised to get the heat of the villagers that they stayed in the village for two days.
It's a very joyful thing to participate in the rural areas and plan for their progress.
There is a wonderful consequence for the new emergence and the new imagination.
This kind of work and man's involvement in it proves that we are interested in the supersonship of the people of Kashmir... the power of progress that always gets more evidence than the power of the bomb-bunk.
All those who want to spread the bitterness of hatred on the path of development and want to stop the progress, they will never succeed in their hatred, or even as clear as the daylight.
My beloved countryman, who is honored with the Gyanpeeth award, said in a poem of Sriman Dattatreya Ramchandra, describing the form of Shravanmas, "Hodiga Madiga Agyalganga, Adraga land magna, i.e., the bonds of rain and baridha.
Whenever you look around us in this season, it seems as if the sit-downs were wearing green silver.
This is the time when the festivities of brothers and sisters are celebrated.
When it's going on in the month of Shravan, you will be happy to know that the most pilgrimages have participated in the last four years in the Amarnath Yatra.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave since July 1 .
More than the Tirthankaras who participated in this 60-day journey in 2015, the pilgrims have joined this time only 28 days.
I want to praise the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests, especially for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
The journey that came back, they brought the people of the kingdom with great care and hot memory.
All these things will help to improve tourism in the future.
I am told that in Uttarakhand this year the journey of four pilgrimages started, since then more than 8 lakh pilgrims visited Kedarnath Dham in a month and a half.
After a huge natural disaster in the film, the first time the pilgrimages reached there in such a record.
I request you all, you must go to all those areas of the country, where you see the beauty, the rainy season.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of humans in our country, tourism and pilgrimage cannot be a greater teacher than this.
I'm glad to all of you, that this beautiful and live month of recognition will enable you to create new energy, new hopes and new rises.
On the other hand, it's a time when heavy rains occur in different parts of the country.
When we see TV, rains all around, water thy Thai, traffic jam.
Another picture of the rain, where we are enjoying, our farmers, birds, birds, waterfalls are flowing, you have to go out with the family to see them sitting on the green silver.
Rain, freshness and happiness, that is, Freshness and Happiness, come together.
My beloved countrymen, "What's the way we start from the Christian Christianity, it seems difficult to stop, but most of the time is a border.
I'll come back a month later.
I'll tell everyone the good news of Ester.
My young friends, you're all busy in the test.
Some people maybe the test is over.
And some of the people are going to switch, because on the one hand, on the other, T-20 cricket world cups.
Even today, you're waiting for matches between India and Australia.
Today, India will play with Australia, I'm telling the two team players my good wish.
But fortunately in the last few decades, we're coming to the bottom - we're losing - we're going back.
Now, in FIFA, our place has descended so much that we can't dare to talk.
Throughout this year, we can create a soccer-footed environment.
In schools, colleges, every corner of the country, our youth generation, our school boys sweat their sweat.
There are few men who go abroad, most of them go somewhere in their own kingdom for 5-7 days.
Some people go out of the kingdom.
I told you earlier, wherever you don't go, upload the phone from there.
We have to take this job forward.
Even now, you do the same thing, but now write something with him, not just the phone.
And he says, "A traveller without cooperation is a bird without wing".
If you want to see good things, you'll have to make a look.
And I'm lucky, I got a lot of chance to travel.
When I wasn't the chief minister, I wasn't the prime minister, and I was a little older like you, I'm roaming around.
Maybe there is no district in India where I don't want to go.
Tourism has a big role in creating life.
And now the youngsters of India are going to tourism with courage, and they are going to work hard.
I didn't call it a good example.
Our young generation adventurous, where no one keeps his legs, they must try to reach there.
I want to thank Coal India in a special way.
Stay away.
When we see the pictures of the people there, we think we're gonna get there.
And it's a matter of fact that the hand is black in the caterpillar, so people go away from the mine.
But how much of that can be built as a tourist center
And I'm glad that it started, so far more than ten thousand people have seen the environmental binding center in Saon village near Nagpur.
This place gives you a chance to see new things.
I hope if you go out on holidays, you can do something about cleanliness.
Maybe it's not too scientific, but it's happening.
Can you also not give importance to the cleanliness of the tourism center as a tourist
I'm sure our young friends must help this.
So there's a lot of employment from tourism.
India is still far behind in tourism as compared to other countries in the world.
But if we think we have to strengthen our tourism, we can surely attract the whole world.
We can take a large part of the world tournament to ourselves.
And then it's possible for our country to make millions of new guys to live.
Whether the government, the institution, the society or the citizen - all of this work must be done together.
Come on, we do something for that purpose.
My young friends, the holidays come and go, I don't like it.
You also think about this.
Would you like to leave your holidays, important years of life, important times like this
I'm telling you how many things you can think.
Can't you take a chance to add more competitive qualities to your personality on this holiday
If you don't know swim, you can swim in the holidays.
If you don't know how to drive a bike, you can learn to play a bike in the holidays.
To develop your personality at the time of the holiday, do something to increase your power and functionality.
Not only the areas I spoke, but there's a chance to do more strange things outside.
Your personality, your self-confidence will increase.
We'll talk to the friends about this.
This time there's some advice on the 'My Govt' portal.
Like - My name is Achurvedi.
I'm enjoying this work... with many birds, I've been friendly.
I request you to repeat this thing.
"My dear countrymen, I want to give thanks to this boy with the name of Achurvedi.
He reminded me of a good job.
Accused me, he's doing this all year and many birds have become his friends.
Mahadevi Varma, the great poet of Hindi, loved birds.
He wrote in his poem: "Don't let you go away, get up and fill up, fill the pot with sweet cold water.
"Come on, let us use this thing of Mahadevi.
I'm grateful to her, thanks to her, you remind me of a very important thing.
From Mahishur, the art cook has made a very sensitive thing for us all.
He said, there's a sufficient milk near our house, a newspaper, a Postman.
Sometimes the binoculars, the cloth seller, go through the way.
Have we ever invited them to drink water in summer, have we ever given them water
My beloved farmer brother-in-law, you've heard a lot of digital India.
Some people think the digital India is the world of young people of the city
If you download this app on your phone, you'll get a lot of information about agriculture and weather.
What's the situation of the market, what's the situation of the picker's market, how to gain good crops at this time, what's the useful medicines, etc.
And if you put any questions in front of them, they'll answer him and tell you.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan facility app on their mobile phones.
This time is very important for the farmers to start the crop.
Can't we open those old places once again, clean up, so that more water can be stored
You've seen this time, you've been trying to make 5 lakh ponds and yields of land.
Under the 'Manrega' project, we are forced to create wealth through water conservation.
To save water in the village, to save every drop of unprecedented rain, to stay in the village of the village, to prepare your plans for this awareness campaign.
You should take care of the various government plans, so that everybody gets an ideal for the importance and protection of water.
There are many villages in the country, there are a lot of progressive farmers, a very careful citizen who are doing this work.
But we have to go further.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to talk more to you, a few days ago, the Indian government organized a big agricultural fair.
I've seen how modern technology has come and how many changes have brought it to agriculture.
But these technologies must now reach the farmer's field.
And now the farmers are saying, we need to reduce the use of chemicals.
I'm greetings like this.
The excessive use of chemical serpent has made our earth ill with mother.
But if a good spice is given in large quantity, would you like to eat it
Whatever the best, the use of these sirs will be a cause of harm.
Every thing needs to be used.
It also reduces costs, saving money.
I hope I'm gonna be able to finish this work with full care of what is necessary for water conservation.
The water that survives, the farmers will get the same benefit and the life will survive.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is the World Health Day.
This year the theme of World Health Day is - ' Bit Diabetes ' .
Diabetes is a disease that leads to all other diseases.
Once someone has diabetes, then many diseased guests enter their homes, in the body.
According to statistics, in 1947, there were six and a half million diabetes patients in our country.
Three percent of death is diabetes.
Diabetes two types - type 1 and type 2 .
Type 1 is genetic, mother-father, there is a chance of children.
And the reason for type-2 is badness, aging and excess weight.
The whole world is worried about diabetes, so on 7th, the theme of World Health Day is diabetes.
We all know, the biggest reason for diabetes is our lifestyle.
Something's going down.
There's no name and smell.
Don't walk.
We're playing online.
Nothing's going on in the offline.
If you are interested in yoga, do yoga.
If you don't, you can run away.
If every citizen of our country is healthy, then our India will be healthy.
And now all the chances and discomfort are close to the hand, it's very easy.
You must think about it.
Last 24th March the 'Jakshma Day' was celebrated in the world.
When I was young, I was scared to hear the name of Yakma.
But when yawning was due to death, we would have been scared.
But now we don't care.
The number of tuberculosis patients in our country is much higher than the whole world.
If you have to get rid of tuberculosis, we need proper treatment and cervical treatment.
If you leave in the middle of the treatment, there's a new problem.
Acute tuberculosis is a disease that everyone around knows, they can also give advice to check up.
That means this is a disease that needs to be tested soon.
My dear countrymen, there's a lot of work on this.
More than 13,500 microscopic centers have more than four lakh DOTs provider.
Treat properly and go to the treatment till the disease is free .
I'll request you, yawning or diabetes.
India must be freed from these diseases.
But it's not just the government, the doctor, the medicine - until you come forward.
And so I'm asking the countrymen today, come, get rid of diabetes and get rid of tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, there are many important days in the month of April, especially on 14th April, Babasaheb Bheemra is also the birthday of Ambedakar.
His 125-year-old birth smoke fled all over the country.
A 'muhu' of Panchthirtha is his birthplace.
His studies in London, initiation to Nagpur.
My luck is that on 14th April this year, the birthplace of Papasaheb Ambedakar will be lucky to go to Mahu.
Dadasaheb gave us a lot to be a responsible citizen of the country.
Following that path, we can give him the most respectable citizen of the country.
In different states, this festival is celebrated in different names.
Somebody calls it "Nob Sambasar", some "Gudi-Parba", some "Year Represent", some "Ugadi".
You know, I told last time, what's my "What' program in about 20 languages you can hear at any time on your mobile phone.
You just have to call a missing.
This facility was just a month, and I'm glad about 35 million people were benefited from it.
You write the number-8190881908.
I'm saying again, 8190881908.
I'm glad I could join you.
I'd like to be a part of this.
I'm so worried about your children's test.
But if we change our thinking about the test, we might be worried.
I told my earlier "What's the matter, you must send me through your advice "Narendra Modi App".
I'd like to talk to parents, testators and teachers in this event.
I want to tell you something from what I've heard, what I've read.
I know the test is going on in a few days.
How many percent of the test
I just want to say that you'll stabilise something for yourself.
Don't put pressure on anyone else.
You must work, but a real and pervading goal... and try to touch this goal.
When I played cricket, I had a lot of people's expectations.
As the time has passed, people's expectations have increased.
It was very important for me to make a solution.
I thought I'd refute myself to myself and stabilise myself.
And if I stabilise myself and fulfil that goal, I can do something good for the country.
And I always tried to fulfil this goal.
I always had a goal on the words and because of that the goal was gradually fulfilled.
And I believe God must give you good results.
Goodbye
Don't ever fall in the pressure of desperation.
You have to make your future.
You must stabilise your goal.
Why would I finish my time to fight with others
Why don't I try to break all my records
Friends, don't think of the test number.
Life should always be driven for a great purpose - one should walk with a dream - repeated.
Whether we're driven on the right way, or not, this test is his hissab-nicesh.
If there's some deficiency in it, don't be disappointed.
Make more and more mindset to try and work.
Thousands of people wrote a small deal through my phone in my app.
Shrey Gupta says he's in a healthy body.
Students, you should pay attention to health as soon as you're studying, so that you can check it properly.
Anyway, for 365 days, we must be in accordance with dreams and imagination.
I agree with Mr. Prabhakar Reddie, he told us to sleep at the right time and get up and revisit.
Let's go to the test center with admit card and other papers... that's what you say.
I couldn't talk about it, because I'm sorry about sleeping.
And when I told you to sleep, don't think I'm sleeping for the test.
Don't misunderstand, I'm talking about sleeping to get a better test.
You mustn't do that.
I believe you're not gonna do that.
Reason in life is very important to strengthen the foundations of success.
It's a strong foundation of life since the sequence.
The strange and discord that works in the morning at night, he feels that the work was done.
That's why you don't think anything is small.
Do it properly, look at it.
Friends, I've seen sometimes tests like two.
One, who learns what he's reading, who's got a good idea.
Secondly, there are other tests that don't know what questions will come, what kind of questions will come, I can't solve.
The question papers would not be easy... like this... I saw the two types of tests.
A lot of tests with Dada playing.
When you're playing, you don't know if you don't know, you don't know what questions you're about.
If you're calm, eat properly, sleep a lot, then you'll see that your brain can remember the right answer to the right question.
I don't think it's just a challenge, can I remember what I have learned for the whole year, can I answer these questions
Stay so calm, sleep well at night, don't be more self-sacrificient, but don't be negative.
I've seen that your test is better than you're scared of the test.
So, be confident and very happy for you.
"Bishwarnathan's joy is really important.
His eyes don't turn around.
We've heard that Arjun's life was just looking at the bird's eyes.
That's how I saw Vishwanathan's pleasure... while playing, he's completely focused on the goal - and that's the peace of his world.
You don't talk to friends - stay lonely, humble, reverse many booklets until the end of the moment, you can never calm your mind.
That's why laugh very much - smile with friends - see your mind will be quiet.
But if the water is not calm, nothing can be seen.
Then I think - No, if I take a little rest, it'll be nice, so I've made a method myself.
Deep breathing - Stay breathing deep.
Let's breathe deeper three times.
Sometimes 30, 40 or 50 seconds, but my mind is completely quiet, something is worthy of understanding.
Maybe it's my experience, but it can help you.
Because most of the time we see, we'll go through the test, uh, uh... and uh... uh... and uh...
If parents are taught at home, parents are teachers on him, then write what I have written in the entire khata.
We're stuck in it.
Friends, you don't do that.
What happened at the time of the test is done.
Talk to the family members about other things, remember any laughing days to come out.
If you go somewhere with your parents, remember that scene.
Leaving the test, spend at least half an hour.
In the present observation, he is trying to reach the world on the importance of "Ramcharit Manas".
The old Murari father gave a lot of important advice to the students.
And confess whatever situation it may be.
In my experience, we can be mentally happy and happy if we recognise the situation.
If you don't have any stress, you'll surely be able to test your mind.
And if you get success, you're not sorry to fail.
We're grateful for the advice that Murarivapu gave us all.
Friends, I want to talk more today.
My mobile app is Sri Atanu Mandal, Sri Kunal Gupta, Sri Sushant Kumar, Sri K.
G.
But, guys, if I tell you to start sympathy from tomorrow morning, it'll be wrong to you.
But those who do yoga, don't do that tonight, they're tested.
If you're doing yoga, you must do it.
If you don't exercise before the test, contact you with someone who knows about your yoga, who will tell you something to do in two to five minutes.
Why should you do it soon
Prepare your entire day-long needle in such a way that if you get stuck in the traffic jam, you'll get to check time.
Otherwise, such a situation creates anxiety between the mind.
And one thing, the point in question papers may be that the time will be lost if they read.
I've seen, sometimes you can't understand the question, but if you read the instructions properly, we can accept it and fix it.
It's very important to understand questions.
Rao stressed on patience - he gave him advice to all the testators in a very little word.
That's what I tell my young friends.
Remember the same thing, we have a lot of chances in our country.
Whatever you need is jealousy, self-esteem and capability.
If you have all these qualities, you'll be successful in all tests and attempts.
That's the strength of science and the strength of the scientific mind.
I'm grateful to Rao Saheb that he encouraged the children of the country, the words of strength, determination, meditation, self-sacrifice, concentration and labor.
Hold on, guys, hold on.
If you're in love, you'll be scared.
The bright future is waiting for you to do good.
My Apa Ruchika Dabbs shared his experience of testing.
We all know about Thomas Alva Edison, a discovery of electric balls, and I've read about her in our syllabus.
But today, that power-the light of that balloon is brightening human life, that's why the failing gains of success.
He had no comprehensive education in the mathematics, no special training.
Harry Potter's history is famous all over the world today.
But this wasn't the first time.
How many problems he has to face - how failed.
The test is not just students today, but the entire family, school, teachers.
But students don't have the same situation as parents and teachers.
A team of teachers, parents, even the Scientific students, will be easier to tests if they go with sensitivity.
Mr. Keshab Vaishnav, wrote my app, he complained that parents shouldn't put much pressure on the students to get the number.
We just have to encourage it to be ready.
They're gonna have to worry about it.
Vijay Jindal wrote, don't press the children with their hopes.
Get their courage as far as possible.
Please don't press.
If he's talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Friends, I'm sure about one thing that I want to tell my young friends, especially our present lifestyle has changed a lot from our old generation.
We want to move with science at the same speed.
Friends, I'm saying this because today's national science day.
Every year, on the day of February, we celebrate as "genetic science day".
On February 17, 1928, Sir C.
Raman announced his discovery "Ramon Effect".
He got the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
That's why on the day of February, it turns into "genetic science day".
Jews of science.
Scientific thinking creates a new idea of science and on the other hand it is not possible to create a new impression by excluding science and technology.
"I'm C.
I pray to Raman, and I will request you all to grow interest in science.
Friends, sometimes it takes a long time to get success, and when success is achieved, it changes the vision of seeing the world.
Maybe you didn't have a lot of news because you were busy with the test, but I would like to remind the countrymen of one thing - you probably heard that science had a very important discovery in the world.
Our scientists have marked gravitational waves in their capacity.
I'll introduce all those scientific greetings.
Our scientists will try to take this research forward in the future.
India will also participate in international efforts.
My natives, we've made a very important decision in the past.
There are only two places in the world.
India's third.
I'm thanking all the scientists again.
My beloved countrymen, I'm telling you the number one, you'll hear my word from tomorrow by giving a msid call to this number.
You'll hear your mother tongue.
Missed call number 8190881908, I'm telling you again.
Friends, your test is starting.
I need to test tomorrow.
125 million people will check me.
29 February - It's Lip Yar.
But yes, you must have seen me understand how healthy I am, how confident I am.
I'll be tested tomorrow, Parashu will start you.
If we are all successful, the whole country will be successful.
Thank you very much
This is my last "Mann Ki Baat" ceremony in 2015.
Agami will be "Mann Ki Baat" in 2016.
A few days ago, we have done the Christmas, and now we're getting ready to welcome the new year.
India is an important country.
There are various festivals here.
Sometimes it seems, India is a country where the festival is also associated with the economy.
Festival is the way for the people of the poor class of society to live.
I'm very happy to all the countrymen with Christmas and I'm very happy about the New Year's Financial.
The films can bring you a lot of happiness for everyone.
New joy, new hope, new visions reach a new height.
Whether it is terrorism, world warming, naturally dangerous, human-culture is different from everything.
You know I'm using the technology completely, so I can know a lot.
Many went out to spend the Christmas holidays.
Tourists are focused on all other facilities, but they have attracted a specific vision, where tourists go and stay, we must have special interest in keeping all the tourist places clean.
Our tourist centres will be as clear as India's images will be in the world.
I'm welcomed by Mr. Saoleshvarkar's idea and I'm sending him to the countrymen.
He's done a brilliant job that has been published in the newspaper.
So I think I'll get it to you.
Dileep Singh Malviya, a resident of a small village, stabilised that if someone of the village accumulates the necessary equipment for the construction of the toilet, he would build a toilet without a family.
Assuming that this work is holy, he has built 100 toilets in Bhojpura village so far.
I'm inspiring Dilip Singh Malvia and enjoying it.
Sometimes we can hear about our country.
As a result of all human efforts, our country is moving fast.
125 million people are moving together and taking the country forward.
We have been able to develop a new reform and new business in the era of developing business at international level, giving a bunking opportunity to bring the citizens under the protection of new technology and biography.
Ordinary family members who couldn't reach the bunker's throne, have easily accessed the loan facility through the currency plan.
When each Indian knew that the whole world was attracted to yoga and when all the countries of the world were united through International Yoga Day, we believed that this is our country and great India.
When we have such thoughts, the most important pictures appear in front of our eyes.
Cleanliness is being heard every house.
The participation of the masses is also increasing.
But I believe, through the propaganda of this village, the people's hopes and imagination of the whole country will come to the country.
That's why the biggest advantage is that all government-workers are involved in this project, they will be encouraged and happy to think they've done something that would bring about a great change in the life of the village.
Isn't it necessary to reach this happy farmer, poor, young, woman and everyone
No government works, no government works - no need to reach the information they can get what they can get, so they can't be disintegrated.
They must be informed of their rights.
We must be aware of the right and good messages of the common man to reach a large number of people.
This is also a kind of surveillance work.
I tried a little to do this like me.
I can't do everything alone, but I should do what I say.
A common man can contact me by downloading 'Narendra Modi App' on his mobile phone.
You're also looking forward to this effort.
I want to reach 125 million people, without your help, it's not possible.
Come on, we all come together to encourage the common man's wilderness and the right to gain.
My beloved young friends, from the last 15 August Red Cella, I start up I India, stand up.
Since then, in every government office, it spreads whether India can become a start up copital.
Everything is a new thinking, a new trick is desirable, because the world cannot move without a new introduction.
In every corner of India there are talented youths, they need only chances.
Answering all the state governments, we'll take this project forward.
On 16th January, I'll meet you and discuss you cheaply, I'll be waiting for your advice.
There are millions of people in this country, like me, who are emerging from Swami Vivekananda's ideal.
From 1995 to 12th January, the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda is celebrated as a national youth festival.
This year this festival is going to take place from 12th January to 16th January at Raipur in Chhattisgarh.
Can you give me some advice about this young man
My special request to the young men is to send your advice directly through the Narendra Modi app.
I want to know and understand your mind.
This will reflect in the national youth festival, and I will give my government the right advice and information.
So, my friends, I've been waiting for you to talk about the Youth Festival through "Narendra Modi App".
Ahmadabad, the blind teacher of Gujarat, Dilip Chauhan, celebrated the "Accessible I India Day" in his school.
I've got a very encouraging ride from the students, and they have been implanted to help the physically disabled people in the society.
I think this effort is an important step.
Dilipji, thank you so much.
You're working on it yourself.
You're well aware of their problems and you must have suffered many problems.
When there's a chance to meet such a man in society, I have a lot of ideas.
We show our vision to their problems according to our thoughts.
Some people are victims of accidents.
Some people again become victims of physical disability.
A lot of words are used for all these people's consolidation.
But it always seems that these people are not right to use such words, not honorable.
That's a special significance of words.
This year the Indian government started 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan' .
Since I had to be present in that ceremony, so I was thinking about it.
During this time, I think God gave some inaction to the body or whose two organs don't work properly, we call him an individual, knows it as an individual.
But sometimes when I meet them, I can understand that the man in our sight is incomplete, but God gave him some extra-powner.
These are those people who have one or more organs, who have the power of God, who are not in the body of ordinary humans like us.
I liked this word.
Can we propagate the word 'Dibang' instead of my request to the countrymen
On that day we started 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
Physical and Vertual - I will try to facilitate the people who develop these two types of structures.
Maybe we need many things like school, hospital, government office or bus terminus, slopes or rimps at the railway station, easy parking and lift facilities, braille scripts.
In our country, gas cylinders are used.
The government has brought about some changes.
With the help of 'Jan Dhan' account, based cards etc., the world's largest director Benefit Transfer Scheme is directly accessing the bank account of the beneficiaries.
I'm proud of telling the countrymen that it's got the Greece Book of World Records to launch the largest direct benefits project successfully.
This project, known as ' Palace', has been very successful.
By the end of November, approximately 15 crore L-P-G has been benefitted through the ' Palace' project.
Nowadays, through the MNREGA project, rural man's employment is ensured.
There was a lot of complaints about the money provided by this project.
Now, in most places, this money is moving directly to the workers' bank account.
The students had a lot of problems with the meaning of skillership, and there were many complaints.
This arrangement has also been started for them and it must be moved slowly.
The bank accounts of the beneficiaries in different projects have reached around 40 thousand crores.
According to a general account, about 35 to 40 projects have been included in the "Direct Benefit Transfer".
My beloved countrymen, on 26th January, the General System Day.
Funny, this year, the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Papasaheb Ambedakar, the form of a constitution.
It was decided for two days in the Parliament session to discuss the constitution, it's a good experience.
The Constitution has been supplied equally on the duty.
It's a lot of duty to vote, but why don't you talk about rituals in everyday life
This year, when we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedakar, what cannot be done in the schools, colleges, villages, towns and various social organizations of 'Our primary works', discussions and poetry races on January 26
I have a new idea, before 26th January, you can write your mother tongue or write poems in English or Hindi.
I want to be aware of your thinking.
I can send it to my Mygov portal.
I'm very interested to know about the consciousness of our country's youth.
I want to put a small proposal.
On 26th January, when we will celebrate the general system day, cannot we take the country's citizens and school students to clean and decorate the replications of the great ancestors established in our cities and to maintain the purity of the resolved sector
I'm not talking about the government.
As an ordinary citizen, we are as excited and emotional about the replication of these great men.
For society, cannot we make it our normal practice for the country
On 26th January, let us all be aware of the cleanness of all these figures built in honor of the great ancestors.
For this, ordinary people, citizens must come forward.
My dear countrymen, I'm telling you a lot of joys about the new year's announcement.
Thank you all inner
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Business and employment will start with new enthusiasm.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas must have started.
Festival has a different significance for life.
Sometimes the festival works to remove grief, sometimes creates a new enthusiasm.
But sometimes when there's a concentration in the festival, it's very painful.
The news of natural misery is coming from everywhere in the world.
There are reports of natural misconceptions that have never heard or thought.
I'm sorry and condolences to all this family.
The state government uses all power in rescue and transportation.
The Central Government always works on the shoulders.
At present, a team of Indian government rescuers have gone to Tamil Nadu.
I believe, despite this danger, Tamil Nadu will move faster in the new Udayam, and he will follow the role he has to take the country forward.
When this danger is happening around, the need to resist it is increasing.
Now it's changed.
Everywhere has its own capacity building, that is, generating growth is very important.
Government, intermediate society, public, even all small organisations will have to work in a very scientific way of Capacity building.
I'm glad that this industry has a good news through a table tok exercise and excellent discussions and programmes in the country's circular countries to be held in Delhi.
You can understand the problems of farmers, not just that biotechnology.
It's working to burn the roots of the crop after our nature and generation.
First, there was no idea of the damage that could happen because of this... and we were doing it.
Secondly, there was no training for what other methods could be.
When the impact of these dangers began to fall on the city, people began to move against it.
That's right, you've expressed sorrow.
First of all, we have to give a proper training to the farmers' brothers and sisters, to understand their reality.
The time will be saved by burning the roots of the crop, the work will survive, the field will be prepared for the next crop, but it's not right.
The root of the crop is very valuable.
It's a bio-service.
We burn the food and destroy it.
This isn't the end, if these roots are cut off, it can be a fossil.
To burn this root, the upper layer of agriculture is burning.
The surface of our land is burnt, which leads our fertile land to death.
And that's why we need to play a useful role.
Look at the root of this crop by mixing in the ground, it'll be cured.
If this biological surveillance is used in that land, it can be doubled.
I had a chance to talk to the artists once.
They spoke of a very good experience.
When they used to grow, they had to spend five thousand, sometimes ten or fifteen thousand rupees every hectare to clean the root of the banana.
If you couldn't find a tracker to clean it, the roots would have fallen.
Some farmers then gave these roots six or eight inches of measurement to the ground.
Because there is so much water in the root of that banana, where they are planted, if there is any tree, tree or susta, it doesn't need to give water separately for three months.
The water that is on the root of the banana, hence protects the crop.
The root that had to spend their money before cleaning, is now coming from it.
Our farmer brothers are not less than any scientist.
Dear countrymen, next 3 December will celebrate the world's 'internal responsibilities day'.
I discussed the organ donation in the last "What Watt".
I've also spoken of the helpline of NOTO for organ donation.
On 27th November 'Territorial Organ donation day ' has been developed .
Many specific people of the society, including Chitravinethri Rabina Tandon, are involved in this.
Organ donation can save a very important life.
It can bring immortality in the same way.
When some part of the body is replaced from one body, it gets a new life, that man also gets a new life.
What can be greater than that
NOTOR LOGO, DONERA CD and Mygov.in portal to create a slaughter on this.
Physical and psychologically resistant people have unlimited courage and power.
But if we change our vision, change our minds to them, they can become our life and work.
Even if we're suffering from small problems, we'll be crying.
That's why they are the source of our inspiration.
I'm convinced of their imagination, strength, their fighting with life and the incredible effort to turn the problem into power.
I'd like to talk to the ghosts today.
Kidney, small intestine and some part of the muscle were found in the terrorists.
There was a severe injury to the spinal cord.
The ability to stand on his feet was finished like him, but the jealousy didn't mean the loss.
The terrorist's injury couldn't sustain him.
A innocent man is suffering from this kind of harm, suffering from life-long contacts, but without any disgusting or disgusting, the disgusting absurdity has confronted these dangers.
This is his greatest mentality, he employed his life in the service of society.
Not always in power, but for the last two and a half years, he has been working for children's education.
Socio-socialism has been in the M-A and today as a socialist and aware citizen, as an angel of every participant.
Can't man from every corner of India get inspiration from the ignorant life
I'm gonna remind him of the life of Javed Ahmad on December 3, penance and humanity.
I'm just ignorant in time, but I know that the island of inspiration that burns in every corner of India gives life a new light, finds a new way.
3-December to recall all these inspirational men.
Our country is a big country.
There are many things that men are dependent on the government.
Middle-level, low-middle, poor, oppressed, afflicted, afflicted people have renewed relations with government and governmental arrangements.
We have a network of hope workers all over our country.
They do many social works in India.
There is a lot of anger in the malaria disease.
A hope worker of this village, Yamuna Manising, has ensured that no one in her own village will die in malaria.
Someone in the village get to the house immediately after a tiny fever.
He started treatment on the basis of the primary treatment he was taught.
Each house emphasized the use of pesticides.
Just as you need to sleep and take care of your child, this hope-worker Yamuna Manising has completely dedicated herself to protect the entire village from the mosquitoes and prepared all the villages to prevent malaria disease.
How many kinds of mindsing are there .
There are millions of people around us.
We'll try to see them in their honor.
There's a lot of power in the country.
We've always been a friend of grief.
I'm honoring all hopes and guys through yahuna monising.
The first thing about 'Swachh Bharat', the second is related to 'Adars Games Parliament' and the third is healthy.
I'm asking you to see these e-books.
Not only yourself, but also others.
You might think you'd have something to do with them.
Then you must send me to Mygov Portal.
There are many things that we don't notice, but there is a real power for society.
The right vision is our greatest power.
I'm calling you, come on, you'll also join the nation building.
My beloved countrymen are worried about changing global climate.
World warming, climate change is now the most illuminating and anxious.
The temperature of the world doesn't increase - it must be all concerned and responsible.
The first way to prevent the increase in temperature is the protection of energy.
I once said that the full moon should be bathed in the full moonlight for hours by shutting down the street lights.
The rays of that moon should be felt.
Any friend sent me a sight link to this kind of scene, and there was a chance to see me.
A woman named Nurjahanha in Kanpur, who cannot be seen on TV that she got a lot of studies, did something that maybe nobody thought.
He's been working to give power to the poor by using the sunlight.
He fights with darkness and brightens his name.
People take the lanterns in the evening, and go back to the sunshine in the morning.
About three to four rupees a day, but there's enough light in the house.
This nurzanha recharges these furnaces through this survivor in the factory all day.
Look, the world's largest people are doing a lot of things to change the climate, but a nursing man thinks he can transform all of them, do the same thing.
So, the name of Nurjahan is to light the world.
He's also spreading light.
I'd like to congratulate the recognised Prime Minister that he started a project with a currency bank.
The prime minister's currency plan is 'fund the unfunded'.
Well, the speed I want to go, the speed is still coming.
Most of these help proprietors are hatred races, hatred tribes and other unrestrained tribes who are trying to live in their own feet with respect.
Abhishek himself spoke of his enthusiasm.
There's a lot of news coming to me.
One told me now, there's someone named Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He got a loan of eight and a half million rupees from the bank through the currency project.
And he started the process of safai.
I said during my cleaning expedition, this expedition would be a new industrialist.
And Shailesh Bhosle has shown it to the ocean.
And a good business for his family.
But I want this plan to be more propagated.
All our banks may be more sensitive and help small businessmen.
The country's economy is actually run by these.
Small working people have the real power of the country's economy.
We want to give importance to it.
It's good, but we have to do better.
My beloved countrymen, on October 31, at the birth anniversary of the Sadar Patel, I spoke of a India, the best India.
There are many things that our society always makes sense of awareness.
"International, Gegrium, Bheem" - Internal Vigilance in the Price of Liberty, that is, freedom prize is inner protection.
In order to maintain the country, this inner safety river has to be deserted.
"One India-Old India" - I want to give it the form of a plan.
I've been told that there's a lot of advice.
I've been told that those who take part in it will be given their accessories.
The big rewards have also been announced.
I believe your advice will be very useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter season begins.
This time, it's a good time to eat and drink nutrients.
But I'll tell you, exercise.
At least one hour of family work together, see how careful it's going to be, and how fresh it's all day.
Be good habits in good weather.
Jai Hind
My dear countrymen, bow down to all of you
This is the twelfth festival of "Man Kaata" and it's been over a year to see this.
For the first time in October 3, last year, I was lucky to talk to you about what's going on.
There is a great glory in democracy.
I have a fundamental concern in my life and that's why I have a deep faith in the power of the people.
"What kind of a sword has taught me, what I know, I can tell what we've thought, the power of the people is greater than that."
Our ancestors spoke of reproduction, they are part of God.
I can tell the feeling that I feel from the wind, that our eastern men have great power to think, because I feel it.
I've asked everyone to suggest "What's the matter, but perhaps every time I've been trying to see or understand two-four suggestions.
But millions of people are actively suggesting me.
It's a great power.
And likewise, what's the story of the society's own thinking is a means of expression.
I once talked about selfie with daughter.
And so the whole world was astonished to hear.
But from all over the world, pictures of a lot of self with Daughter have come and the daughter-in-law has glorified it.
And when they made a self with a doughter, they didn't glorify their daughter-in-law, they got a vision in themselves.
And when others are looking at these selfies, every one of them seems to have to abandon their indifference to the daughter-in-law.
From every corner of India, people have sent a lot of such pictures.
The state government or the central government's tourism department cannot even think that there is such a priceless wealth in our country.
Even if we're a little short, we're not gonna be eating.
Today I can tell you with great joy that in the last one year, the sale of fertilizer has almost doubled.
And it's not for any government advertisement.
I didn't even spend millions of rupees.
This was a belief of the people's power, a feeling.
I asked the economically rich people to demonstrate what you have for gas cylinders.
I saw in a TV channel, a widow woman, she's standing on the lines of retiring teachers, gas cylinders.
In the midst of society, the lower middle class families, who are very impossible to quit all of them, have also given them the facility of phenomenon.
Isn't this a silent revolution
As much as the government works with the people, he can work as a better intellectual for the improvement of society.
The people of my country are trying to enforce themselves in the welfare of the country by giving importance to every small thing.
I thought of taking a new experiment in this festival of "What'
Siachen, Kachh or Kamrup, or Kanyakumarika from Kashmir - there is no place where people didn't call.
It's my own joy.
The people of all ages have called.
I heard some phones myself and I loved it.
My entire government will work according to your advice.
Fullly elegant, they gave an elegant advice.
Look at the work, the country's ordinary people take so much precise thoughts, and this is a big wealth for the country.
One or two percent of the phone was probably a serious complaint.
And one thing has come to us, especially a skilled person, especially from the blind people.
One of the reasons for this is because they don't have the luck of watching TV, so they must listen to the radio.
I understand how important the radio is to the blind people.
I've got a new direction from these phones, these phones are very important to make the government more sensitive.
Pawan Acharya gave me a suggestion from Alwar in Rajasthan.
I think everyone should listen to it and people from all over the country should consider it.
Listen to what he wants to say, "My name is Pawan Acharya, I stay in the Alwar of Rajasthan.
"Pavan, my belief, your advice on the air will spread to the corners of India.
My beloved countryman, Ganesh Chathi, had a chance to spend two to three hours with the soldiers of the army.
I have spent time with the water, place and airways, the waters, the grounds and the airscapes, the army, the air force and the Navy's windows.
What wasn't there - the whole history was surviving.
The glorious moment of war, we've heard of all the indomitable courage and sacrifices of our army, through this exhibition, because we didn't get any picture of that time, the videography was not possible.
Haji Peer's fight or the war in the north of the country, the Chamunda's fight or Haji Peer Pass Joy, whatever you see, is a thrilling experience and our army is proud of the soldiers.
This exhibition will last a few more days.
I request you to go around Delhi, see this show with your family and don't hurry like me.
Look at the power of democracy, a little boy is ordering the Prime Minister, but the little boy has forgotten to call his name immediately.
We should naturalize cleanliness and take appropriate arrangements for it.
I have to hear a lot of things, that Modhiji tells a lot of big things about cleanliness, but what's going on till the end
And, on the other hand, we're talking about the Parliament on one side and the two children of the country on one side... what can be the greatest luck of the country
This movement of cleanliness, the environment of hate that has been created, the awareness of cleanliness, will also force this government to work to create a clean India.
Local self-determined institutions - it will have to work in this regard in Panchayat, Nagar Panchayat, Pur Nigam, Mahanagar Paur Nagam or State or Centre.
We have to take this movement in trouble, and when we see 2019, when we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary, we will go on the right way to successful Mahatma Gandhi's dream.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi says
Mahatma Gandhi once said, freedom and cleanness - if I had to like one of these two, I would first like cleanness, freedom.
Gandhiji's cleanness was more important than freedom.
Come on, everyone follows Mahatma Gandhi and we don't even take steps to fulfill his wishes.
He wanted to know about Dain Dawlaji's birth centuries.
My beloved countrymen, the vision of the life of the great men is the source of our inspiration.
Any day, in historical vision, somebody is associated with the name of a great ancestor.
In the coming days, we'll remind these great men, we'll visit their lives every house, and we'll try to learn something from it.
I would like to mention the two-thirds of October, that day on the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, I told you last year, you have different fashion clothes, there are different types of fabrics, and many other things, but there should be a specific place of fertilizer goods.
And that's why we'll surely put our homes in this island, we wear clothes.
And look, last time the sale of pottery was doubled.
How poor people have benefited.
The work that the government cannot spend through a million rupees advertising is possible for you.
That's the gene power... and that's why I request you to do this once more.
Dear countrymen, one thing has enjoyed me.
I'm sorry, you're also funny.
I went to Kolkata in May, some of the family members of Subhas Chandra Basu came to meet me.
His nephew Chandra Basu arranged all the arrangements.
There was a chance to spend some time in the search table with the people of Subashbabu's family.
You can imagine how pleasant it is for me.
Maybe they're all coming together to the Prime Minister's house for the first time.
But the most joyful thing for me is that the prime minister's survival doesn't have a chance to do so, that I'll get the chance in October.
More than 50 members of Subashbabu's family, who live in different countries, are all coming.
He sent me a message, and I heard his voice, and I thought he was going to be a leader or a leader.
He said, "My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to ask the Prime Minister to take care of the youth to register the vote, so that the youth's participation will increase in the next day, and in the future, the youth can make an important contribution to the formation and conduct of the government.
Thank you. "Thank you for describing the name in the vote list and describing the vote.
The fate of every vote in the democracy, and this awareness is growing gradually.
Even a few years ago, we have seen that the election commission was just conducting the election process, but in the last few years it has a big change.
Today our choice commission is not just a director, a assistant worker, voter-friendly, and all their thoughts are the center of the project, the voter.
But just do the selection commission, it's not going to work.
I hope the country's newborns don't write their names in the vote list, and they must write it and vote.
I speak openly on the election day, "For the first vote, then drink."
It's a holy talent, everyone must do it.
Yesterday, I've come back to Kashi.
I've joined a lot of people, a lot of events, a lot of people have met, but I want to tell you about two boys.
But his interest in pharmaceutical studies in such a young age surprised me.
I think he's studying a lot, doing internet surfing, reflecting the new use of science.
He was talking about how to get rid of the rail accident, what kind of technology is needed, how to reduce energy costs, how the experience of the robot comes.
That's how you met a small sandwich called Sonampatel.
Sonam's age is nine years.
I am surprised, the whole Geetha's voice, but the most important thing is that when I asked her, she was embarrassing in English, explaining the world, analyzing in Hindi.
I told her to ask her father, she's doing this since the age of five.
I asked him to study, did he not read only Geetha and do anything else
The gentleman said, "Now Sonamjid has a break in the evening, and if history comes, he's in the morning."
They're astonished about the girl, they're the only one in the family.
I really amazed.
Sometimes kids are very happy to have celebrity, nothing happened in Sonam.
I think God gave it a special power.
"Sandeepji, what else would you do with me
I have to take a lot of time to do this once a month.
Sometimes we have to wait for half an hour of friends of the window, waiting for me for an hour.
Would it be a year's event.
You know how much Subashbabu used to talk about the radio
He started broadcasting his radio from Germany, and through radio he told the people of India about the movement of freedom.
With a weekly news bulletin, he reported the Azad Hind radio.
This radio was broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengal, Marathi, Punjabi, Puducherry, Urdu.
Listening to you, I think I'll consider your proposal, and that's why I'm gonna open my thoughts, which leads to you through the window.
I say, but it's yours, and that's my fondness.
Once again, I've got a chance to come to you in the event of 'Man Ki Baat'.
People from far southern India are now at the Vanama Festival and the whole country has celebrated the Holy Residency Festival.
The Indian government has started a new plan with social security for ordinary people.
I'm glad that many people have come to this plan for a short time.
I'm just requesting a little, as if our sisters were given a safer plan in the festive festivity.
I have a lot of information, which shows that eleven million families have been involved since the plan begins.
I've been told that about half of this facility was found by the mother and sister.
Today, when I'm talking to you, he was taken a year before the 'Generation Plan'.
There was a lot of questions that didn't happen in sixty years, would it be so short
Because of this, the youngsters of the country have worked.
You'll be glad to know that in this one year, one lakh 31 thousand financial literacy camps have been opened to collect banking sectors, economics and low-range people.
The poor man can get paid from that bank.
I once again thank everyone connected with it and I request the poor brothers and sisters who opened accounts on the bank, you don't want to break this connection with the bank.
This bank is yours, you don't leave it anymore.
I've got it to you, now you're responsible for holding it.
We've got to keep all of us in the bank.
I have full faith, you keep it.
A few days ago, the foolish events of Gujarat struck the whole country.
And it is simple that if anything happens in Gandhi and Sardar Patel's kingdom, then the whole country is sorry.
But in a very short time, the citizens of Gujarat have taken care of my brothers and sisters.
They played an active role in preventing the situation from being ineffective and the Gujarat has taken the path of peace again.
This way of peace, unity and fraternity is the right way and we have to walk on the shoulders.
Prosperity solves all our problems.
I had a chance to meet and listen to the rebels of Sufi Dhara recently.
I'm really telling you, this experience of listening to their greatness has come to me with a sense of music.
Speak to those pundits, talk to them, i.e., the calm glory that is in Sufi stream, it's like a musical fountain.
I'm very happy.
Perhaps it's most necessary to bring this true form of Islam to the heat world.
I believe this love and generosity of the Sufi tradition will reach far and wide, so that the entire humanity and Islam are useful.
I tell others, we need to understand Sufi's idea if we are in different creeds.
Next day I'm going to have another chance and I think I'm lucky to get this invitation.
Pundits of Buddhism from many countries of the world are coming to India in Buddhism, they will discuss many things related to humanity all over the world.
These wizards who invited me there, I am happy.
India's first Prime Minister Pundit Nehru went to Buddha.
This minute to see all this miracle of the world is going to be a joyful moment to me.
My beloved farmer brothers and sisters, I want to talk to you more than once more.
I've already spoken about this in the "Man Ki Baat" ceremony.
You've heard him in the Parliament, in the public meeting or in the 'What' ceremony.
I'm telling you every time, the government's minds are open on the issue of land acquisition law.
I'm willing to take any suggestions for the farmers... so I'm telling you many times.
But today, I want to tell the brothers and sisters that the proposal to revive the land acquisition law came from the state.
But I saw a lot of misunderstandings about this, the farmers were scared.
My brothers and sisters, our farmers will never be misunderstood and the fear will never go.
I don't want anyone to misunderstand or scare anyone.
I need every claim of the country, but the claim of farmers is the most important.
I'm okay, let's let this execute.
I mean, the position that was before my government was formed has come back.
But one thing was incomplete.
There were 13 things that were about to finish in one year, and that's why we brought them in half-a-half years, but the matter was incomplete because of this discourse.
The poor and the farmers' welfare of the village are our guides.
So I said on August 15 that not only the agriculture department, but also the farmers and farmers.
We're trying to change this decision faster.
My farmer brothers and sisters, there's no reason now, there's no reason for doubt.
If someone tries to scare you, don't be afraid.
I have to talk more.
Two days ago, the 1965 war was over fifty years.
Whenever you talk about the war in 1965, it's very simple to remember the red-wheeler.
It's very simple to recall the "Jai Jawan Jai Kishan".
In order to maintain the glory and respect of the triangular flag of India, the people who have been martyred are very simple to recall their self-sacrifice.
I know my commendation to all those associated with India's victory of 65, and I know the namaskar of the martyrs.
Such historical events incorporate our everybody's inspiration.
I'm very happy that India is doing a lot of good work in science.
Our scientists are actually doing a good job.
I've seen young scientists talking to gentlemen, I've seen new dreams in their eyes.
In the last year's 'What' program, I said that our students should move further to science.
After discussions with scientists, I felt that there was a lot of chance in this area.
I like it in just fifteen days, the government has started working on it in a short time.
It's been instructed, and it's possible to get an interview for small jobs.
Iding has come from many countries of the world.
In order to reduce health, especially mother and child's death, the world's 24 countries agreed to the Call to Action Plan of India.
This project is the first time in another country outside the US.
It is true that even today we have about fifty thousand mothers every year and almost ten million children die in the pregnancy or in the next time.
It's too terrible and scared.
Though there has been a lot of improvement in this, India's admiration at the international level, yet this number is not less interesting.
Like we got rid of the polio, we got rid of death due to mother and child's tetanus.
The whole world has recognized it.
But we still have to save our mother and the infants.
Brothers and sisters, the news of dengue is getting a lot today.
It's very dangerous, but it's easy to get rid of dengue.
It's directly connected to the clean India I speak.
We've seen advertising on the TV with dengue, advertisements are published in the news paper, but we don't mind there.
To clean the small things in the house, there is a law to keep the water clean.
There's a lot of people learning about this but we're not paying attention to it.
Sometimes I think we're in a clean house, a very good arrangement, but I don't think I'm inviting Dengue to the water that is accumulated in my house.
I'll ask everyone not to let death come so easily.
Life is very worthy.
It's not right...
Around 514 centres across the country have access to dengue tests.
It's very important to keep the death tested in time.
All of you have a bit of help in this.
Pleasure must be very important.
There will be a lot of festivals in the country from Rakshabandhan to Deepawali.
You'll see, it'll be your nature to pursue this method of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, I want to hear a happy news today.
I often say that now we don't have the privilege of giving life to our country, but we have the privilege of saving our country.
Two young men in my country, two brothers of Nasik in Maharashtra - Dr.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan has a strong desire to serve the tribals of the country.
These two brothers have glorified India.
There is a cycle race in America, "Res Access America", which is very difficult.
I'm not very good to these two brothers, thanks and greetings.
I'm very happy that these two brothers, "Tim India Vision for Tribals", worked for the evolution of tribals... through this campaign, they succeeded.
Look how everybody is trying to take the country forward.
Heart swells proudly when he hears all this.
Sometimes, we're injustice to the new generation.
The old generation thinks that the new generation doesn't know anything, this meditation has been going on for centuries.
I've joined a number of young men who bore Sundai on Cycle their lives.
Some people say, I'll celebrate 'Cycle Day' a week.
It is also very useful for the protection of my body and environment.
And I like to think of the young man I am.
Now in many cities of our country, there's a lot of people who encouraged bikes.
It's a good attempt to protect the environment and improve health.
Today, when two young Americans of my country have made national flags, I love to mention the way the youth of India are going.
I want to congratulate the Maharashtra government today.
In the land of Endo Mill in Mumbai, the work of making the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedakar was stuck for a long time.
With this, we bought Dr. Dabasaheb's home at London's 10, King Henry Road.
The Maharashtra government will build a memorial of Babasaheb Ambedakar.
Indians, who roam around the world, this place of London will be an inspiration for them.
I'm convinced of both the efforts of the Maharashtra government to honor Dadasaheb Ambedkar, I'm proud of them, I'm greeting them.
It's good to start the rain this year.
Our farmers will be helpful in bad surgeons of brothers and sisters.
And I'm glad to remember a happy news.
There is a lot of defect in our country.
I want poor people's pulses, and I need a little oil to make rice for food.
I am glad that this time the yield of pulses has increased by about 50 percent, and oilseeds have increased by about 33 percent.
My dear countrymen, on July 26, are marked as Kargil victory day in our country's history.
As close to the farmers' land, our country's survivors.
Cargil's war is not only in the borders of the country, every city in India, every village was together with this war.
All the mothers and sisters who were fighting the enemies in the boy or brother Kargil.
That's because of their self-sacrifice, India can speak up to the head of the world.
I'm supposed to enhance the direct part of the people in the democracy, to enable every man to work for the betterment of the country, and it is my joy that almost two people have seen the Mygov portal.
Why cannot you preserve responsibilities while booking train tickets through RCTC's Website
Now this thing is very small, but no government has ever thought of it or has not been judged.
But this opinion of brother Akhilash Bajpayee has been considered to be very important and this arrangement has been started for our responsibilities brothers and sisters today.
The luggage that is being built today, the tag line is being planned, the policy is being prepared... in the Mygov portal, there is a positive opinion about all this.
There's a new clean wind in the governance system.
I feel a new consciousness.
There's a lot of advice on what I should say on August 15 at the Iding Mygov portal.
From Chennai, Suchina Raghavachari has sent a lot of information.
You can send me to the Mygov portal, you can write letters to the window, write letters to the Prime Minister's Office.
Look, I know it's a good thing to get advice from Janta Janardhana on 15th August.
I believe you must send good advice.
Just two days ago, I've seen an accident in Delhi, a scooter driver has been dispersing for 10 minutes after the accident.
He didn't get any help
And when you look at the statistics, your mind gets distressed.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
For accidents, deaths occur every 4 minutes for road accidents.
And the most important thing is that one-third of these dead men is the 15-25-year-old Naozwan, a death can destroy the entire family.
They'll do what the administration should do, but I'll request Mother-Bad, your child's two-hoilers or the Four-hoiler, all efforts should be made under the family.
Sometimes I see, it's written behind Auto Rixer, "Don't come home soon." (Look back home soon)
And that's why I'm telling you that the government has taken a lot of new jobs - whether it is educational for road safety or carpenter for road safety, administrative arrangements, or the immediate medical treatment of the injured persons after the accident, we're bringing the road transport and safety bill.
I'm thinking of taking some important steps in the next day to use the 'General Road Security Policy' and the Road Safety Action Plan.
I have taken another project, from Gurgao, Jaipur and Badodara to Mumbai, Rangao, Mondia, all the highways of the country.
I'm supposed to have a cashless medical facility for the first fifty hours after the accident.
I arranged for a toll-free number 1033 to report the accident all over the country, but all this is the next step of the accident.
Sometimes I say the workers are working.
I'd like to tell you what I liked in the past few days.
His own interest, his own art, his ability to be associated with his work, showed victory.
Tomorrow, there's a lot of discussions about Vijay Viswal's picture, like exchange.
One more thing I remember is that the entire group of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh started work in the entire district that touched my mind and I liked their work.
And they took charge in the Rescue Festival so that all the brothers give their sisters the toilet and no mother-daughter in the entire district have to go to the open space.
I'm gonna know what I want to share with you.
There is a small village named Kesala in Rajnand village of Chhattisgarh .
The people of this village have been trying to prepare the toilet for the past few months.
Now no man in this village has to go to the open space.
After the completion of the excretion work, the entire village people celebrated a big festival in this achievement.
How the society is changing the value of life, how the social demands of the masses are changing, how the citizens of the country are moving forward, this is the best example of what has come to me.
Gauhati's prediction about north-east India Deca wrote to me, although it was very active in the work of the people of North-East India.
They're writing a lot, it's a good thing.
I enjoy telling them today, there is a separate specimen for north-east India.
When Atal was the Prime Minister of Bihari Vajpayee, the Development of North-East Regiion means a separate specimen called "D-O-N-E-R" (Donor).
After the formation of our government, our Donor Department takes an important decision that the development of north-east India is not possible by sitting in Delhi.
Everyone decides that a group of Indian government officials will go to North-Eastern India states like Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal, Tripura, Assam, Sikkim and camp for seven days.
I'm calling the Accott East Policy to move from Delhi to the east.
We're happy with the success of Merce Mission, my dear countrymen.
In the past, India's PSLV C28 successfully executed five graces of the United Kingdom.
All these news comes for a moment, it goes back.
We don't usually remember these.
But sometimes think, today when we talk to the young generation and want to know what they want to happen in the future, one-and-a-half students from a hundred people, who say, "I want to be scientific."
The Indian government's Human Resource Development Ministry has launched a National Meditation Research Expedition in New Revenue.
Now you have to go to another village if you want to charge the mobile.
All the facilities in the city should be available in the village.
That's why we started "Gram Joti Program" on the day-to-day meditation.
But we have to work more for the poor.
We'll finish it.
I've started it, I'll finish it, and today I'm supposed to talk about different things.
On the one hand, we are in our country as the month of the August-September festival.
There are many festivals too.
I enjoy you all.
Send your advice on August 15.
Your opinion will bring me a lot.
Thank you so much
When I told you, I didn't think I'd be able to fit like that.
Hundreds of thousands of people posted a photo in Toyter, Festival, Instagram.
I saw one after another, how many specialities in India - architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, sea-what
I think the Indian government couldn't think of tourism, that's what you did.
And I liked some pictures so much that I've once again visited myself.
I think we couldn't know the places that are hidden in our country if we didn't post the Belum Cave in Andhra Pradesh.
But on June 21, the scene we saw was very strange, I think there was no country where the sun rays reached, where the sun was not welcomed by yoga exercise.
I can tell you, the sun doesn't exist in the world of yoga.
The way the people of the world respected and self-esteemed Yoga, it is a matter of pride to every Indian.
I'm too happy.
French people have a symbol of the Sin river and the Eiffel Tower's glory, and they have also given equal respect to the place they love to join.
People in New York's Times Square have joined.
When Australia's Sydney is talking about, the Opera House's picture is in front of the eye.
Australian citizens have arranged for the Opera House, showing Yoga equal respect for the Opera House.
Whether North America or Silicon Valley or Milan's Doomo Cathedral, Yogavas has glorified us everywhere.
On June 21, when Secretary General of the Nation, Shriman Ban Ki-moon, joined the chief of the Nation Party, I am very happy.
Similarly, the members of the peacekeeping forces of the Nation have performed very beautiful yoga.
Our troops gathered on the white ice sheet in the Indian Seachen, wherever the boaters were our boats, they participated in the program of Yoga.
In Delhi, Yogavas has replaced the Guineabook of World Record.
It seemed a new question from everywhere in the world - a new joy - a new excitement - a new solitude.
A few days ago, when I visited a small kid in Vietnam on a tour, the phone was so beautiful that he was praised in the world.
Wives, children and children, villages and villages, advanced or developing countries have joined themselves with yoga.
Yoga really enclosed the whole world in a formula.
I don't know how mad and wizards will look at this incident... but one thing I feel, every Indian can proud that is interested in knowing the whole world.
Everybody's interested in knowing India.
India wants to know the valuable, traditional, heritage- world.
The responsibility of all of us is not to get this statutory, but to disintegrate all of us.
If we are proud of our heritage, we can do this.
Sometimes we know something so much that we don't see any harm in it, like our family values, we don't know our family worth is an important thing to the world's people.
Why don't we know our family tradition and valuable worldmen
I'm surprising to believe that I must be surprising to believe that there are many best things that the ancestors have given us, calling for world rights.
With the success, joy and satisfaction of the "International Yoga Day", it brought a new responsibility.
It's our duty to give a good job to the world.
I believe you can create a database about where you can learn yoga, where you find yoga-speakers.
I've seen the events of the past day in another way, the government is working, we have seen what is the result of the government's very active, sustainable objective.
When we've been desperate around us, as we heard a year ago, nothing will happen.
There's a department of the government. Ayush.
Nobody gave any importance to this
But on the day of 'Yoga Day', this small department, which has been in one corner, has been surely organized on the whole world.
If the goal is stable, the smaller department can work well, it's his own sample.
Just a few days ago, the world saw how our people protected people from Yemen.
In a few hours, Indians went to Nepal to help.
If the government is active, all the bunkers have come forward to open 'Jan Dhan Account' and in a few days, millions of patriots are connected to the bank.
On August 15, I asked to make a toilet in all the schools in Lalkilla, and I told you we had to complete this work in the next 15th August.
It was a very bravery job to invoke the work that couldn't be done in sixty years.
That is, the government, ordinary people, government employees - wants to work for all countries.
Last month I started three public safety projects from Kolkata.
In such a short time, more than 10 million people have been involved in the John Defence Project, though we have to take this project further.
It's coming in the month of August.
Cannot we facilitate our country's mothers and sisters' survivor project to build a strong-style mass movement before this festival together
On the occasion of maintenance, it could be a big gift for brother's sister.
When I come to the "Mann Ki Baat" ceremony, many of them send me the advice.
Many people have advised me to tell me something about the rain.
Yogesh Dandekar from Nagpur, Harshvardhan Mahasay from Mysore, Pravin Nadakarni Mahasayya, Divanshnu Gupta Mahasay - Everyone told me "What's the rain"
This season enjoys heart.
People of any age want to enjoy the first rain water.
You're also enjoying hot tea with hot packs, fried and sown in this rain.
Just as the sun's rays give us life, the rain adds our strength.
The drop of water is also very valuable.
As a citizen, as a man of society, we have to create a habit of saving water.
The water of the village will be in the village, the city's water in the city - this should be our imagination.
"Ren Water Harvesting" is not a new thing - it's been going on for centuries.
Check dam, watershed development, small ponds, small rocks of fields, whatever it is, we need to save the drop of water.
This port on the sea, so the rain water was collected in the house for sweet water.
Even at that time, there was so much effort to save rain water.
We can do that too.
And I'm giving a suggestion that can be achieved from my witness and successful experience.
It's a whole village carving.
When you plant trees, put an old clay on the tree and fill it with water.
I'm gonna get water once or twice a month.
Look at this tree grows very fast and is very strong.
I'll tell the farmers, you don't wanna roam around your field and plant trees.
And we know that the disease spreads more through water in the rainy season.
Bacteria are active for the increase in moisture in the weather.
So cleanliness is very important this time.
You should drink pure drinking water right now.
It's okay, as much as we'll be careful, the disease will be as far away.
I want water, rain, but I want to get rid of the disease.
My countrymen, we've started three new projects, especially for the city's people.
There are five hundred small towns in our country.
We have to take this effort forward.
And I want to live in this house, electricity, drinking water, toilets and children's school to study.
When India finishes 75 years of its independence in 2022, we want every countrymen to give their homes.
I'm connected to all of you with the social media.
There's a lot of new ideas, suggestions from you. I'm gonna have a good idea about the government's work.
But when this government project becomes its own project in a person, society or village, its power increases.
In the past, Sriman Sunil Jaglan Mahasay, a Panchayat chief of Bibipur village of Haryana, started a very funny effort.
And this creates an environment that every father wants to put a cellphone with his daughter and put her in the social media.
The number of sands in Syria is very low compared to boys.
There are about 100 districts in the country where there is such a situation that is very terrible.
Harryna's situation is worse.
And so I'm asking you, you take part in the selfie with your daughters.
With this, write a tagline to make the project stronger, write a beautiful tagline, which can be in any language, English, Hindi, your mother tongue or any other language.
The tag line that will be inspiring, I'll retire your selfie with your daughter.
We all can give this project the form of a mass movement in a similar way.
Show us our country.
I'm telling you from my experience, you take this effort forward.
Make it part of your life.
And one thing... "Incredible India"... wherever you don't go, you must send pictures.
Our country and all such worlds will know how much we have in our country.
I think the pictures you're sending are very low in handicrafts.
You can also post the handicrafts of your area in Incredible India.
You've got a lot of things in your city - poor men have made many things.
And we have a simple way to reach.
My beloved countrymen, that's all.
I'll talk to you again in the next "What Watt".
Some people sometimes feel like I'll announce the government's big project, but not that.
I'm working day and night.
I'm talking to you slightly sweetly through this ceremony, Bass.
What's the mind, June 2019
You imagine what happened in the middle.
When I spoke to my mind, I used to say, words, my voices, my voices, but your words were men, yours, yours.
But this Sunday has waited a lot for me.
Well, there's a chance for the end.
In a household environment, "What's the matter of a small mind, which can change in society, life, because of its circumcision, a new indignation, and thus making the soul of a new India ballistic.
With you, I had a feeling of this kind of spiritual journey.
Many have asked me why I went to Kedarnath in that busy vote.
You have the right and I can understand this confusion with you.
I think I'll tell you about the situation of that time.
But today, I think, if I talk about that, I'm gonna change the pattern of a bitch.
The vote is busy, the guess of Har-jeet and the Poling left when I got out.
Most of the people found political meaning in it.
But it was for me to join yourself.
I can tell you I'm gonna join me.
I don't know when I can tell you, but I'm sure you have the right over me.
The way people've expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I'm always feeling your point of view.
Sometimes some of your words make my thoughts sharp.
People are talking about the challenges to stand in front of the country and society, and they talk about his solution immediately.
I've noticed, there's a description of the problem in the letter, but there's a specialty with him that some solution, some suggestions, some visions are obvious or indirectly given.
If anybody wrote about cleanliness, he'd welcome this effort to pursue his foolishness and reveal his foolishness.
When someone talks about the environment, he's talking about his own effort as soon as he feels afflicted with pollution.
He also refers to the way he's been taking, and the imagination he's supposed to reflect on the environment, to prevent pollution.
That means how to solve the problem with the whole society, a glimpse of what I can tell you.
"What kind of a spectacle to the country and society"
It tells us that there is no lack of inner power, capacity and survival among the countrymen.
Just need that power and sympathy to go on the right path, give him a chance, to use it.
What does the "A-O" say, in the progress of the country, the entire 130 million countrymen will have to add strength and activity.
I'm gonna tell you one more thing, "What's the matter with me, many phones come, many messages come, but the amount of complaints is very low, somebody wants something to get for himself, I don't think it's happened once in the last five years.
You can imagine, someone is writing letters to the Prime Minister of the country, but don't you want anything for yourself
This is an example of millions of people in the country.
Today my mind is full of happiness.
And that's why I'm simply pronouncing that I'll come back to you a few months later.
Let's pave this imagination. Let's take the significance of the Watt.
The movement against him was not limited to political circles, political leader's prison.
I don't feel a hungry burning when we eat at night.
Likewise, the significance of the right of the corpse in everyday life is felt only when that right is lost.
And this is not because the Indian constitution took some steps to genocide.
The Constitution and the law are required to drive society.
And that's why the country dedicated to a whole world, not only for itself but for the protection of democracy.
Recently, the greatest, the greatest election process of democracy was completed in our country, where the rich were obliged to make the future decisions of the country to be convinced of this campaign.
When anything is close to us, we can't achieve her importance
More than 61 million people voted in the 2019 election, Sixty One Crore
The number may be simple, but if you look around the world, I'll say, without a chin, more than any country's population has voted in India.
As much as the 2019 election voted, the number is more than the total population of the United States, almost double.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of Europe.
These are the greatness and widespread culmination of our democracy.
The election of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is still the world's largest monarchy.
You can imagine what huge plans and human resources are required to finish this process.
This election was possible for a lot of teachers, officials and workers' hard work.
On the one hand, nearly three million security personnel of the paramilitary forces have enforced their responsibility, while on the other hand, twenty million police personnel of different states have worked uncertainly.
This time, as a result of their hard work, voting is more than last election.
About 10 million police stations in this election process, more than 40 million EVM machines, more than 17 million VVPAT machines are arranged.
To make sure that nobody is interested in using his vote.
Polling station is made for only one female voter at one place in Arunachal Pradesh.
You'll be surprised to know that the commission officials have to travel for two days to reach that place.
That's the real honor of democracy.
The highest vote center in the world is also in India.
This vote center is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there's another information that we can be proud of.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women voted with enthusiasm like men.
The number of male and female voters in this election is almost equal.
There are 78 women in the Parliament, which is a record.
I'm greetings to each of the selected commissions and the voting process, and I'm calling for the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you'll listen to me many times, not a Bouquet, my heart.
I was supposed to give books instead of breaking the flowers for the habitation of the habitats
Another story, which dresses my heart deeply, is 'Eidgah'.
A child's sympathy about the story... to his grandfather's sacred love.
Four-five years old when Hamid takes a chit from the fair to his grandmother, it really seems to be a love for human mind, absurdity.
We think the last line of this story is a strange truth of learning life. "Shishu Hamid played the role of the old man, the old man, the girl turned into me.
That's a very heartbreaking story "Puss Ki Night".
This story shows a strange picture of a poor farmer's life.
Even after their crops are destroyed, farmers are funny, because they don't have to sleep in the winter season.
Although these stories are almost centuries old, it still feels the same.
After reading the story, I feel another kind of feeling.
When it's about reading books, I read the letters of the library of Kerala in a message.
You'll be surprised to know that the library is in a village in the deep desert of Idukki.
P., a primary school teacher.
V. Chinnathampi worked strangely for this library.
There was a time when the books were brought here by pressing the back on the bed.
Today, this library is close to the tribal children, everybody sees a new direction.
Gujrat, 'Vangche Gujarat' campaign, a successful industry.
Every age, millions of people, took part in the process of reading.
Today's digital world, at the time of the Gogler guy, I'll ask you to get out for a while, even in my Daily Routine, books are given a little space.
You really enjoy the books and don't read, surely write to the Narendramodiapp, so that all the curtains of the "What Watt" know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am very glad that the people of my country are thinking about all things that are not just present, a big challenge for the future.
I read your comments on NarendramodiApp and MyGov, and I noticed a lot of things about the water problem.
Belgavir Pawan Gaurai, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, besides Yash Sharma, Shahav Altaf and many others have written about water related problems.
Water has a great impact on our culture.
Rakved's App: It's said about the water, 'Apo Histh Mao Bhoov: Stha or Urge, yoh, yoh, yoh, yoh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Due to lack of water, many parts of the country are getting damaged every year.
You marvellously know that only 8 percent of rain water is saved in our country in a year.
Only 8 percent.
But now it's time to solve this problem.
I believe we'll find solutions to this contact with the potential, collaboration and imagination of 130 crores of countrymen through public participation, like other problems.
Keeping the importance of water concentrated, new water power maps have been built in the country.
This will lead to a quick decision of all the water related.
A few days ago, I tried to create something different.
I wrote letters to all the village heads of the country.
I wrote to the villagers to save water, save water, save every drop of rain... and they called the village council, sitting with the villagers.
I'm glad they showed full enthusiasm in the e-vision and on the 22nd of the A-Mass, millions of people worked in thousands of panchayats.
People in the village have been able to collect one drop of water.
Today I want to listen to a village council in the 'What' ceremony.
Listen to what message was given to all of us by the Panchayat chief of Lupung village of Katkamshandi block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand. When the Prime Minister wrote our letter to save water, we did not believe that the Prime Minister wrote our letter.
The people there once again agreed to play their active role for water conservation.
I don't like all the village heads, all the Panchayat chiefs, for their activity.
There are many such panchayats all over the country who have been working for water conservation.
What I told you, it's possible for everyone to get a very important consequence.
But everyone's goal is to save water, save water.
The work is going on in Punjab's water supply tube.
It's getting rid of the problem of water accumulation.
Due to the construction of a waterfall in Thimaipalli of Telengana, the lives of the people of the village are changing.
There has been a major change in the construction of small ponds built in the fields of poets of Rajasthan .
I was talking about a public effort at Vellore in Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women were in one place to save Nagandi again.
I was reading about all the women of Gadhwal who are working very beautifully to keep the rain water together.
Today, I'm asking the countrymen three through the 'What' ceremony.
Just as my first request was given to the country's cleansing as a provocative mobilization, let's start a summon for water conservation.
We all envisage to save every drop of water, I believe water is a prasad found from Parmeshwar, water as a surrounding.
To save one drop of water, let's start an awareness campaign.
Whether it is a movie or a game, media friends, people associated with social organisation, people associated with cultural organisations, artists of discussion, everybody leads this movement through their own method.
Awake up the society, connect everybody and bind the pocket.
You see, we'll see changes in front of our eyes.
Come on, we make a list of methods related to water conservation and implant humans to water conservation.
You can shook your content using 'Hashtag Janshakti4jalshakti'.
My dear countrymen, I thank you and all the people in the world for one more thing.
Just as on June 21, once again, with the activity of the Yoga Day, three or four generations of each family filled with enthusiasm celebrated the Yoga Day together.
The significance of the Holistic Health Care has increased.
If any yoga lover welcomes the sun at every corner of the world, his entire journey ends with sunset.
The presidents of different countries of the world, Prime Ministers, well-known personalities, ordinary people have shown me in a tour how they celebrated the Yoga Day in their own country.
That day, the world looked like a big family full of happiness.
We all know that there is a need for a healthy society, a healthy and sensitive man.
That's why the publicity of yoga is an integral part of social service.
In 2019, the Prime Minister's Awards announced a unique contribution to the expansion and improvement of yoga, which must be thankful to me.
This award has been given to the organizations of the world who have played a serious role in the spread and spread of yoga.
Like, "Japan Yoga Niketan" can be said to have made Yoga very popular in Japan.
"Japan Yoga Niketan" in many institutions and training courses.
And where can the Indians remain behind the subject with joy
Yoga school in Bihar's Munger, which has been honored for the last few decades.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Munich also honored the 'Life Mission' and 'Lokulish Yoga University'.
The immortal instruments of yoga and those who gave a message of yoga at home, honoring them, these two things have been separated from the Yoga Day.
My dear countrymen, our journey today began to pave new ideas, new feelings, new imagination and new energy, I waited for your fascinating opinion.
You can add yourself to your thoughts, I have important points, "What's the wind"
Stay with me your blessing.
You are my inspiration, my strength.
Come on, we all sit together and fulfil all the jobs of life to listen to the "Mann Ki Baat" ceremony.
I'll talk to you again in the next month.
Thanks to all of you, Namaskar.
What's the mind, February 2019
I don't mind going to start the vaat.
Ten days ago, Bharatmata lost her bravery.
To face this challenge in front of the country, we all have to forget patterns, communalism, regionalism and all others, so that we can take stronger, stronger and fruitful steps than ever before.
Our armed forces are introducing immense courage.
You've seen what steps have been taken within 100 hours of the terrorist.
The soldiers took the signal of how the terrorists and their alcoholics could be destroyed.
After the virgin soldiers were martyred, there was an inspirational message of their people through the media, which woke up the inspiration of immense courage, enthusiasm and strength among the people of the entire country.
In Bhagalpur of Bihar, the father of Shahid Ratan Tagore, Ramniranjanji, inspired all of us to introduce a strong sympathy with indignation during this sadness.
He said he would send his other son to fight the enemies of the country and be present in the battlefield if necessary.
The whole country knows the immense courage of Shahid Prasanna Sahu's Pitni Minaji of Jagat Singhpur in Orissa.
He enjoined his only son to join the CRPF.
When Shahid Vijay Soren's dead body covered with national flag reaches the Gulf of Jharkhand, his younger son says he will join the army.
This strong sympathy with the enlightenment of this innocent child reveals the imagination of young children in India today.
My beloved countrymen, the longstanding freedom of our people, who were waiting for the War Memorial, is now coming to an end.
It's very simple to have a lot of questions about the countrymen.
Odupi in 'Narendra Modi App', Sri Omkar Shettyji National Wire Memorial of Karnataka has expressed his happiness.
I was stunned and distressed that there was no national wire memorial in India.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country, Morarjivai, was born on February 229.
You all know that the special day comes once in 4 years.
In a simple, peaceful personality, Balian, Morarjivai was one of the most loyal leaders of this country.
In this independent India, the record of the most budget in Parliament is named after Morarji Bhai Deshai.
At that time, Morarji gave India the right leadership, while the country's democracy was in a narrow state.
The Moraziwai country defended this democracy, embracing itself in the movement against the necessary situation.
And for this, he had to pay a lot of money.
The government of that day arrested him and snatched him to prison.
But in 1977, when the Janta voted for the party, he was our Prime Minister.
His prime minister is proposed to revise the 44th constitution.
This is why the incident is very important because 42th revision is proposed for the necessary situation where there were some more proposals to ruin the power of the Supreme Court and that our monetary values would be ruined and they would not be sent back.
Like the 44th reconciliation proposition, the Parliament and the Legislative Assembly are given the opportunity to reveal the news of the work in the newspaper.
Besides this, some powers of the Superimcort are maintained in this revision proposition that the citizen's fundamental rights are not to be supplied by the constitutional 20th and 21th of the Constitution.
Today, once more, I'm paying my tribute to this great leader.
My beloved countrymen, like every year, had a lot of joy in the minds of a man with a prize.
I want to tell you something like this today.
It's just about Gujarat's Abdul Ghafu's Khatijiji, who worked surprisingly to revive some of the historical diseases.
He did a great job to bring this rare art to the new generation.
"Tree of Life" made by Abdul Gafur, I felicitated former US President Barack Obama.
Among the priests of the prizes, everybody knows the Saddam of Marathwada as "Gomatar Sevak".
The way he gave all his life to Gomata's service, so he's unique.
Madurai Chinna Pillai, the specific man who tried to strengthen and selfishly destroy the harmless and exploited people through the 'Kalanjiyam movement' in Tamil Nadu.
He has been training all the people in the world even at the age of one hundred, and has made 1500 yoga teachers so far.
Famous as Lady Tarzan of Jharkhand, he did a bold job to combat the tree-producer Mafia and designers, not only saved 50 hectares of jungles, but sent ten thousand women together to protect the trees and wildlife.
Today, as a result of this work of yamunaji, people of the village make 18 at the time of every child's birth and plant 10 trees at every girl's wedding.
The way she worked for the development of Dibang women herself, for example, Birl, she gave herself the reciprocity of making the blind children self-reliant by creating an institution called "Christian Sevakunj".
The real thing is that he also worked for the use of artificial education with farming, my dear countrymen, maybe this is the first time that 12 of the farmers who have been awarded this year.
Normally, very few people connected to the agricultural sector and the farmers who are directly involved in the list of 'Padmashree' proprietors.
And this is the replacement of India's life-threatening picture.
My dear countrymen, I'm gonna tell you all about feeling a heartbreak with you, I've achieved it for the last few days.
Today I want to meet the people of the country's Ayushman India plan with the beneficiaries of the PM-JYA and the PM John Agreement.
Brothers and sisters, in the last five months, nearly twelve million poor families took the opportunity to plan.
I understand how big this has changed in poor man's life.
If you know any poor man who can't be treated in a sense, tell them about this plan.
This plan has been initiated for the benefits of the poor people.
My beloved brothers are going to start testing in school.
Several educational councils all over the country will start preparing for a twentieth class board test.
I enjoy the testators, their admirers and teachers.
A few days back in Delhi ' Preservation Pe Church ' this program was organized in Town Format .
All students, their teachers, parents, YouTube can see the recording of this program, I'm glad to all the real tests, warriors and analysts.
My beloved countrymen, India will talk and it doesn't matter.
Perhaps we don't have a hint in our country that day there is no festival or parable with us, because we have a thousand years old heritage.
And in a few days, the Mahashivaratri is coming and this time the Shivaratri falls on Monday, and on Monday and Shivaratri falls together, our mind feels very sacred and is filled with devotion.
I have to conclude that I've been very impressed with the power of this divinity.
My dear countrymen, I have a unique experience to connect all of you through the "Mann Ki Baat" program.
I'll face millions of families every month through the radio.
Many times you read letters, talking to you, or listening to a lot of things sent to your phones, I think you've made me one of your families.
This is a very happy feeling of me.
Friends' choice is the biggest festival of democracy.
For the next two months, we'll be busy with the choice.
What's the mind, January 2019
Mankind's jealousy, shelter, education and sensitivity of spiritual sensitivity have been survivors forever.
In the Siddganga-Mathoni-made Pashu, the artificial.
I'm the only one who's intuitive.
But today I'm gonna talk about something.

All this is possible for 130 million people of the country.
My beloved countrymen, we lost some excellent countrymen in December.
Dr. Jaya Chandran died in Chennai on December 19.
Narsamma was a helpful woman in the womb.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in every area.
In the beginning of this year, he was honored with Padmasri.
Dr. Jaya Chandran and Sulagitti have a lot of emotional personalities, who have their own life for the better of the society.
When I discuss the health career, I want to mention the social efforts of the doctors in Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some of my party officials inform me that some young doctors in the city are being treated free of cost.
Now hundreds of poor people are benefiting from this camp every month.
Unsuccessfully, the encouragement of these physicians to serve is really encouraging.
Today I can tell you with pride, because of our joint effort, the 'Swachh Bharat Mission' has become a successful campaign.
Some people told me that a few days ago, more than three million people are connected to the cleaning campaign in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
In this great purity, the citizenship, the self-sacrifice organization, the students of the school-college, the people of Jabalpur, participate with enthusiasm.
Here I can know about Dr. Jaya Chandran.
Whenever it's time, I try to go to the website of the Better India Dot.
I'm glad there's a lot of websites today that introduce us to the life of inspirational people.
Through ' Sanskrit Bharati Dot in ' you can easily learn the language of Sanskrit by sitting in the house .
I believe that many people will know about these heroes to change society.
Negativiti is very easy to spread, but around us, there is a lot of good work in our society and it is possible that 130 million Indians join.
Every society has a different importance of sports.
Whenever there is a game, the audience also have a swimming transmission.
I want to tell you about Hanya Nissar, a girl from Kashmir, she won golden championship in Caret in Korea.
Twenty-twenty-year-old Hanya lives in Kashmir's contempt.

Royal is very happy and blessed for Honour.
Another daughter, sixty-six Razni, has a lot of discussions in the media.

When Rajini intends to learn boxing to his father, he tried his best to encourage him, to succeed his dream.
The rosary boxing practices started with an old glass because his family's economic condition wasn't good.
Despite all resistance, Rajini doesn't lose courage and keeps on teaching boxing.
He also wins a medal in Serbia.
I enjoyed Rajini and blessed his parents, Jesus Christian and Usharani, to be close to Rajini and to give him encouragement.
This month, the twenty-year-old Bedangi Kulkarni sycle has achieved the glory of being the fastest Asian.

Resistance never stops.
When we hear other examples of this, we also get new inspiration every moment of life.
My beloved countrymen, many festivals with enthusiasm and joy in January, such as Lohdi, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttaranam, Magh Bihu, Maghhi etc.
All these festivals will be seen all over India, the color of traditional dance, the irony will be burnt somewhere, the colorful bells will fly in the sky, and you will sit somewhere.
There'll be a sports activity somewhere, and there'll be a festival to sweeten each other with sweets.
Even though the name of all these festivals is different, the purpose of the festival is to be held, these festivals are somehow related to agriculture and livelihood.
During this time the sun rises and the sun goes into the marble rash.
Since then, the day starts to grow slowly and the winter season starts.
On this occasion, our Annadata farmer's brothers and sisters are very happy
One India, the best of the unity among the varieties is in the grand festival of this feeling.
We can see how neglectful these festivals are associated with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not seen separately, there is a group of people and groups.
Another beautiful example of our immunity with nature is the Festival Calendar.
These calendars also have details of the planets and satellites with festivals throughout the year.
These traditional calendars show how ancient our relationship with natural and astronomical events.
This moon-surya calendar based on the speed of the moon and the sun is determined to celebrate festivals and festivals.
It depends on who follows a calendar.
In many places, I'll be on the planet's location, the day of the festival is fixed.
All these festivals, such as marching, cheti-chand, gadi, are celebrated according to the moon calendar, like Tamil Puthandu and Vishnu, Vaishakh, Vaishali, Paila Vaishakh, Vihu etc. are celebrated according to the sun calendar.
Many of us have a special purpose to protect the rivers and water.
The rivers and the reservoirs are connected to sunset.
Even in Makar Sankranti, millions of people take bath in the holy rivers.
Our festivals also teach social values.
On the one hand, as they have a mythological significance, on the other hand, every festival offers education and inspiration to encompass each other in a very easier life.
I'll enjoy you all in the year 2019, and wish you'll enjoy all these festivals.
You must share the photographs of this festival with everyone so that everyone can see the beauty of India's specificity and Indian culture.
My beloved countrymen, there are many things in our culture that we can proudly enhance and enhance the world's head... that is the same is the Kumbh Mela.
You'll be listening to a lot about the Kumbh.
Even in many films, this fair has been replaced with a variety of variety and greatness, and it is true.
People from all over the world come to participate in the Kumbh.
In this Kumbhmella, the faith and faith of Johnzoy.
There are millions of people from the country and abroad together.
The tradition of Kumbh is enlightened and enlightened by our great cultural heritage.
Saint-Mahatmas have already started reaching for the Kumbh fair.
Last year, the UNESCO Kumbh Mela was listed in the Intensible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, the ambassador of many countries has seen the preparations for Kumbh.
There was a national flag hoisting of many countries.
In the Kumbh fair to be held at Prayagraj, there is a possibility of more than one and a half people coming to the country.
Especially for the youth society, it can be a very big "larning experience".
I went to Prayagraj a few days ago.
Prayagraj's man is very excited about the Kumbh.
This time there is a lot of emphasis on cleaning in the well.
The symbol of human faith was closed in the fortress for thousands of years, because the pilgrims could not see it even if they wanted it.
Now the entrance of the Akshay Butt has been opened for everyone.
My request to you, when you go to the Kumbh, you must share different features and pictures in the social media so that more numbers of people are impressed to go to the Kumbh.
This Kumbh of spirituality may be the great Kumbh of Indian sight.
This Kumbh of faith may be a great Kumbh of patriotism and national sympathy.
My beloved countrymen, on 26th January, on the occasion of the day of Common Territory, the countrymen are very embarrassed, and on that day we recall the great men who gave us the Constitution.
This year, we're following a half-third birth livelihood.
For us, fortunately, the President of South Africa, Shri Serial Ramaphosa, is coming to India as the chief guest of the day of the general system.
There's a bondage between the ancestral father and South Africa.
South Africa is the place where Mohn became the glory.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started the first Satyagraha and stood against genuine adultery.
He established the Finnics and Talstey farm, from where the sound of peace and princess all over the world.
He's got the strength and inspiration to live in prison all the years since he was full of salvation
Mandela said, "Mahatma was an integral part of our history because here she used herself in the way of truth.
There is a widespread discussion about what steps are needed to further strengthen the security of the country and the country.
In this conference, I announced to launch the Sardar Patel Award for national unity, this award will be given to those who have contributed somehow to national unity.
Sardar Patel dedicated his life to the unity of the country.
He has worked forever to keep India's integrity untouched.
According to him, the country's diversity is definite.
I want to pay tribute to him through this award of unity to show respect to this idea of Sardar Patel.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Guru Govind Singh on 13th January.
Guru Govind Singh is born in Patan.
Most of his life was North India, and he gave up his last breath at Nanded in Maharashtra.
Reproductive place, workplace, north India and the last time of life in Nanded.
To say one thing, he's blessed all over India.
According to Guru Govind Singh, it is the biggest service to remove human sufferings.
This glory was full of gallantry, glory, sacrifice and religion.
His unusual knowledge was in weapons and science.
He was on one side, like a penetration, on the other side, a gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Farsi, Hindi, Urdu, in different languages.
I'm punishing Sri Guru Govind Singhji once more.
My beloved countrymen, there are some good things in the country that don't exist.
Several events are organized all over the country in the year of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary.
Better to build a safe and healthy diet.
As part of the "Eat Right I India" campaign, "Swast Bharat Yatra" is being organized across the country.
This expedition will take place on 27th January.
When India is clean, healthy, India will be prosperous.
First of all, nutritious diet for good health.
Whether it is personal life or national life or social life, the source of unprecedented progress.
Come on, let's move in front of the nutritious inspiration, indignation, sympathy, nutritious simplicity, nutritious elevation, change yourself, change the country.
What is ' Vaata ' November 2019 .
The 50th festival of that journey of vaata is completed today.
It's said Golden Jubilee Episode's golden episode.
Most of the letters and phones that have come here are in this 50th edition.
Through the 'My Gov' app, Delhi's Angukumar, Kamalkumar, Patna will develop from the same way, Manika Jain of Delhi, Manika Jain from West Bengal, Musicians from Nagpur have sent almost one question.
This question is very simple.
In today's era when people almost forgot the radio, why did Moody bring the radio back
Now the shopkeeper said, listen to this radio.
I heard in the radio, there's talk about breaking the bomb.
The shopkeeper told us that Prime Minister Atalbihari Bajpayeeji had heard the bomb breaking, the historical significance of the nuclear bomb test, that day he told them in the radio.
Looking at the shopkeeper's gentleman's dancing, I was thinking this area, the snow-ridden hilly area, the shopkeeper's radio in the middle of the jungle all day.
I'm thinking about the radio communication rich and its far-reaching impact.
And then, when I am the Prime Minister, it's normal to help the most powerful connectivity.
Since May of the year of May, when I began to pursue the responsibility of the chief servant, I remember that the unity of our country, our glory, history, glory, specificity, cultural diversity, human works, their men, emotions, excuse, penance and penance must be spread to all the people of the country.
Every month, I've come to 50th Apisode, telling a few lakhs of letters, listening to the phone calls, knowing how many apes came together and simultaneously, talking to myself a little joke.
The result of that meeting is very encouraging.
The survey shows that the curtains are listening to what vaat, seventy percent of them have heard every episode of "Man Ki Vaat".
Most of the people think that the vaata has increased the emotional thinking among the people of the world.
Well, there's a lot of cultivation through the vaata.
"Has Tax India Puzitive" has discussed a lot about this.
It's a good change that men are going too far to live in society.
Moddy will come and go but our country will be temporarily, our culture will be ineffective.
130 million Indians will always survive these small caravans.
The new inspiration filled with enthusiasm will lead the country to a higher peak.
I read letters and feel such a feeling in them and they work in mind.
I've got two things myself and I'm shouting with them and I'm gonna share with you all.
But who knows when these things go home.
Sometimes any government will have so much power that the project like "self with Daughter" means "the daughter of yours" will start from a small village of Haryana, not only in the entire country, but in the whole world.
People from every class of society, even the celebrity, are also associated with this point, and the thinking of society has been taken into a modern balance, so that the modern generation grows.
Sometimes I've been funny about the wind, but I've always lost 130 million countrymen.
Their mind is my mind.
"What's the matter but not the government - it's the matter of society.
There are many aspects of social life, in which politics is just one side.
If politics becomes a fundamental thing, it cannot be a reflection of a healthy social system.
Sometimes political events or political people become so important that the other genius or other immense powers of society are ignored.
For the bright future of nations like India, it is our sympathy for all of us to take care of the talents of human beings and other things of society that have a better place.
I think the greatest credit for the 50th festival of 'Mann Baat' is that you're not asking the Prime Minister, as if you're asking one of your closest partners.
There's also a toll free number - 7800, calling there, men record their message in their chest.
I'm trying to read as much as possible letters and comments before the "What Wait".
I've heard a lot of calls.
This time, as much as the Apisod of the Watt, I'm going to be very careful about the information and ideas sent to you while traveling in different places.
That letter isn't just a paper piece for me.
And apart from this, I lived for almost 40-45 years and I went to most of the districts of the country and I spent a lot of time in every district of the country.
And this is why when I read a letter, I can easily connect myself to that place.
Then I'm some information, such as the village, the name of the person - sort of information.
Truely, "What's the voice, the voice is mine, but for example, emotion and life are my countrymen, I want to thank all the contributors.
There are millions of people whom I haven't been able to take the name so far, but they're not desperate to send their letters, their comments.
I'm sure your message will come to me many times more than ever before and will make "What Watt" more entertaining, effective and useful.
It's also attempted that all the letters that are not included in the "What' program, that's all the letters and suggestions as well as the participant.
I'd like to thank all the propaganda channels, television, other TV channels, social media friends.
In their hard work, "Man Ki Watt" is going to reach most people.
In this way, they're going to be merged for thirty minutes.
I would like to congratulate them for their talents and skins, thank you.
I'm asking everyone to listen to this event in their official language.
I'll thank you for all those friends of the media, who are regularly propagating the "What' program in their channels.
Any political person is not satisfied with the media, thinks he's very less covered, or he's a negative coverage, but the media has published a lot of things in the 'What' program.
Without your help, this journey of 'Man Ki Baat' would have been incomplete.
"Nidhi-ji, thank you so much for your phone call.
Normally I say I have no secret.
That's what I'm doing in every family.
In a simple language, I'm trying to make myself like those young men, putting myself in that situation and synthesizing with their opinion, trying to make a wave long match.
We have some old bags in our life, if they don't come out, it's easy to explain to anyone.
I don't understand any of the two, how one has confessed to other than his thoughts.
The youngsters of the present are good, they never do what they do not believe, and when they believe in something, they leave everything behind them.
Often people discuss the communication gap between family elders and Teenagers.
But most families have discussions on limitations with Tennesser.
Most of us talk about studies or habits, life style, don't do this, do it.
It's also a matter of concern that the words are gradually decreasing in the family without making any noise.
If you take revenge for desperation and don't discuss it, it's important through any news.
I've been incomplete with the youth through a variety of works and social media.
I've always learned from the youth's thinking.
The young men have different ideas.
The youngsters are instinctive, innovative and strange.
Somebody says young students want to work together.
I say, what's wrong with it
They're part of Multi-Tasking, so they do it.
If we look around, there'll be a social industry, "Start-up", sports, or any other area, big changes in society.
The young men who have shown courage to ask and dream.
If we can give up the ability to decide on the young people and if they openly express their thoughts, they can bring about the nation's creative changes, and they're doing it.
My beloved countrymen, from Gurugram, Binita ji wrote on the website, "What do you want to say about the Saturday day of the next 26th November."
His statement is a special day, because we're going to enter the seventh year of India's constitution.
Binitaji, thank you so much for your advice
Yes, tomorrow's Convention Day.
Those who have published our constitution remind them of those great personalities.
Our constitution was accepted on November 26, 1949.
It took two years 11 months 17 days for the constitutional council to complete the historical work of the constitution.
Imagine that within three years, these great talented people gave us such a comprehensive and vast constitution.
They've built the Constitution in a strange way, a unique example of time management and productivity.
We're also supposed to finish our jobs in record time.
The 'Convention Assembly' was a congression of the great talents of the nation, which was responsible for providing a constitution to every country, in which the privilege of the people of India becomes capable.
The main features of our constitution are that "the right and duties here, that is, Rights and Duties are detailed.
In the citizens of the country, these two things will be reconciled to the country.
If we respect each other's rights, your rights will also be protected by you... and in the same way if we serve our duty to the Constitution, our right to defend our rights will also be fulfilled.
I remember, in the year 2010, in Gujarat, in 60 years of Indian democracy, we left the constitution on the back of the elephant.
It was a memorable attempt to make the youngsters aware of the constitution and enjoy the various streams of their constitution.
As a monarchy country in 2020, we are going to finish 70 years and 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Come on, we all give more status to the value of our constitution and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
Dad Saheb is compassionate.
On December 6, his grand anniversary.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I pronounce Dadasaheb, who has given millions of Indians the right to save them.
The democracy was under the contemplation of Dadasaheb and he said that the democratic ideals of India are not outside.
The definition of democracy or parliament was nothing new for India.
In the constitutional council, he made an emotional order that we have achieved this freedom after many wars and that's why we have to defend it with the last point of blood.
He added that no matter how different Indians grew up in different environments, the country's welfare would always be preferred.
Once more, I'm devoted to Dadsaheb.
My dear countrymen, we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Sri Gurunak Dev on 23st November two days ago, that is, in 2019, his 550th exhibition.
Sri Gurunak Dev has always wished human welfare.
He has always guided society to truth, action, service, compassion and comfort.
Our country will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Sri Gurunak Dev next year, and its expansion will spread all over the world.
All the States and Union Territories have been requested to celebrate this day with smoke.
This way, the 550th festival of Sri Gurunak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
With this, all the holy places connected with Sri Gurunanak Dev will be run by a train.
When I was discussing this recently, I remember Lakpat Saheb Gurudwara.
During the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, this gurudwara was widely damaged, but the way the local people revived the gurdwaras of the kingdom.
The Indian government has taken an important decision to create Kartarpur corridor, so that our country's travellers can easily visit the holy land of Sri Gurunak Dev in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
My beloved countrymen, after the 50th festival, we'll meet again.
We're gonna be on this trip.
The more I get your courage, the more this journey will be deeper and comfortable.
Sometimes the question arises in the minds of man, what did I get from 'What vaat'
I want to say today, "What's the feedback that comes to my heart, most of the people say that when they sit in the family and listen to the 'What' program, they feel as if the family members are talking to them.
When I realized that I made you, one of you, one of you and you made me big, I'm glad I'll come back to your family as a member.
Your sister-in-law, I'm sick.
Come on, we'll take this trip further.
What's the mind, October 2018
I want you all to take part in this race of great numbers of unity.
About six and a half months before Independence, the famous international paper 'Team magazine' was published on 27 January, 1947 in the printing of the surdar Patel.
Tim served a map of India in his Lid Storey.
There were more than 550 countries.
Though the British interests in India were fascinated, they wanted to keep this country away.
The Time magazine wrote, "The dangers like dissolution, hungsa, food-snatch, preciousness and power politics are spreading to India, but if anyone has the power to consolidate the country with unity, then he's surdar Vallabhvai Patel.
Gandhiji told Sardar Patel, the problems of the states are so dangerous that you can only solve it.
Currently, the Serdar Patel really solved the problems one by one, and showed the unlikely thing to keep the whole country in one way.
He connected all the national kingdoms with India, whether it is Junagarh or Hyderabad, Trivankur or Rajasthan's territories... the only person in the tricks of understanding and warfare, we can see India today.
This nation, tied to unity, seeing our mother in India, really reminds us of the renovation of our surdar Vallabhvai Patel.
This 31 October, the birth anniversary of the Sadar Patel is even more important because on this day we'll take the statute of unity to the nation as his honourable devotion.
Situated on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat this statue is double the height of America 's Statue of Liberty ' .
This will be the world's highest genetic architecture.
Every Indian can proudly tell that the world's highest idol is now in the Indian territory.
I believe this specific architecture will be marked as a favourite flame all over the country.
This is the day the Indian Army's soldiers descended on the ground of Kashmir and protected the valley from the innovatives.
These historical events are also related to the Sardar Vallabhvai Patel.
I was reading an old interview with India's great soldier, Sam Manikesh.
In this interview, Field Marshall Manekshe told me when he was Colonel.
At that time, a military expedition started in Kashmir in 1947.
Field Marshall Manekshe said that at that time, how was the surdar Vallabhbhai Patel distressed in a seat to delay sending troops to Kashmir, looking at the surdar Patel in the sittop and looking at Maneksh, he said that there will be no delay in the army's campaign in Kashmir and the problem will be solved as soon as possible.
On October 31, our former Prime Minister Shrimati Indira Gandhi's excuse day.
I'm telling Indiraji reverence.
Does my favorite countrymen have people who don't like sports
Spirit, stamina, Strength, Skill, etc. are very important in the game.
The criterion of any player's success is all these qualities.
On the other hand, it's four times important for the formation of the nation.
If all these qualities are among the youth of a country, they will not only improve the country's economics, science and technology, but also in the field of sports.
Recently, I had two meetings to remember.
First, Asian Para Games, in Jakarta, got the opportunity to join Para Athlete, who participated in 2018.
In this game, India has created a novel record in a total of 72 medals and has increased the honor of the country.
These games have won more than three more medals in Mix Event, 13.
You must have remembered that this time the Asian Games was very good for India's performance.
Look, in the last few minutes, I've used the best, most beautiful words so far.
He is eight years old.
He spent the next eight years in an orphanage.

Sixteen-year-old young woman Tabavi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.

Sometimes there was a situation that they didn't mean to buy food.
Such a situation has also lost to Tabavi Devi's indignation.

There are many more carvings, the source of their life inspiration.
Every young player, their encouragement is the new I India.

More than 12 million spectators in different stadiums in the country saw the football and encouraged young players.
This time India has lucked the World Cup hockey organization in Bhubaneswar.
Hockey WorldCop will run from 28 November to 16 December.
Whatever Indians don't love, they have a different place to hawk in their minds.
The Hockey game is the golden history of India.
India has won gold many times in the past, once won the world.
Some of the world's hockey players have also gifted.
It's incomplete if India's name is discussed in any place in the world.
Hawk's magic majesty is known all over the world.
Besides, Balbinder Singh Signier, Lesley Cladias, Mahmad Saheed, Dhanraj Pillai from Udham Singh, has brightened the name of India in the world.
Even today, the Hockey players of Team India are working hard to achieve success to the new generation.
It's a great experience for the sportsman to sit in the stadium.
While watching the game in Bhubaneswar, the Indian team will encourage all nations.
There is a heritage of prosperity and cultural productivity and the Orissa people have to keep in mind the worrisome character.
It's a nice opportunity for the sportsmen to ride Orissa.
I also knew the rest of the world.
My beloved countrymen, many people are coming forward in social work, they are doing volunteering, they are becoming very impatient to the people of all over the country.
A young man has also learned a wheelchair basketball to play a basketball in Wheelchair.
This is the mentality, this is the mission mode executive.
There's no Indian who can't be proud of hearing this, sure.
"I'm not, we'll inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I saw your proposals with 'Man Ki Baat', I got an opportunity to see a very thrilling comment from Mr. Manish Mahapatra of Puducherry.
He wrote in Mygov, "What do you please talk about what the tribes of India and their rituals are the best examples of being united with traditional nature."
We need to learn something from them, what they do for the Sustainable Development.
Manishji, I'm grateful to you for keeping such a thing in front of the envoys of "What's Watt".
This is something I inspire to look back to our glorious past and culture... today the world, especially the western countries, discuss the environmental protection and find their balance life, that is, a balanced lifestyle.
Today our India is not far from this problem, but we have to defend ourselves to solve it.
Our tribal brothers and sisters are like trees and flowers and goddesses.
The Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh, especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the trees like Bat, Arjun with faith.
In the desert like Rajasthan, Vishnoi has shown us the way for environmental protection.
They're ready to leave their lives for the protection of trees, but they're not ready to confess a tree.
Arunachal's mushmis claim their relationship with the tiger.
They mean him as their brother-in-law.
In Nagaland, the tiger is also seen as a forest guard.
The people of the Verli community of Maharashtra meant the tiger as guests, and they have a symbol of the prosperity of the tiger.
The Kola community of Madhya Pradesh means that their fate is connected to the tiger... if the tiger doesn't get food, the villagers will have to be inclined.
Middle India's Gond tribe stops fishing at some places in the breeding season.
They mean these places as fish shelters... and this tradition runs a lot of fresh fish to them.
The tribal community produces their homes from the natural maternal, which is also environmental when it becomes strong.
In south India there is a small giant sect in the perpetual region of the Nilgiri mountain, which is based on tradition, with their slums from the local level.
My beloved brothers, it is true that the tribal community believes in being very peaceful and mixed together, but when someone harms their natural resources, they don't scare to fight for their rights.
It's not surprising that our first freedom struggles were people of the tribal community.
Who can forget Lord Virsa Munda who fought hard against the British regime to protect her territory.
There are many examples of the tribal community, who can save us from the nature that teaches us, and our country owes to the tribal community for the forests that survive around us.
Come on, we ask for respect for them.
My beloved countrymen, we talk about those people and their problems in the 'Mann Ki Baat' program, who are doing something pretty good for the society.
All those things, which seem to be normal, but really its far-reaching effects are to change our mindset and determine the goals of society.
A few days ago I was reading about Punjab's gentleman Sing-ji.
A common and labour farmer was the marriage of Gurubachan Singh-ji's son.
Before this marriage, Gurubachan Singh-ji told the parents of Conn that they would do this marriage innocence.
He suddenly said, he has a condition.
Nowadays, if you say a shirt in marriage, it's usually like he's going to talk about a big pinnacle, so that Connor's family will fall in trouble.
But you'll be surprised to know that brother Gurubachan Singh was a simple white farmer, he told Conn's father what he said is the real strength of the society.
Great sing-ji said, "You should talk to me, don't wear the remnants that will remain after you have cropped in the field of farming."
You can imagine how big social power is hidden.
It seems very surprising, but it appears to be his personality, and we have seen that there are many families in our society that have changed personal matters to society's best.
Mr. Gurbachan Singh-ji's family has established a vision.
I've read about another village in Punjab, Kallar Majra, which is near the river.
The killers were headed because the people there didn't burn the rice and mix it with the ground, and the Technology made it necessary.
Brother Grandpa, I'll enjoy Sing-ji.
Callar Majra and the people of all those places, who are trying their best to free the environment from pollution.
You're all going on the right way to the healthy lifestyle of Indian inheritance.
Just as drops of water create seas, such small sensitivity and ethical work always helps to create an elementary environment.
This year, for India, there is a special significance of the day on November 11, because the first World War ended a hundred years ago on November 11.
That's a hundred years after that terrible destruction and death.
The first World War I for India is an important event.
We didn't have any connection with this war.
Despite this, the soldiers of our country fought with Bahaduri in this war, played a bigger role and sacrificed the highest.
Indian soldiers showed the world that they were not behind anyone in the battlefield.
Our soldiers showed their glory in a difficult situation.
The only purpose of this was to restore peace.
In the first World War I saw the world's destruction.
It is estimated that nearly one crore soldiers and so many civilians lost their lives.
After this horrific war, we realized the importance of world peace.
In the last 100 years, the definition of peace has changed.
My dear countrymen, there is a specialty in the north-east of the country.
The natural beauty of this place and the people here are very talented.
Our North-East is now known for the best and great work.
This is a place where organic farming has improved very much.
A few days ago, Sustainable Food System won the Sikkim once honorable Future Police God forward to encourage long-term food systems.
This award is given by the FAO Arthur Food and Agricultural Organization.

Not only this, our Sikkim has won this award by losing the sole figure of the sixty-five country.
That's why I thank the people of Sikkim.
