Manki Bath October 2019
(CHUCKLES) My dear natives, you're greeted.
Today is the sacred day of Deepavali.
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The distinction of this festival is that not only the Indian society but the governments of many countries, the citizens there and the social organizations there celebrate with the happiness and happiness of Diwali.
So there's a small world in India.
Friends , tourism in the world is its own attraction for Festival Tourism .
In our country, every region has its own variety of festivals, and people from other countries are particularly interested in it.
That is why Indians living outside the country are very important in promoting Festival tourism in India .
My dear people, we decided on the last Manki Bath to do something different to this Deepavali.
I said, "Come on, let us all together, this time Deepavali will celebrate India's women's strength and its achievements, i.e., honor India's Lakshmi."
Look, the stories that inspired the social media immediately appeared.
Written in the cordial Rayamo Namo App of Warangal, my mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took charge of five children.
Today we have five brothers in a good job.
Rashmiji, your mother's calls me.
Geetika Swami, who is acting in the film, says she's the son of the bus conductor, the son of Asam Rifles, Major Kushboo Kanwar, who led the elite department, Bharat Laxmi.
Kavita Tewari has her daughter Bharat Laxmi and her own strength.
They're proud of their daughter being a good painter.
The girl got a good rank in the CAT exam.
While Megha Jain has been writing for years about a 92-year-old man who has provided free drinking water to Gwalior railway station.
Meghazi, this Bharat Laxmi's humility and humility is very inspiring.
Many such stories have been shared by people.
You must read, enjoy the instruction and share your closer things...
The hypocrisy of that poem gives us a sense that the words of the poem are now written in the seventeenth century.
How important words, how great is the hypocrisy, how terrible is this poem in Kannada language
The mountainous king Himavan was the Jasulidan of the Pinnida Pearmagoondon Himavaman , Pinnida Bhrigu , the prince of Pinnida , because of his daughter's parlor, Bhrigumuni became famous because of his daughter Laxmi, the king of the people.
Our daughters are our pride.
Because of the glory of these women, our society has a strong personality, a glorious future.
Dear people, on 12 November, 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
I have never forgotten what I went to the Gurudwaras of Vancour and Tehran.
I understand many things related to Sri Guru Nanak Dev, who can share with you, but it requires many episodes of Manki Bath.
He stood firm against many famines like Thoucaima.
Mr. Guru Nanak Devji sent his message to the world far away.
He was the most traveling man at that time.
Everybody's heart was swimming with his foolishness and humility as a common man who went to many places.
The great religious journeys done by Guru Nanak Devji are called as Dassi .
With the message of harmony and equality, he went to the north, south, east, west and west, and saw the people and saints and sages everywhere.
The well-known Santh Shankardeva of Assam is also considered to be inspiration from him.
Pilgrimages like Rajgir, Gaya, associated with Buddhism.
Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji has gone to Sri Lanka in South India .
On the journey of Beedar in Karnataka Guru Nanak Devji had seen a solution to the problem of water there .
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Sahab in Beedar which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devi .
During a similar journey Guru Nanakji travelled in Kashmir and the environment in north India .
This has established a strong relationship between the Sikh followers and the Kashmiris.
Guru Nanak Devji went to Tibet and the people of that place considered him a Guru .
He's a priest in Uzbekistan.
He has gone to Islamic states, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He shook the minds of millions of people, according to his suggestions, with their gratitude, even today.
A few days ago, negative representatives from around 85 countries went to Amritsar via Delhi.
There they visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar, which was declared to be the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
There these neo-democratic representatives got the opportunity to know about the history of the Sikh tradition and culture along with the Golden Temple tour.
After that, many Ambassadors shared the pictures in the social media and wrote a lot of proud experiences.
My beloved brothers, I'm sure you'll remember all of October 31.
At that time, this country is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the salt man of India, in the midst of unity.
Sardar Patel was surprising to gather the people, as well as fighting with those who have deliberate opinions.
The Sardar soldier saw and learned everything a little bit deeper.
He was a personality of humility in the right sense.
With this, the organization was enlightened.
He gained nobleness in making plans and regulating warfare.
When Sardar reads and hears the activity of Saddhar Saheb, he knows how deep his preparation was.
In 1921 thousands of people from all over the country came to participate in the congress conference in Ahmedabad .
He was responsible for doing all the arrangements related to the Mahasam festival.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
Nobody's got a problem with water.
He was associated with the treasurers, asked to make Khadi Bags.
The farmer made a bag and sold it to the representatives.
Because the shoes were kept in these bags, the representatives didn't need to fear that the shoes would be stolen.
On the other hand, there was a lot of money in Khadi's sale.
Our country will be grateful to Sardar Patel for the part of the ruling elite.
He did the great thing to ensure moral rights, without the possibility of a variety of differences in the Jati-Matistry.
Friends, we know, as the first home minister of India, the Sardar was a madman soldier, a genuine attempt to unite the nations and determined the act of reducing history.
It was the specialty of Sardar Vallabhbhai to look at everything.
When India was divided in 1947, our neighbor's eyes fell on the Lakshadweep, and they shipped the flag of that country.
When it was noticed, Sardar Patel, without finishing some time, immediately started a drastic action.
He instructed the brothers of Arkot Ramaswamy and Arkot Laxmanaswamy and Thiruvananthapuram to bring them from Thiruvananthapuram to Lakshadweep and raise the three-wheeler flag in Lakshadweep first.
There was a three-wheeler flag, and the neighbour's dream of capturing Lakshadweep was struck.
After this incident, Sardar Patel instructed the brothers to ensure that all help is available for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today Lakshadweep plays an important part in India's development.
This is a very attractive tourist place .
I hope you will visit these beautiful islands and seashores.
Dear people, on 31 October, 2018, I dedicated the Statue of United States to the world in memory of Sardar Patel.
It's the highest statue in the world.
To double the statute of Liberty in America.
The highest statue in the world is proud of all Indians.
All Indians grow proudly.
You'll be happy to see more than 26 lakh tourists coming to the Statue of Unit within a year.
The people there have started the farming of the Dragon Fruit, and I believe that it will change the main source of livelihood of the people there.
Friends, for the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, this statute of unit can be a study.
We witness how to develop a place as a world famous tourist center within a year.
There people from the country and abroad come.
Travel facilities, shelters, guides, environmental friendly arrangements, etc. are developing a lot of arrangements after one another.
The government also shares its share.
Friends, last day Time Magazine must be an unprecedented Indian to give the Statue of Unit to the world's 100 greatest tourist centers.
I hope you're going to see the Statue of Unit some time from your valuable time.
But every Indian who finds time for the journey remains at least 15 tourist centers to go to the family, where I want to stay at night.
Friends, as you know, every year from 2014 to October 31, we celebrate the national unity day.
This day, we inspire to save our country's unity, integrity and security.
On October 31, Run For Unit will also be organised every time.
In this, people from all sections of society will be involved in all heads.
This country is one of the symbols of the Run For Unit... going to the same direction, seeking to achieve the same goal.
Likewise, there is a specific interest and excitement among the people.
Run phone unit is a beautiful opportunity.
Walking is beneficial for mind and brain and body.
Therefore, not only the body, but also the unity of the mind and cultural India and the new heights of India...
So, if you live in any city, you can find out where the run for unit is going next.
I hope you'll run your fitness to India's unit on October 31.
My dear people, Sardar packed the country's unit on the tip of unity.
Dear people, our society was always alive and awakening to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look around, we'll see many examples of working continuously to enhance each other's harmony.
But often the problems of society, its contributions, the fastening of memory.
A lot of people in different ways went to the field.
Any kind of enthusiastic clients were playing games for their own benefit from the environment.
What kind of language is spoken to warm the environment.
Efforts have been made to drive into different heavens.
We remind you of what some architects and some volunteers say only to make themselves glorious.
Gloriously respected the court's excellence, heating the society, not allowing the environment to become a stressing environment.
This thing must always be remembered, which gives us a lot of strength.
Those days, those moments give us a sense of duty.
This is an example of the sound of unity that gives the country the greatest power.
It was a big blow to the country.
I pay tribute to that woman today.
Dear people, if you can hear a story from home today, every village can hear a story from north to south, from east to west, if you hear a story from every corner of India, it's about purity.
Encouraging every person, every family and every village to have a simple experience of purity because the effort to purification is 125 million Indians.
The rights of its consequences are only 125 million Indians.
But it's a comfortable, fascinating experience.
I'm sorry to hear you.
The world's highest battlefield, the temperature is 50-60 degrees Celsius.
Only the place where the oxygen is in the air.
It is a very adventurous thing to stay in the midst of such challenges in the face of this opposite situation.
In such a opposite environment, our giants see our borders from the breasts, rather than a program called Swachh Siachen.
The source of rivers and waterfalls is that we know the ice of this syachin.
Therefore, it means to ensure fresh water for those living in the valleys, which uses water in rivers like Newbra, Shyok.
Dear people, the festival is the opportunity to awaken ourselves.
If Deepailica, especially buy something new, bring something from the market, it's going to be a little less and less in the family.
I once told you to try to buy local things.
If we get things we need in our village, we don't have to go to Taluk.
I don't want to go to the district if you've got it in Taluk.
As much as we try to buy local things, Gandhi will become an important opportunity to 150 himself.
We need to buy something that we've got with the hands of our dresses.
I'm asking you to buy local things with Deepawali's good wishes.
Look how important we can share to witness the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
But maybe due to carelessness, it's burning.
I'm gonna get burns.
Regulate yourself, enjoy the festival with enthusiasm.
Many good pleasures.
Thank you very much.
Man Ki Batt, September 2018
No Indian will be proud of our armies, the soldiers of our army.
Every Indian, in any country, in any language of caste or religion, will always be glad to express their happiness and express their support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, hundreds of thousands of people in India celebrated as the day of our army's invasion.
We recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016, when our soldiers responded to those who feared that our country was terrible on the ground of terrorism.
Most of the country's citizens, especially the younger elite, have planned our military exhibitions in different parts of the country to know what our power is.
How we are capable and how our soldiers enjoyed their lives and saved the people.
On a day like Parakram Mountain reminds the youth of the proud tradition of our armies.
It inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a program at Jodhpur in Rajasthan, the land of devils.
It is sure that those who try to avoid the atmosphere of peace in our country will respond to our armies.
India continues with dedication and dedication for peace.
In the twentieth century more than one lakh soldiers sacrificed great sacrifice for peace in two world wars .
It must also be remembered that we had no connection with that war.
It was in the territory of our soldiers for peace.
Even today, among the many peaceful forces of the United Nations, India is one of the most transmitted countries.
Our virgin soldiers have been wearing blue helmets and playing a great role in establishing peace in the world.
My dear people, the things of the sky are different.
On October 8, we celebrate the air force day.
I enjoy the heartbeats of all the windows and their families that serve for the country.
In 1947, when the attackers from Pakistan suddenly started the attack, the same air force confirmed that Indian soldiers and warplanes would come to the battlefield to save Sri Nagar from the attackers.
The air force responded to the enemy in 1965.
In 1971, nobody knows the freedom struggle in Bangladesh.
The role of the air force is determined in the 1999s to drive Kargil out of the capturers.
In Tiger Hill, the air force bombed them at the enemy's bases.
I'm grateful to the air force in the name of the survivors of our air force, even though the escape from the dangers occurred.
In India's army, India can be proudly provoked not only men's power but women's strength.
I was worried about how Tommy could be saved.
You know Ablash Tommy is a very adventurous hero.
He is the first Indian to worldwide with a small nauka without the help of a modern technology alone.
For the last 80 days, he continued his journey to the sea to participate in the Golden Globe race in the Southern Hind Sea, but the horrific sea shore caused him a danger.
But this hero of the Indian Civil Force was fighting for trouble in the sea for many days.
He's in the midst of the sea without eating and drinking anything.
It's not ready to abstain from failure to life.
I spoke on a telephone when I saved Abhilash from the sea, a wonderful man of courage and vision and contradiction.
His patience, sympathy, vision, victory, will certainly inspire our country's youth.
Dear people, everybody knows what is the importance of our country on October 2.
This year's October 2 has an important significance.
Since now for two years we have been going to make various programs worldwide by making Mahatma Gandhi ' s 100th birth anniversary .
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have been inspired all over the world.
Then in 1945, when he achieved the power of freedom, he revived the ideas and prepared a new release.
His concerns have been placed in front of the people regarding the rights of the priests and the workers of the villages, and many subjects such as purity, education and spreading.
This is called Gandhi Charter.
The priest's father was a mass struggle.
Baby's specificity was to gather and gather people, this was his nature.
This is the most important feature of his personality.
He convinced every person that the person is the most important and ever-necessary man in the country.
His most important contribution to the freedom struggle is that he made it a huge mass.
According to the pride of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom struggle, people from all sections of the society have surrendered themselves.
In that Gandhiji says, I'm giving you a mantra.
You'll feel that you're without doubt, and you'll be without ah.
My dear people, this mantra of Gandhiji is equally important today.
Today, one thing must be considered based on the growing middle class and increasing economic power and increasing activity in the country.
Would you remember the priest's bapu for a moment when we're going to buy something
Can you recall that mantra of the priest father
Can you think of what citizen of the country will be benefited from the things I buy
Whose face will be happy
Who will be obviously or indirectly benefited by you buying it
I'm glad if the poor man gets the benefit.
This is Gandhiji's mantra, this is Gandhiji's message... and I believe you'll have a small step in the life of the poorest and weakest person.
Perhaps he didn't even know how it was when Gandhiji said he would get freedom if he cleaned the premises.
But that happened, India got freedom.
We can see how poverty has a great contribution from ourselves to fight poverty in economic efficiency and economic growth in my country.
But if I believe it would be the real patriotism of today's age.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Scientist used to keep Khadi's old and dressed clothes, because somebody in it has forgotten his dress.
He used to say that these dresses were made very dressed and used to use each of these nails.
The size of the country's tea and love for the people of the country was filled with a small, lengthy glory in every part of the glory.
Two days later, we'll celebrate Scientist's sacrifice with the priest.
As soon as the name of Scientist comes, Indians will glow in our minds.
His gentle personality is always proud of the people.
Besides, he seemed to be a very humble person, but he had a strong personality inside him, the characteristic of Lal Bahadur Scientist.
His mirror, Jai Jai Kisan, shows his strange personality.
He gave the country's jewelers and farmers the widow to reach the peak of victory for nearly a year and a half.
People from all over the country are associated with this effort of the fifteenth anniversary.
If you don't have a phone contacting this topic after the defecation, the people working with purity didn't even notice such a heart attack.
I'd like to thank you for calling.
The end of the Mahatmagandhi International Sanitation Convention will take place on October 2, 2018 at the beginning of Baba's centenary celebrations.
My dear people, there's a word in culture - "You're the self-esteem."
In the administration of Babasaheb Ambedkar, there have been many systems to maintain the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired in his sight on October 12, 1993, the National Human Rights Commission was given the shape of the National Human Rights Commission.
More than a few days, the commission is completing its 25 years.
Human rights commissioned not only human rights, but also generous self-esteem.
Our favourite leader, Mr. Dal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of our country, clearly stated that the demonstrator was not our immense imagination.
In this 25-year-old journey, this institution made an environment of conscience and faith among the people.
I think it's a very humiliating event for healthy society, the best masses.
Today, human rights commissions have been formed in 26 states along with human rights activity in the national level.
As a society, we need to understand human rights and bring it into action, which is based on the development of everybody along with everybody.
O dear natives, if Jayaprakash comes to the birth anniversary of Narayan in October, they can not remember that Rajamata Vijayraj starts the birth anniversary of Scindia.
These magnitudes have been very inspired by us.
On October 31, Sardar Sahab's birth anniversary is a great victory, but for a few years, for the birth anniversary of Sardar Sahab in the next Manki Bath, it recalls that in all the small and big cities of Hindustan, in villages and streets, there is a single game of unity on the streets.
This year, our villages, streets, towns and great towns have to organize a runfor unit.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Sahab because he worked for the unity of the entire nation.
On October 31, through the Run For Uniti program, all sections of the society have to urge all the elements of the country to enforce our efforts to enforce them in the midst of unity.
Thank you.
Manki Bath 2018 August
Today the country is celebrating the rescue.
There are many good pleasures for everybody.
Raksha Bandhan is considered to be the symbol of love and faith of the brothers.
This festival is an important example of social harmony for centuries.
In the history of the country, there are many stories dedicated to the people of two different countries or religions.
Within a few days, the celebration of birth stream is coming.
The hearts of all the people and the survivors and the hearts of the birthplace.
Friends, without savings, the ears are celebrated every day in the day of fulfillment.
I appreciate all those who are engaged in growing up this great phenomenon and bringing to the common people.
We are very proud of Tamil being the world's oldest language and have played a great part in the propagation of Sanskrit language and knowledge since the Vedic times.
You will also be happy to know that the residents of Matur village of Shimoga district of Karnataka are still speaking in a mutually cultured language.
So in any microscopic vision or thing can be correctly explained.
It's easy to understand that it is associated with our soil and our tradition.
For example, to convince the importance of the Guru in life - one-time characteristic guru , disciple , nasty , drum , yud-datwahani bhavet .
Sarvapli reflects Radhakrishna.
His birthday is celebrated as a teacher all over the country.
I'm enjoying all the teachers in the country as a teacher's day.
With that, your dedication with science and education and student gladness.
Dear people, our workers, who are hardly impressed, come with new hopes for years.
The rains relax the dry ponds of trees and trees in the terrible heat.
But sometimes the catastrophic and devastating water comes along.
Nature has come to the state that there is more rain than it falls somewhere.
We have already seen that the horrific flood in Kerala has severely affected life.
Today the whole country is with Kerala in this state.
We feel comfortable with those who lost their own people.
Disturbed families want to ensure that hundreds of twenty-twenty million Indians are together with your shoulders during this suffering.
I pray that those who are injured in this natural disaster will soon recover from health.
I am very sure that because of the enthusiasm and indomitable courage of the people, Kerala will fall.
The ruins that are left out of dangers are unfortunate.
But we can see how many scenes of humanity at the time of the danger.
Wherever there is an accident, it is in Kerala, whether in any other state of India or in the district or in the region, from Kach to Kamrup, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everybody is doing something in their own way.
Every age and every karmatic part of it.
Everyone is determining their share of the hardships of the people of Kerala to slightest and share their grief.
We know the soldiers of the armed forces are leading the rescue operations in Kerala.
They tried their best to save people from the whites.
Dear people, this time Manki Bamb was checking the suggestions.
Most people from all over the country were Dul Bihari Vajpayee, our loved one.
Kirty from Gaziaabad, Free from Sonipa, Province from Kerala, Dr. Swap Banarji from West Bengal, Kshesh Pande from Katihar in Bihar, and many of the names of Nirdimodi Mobile Apple and MiGio have been asked to tell about the different aspects of the life of Dalji.
On August 16, the country and the world were sorry to hear the death of Dalji.
14 years ago, the Prime Minister of the country.
In a way, for the last 10 years, he was away from active politics.
The news didn't take place, it didn't appear in public life.
The 10-year break is very big, but after August 16, the country and the world saw that the ten-year period in the minds of the common people of India was not even a minute.
What kind of love and respect was with Dalji, the sorrow that spread all over the country, it shows his great personality.
India and the top of 2003 will be tied to Daljee in the name of the first state.
This change has made two important changes in Indian politics.
First, the size of the ministries in the states was fixed at 15 percent of the total councils.
Secondly, the limit determined by the Prevention of Restriction Act turned it into three to two.
Also, clear instructions have been made to disable those who change the party.
For many years, the political culture, which has been building a large ministry in India, was not divided by the departments, but the political leaders.
Dulji changed it.
His footsteps waited for money and resources.
And the ability to do.
The long distance of a man like Daljee was made through this change, and our political culture and healthy habits developed.
Dulji was a simple patriot.
During his reign, the time to present the budget was changed.
Earlier, following the tradition of the British, the budget was presented at 5 in the evening, because it was time to start the Parliament in England.
In 2001, when Dulji presented the budget, it turned 5 in the evening as 11 in the morning.
An independent Indian Flag code was built in the reign of Darlaji and gave it authority in 2002.
In general, the national flag can be opened so that the departments are mixed up.
That's a good thing, good news for democracy.
For healthy democracy, for a better democracy, to grow good habits, to constantly try to strengthen democracy, to take the discussions openly, to be a good ideal.
I repeat the vision of fulfilling his dream of developing and prosperous India and offer my honor to Daljee for all.
A few days ago, the Parliament's annual meeting ended.
In this conference, you will be happy to know the productivity of the world, 118 percent of the country's productivity, 74 percent.
Besides the party's interest, all members have spent 21 bills and 14 bills in the state as a result of an attempt to make the annual session fruitful.
The parlor's annual meeting will be remembered as a fair fair fair fairness of social justice and youth.
In this conference, the great bills that benefit young people and other communities have been served.
For decades, the need to make OBC commissions like the listing commission was increasing.
To ensure the rights of the backward classes, the state has been able to make the OBC commission this time and has given its constitutional authority.
This step will become one of the goals of social justice.
The litigant, the right to gain the rights of the litigant varieties, has also been served in this conference.
This law will protect the goodness of the dogs and dogs.
And the culprits will be prevented from attacking, and it will fill up confidence in the communities.
There is no harmony and culture of any kind against the woman's power in the country.
The country is not ready to bear the guilty.
That's why the parlor pinnel code was measured by Bil Pass, and it was ensured by the Department of Penal Code.
You might have read in the newspaper a few days before the court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, in a two-month trial.
Prior to this, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh, completed the trial in five days and gave death to the culprits.
The court of Rajasthan also took such a decision very fast.
This law will play a better part in preventing crimes against women and children.
Without social change, economic growth is incomplete.
But in this state's meeting, it cannot be supplied, and I assure the Muslim women that the whole country remains in power to justify them.
I thank all the parlors in the country for this occasion.
Dear people, now the attention of millions of people is focused on the Asian Gyms in the public.
Every day in the morning, people in the newspaper, in the television, in the news, in the social media, what Indian player has achieved medal.
Asian games are still going on.
Welcome to all the medal players for the country.
Among those who receive medals for the country, our girls have a lot of names, which is a very conscious sign.
There are 15-16-year-old youths in the medal-gaining youth.
It is a good sign that most of the medalists live in small streets and villages, which have been successful in hard work.
I once again appreciate the medal in the Asian Games, and I hope the other players can show a good effect.
Everyone has many good wishes of the National Sports Day.
I respect the child's idea.
We all have seen buildings and buildings with stones and rocks, but you can imagine that a mountain with a single rock was built about 1200 years ago as if it was difficult to imagine it was possible to imagine it.
But the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur of Tamilnadu is so unique where this unbelievable harmony of architecture and engineering can be seen .
The Westerners known as Raniki Wave built in the eleventh century in the place named Pan in Gujarat will surprise everyone .
India's land was an engineering experiment.
He's Indian, Dr.
M.
He is a priest in that part of the country, and the rest of the country reminds him of great respect and soul.
His memory is celebrated on September 15 as an engineer's day.
Following his legs, the engineers of our country have shown their own different identity all over the world.
Now when we celebrate the Engineer's Day, we must think about the future.
We need workshops there.
Now the disastrous management has become a big deal.
The world is facing natural resources.
What kind of structural engineering should be in this situation
How can you determine how to make a dirty creation
We have to think of this when we celebrate the engineering day.
See you again.
Manki Baath, July 2018
Due to India's globalisation and diversity, sometimes rains show interests.
But why do we blame the rain
V.
In Thailand, football players took the team of 12 children to the cave while dressing their coaches.
It'll take a few hours to go inside the cave.
Because they didn't find any other way, they searched for a small rock inside the cave - that's not one or two days, but thirty days.
If children see death in front of you, you'll see how it'll be when they have to live straight every moment.
On one side, they were straightening the danger, on the other side, human beings in the world were gathering together.
People all over the world prayed to get these children safely.
But when a good news comes, it's peaceful to the world, happy.
But I feel like seeing this happening in another way.
Everyone joined the mission as a team.
I think everybody's reconciliation is a thing to learn and understand.
In this campaign, a young man from Thailand's civilian army had to sacrifice his life.
It's surprising to the world that they don't have hopes with so much courage and forgiveness in a dark caves filled with water.
It shows wonders when ecstasy is together.
Hope, faith, vision and self-confidence were the specialities of the poems of Riz ji.
All that we have told the Indians will be very powerful and inspiration.
It must be dark.
We'll pay attention to the nice jewel.
"Namaste Prime Minister, my name is true.
I've got admission this year as a student for the first year at the University of Delhi.
We talked about the stress and education of our school board exams, what's your message to students like me
July, the months of August are very important for the workers and for the youth.
Because it's called the Peak season of colleges.
This is the time when millions of young men, like the truth, get out of school and go to jail.
If you go to Februry and March and the exam papers and answers, it's time for April May to play holidays and wait for the result, to decide the future direction in life and select the field.
Children come out of the shadow of their parents to the shadow of professors.
I'm sure my young friends will be very excited and happy from the beginning of the cultural life.
First of all, go out of the house, go out of the village and get out of a safe environment and justify it.
Many of these young men leave their homes for the first time to give a new direction to life.
Many students must have joined their colleges and some will be ready to join.
Stay calm, enjoy life, let me tell you to know the joy of the enduring life.
There's no way out of books, learning, but there's a habit of finding new things.
The price of old friends is very big.
My childhood friends are incredible, but it is a matter of sensitivity to find, build and maintain new friends in their own way.
Learn something new, get new new naps, learn new languages.
A student from a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh, now speaking of the Cold Season, was watching the news of how he achieved victory over the difficult challenges of Chaudhari life.
There are many students that have been inspired by us from the poor family, and from the challenge environment, but by dedicating and dedicating ourselves.
Father is the driver of DTC , Prince Kumar of Delhi , Abhay Gupta , who was studying under Street Light in Foodpath in Kolkata , daughter of Afrien Shaikh and Anundorhar of Ahmedabad , daughter of Autorickshaw driver , father of school bus driver , daughter of Nagpur , daughter Khushi of Nagpur , father and father of guard , who works in Harian , charms in Jarkhand .
If we look around, we can see many examples like this.
Any good event in any corner of the country inspires my mind, inspires me.
The incident was - once I was talking to Indian youth in Sanjos city, known as Technology Hab in America.
I told them how they could use their capabilities for India, and that they should do something in time.
I called for brain drine to change it into brain gene.
Two IT professionals in Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahauji and Rajneesh Wazpeiji, took my challenge and tried a different attempt.
Yogeshji and Rajneeshji together with their professional skils made the Smart Gaw up.
Not only does this app connect the people of the village to the world, but they know any information on their own mobile.
The village residents of Taudhakpur village of Rai Bareli inspired the district magistrate and CDO to use this app.
It's a matter of bringing a digital revolution in this village, recording, tracking and monitoring all the developments in the village.
There are phone directories, news sensors, ents lists, health centers, infermation centers in this village.
This is also very beneficial for the farmers, the Fact Rate between the farmers of the App village feecher, is useful as a model for their production.
If you look at this incident, the young man lives in the United States, living in the country's lifestyle and thoughts, India will leave many years ago, but knows the challenges of his village, understands the challenges, develops a virtual relationship with the village.
But sometimes due to lack of time, sometimes because of the surroundings, sometimes the slight layer of the spear is covered upon it, but if a small skin touches it, all things emerge once more, it takes it to the past.
"Santoshji, thank you for your phone call.
Of course Pamppur ride is a very unique pilgrimage .
Friends, Asha Ekadshi, this time is celebrated on July 23.
Pampur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
About 15-20 days before Aasha Ekadashi the adults i . . the pilgrimages leave on foot for the journey of Pampur with teeth .
Millions of people are involved in this journey called Wari.

God loves the poor, the poor and the victims.
People in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Thalassery have great respect and devotion.
To go to the Laddhoba temple of Pampur and its magnificence , beauty , spiritual joy etc . are also a different experience .
If I have an opportunity to tell the sons of Manki Bath, I must be in Parpur.
Gyaneshwar , Namadev , Eknath , Ramadas , Tukaram , and innumerable myths , are still available to the common people in Maharashtra .
This monastery will continue to inspire all over India to fight against blind respect.
The message of harmony, love and patience is received from all the ideas related to it.
There is a mandate to fight society with respect to blind respect.
The worldman was a patience and self-reliant person.
He had the power and intelligence of the British rulers to make their mistakes.
The British feared him thrice in a year.
That's not a small thing.
I want to present a funny thing to you about the world's tailor and a statue of his in Ahmedabad.
When Ahmadabad arrived in October 1916, nearly a hundred years ago, more than 40,000 people came to welcome him there and during this journey, Sardar Vallabh Bhai had a chance to speak to him.
Sardar was very impressed by Brother Patel.
It was naturally unsatisfied by the British, and the players continued to deny the permission.
But Sardar Saheb was a brother-in-law, and he was firm and sure he had to give up his position, but he would be able to establish the statue of the world-wide man.
Finally, the statue was built, not only on 28 February 1929, but also on Mahatma Gandhi, it was inaugurated.
Ganeshotsav started as a result of the effort of the world leader.
With the celebration of traditional respect and festival, the Ganesh festival has become a strong medium of promoting social awakening, socialism, socialism, dedication and equality among the people.
It was a period of time to fight against the British in the country.
It is obvious that our old tradition and our boons in history are still interested in our young generation.
Today, in many cities and every streets, you can see glory.
This is a good opportunity for our youth to learn about leadership and organizationalism and to develop its ability.
This time, from the statue of Ganeshji, all the decorations must be environment friendly, and every city must be a competition for environment friend Ganesh festival.
I'm gonna get all this to the people.
The world-general self-sacrifice among the people, a madness, a self-respect, a self-sacrifice of our own, achieving it.
It's time to say that Swiss is our own right to live.
There should be good results of every Indian and wealth and development.
This is the creation of a new India.
After 50 years of Tilkon's birth, the same day, that is, on July 23, another son of India.
He sacrificed his life as he thought we would breathe the wind of freedom.
I'm talking about Chandrasekhar Asad.
There will be no young man who is inspired by hearing these scriptures, inspired many youths like Sarfaroshi's Tamnana, Ab Hamare Diil Me Hydhekhana, Baju-e-Kaitta, Ashfaq Banarah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azad's courage and his enthusiasm for freedom became inspired by many youths.
Azad's life was lost, but he never shook his head when he was in foreign rule.
A few days ago, the junior attorney in Finland made history by gaining a gold medal in India's heroic lady, the treasurer of India in a 400 metres of rampant race at the 20 world astrological championship.
Another of our daughters responded to my request to fear alone and sent me to the e-mail by describing the preparations for Asian Gyms from Indonesia.
Ekta in the e-mail writes: "The most important moment in the life of any adlet is the triangular moment, I'm proud of it.
"Ekta, we're all proud of it.
The name of the solitary country is joyful.

In the month of August, for many festivals that have been going on for centuries, thanks to the best of yourself.
I'll once again get into the Manki Bay.
Manki Bath, 2018 June
A cricket match was held in Bangalore a few days ago.
You know, I'm talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
Two teams have a good performance in this game.
Bowler Rashid Khan, from the side of Afghanistan, showed good performance to IPL this year.
I remember, Afghan President Shriman Ashraf Ghani said, "The people of Afghanistan are proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I'm thankful to my Indian friends for preparing the stage for our players to show their strength.
Rasheed Khan reminds the great players of Afghanistan.
The Indian team did something to be the whole world.
While buying Indian team trophy, the first time in the international competition, the Afghan team was called together and took photographs.
My best wishes to India and Afghanistan teams.
I'm sure we'll take part in the games with the Spartzman Spirit.
Dear natives, the fourth day of this June 21 showed a different sight.
I've seen one thing all over the world.
In the high snowy peak of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China together sacrificed yoga.
Yoga works to break all borders and unite the people.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from more than 100 countries have made this occasion a big festival without caste, religion, region, color, women and men.
While people from all over the world have participated in the programs of Yoga in so much enthusiasm , it is natural for India to be more and more excited .
It is proud of the country that hundreds of twenty-five million people have sacrificed the security forces of our country in water and sky.
Some virgins synonymized at the intervals, some synthesis on the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our warriors in the air, in the midst of the sky, sacrificed everybody at the height of fifteen thousand feet above the earth.
They were swimming in the sky, but they did not see it on the plane.
Yoga was done in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and sports.
Yoga tribes, religions and regions have gathered people all over the world for centuries, and we have been convinced of the Vasudhaiv family.
Our sages, fools and other priesthoods have supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be in the middle of the yoga literature.
Most people will make it part of their lives.
My dear natives, I have written a number of people in My Giovi and Narendramodi up to tell you about Dr. Dae, who came to Manki Batt this time.
That's right.
Let's just remember the doctor when we get a problem.
But it's a day to drive our doctor's achievements... and this is the opportunity to thank them for their service and offerings to the society.
The role of the doctor is not enough to treat the disease .
'They are not only treating, but they are treating the doctor today, but they have a great experience about how it affects our lives.
With their ability and naiveness, Indian doctors have put their own personality all over the world.
The chiefs of the therapy are also known to solve the problems related to treatment with hardship.
Through Manki Bay, I'm enjoying good pleasures for all the people for our doctor friends on the occasion of Doctors Day on July 1.
O dear people, we are lucky to live in this Indian land.
India has a prosperous history for a month or day without any history.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It's true I'm coming to Magahar on 20th.
Do you know why he went to the marble
There was a feeling that those who died in Meghhar would not be heavenly.
On the other hand, those who die in the money will get heaven.
Magahar was considered insane, but Sat Kabir didn't believe it.
In today's time, they are so inspiring.
That is, the real pious saint knows and understands the pain of others.
He doesn't know the pain of the others is foolish.
At that time there was an imperfection and conflict in the world, and he gave a message of peace and harmony.
Accumulated the minds of the world and worked to remove the opinions.
His words are true even after centuries today.
The same is a guru Jagatguru guru Nanak Dev.
He's been inspired by millions of people for centuries.
He taught the Guru Nanak Dev community to destroy the racial differences and see the human beings as a whole and turn them away.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say, "God service is to serve the poor and the poor."
In 2019 the fifth light of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated .
I want all of us to be merciful and enthusiastic.
I'm supposed to think of new ideas, new ideas, new ideas and ideas about how to celebrate the nineteenth light of Guru Nanak Dev in the society, and how to celebrate all over the world.
There is a history associated with Punjab.
In Jallianwala Bagh, the horrific event that smelled the entire human life has been given a hundred years in 2019.
My dear people, Sriman Raman Kumar from Rohini in Delhi wrote on the Nerendramodi Mobile Appellate 6th July.
Shyam Prasad is the birthplace of Mukherjee.
In this program, he wrote to the people to tell me about Shyam Prasad Mukherjee.
Ramanji thanks to you for the first time.
Dr.
In 1937 the convocation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore University of Calcutta was congratulated in Bengali language by accepting the invitation of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee .
When the British ruled, someone at the University of Calcutta was the first to speak in Bengali language at Convocation.
From 1947 to 1950.
In a way, he made a strong base for India and industrial development and built a strong stage.
His ideas and philosophy have been displayed in the first industrial leadership of India declared in 1948.
He dreamed that India would be a professional self-sufficiency and prosperity in all areas.
He wanted the SMEs to pay attention to handlooms, clothes and dwelling industries.
Between 1948 and 1950, Ol India Handy Crafts Board, Ol India Handloom Board and Khadi-Village Industries Board were established for their economic help and organizational system for the proper development of small business.
Dr. Don't want to patriotism in India's defense production.
The most important thing for Shyam Prasad Mukherjee was India's anomaly, for which he had to sacrifice his life at the age of just twenty-five.
Come on.
People talked about their imaginations, illusions and their achievements.
In remote villages, girls provide services from pension to passport to the elders of the village through public service centers.
A sister from Chhattisgarh works with ice cream.
Like the ignorant light in Jharkhand lakhs of youths of the country along with providing medicine centres provide less medicines to nearby villages .
A young man from West Bengal was looking for a job two-three years ago and today a business was successful.
Not only that, ten-twenty people are working.
The school students from Tamilnadu , Punjab and Goa work in the important areas like pollution in the tincture lab of school at their young age.
There are some people in the society, and they don't know what they are despairing, and they don't know what they're despairing, but they're not trying to relieve.
In such an environment, when the ordinary man comes with ideas and new enthusiasm and the events in his life, it is not a source of government.
The incident of a little boy in a small village can also be inspired by hundreds of people.
With the help of technology, when I spent time with experts through video bridges, it was very comfortable and inspiring to do something.
There is a new happiness and new enthusiasm to give life to a poor man in poverty.
I'm very grateful to the people.
40-50 lakh people are associated with this video bridge, giving me a new power.
We can also feel the smell of wealth.
One thing came to me last day, it's a different experience.
Accompanied by the treasurers, made plans and worked successfully to increase the income of the treasurers.
In a way, the farmers have a big share in the whole range from generating to marketing, and they are trying to ensure double profits, and they need good seeds to improve the crop.
That's why the bank has been built.
Women are watching the things of this shitbank, and the women are connected to it.
I know everything, I don't know anything, some people know, some people don't know, but millions of people constantly do some good things, everybody's very happy.
Dear people, it's going to be a year in the middle of GSD.
Van Nation One Tax was the dream of the people, which has really changed today.
People from different political criteria are sitting there, people from different states, people from different states of preservation, but the decisions taken in the GST Council are unanimously taken.
Before GSD, there were many taxes in the country, according to this arrangement, only one tax is in the country.
GSD is the victory of truth, this is the festival of truthfulness.
Earlier, Ispector Raj was complaining of tax in the country.
In place of inspector in GSD, ID, information technology, informatic trick has reached.
From Ritten to Refund, everything goes on online through description.
GSD was probably the world's largest tax evasion program.
This is because of the people of the country's acceptance of such a huge tax transformation in India, and the victory of GSD is not confirmed by the people's power.
Ordinarily thought that such a huge circumstance would take 5-7 years to reach all over the country.
Manki Baath, 2018 May
Welcome.
- Yes, I want to tell you something about them.
These six daughters of India, their group, returned to India on May 21, roaming around the world on the INSV floor in the sea for more than two and a half days.
The whole country welcomed them with enthusiasm.
Last Wednesday, I got an opportunity to see these women, to hear their travel experiences.
Once again, I rejoice to inform the world that India's magnificence is not very bad, especially the Indian women.
Nobody's adventure.
If we take care of the development of human cells, we can see that progress has emerged from a spiritual conception.
Evolution is in the lap of adventure.
On May 16, five tribal children of a Ashram School in Maharashtra, Manisa Dhru, Pramesh Ale, Ummanta Madavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam, climbed into the world's highest peak.
These children in Ashram school started training on August 2017, and they got training in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Le and Ladakh.
These young men were chosen under Machin Shaurya.
They won the Everest according to the name and they were proud of the country.
I enjoy many best wishes to those connected to the Chandrapur school, these little kids.
This is the next time, the 16-year-old Shivangi Passak was the youngest Indian girl who won Everest from Nepal.
I enjoy innumerable best wishes to those brave virgins, especially the women.
They taggle each other and challenge them.
This fit is connected to the Indian state.
The cinema sector, the ordinary people of the country, the soldiers of the army, the school teachers, have shared it all around, listening to its noise.
If we fit, India and fit...
Kohli, Captain of the Indian Cricket Team, has also challenged me, I have accepted his challenge. It's a good thing.
The challenge will encourage us to be fit and others.
My dear people, you've heard about games, games many times in Manki Batt, something I say.
Last time the heroes of Common Welth Games spoke to us through this program, "Namaskara, sir.
"Chry Yadavji, thank you so much for calling on the phone.
It's true that the games that were part of all children's life are decreasing today.
These games were particularly part of the summer.
Sometimes lunch, sometimes in the night, after dinner, the children used to play for hours.
Outdoor and Indoor.
The unity behind our country's diversity can be seen in these games.
The same game is known in different names at different places.
I'm from Gujarat.
A game in Gujarat is known as Chomal-Isto.
It's playing with wood, or potatoes, or 8:8 size square bords.
This game was mostly played in every state.
In Karnataka, it was called Chaukabara in Madhya Pradesh, the hills in Kerala, the Chambal in Maharashtra, and the Tamil Nadu in Tamil Nadu, and many names like Changpo in Rajasthan.
But when you play, you know, people in every country don't know the language, huh
It'll be said we don't even play this game.
Those who don't play kids and kids in childhood.
It's a game played in children and towns and towns.
It's called different names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh it was called Gotibila or Karrabila.
In Orissa, Gulibadi is called Vitidalu in Maharashtra.
Some games have their own weather, season.
It's like a season to open the city.
When everybody opens the city, everybody plays, the different qualities of ours can be expressed without any turmoil.
The elders look very seriously, but when they play, the child hiding out of them comes out.
Overwhelming games encouraging our universal thinking, concentration, awareness and supremacy with physical ability.
At the same time, we know our culture and tradition.
Many games make us aware of society and environment.
By calling people, we can create a great historical collection of our traditional games.
This time the fire is to fail plastic dirt, beat plastic polution.
I request you to understand this theory of the fire, and don't use a low-level plastic plastic on the nature of plastic waste, on wild animals, and on the resistance of our health.
Web site of world climate to see a lot of opinions given in a very attractive way in the wed-India2018, and try to enforce it in everyday life.
When it's hot, when the rain doesn't end, it's cold, everyone'll start telling the globe waming, climate chainging like a specialist.
But can you just talk about it
This is basically a climate change, the result.
Our culture, our tradition, taught us not to fight with nature.
We have to be happy with nature, we have to live together with nature.
The Great God promised for this in life and in every step.
Today, India says about climate justice, India has played a major part in the PO21 Paris Convention, and we have united the world through international solar layers.
How can we go ahead with this
What can you do with a new one
It's rainy season.
There are reports that plans are being made to celebrate the International Yoga Day on 21st June.
The Yoga for Unit for unity has recognised the world over the past few years.
There is always a courage to live like a father to do yoga.
If all these qualities are friends, the yogi can overcome all kinds of fear.
I once again ask all the people to encourage Yoga and create a healthy, comfortable and wealthy nation.
Dear neighbors, today is 27th May, the memory of India's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
Procedures for Panditji...
This month's memory is connected to another person.
In May 1957, Indians gave their strength to the British.
In 1857, Veerasavarkar wrote that the first fight for freedom was not irrelevant.
Savarkar's life was full of species.
But more than that, he was a great poet and a socio-economist, who always gave importance to harmony and unity.
Our beloved Dal Bihari Vajpayee has made a great description of Sarkarji.
Sovereign poems and poetry went together.
As a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary.
If there's an excitement to do something, it's obvious that you can win all the constraints.
This is not just a matter of Siker, but you can see it everywhere in India.
If you look around, you'll see how people lose their resistance.
Even now, when we go to a tea chamber, we'll have to enjoy the tea there, we'll have to take care of some of the nearby discussions and discussions.
These discussions might be political, social, films, players and games, problems in the country - this is the problem.
You'll be surprised to know that he's the light of education in more than seventy children's life.
He opened a school called 'Asha-Ashwasan' for the children living in the streets and ghettos, for which the poor teamaker spends a half percent of his income.
He makes arrangements for education, health and food to all children coming to school.
I'm D.
Bright loves Raw's teaching and offerings and new directions for the life of poor children.
He's abandoned the darkness of their life.
There'll be a lot of things like this around you.
There will be innumerable events.
Come on, let's encourage goodness.
The moon will wait for a few days.
Everyone thinks it's very exciting, especially children will get good gifts on this occasion.
Eid hopes to strengthen our society with harmony and friendship.
Everybody has many good wishes.
My dear neighbors, thanks to you.
Maybe next month in Mankie Bay.
Manki Baath, April 2018
The Commonwealth Games was held in Australia from 4 to 15 April .
71 countries including India participated in it.
When such a big program, thousands of players from all over the world imagine what the atmosphere is there.
Who can get rid of it in an environment consisting of excitement, excitement, ideas and hopes and a vision of achieving.
Shooting, booking, whitelifting, table tennis and badminton showed the performance of India recordings.
India has achieved 66 medals, including 26 gold, 20 silver and 20 varieties.
This victory will be proud of all Indians.
Everything's gonna be drowned in the same way.
The words will be sorry to make it clear.
But I'm gonna hear you from that player.
It was my dream of being the only player between India and Manipur.
Do you know that all the restaurants that went to participate from India this time have received a medal
Manika's bulls got medals from all of them.
They are the first Indian woman to receive gold medal for India in personal table tennis.
India's most medal shooting.
Fifteen-year-old shooter Anish Bhanwala is the youngest player in the Commonwealth Games for India.
Sachan Chaudhari is the only Para Power Lifter to get a medal in Commonwealth Games for India.
This time it's special that more women than medalists are.
Whether it's a squash or a boxing, weight lifting, the women are wonderful.
The last fight in Badminton is the two players of India, Sinna Nehwal and P.
Sindhu was also together.
Everybody was interested in getting two medals for India.
The players in Gyms have gone from many parts of the country, from small towns.
They have their friends who have power over every neighborhood.
In Manki Batt last month, I invited people, especially the youth, as Fit India.
Come on, let's cooperate with Fit India and jealousy about leading Fit India.
I'm glad that people join it with great enthusiasm.
Shearing her own picture in the swimming pond at Shishikanth Bhosle, My Veparan Ice Body, My Element Ice Water, My Wald Ice Swimming...
Dhawal has written his own picture of trekking priests, surely for me traveling and trekking is Fit India.
It's very happy to see many of the well-known people inspire our youth for FIT India.
Sunma's caller Akshay Kumar has made a video sheer on the screen.
You must see it, and he'll see the Wooden bed exercise.
He says this exercise is very good for the outer and stomach muscles.
Another video is in progress.
He's playing Volleybol with the people.
Many young people have shared their experiences with Fit India's efforts.
I think such initiatives are very beneficial for us and all over the country.
And one more thing is to say, the name of the FIT India Movement is Yoga.
Yoga has special importance in the FIT India program, you must have started preparing.
The importance of the International Yoga Day on June 21 has now been accepted all over the world.
You'll be ready now.
Not alone, your city, your village, your colony, your school, your castle, everywhere, everybody, every age, a man, or a woman, must try to deal with yoga.
Today there is no need to say anywhere in India or the world that Yoga is beneficial for psychological development and mental reconciliation.
You've seen my animated video too much.
They've been driven out of animation even if they can show a teacher very slightly.
You'll also get the benefit.
I want to tell you something by inviting you to a new job.
A lot of young people spend their time to learn something new now.
Otherwise, Internship provides a new experience in its own way.
Outside the four walls, there is a chance to escape from the papers, pens and computers and a new life experience.
My young friends, I'm forgiving you for a specific internship.
The three ministries of the Indian government - Sports, Department of Development and the Ministry of Drinking Water has started a Swachh Bharat Summer Industries 2018 together.
If the students of the college, the youths of the ENC, NSS and Nehru Youth Centre want to do something for the country, if they want to learn something for the society and the country, they can join it if they want to be a cause for the change of society.
This will enjoy the support and strength of purity, while celebrating the centenary birthday of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2, it will be happy to do something before.
The best participants, those who do good work in the college, those who do good work in the university, will be given priests at the national level.
Not only that, the UGC will give two credit points to those who finish very well.
Students and students and youth are once more intended to indulge in index.
You can go to MiGovi and register the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope our youth will come forward in this initiative for purity.
I'm supposed to know about your efforts.
You know what you know, know about the events, send photos, send video.
Use this holiday for a new experience.
We'll see how many people are doing good things on the edges of our country, what good things are going on.
I've seen the story of the young men who are unsuccessful for poor children's education.
In addition to these youths, children living in the teeth and children living in the teeth have begun a major program of education.
They snatched them on the streets, and snatched them into the conditions of children doing small jobs, so they left for this actual activity.
The youths and teachers associated with this program are engaged in this virtual attempt to change socially for two hours from their busy life.
Likewise, brothers, some farmers in the mountainous region of Uttarakhand are inspired by the farmers of the country.
They changed their own fate, not just theirs, but their fate.
In Bageshwar, Uttarakanth, mostly ragi, Chaulai, chicken or barley are farming.
Because of the mountainous area the farmers did not get the price of paying them .
This biscuit of iron is very beneficial for pregnant women .
These farmers formed a collaboration team at Munnar village and started a business factory.
Seeing the patience of the treasurers, the government also linked it to the national survival.
This biscuit now reaches not only in Bageshwar district but also in approximately 50 organisation centres, Almora and Kaisani.
With the aid of the treasurers, the annual sale of the team has not only reached 10-15 lakh rupees, but with more than 900 families getting jobs, the district's jobs are declining.
We don't think water conservation is social responsibility
Think of how to protect every rainbow.
We know that water conservation is not a new thing in Indian mind.
Not the subject of the book, not the subject of language.
Our ancestors have lived it for centuries.
They predicted each drop of water and glory.
They've been looking for new ways to keep every drop of water.
In Manar Koval , Chiranmaha Devi , Kovalpatty , Newkottai there are big rock paintings , even today many ponds are like tourist centers .
But don't forget to forget that these big summits of water supply are the living examples of our ancestors' efforts.
The pond named Raniki Bawdi of Adlaj and Patan in Gujarat is the world heritage center of UNESCO which is worth seeing .
These ponds are one type of water shrines.
If you go to Rajasthan then you must go to Chandabawadi in Jodhpur .
It's one of India's largest and beautiful Bawdi (kulam), which is in the watershed area.
April, May, June and July are the best time to sustain the rain water, and we will be benefited by what we prepare before.
In the last three years, water conservation and water management have done some things in their own way.
In the year 2017-18, a total of 64,000 crore has spent 55 percent of the expenditure, i.e. about thirty-three thousand crore rupees for water conservation.
For the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been made available through such water conservation and water management.
Sasur, who was dried up with people from around 40-45 villages, revived the rivers of Khaderi.
Whether animals, birds, birds, farmers, fields or villages, how blessed is this victory for all of them
In the north 24 Farghan district of West Bengal, the name of the village, Deotola, has been mentioned in the name of Ankur Banerjee Majio. We celebrate Revinder Jayanti every year, but no one knows the vision of living peacefully and concentratedly.
Please, people must discuss this matter in the Manki Bath program to know about this.
Her palms were a strange mudra in everyone, and Rabindranath was a revengeful personality, a brilliant man.
I had a habit of listening to it, but I don't know the language, but I wake up in the morning and listen to Radio in Radio... and become my habit... enjoyment...
You and Rabindra Sangeeta may have influenced his poems.
I'm honored to celebrate Rabindranath Tagore this time.
Rumson is celebrated all over the world with respect and respect.
When humans are hungry at the social side of fast, he knows the hungry of others.
When you're thirsty, you know the others' thirst.
Once a man asked the prophet, what is the best thing in Islam
The prophet replied, "Whatever poor or hungry, eat and behave with everyone, whether you know or with harmony."
People donate to those who deserve this pious month.
According to the prophet Mohammad, a person is rich with a pure soul and not with money and wealth.
We must predict that India is the soil of Lord Buddha, the glory of sacrifice, service and sacrifice, which has led thousands of people all over the world.
Remembering this Buddhist Lord Buddha, he reminds us of our responsibility that he can take care of and remind him of the way to travel through the wilderness.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration of equality, peace, harmony and harmony.
This is the most important human value in the world today.
Buddha's motivation in the social perspective of Baba Saheb Ambadkar is very much.
Babasaheb said: 'My social vision is reflected in three words - freedom, equality and patience.
The roots of my vision are in religion, not in political science.
I've been embraced from my master Buddha.
Despite this, it has strengthened millions of people who are suffering, suffering, defected and relieved by the Babasaab administration.
There's no bigger example than this.
It was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha in the pain of people.
Even in Asia the advice of Lord Buddha is traditionally available .
I am very happy to be partnered by the Indian government in revival of many Buddhist temples , in which the centuries old grand joy temple of Myanmar is also included .
Today there is a scene of tension and human pain all over the world, and the advice of Lord Buddha leads to abstain from hate.
I enjoy the museums of the Buddhist religion all over the world, which believes in the myths of Lord Buddha.
For all over the world, Lord Buddha prays for the blessings of Lord Buddha to defend my responsibility for the creation of a peaceful and cruel world based on his advice.
The Indian people worldwide had a new self-esteem.
It was the day of Buddhism.
May 11, 1998, on the west coast of India, in Pokhran, Rajasthan.
It's been twenty years since Lord Buddha's blessing is on the day of Buddhism.
India's experiments became successful and India's ability to see science and communism.
On that day, it is recorded as an exhibition of military power in Indian history.
Lord Buddha told the world that the power of the infinite is necessary for peace.
Likewise, when you get strength as a country, you can live peacefully with anyone.
It is not only important for the country to test it in May 1998, but it is also important to do it.
India's land has wildlife all over the world, with great scientists' land and a powerful leadership, India and new goals and heights.
Dul Bihari Vajpayee gave a mantra, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigin...
We can feel a new joy in the journey that starts with Duljee.
Dear people, I'll see you again in Manki Bay, and I'll tell you a lot of things.
Man Ki Baath, March 2018
Today is the myth of Ramnavami.
On this pilgrimage of Ramnavami, many of my best wishes to everyone.
We have seen at all moments of his life how much Rama's strength was in the life of the supreme father.
On January 26, all the great men in the Asian countries were here, and they brought it with them to the cultural unions of the nation.
I once again enjoy the best wishes of Ramnavami.
My dear people, this time, like every time, all your letters, e-mails, phone calls have received a lot of opinions.
I read about Col. Thakur My Geovy's online course of culture.
I'm glad to see ID professional love with your culture.
We have told the department concerned about the efforts in this direction.
I'm also asking Manki Bath's stars working with culture how to take the advice of Kamalji.
And in the summer, the birds ask everyone to keep water.
Shakal ji, I've reached all the stars.
Mr. Yogesh Bhadresh ji says I want to tell the youth about their health.
He feels that our youths are physically weak when they embrace the Asian countries.
Prasantji, the Central Government has already supplied the photographs of social media and Norendramodi Applu.
Let's lick it up, retweet it, get it to friends.
From Chennai, Anuga, Jaisesh and many children have written things that have been found in the Gratude Cards behind the book Eksam Warrior...
I've touched my mind with so much of the burning, so much of the phone calls, from the opinions, and from the hearings...
Even if I talk about them, I'll have to talk for months.
Winters tell you about the water of birds.
There are letters from artificial brother-in-law about things going on from Kisan fairs and farming and all over the country.
Some people who are aware of water conservation have suggested.
There will be burns about our festivals, our culture, our traditions.
In these experiences, however, you don't change, in these examples, so much inspiration, energy, self-esteem, something to do for the country.
It has the power to change the entire environment of the country.
When I can know that Ahmad Ali, a refugee from Karingch in Assam, built 9 schools for poor children in his will, is directly witnessing the indomitable will of this country.
When Dr . Ajeet Mohan Choudhary of Seopur went to the footpath to hear the story of the poor and giving them medicines free of cost, the people of this country had the opportunity to understand mutual relations.
The car driver Sidul Luzker's brother died in Kolkata because he was not treated 13 years ago.
Twelve years after the money collected, finally, the crazy effort of the Saidul Laskars appeared to be seen.
Due to his hardship and vision, a hospital of 30 beds has been built in the village of Regiment near Kolkata.
Many of these motivations introduce my country.
Today the world's perspective has changed.
We are moving forward among all classes, faith in our country's progress.
This self-esteem, this possibilty, will help in realizing our vision of wealth, will be a dreamer.
My dear natives, for a few months to come, it's very important for the treasury brothers and sisters.
Because of this, many letters have come in contact with agriculture.
This time I saw a video of discussions with the farmer on the DD Kissan channel, all the farmers should contact the DD Kissan channel of the aforesaid.
His discourse to the earth, the fields of agriculture and the fields of agriculture, and the greatness of the treasures, is evident in this verse... and he said, "Though the warmth to die and the soil to tend, ourselves to forget."
Likewise, Lal Bahadurswiss was strongly arguing about the safety of trees, trees and trees and the need for better agricultural practices.
Ramnohar Lohya told our farmers the need for better income, better water supply facilities, to ensure them and increase the production of food and milk, and a large number of people to wake up.
In his speech in 1979, Chaudhari Charansing asked the treasurers to use new techniques and conduct new findings, encouraging their needs.
I went to the farm-free fair organized in Delhi last day.
There was a very comfortable experience for me to know, understand, understand and know the new findings related to agriculture, and my discussions with the artificial brothers and scientists.
But I was most impressed by Meghalaya and the artists there.
This very low-strong state has been observed as a major activity.
Our workers in Meghalaya produced records in the year 2015-16 compared to the previous five years.
When I explicitly stated that when the MSP is considered to be a small amount of superiority, its four-wheelers, machines, or the cost of the machine, the price of the vessels, the price of all kinds of caterpillars, the cost of irrigation, the cost of the state geography, and the song of the song on the activity... it is not merely the length of it... but also the blindness of the people who blinded themselves into the treasure of the treasury.
Besides, a large number of jobs are being carried out for artificial reforms in the country for the farmers to get the right price.
The rural markets are being attempted to connect with Halseil Market and the global market.
My dear countrymen, this year the beginning of the centenary anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will be reduced.
How should the country celebrate this festival
It's our definite weight.
Besides, a hundred twenty-twenty-twenty-thousands of people will give Gandhiji the best attention
You can share your opinions through my Geovi.
What should be the Logo of Gandhi 150
Slogan, Wizard, or what's the celebration
Today the country has progressed from traditional ways in the health sector.
Everything related to health in the country was the only responsibility of the Ministry of Health.
Today, all the departments and ministries are working together for healthy India, whether the Ministry of Women and Children, or the Ministry of Women and Children, or the State Governments.
Disease resistance is the cheapest and easy health care.
As much as we are aware of the disease resistance , there will be benefit from the person and family and society .
If life is to be healthy then first it is clean.
We all took a challenge as a country, resulting in the repeated security coverage in 4 years, nearly 80 percent.
Besides, there are widespread operations in making health care centers across the country.
Yoga has turned into a birthplace today, with the dedication of all of us to the house.
This time the International Yoga Day remains 100 days to reach June 21.
In the last three international yoga days, people shared everywhere in the country and in the world.
We must ensure that this time we will sing ourselves and inspire the whole family, friends and everybody to do yoga.
In the new attractive ways of doing yoga, it is necessary to inspire children and youth and elderly citizens.
TV and electronic media have a number of programs related to yoga throughout the year.
From now on to the yoga day, can you make an awakening in the matter of yoga
My dear neighbors, I'm not a teacher of yoga.
I'll show you the video so that we can study asanas and pranayamas together.
It'll help them.
For heart patients the rate of stench in the heart is less than 85 percent .
The price of egg transplant has also been reduced by 50 to 70 percent.
According to the Ayushman Bharat plan, about 10 crore families i.e. about 50 crore people will spend up to 5 lakh rupees a year for treatment and the Central Government and the Insurance Company.
In the country's 479 medical colleges, the number of MBBS seats has increased to 68000.
New AIIMS is being opened in different states to provide better treatment and health care to the people of the country.
A new medical college will be opened every three districts.
We have to work together to get rid of TB.
My dear neighbors, April 14.
Baba Saheb is the birth anniversary of Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar told us about the industrialization of India.
For him, it was a good medium to provide jobs to poor people in the poor.
Today when we are successful in launching 'Make in India ' in the country, Dr.
With his views today, 'Smart Stis Mission' has started in the country, 'Arbon Stis Mission' and it is necessary to provide all kinds of facilities in big cities and small towns of the country - whether it is good roads or water facilities, education or digital connectivity.
Baba was very faithful in self-sacrifice.
He wanted no person to be in poverty forever.
At the same time, he believed that he would not only remove their poverty because he gave something to the poor.
Today, the beginnings like Mudra John, Startup India, Standardup India are giving birth to our young comrades.
For the development of the country, the use of water, the various reverse vali athorities, the various commissions related to water, are born in the eyes of Babasaheb Abedkar.
Today, efforts are being made to reduce history for waterways and ports in the country.
He gave importance to Federalism and the development of the Federal Institution and working together with the Centre and States.
He showed us that it is not necessary for the highest or wealthy family to live, but to see dreams and dreams of people born in the poor family in India, and to try to testify those dreams.
Baba Saheb has played Ambedaka.
Accordingly, there will be special programs on all rural development, poor welfare and social justice in India.
I'm asking yourself to take part in this program.
My dear countrymen, there are many festivals in the coming days, Lord Mahavir's victory, Hanuman Jayanti, Ester, Vaishachi.
Lord Mahavir's Janetinal is a long time to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life and vision of Lord Mahavirji, the messenger of Ahimsa, will inspire us all.
The good wishes of Mahavirajayanti to all the people.
When I tell you about the Eastern, the inspirational advice of Jesus Christ will be remembered, and he gave the message of peace and harmony and justice to mankind.
In April, Vaishali will be celebrated in Punjab and western India.
Many questions related to science have asked my young friends to write something.
We see the color of the sea blue, but we understand from our experience that water is not colorful.
Have we ever thought why the water in the river or sea is colored
The same question came to mind a young man in 1920.
This is what a scientist gave birth to modern India.
Now when we talk about science, India's C.
One of his findings is famous as Raman Ifact.
Because this is the day he found out the truth of light skatering, that's why he got the Nobel gift.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the science sector.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khuran and Satendranath Bose are proud of India .
In the name of Satendranath Bose the famous ' Boson ' partychildren has been named .
Next time I had an opportunity to attend a program in Mumbai, which was inaugurated by the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It was very happy to know the wonders in the science sector.
Artificial intelligence helps in the creation of robots, boots, other definite purpose machines.
Now machines reflect their brains through self-length.
This technique can be used to improve the lives of poor and poor.
I asked the Scientists how Artificial Interligens could be helpful to facilitate the lives of Divanga -LRB- unlimited -RRB- brothers and sisters -LRB- unlimited -RRB- in this program of Artificial Intelligence.
Do we know better about natural resources through artificial intelligence
Could the farmer get some help in carbohydrate
Are the artificial intellectuals helpful in the treatment of diseases in a modern way , making it easier to reach everybody
Last day, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I got an opportunity to join the inauguration of the program in Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
There's a young man who developed a digital device.
I think I can use artificial individuals for many such things.
Scientistic analysis is one of the virus neutrals.
Any machine we're gonna do.
But what we want to do with machine depends on us.
Tomas Alva Edison, who saw the lighting bulb, failed many times in his test.
Once he asked about this, he replied, "I have searched for ten thousand methods to find Bulb.
I mean, Edison made his failures stronger.
I'm very lucky to tell you I'm in Aravalli, the land of Great Aravindan.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and raised questions to British India.
The idea of repeating questions to know the truth is very important.
This is the real motivation behind scientific findings.
Why, don't you calm down until the questions are answered.
During this period of national science, the best wishes to scientists and all others associated with science.
Friends, I get a lot of messages about all matters, including security, extermination, and people write something related to me.
Mr. Ravindra Singh from Poona and Narendermodi Mobile of All Comments are about the safety of the working class.
He wrote that security standards are not good where factory and manufacturing works are going on in our country.
The next 4th March is India's national security day, so he suggested that people should talk about security in the Prime Minister Manki Bath program to be aware of security.
When we talk about public security, two things are very important.
One is important in danger time - safety during disastrer - second is the daily life - safety in averted life .
If we don't care about security in everyday life, if we don't care, it's difficult to be in danger.
We'll often write on the boards on the way - if there is no awareness, the danger will certainly be a wrong loss, joy and laughter... and ensure safety without leaving the world so fast.
I have to say that the Fire Brigadekers in the cities of Fire Brigade should go to school once a week or once a month to show them in front of the children.
So there are two advantages, and the new generation can know about it.
In terms of dangers, India is a country of geographical and climate variety.
This country has witnessed many disasters such as natural and chemical accidents and commercial accidents.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority, i.e., stands in front of the dangers in the NDMA country.
ANDMA is soon coming to the rescue operations in various accidents like earthquake, flooding, sweeping, soiling.
Till two-three years ago, due to heat-heat wave, thousands of people lost their lives every year.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat decreased to almost 220.
If we give precautions to safety, we can get protection.
There are innumerable people doing such acts in the society, social organizations, aware citizens, and I appreciate all those who have reached the rescuers within minutes when there is a danger.
The number of such heroes is not less.
Our Fire and Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, armed forces, Paramilitary Forces, etc. reach the dangers, and they help people without serving their lives.
We need to keep a society that is aware of the danger.
In our culture, we look forward to values, talk of security values, but we have to understand the values of security.
We have to turn it into part of our life.
In our normal life, we travel hundreds of times in the plane, and we see that Air Hostess initially warns of security.
We must have heard it a hundred times, but if someone takes us to the plane and tell us where every thing is, how should you use life jacket
So we don't think we're listening to our ears on the plane, but we don't even think these warnings are with me.
That's what happens in every field of life.
We shouldn't think that security is for anyone else.
If we're all aware of our safety, we'll be aware of the security of society.
Dear natives, this time with the aim of sweetness in the budget, the West Two Welth of Baghyas gave the villages the importance of West Tu Energy.
The purpose of this goberd treasure plan is to purify the villages, to replace the ruins of the birds and the ruins of the fields of the birds and to produce treasures and energy through which the composta and biogia are transformed.
The number of four-fives in India is highest in the world, where about 300 million four-folds and their juice production is about 3 million tonnes per day.
Under the scheme of Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, this thing has also been progressing.
Gobardhan will benefit in rural areas, helping to keep the village clean.
Make yourself a collaborative team and make use of this opportunity... to be part of this birthplace called Clean Energy, Green Job... and come forward to change the monkeys to eliminate the dirt of your village.
My dear natives, so far we have heard about music festivals, food festivals, film festivals and other festivals.
But as a unique garden in Raipur in Chhattisgarh the first Chauru Mahotsav of the state was held .
The purpose of this festival organized by Raipur city was to make aware of the purity of the city's dirt and to make it aware of the strange methods of bringing the chalk back.
During this festival various programs were organized , in which the elderly people participated .
Various festivals have been organized in other districts with inspiration from Raipur program .
Everyone shared the new ideas of purity by doing everything in their own way, discussing and telling poems.
The importance of nutrition and purity was presented in this festival in a very new way , in which people from Raipur city , Chhattisgarh , the government and rulers of Chhattisgarh enjoy greetings to everyone .
Every year, on 8th March, the International Women's Day is celebrated.
A lot of programs are organized in our country and around the world.
On this day, the nation's power gives priesthood and respects those who have done instruction in different fields.
Today the country is moving towards the development of women through women's development.
I remember Swami Vivekananda's words.
He said, "The idea of perfect woman is completely free, and Swamiji's opinion, which was pursued twenty-twenty years ago, appears to be a sense of women's power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure partnership with women in all areas of social and economic life, which is our responsibility and responsibility.
We are part of the tradition recognized in the name of men, Yasoda-Nandan, Kausilya-Nandan and Gandhari-boys.
Today our woman's strength shows her self-confidence and self-confidence through her activity.
With they advanced themselves, they carried forward the country and society and carried it to a new goal.
Our new India is supposed to be one of the most powerful, equitable, simultaneous partners in the entire development of the country.
There can be many examples of what women's power can do, such stories that inspire life to look around.
I know something from Jharkhand.
According to Swachh Bharat Yojana, 15 lakh women in Jharkhand don't think that these numbers are not very low - 15 lakh women have been involved and enforced purity for one month.
These women in Jharkhand show that the purity of purity and culture can be converted into a common man's nature.
Brothers, two days ago, in the three villages of Eliphanta Island, we saw that freedom was a 70-year-old medical man, so that the people there were so happy.
You know that Elephanta island is in the sea ten kilometres away from Mumbai .
This is a very attractive center of tourism .
I appreciate the government and the people there.
I'm glad that the villages of Eliphenta and the caves there will see the light of electricity.
This is not just a medication, but a new beginning of development.
Let the light grow in the life of the people, let the life be happy... and the moment that makes more happy and excited.
Dear neighbors, we celebrated Shivaratri last day.
Now, for the month of March, it's time to give rich farmlands and sweet sweet pomegranates, golden and sweet pomegranates to the heart.
And because of Holi celebrations this month, it's a favorite month for everyone.
On March 2, everyone will celebrate Holi with Harsholas.
My dear people, thank you very much, Namaskar.
Man Ki Bath 2018
For the first time in history the rulers of 10 states participate in this festival .
The memory of Kalpana Chaula, who has traveled to the heavens, is on the one hand of February 1.
Though they rooted us in the danger of the Columbia specific port, they went to the world's millions of young men.
The loss of Kalpana Chaula at such a young age is a sad thing for us all.
It is very pleased to see these women in India swiftly snatch in every field and glorify the pride of the nation.
In the ancient times, the honors of women in our country, the place they have in society, their contributions are astonished all over the world.
There is a long traditional of Indian scholars.
Now, we'll talk about Bie Bachao, Bie Patho.
So, in the ancient times, Rachakpe says in the Skandapuran: Dussehra, Samania, Dussehpuran worker, that's good, that's good.
I mean, a daughter is equal to ten sons, you'll get the merit from ten sons in a woman.
It shows the importance of women in our society.
That's why women have been given the power status in our society.
Get this woman's strength in the shadow of unity to the whole country, the whole community.
Despite the devotion and devotion of Lapamudra, Gargi, Maitrei and Akamahadevi and Meerabai, the ruler of Ahalyabai Holkar, but the patience of Rani Laxmibai, the woman's strength will inspire us.
Give rise to the glory of the country, Mr.
The light tripartite has given many examples.
He writes that the adventurous minister of our patriotism, built by Sitharaman, is an inspirational flying flight in Sukhoi 30.
Under the leadership of Vartika Josi, he wrote about the world's surroundings in INSV Tharini, women members of the Indian Civil Service.
Three brave women, imagination, mohana sing, she's a pilot of the Chaturvedic warfare and she'll be training in Sukhoi 30.
The women, under the leadership of Damascus Vajpayee, proudly prophesy in Delhi to San Francisco in America and in Delhi and in Air India's Boeing Jet.
Everybody must remember women...
These women with eyes - the first female merchant navy captain , first female train driver , first female fire driver , first female bus driver , first female bus driver , first woman in Antarctica , first woman , first woman in Everest , in all such areas , the first woman captured in our women 's power society ' s genuineness and absorbed an abnormal eye .
They've waited for a new route to cover all obstacles and all responsibilities on the strength of hardship, conscious activity, vision, either.
Not only their equivalent people, but also the generation is a path to inspiration.
They fill a new enthusiasm and motivation.
Let's make a book about these women who have our eyes... through which all the people of the country have to know about this woman's strength, inspire you and their works.
This is available for e-books in Norendra Modi Web site.
In the active changes in this country and society, women's power has a great contribution.
Let us tell you about a railway station when we talk about women's power.
The railway station and the women's powerfulness... you'll think of what's with them.
The Mauga station of Mumbai is the first station of India with all workers .
Perfection is a form of sufficiency.
Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh is a region of Maoism .
Hymsa, attacks, bombs, guns and pistols... are a terrible atmosphere that the Maoists built there.
In such a terrible area, tribal women run e-o-orixa and get themselves sufficient.
For a very short time, a lot of women are in touch with it.
With all this, it will give strength to environmental protection.
The district administration has played an important part in the victory of these women until the Grands are provided.
For centuries, our society continues to individually and socially attempt against social misconduct and evil.
A few days ago, there was a beginning in Bihar.
In the state, the world's largest mankind has been set up in a length of thirty-three thousand kilometers to separate social evils.
This sword woke up the social testimony against the evils of childhood and women's community.
The state simultaneously demonstrated to fight women and children's evils.
The young men, mothers, sisters, and all of the elders, enthusiastic and enthusiastic, have themselves participated in this war.
In the historical Gandhi Maidan of Patna , the humanitarian state , which has begun , is unlikely to be supplied to the border of the state .
Everyone in the society needs to be free from the society's misconceptions.
Come on, let us enjoin together to salvage society in the mischief, make a new India, strong and powerful India.
Before him, the Prime Minister doesn't know about the drug system.
When the public knew about the medicinal plan, where you started buying trees, the cost of the trees decreased by 75 percent.
For the last few days, a lot of people have been writing to me about it.
The objective behind this plan is to increase the livelihood of anybody's health care.
The trees found at the genitals are sold here from 50 percent to 90 percent less than the trees of brandady .
That's why we get very good trees at a low price.
This country has more than three thousand public medicine centers established .
Not only do you get the price of the trees, but those who want to find personal employment would have a new job.
Reduced trees are available at the Prime Minister Indian Geologist Centres and hospitals 'Amrit' stores.
The only purpose of all this is to provide a health care to the poor people in the territories of the country, and to create a healthy India.
My dear natives, there is a foo shower in the Sri Mangesh 'Narendramodi Ap' in Maharashtra.
According to ' Swachh Bharat Abhyan ' the citizens of Akola , I know that purification of Morna river has been arranged before purification .
The Morna river flows for twelve months before, and Ali flows only in the rainy season.
The river is full of leopards and palms, painful.
The river and its shores will drag the dirt.
On January 13, a day before the Makar Sankranti, the two sides of the Mornan river were cleaned at four kilometres in the first floor of Mission Clean Morna.
In this plan of Mission Clean Morna, more than four thousand people from Akola, more than a hundred governmental institutions, college students, daughters, elders, mothers and sisters, all shared it.
On 20th January, 2018, and the purity of this purity... and the Morna river is completely dirty... ..What's the program going on every Saturday morning
If someone comes out to do something, it's not impossible to show it.
Big changes can be brought through the genitals.
Congratulate all the people of Akola and the district administration and the Christian rulers of the country to make this work public, and your effort will inspire other people of the country.
Princes, you'll be listening to the pedestrians these days.
There must be reports on the papers and TVs.
It's a regular thing to give the Padma priests every year, but for the last three years, it's already known.
Let's invite someone to this citizen.
Because of all the activity being done through olive it has a supplementary v .
In a way, the election process for these ancestors is completely changed.
Generally, in the cities, in the papers, in the TV, be given to those who don't see at the meetings.
Aravind Gupta's priest Kyi was the only one.
You'll be glad if I'm a student of IID Kapur... and you'll be happy if you give life to these Aravindan ku's sports.
He's been making sports with things that are left to increase the scientific significance in the well for four decades.
He tries to inspire a scientific experiment with things that leave the kids without use.
For this, inspire cinema 'Ki Ku' in 18 languages that have been made in schools for 3000 people.
Surprising life, surprisingly dedicate.
A story like this is the Sitawa Jodhi of Karnataka.
Don't just tell the goddess of women's power.
For the last three decades, they made a great contribution to changing the lives of innumerable women in the Balgava.
When they were seven years old, they dedicated themselves to goddesses... to give life only for the good of the Peeth goddesses.
Not only that, it worked unprecedented for women's goodness.
Because of this interest, it is not the world's honor.
In countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy, there are pictures of this.
Identify the reflection of Majju Shayam, who came to India abroad, gave him padmasri.
The story of the tribal woman Laxmiki of Kerala will be surprising to bathe you in your heart .
Laxmiki lives in a place where the rocks live, and live in the dwellings of the tribal territory in Pudika.
Build a hundred green trees on your memory.
It's very important to make a caterpillar.
Lakshmiji continues to serve society through her own knowledge of greenery.
The country has been honored with Padmashree to recognize this personality of the world as a part of society.
At the age of 23, her husband died without the treatment, inspired to build a hospital for the poor.
Built by their hardships, thousands of poor people can be treated freely in the hospital.
Perhaps in schools, call them in colleges and listen to their experiences.
Some of the efforts of the community must be made more than the ancestors.
People, we'll celebrate the Indian day every year on 9th January.
On 9th January, Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in South Africa.
This day, we will celebrate an unpleasant relationship with Indians in India and in the world.
This year we arranged a program on the immigration Indian day, in which the world invited different parlors and mayors in India.
In that program, you participated in many countries including Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Brien, Surinam, South Africa, America and the Indian-class mayors and parliament members.
Stay in different countries, with the people of different countries in India who served those nations, they would continue to have their strong connection with India, and I am happy to have the European Union sent me a artist.
Our Indian people live in different countries of Europe - some work with the cyber security, some dedicate to the Ayurveda, some poems by their music.
On 30th January we all have a new way to remember the priest's father-in-law.
We shall be a witness day, and we shall offer honors to the greatest martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the kingdom.
They're not just principles.
Please, guys, let me finish my words with your pleasures of 2018.
Man Ki Baath, December 2017
This is the last year of Manki Bath, the last day of 2017.
I shared a lot of things this year.
It'll change a few hours later, but it'll continue to share our ideas.
On the occasion of Christ, Jesus reminds us of the great lessons given by Jesus Christ, and Jesus gave great importance to the experience of service.
We've seen the symptoms of service in Bible.
Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramahamsar used to say, "Life should be done with sensitivity."
The unusual life of Guru Govind Singhji's courage and excitement is inspiration for us.
In this attempt, he had to lose many things personally.
It was very lucky for me to participate in the light festival organised in Patna Saheb at the time of the ninth victory of Guru Govind Singh in the beginning of this year .
We can decide with our mind that learning lessons from the great lessons taught by Guru Gobind Singh and the inspirational life.
January 1, 2018, that means tomorrow...
Tomorrow is a special day for me.
But when I tell you what is special, I repeat that it's really special.
The Indian democracy welcomes the voters of the twenty-fourth voter.
This India is encouraging you to welcome the voter of the 20th century.
You'll be proud of being a voter of the twentieth century.
Your vote will be based on freshness.
The strength of the vote is the greatest power in democracy.
Voting is one of the most powerful changes in the life of millions of people.
You just don't have the right to vote.
How India should be in the twentieth century, what your dream about India in the twentieth century, you can also be the kingdom of the twentieth century.
The youth of the newborn are the pattern of excitement, excitement and energy.
The dream of the newborn is witnessed by our energetic, efficient and powerful youth.
When we talk about new India, it is about free India from caste, classity, terrorism and corruption poison.
India free from dirt and poverty.
Everybody gets the same opportunity, the new wealth that fulfils everyone's confusion.
Peace and unity and harmony are the powers that lead us.
My newborn young men must imagine how new weight will come forward.
How can we testify our visions before 2022
How can India make us like our freedom fighters dream
Mahatma Gandhi turned the freedom struggle into a birthplace.
My young friends, we need to organize a nation to create a grand and divine India of the twentieth century.
The productivity of development, the rise of progress, the productivity of India for powerful and powerful.
Today many opportunities have been opened for the youth.
Our young men are coming forward and succeeding in new buildings and industrial missions from nepotism.
I want to think about the plans to open such occasions, how the young people of this newborn can get at one place, and when they are 18, they want to know about this world and these plans, and make a system that can be achieved.
Nothing can be impossible for a person full of universal thinking and enthusiasm.
There's a saying in English, Pesimism Leads to Weekness, Optimism to Power.
Coming comments and reactions were really encouraging.
It was very comfortable.
Some people shared the events that have adversely influenced their minds.
Some shared their personal achievements.
My name is Fish Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket 1, Face 1, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyothi Rajendra Wade.
I'm speaking from a place called Bodel.
According to my husband's instructions, the insurance premium amount was one rupee per month.
He died in danger.
So we know what our situation is.
My name is happy Jadhav.
Our different villages are going through the National Highway since 2017.
My name is Satis Bawani.
There was a shortage of water in our area, and for the last 40 years we had been depending on the pipelines of the soldiers.
Now put a pipline...
It was our biggest achievement in 2017.
There are many who do things like this on their own heads in the way there are positive changes in people's life.
It's the new wealth that really makes us all together.
Next day I could know about the story of Bashir Khan Khan Khatak's inspiring stories on the front floor of the Administrative Service from Kashmir.
He went to the Kashmir Administrative Service examination to get rid of the poison of terrorism and hate.
You wonder if the terrorists burnt his pilgrimage in 1990.
His family had to leave their traditional land and repeat as much as terrorism and ice.
He chose a different way for himself and served the people.
To escape from the opposite situations, the story of victory was struck by itself.
Today, he is not only in Jammu and Kashmir but also inspired by the youth throughout the country.
Anjum has also proven that the environment is evil, however, will be unsuccessful with the universal steps of despair.
Last week I had a chance to see some girls in Jammu and Kashmir.
Excited, excited, energy was, dreamed, sure.
I've been inspired for the time I spent with those children.
This is the strength of the country, these are my young men, and I felt the future of my country.
My dear neighbors, it is natural to talk about the Shabarimala temple of Kerala while discussing not only my country but also the famous religious places in the world.
In this world famous temple thousands of devotees reach every year to get the pleasure of Lord Ayyapp Swami .
The more devotees come, how big challenge can it be to keep the dirty place in such an important place
If the mountains and the jungles are the regions, are you specially told
A police officer named Vijayan started a program called Purnia Building, which has started a career of awareness about the manufacturing of dirt.
Any devotee has made a habit that the journey cannot be completed without any physical effort in the matter of purity.
There's no bigger in this advance, no smaller.
Every devotee is a part of the worship of God and keeps away for some time, works, works to remove the dirt.
Every morning the scene of dirt is surprising, all the shrines are participants in it.
Whatever big celebrity, however rich, however big officer, everyone will be involved in the programme of purification like ordinary devotees, proceeding with purification.
There are many such examples before us.
In Shabarimala , at such a purity , the worship of the Puranas becomes part of the pilgrimage of all the devotees .
The surety of purity is simultaneously moving there with a severe wound.
On October 2, 2014, we took a vision to the birth anniversary of Bapuji, my dear natives, to complete the incomplete sacrifice of the priest Bapuji as self-sufficient and impoverished.
Bapuji spent his whole life trying to do this for one thing.
In rural areas and urban areas, there has been a widespread change in the cooperation of the people.
The world's largest cleaner survey will be conducted in 2018 between January 4 and March 10, to assess the achievement of the quality of purity in urban areas.
More than four and a half of these cities will be held among the people.
We'll talk to the citizens and know their response.
The use of the Swachhta App and the renewal of various services.
To change the purity of the city into the nature of the people, it will be observed whether all the systems that do not change the nature of the city have been built in the city.
Don't let the government do it.
All citizens and citizens' organizations have great responsibility.
I'm advising all the people to take part in the voluntary service that runs in the coming days.
Don't go back to your city, try to keep your streets and villages behind.
Based on this survey, cities will be ranked - if your city is more than one lakh people, in Ranging in the country, if there are more than one lakh population, it is your dream to get the highest place in local ranking, you should try it.
Come on, let's remind Bapuji of the best gardens with the sight of clean India once more.
My beloved natives, some things may look very small, but as a society, have a far-reaching impact on our personality.
Today, I want to share something like this with you in Manki Bath's program.
For decades, Muslim women were getting injustice, but nobody talked about it.
There is no such law in many Islamic countries.
But the Muslim women in India had no right to go to Haj without men.
I have instructed the Ministry of Newspapers to ensure that all the women who are asking to go alone will be allowed to go to Haj.
I'm supposed to be denying the Haj pilgrimage, and give them a chance to deny the women who want to leave alone.
India's development journey has progressed on the strength of our women's strength, on the basis of their revenge.
I'm convinced that our women and men will get equal rights and equal opportunities... and our constant effort to move together on the path of progress.
My dear neighbors, January 26 is a historic celebration for us.
But this will be remembered on 26 January 2018.
This year, the leaders from ten Asian countries will come to India as chief tribes for Republic Day celebrations.
It's not one time in Republic, it's 10 mainstreams.
It's never happened in India's history.
2017 was special for Asian countries and India.
Asian finished 50 years, in 2017, India's alliance with Asia was 25 years.
In January 26, we're proud of all Indians, together with these great leaders from 10 countries in the world.
Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals, in a way our country is the country of festivals.
It's not even a day that doesn't belong to the festival.
We've just celebrated Christmas, we're going to come here for a new year.
Let us bring you happiness, happiness and prosperity to the new year.
We can move forward with new enthusiasm, new enthusiasm, happiness and new perspective, lead the country.
It's time for the sun to go to Uttaranchal in January, this month, Makar Sankranti is celebrated.
This is a celebration of nature.
In Rajasthan, it will be called Sankranth, Magh-Bihu in Assam and all the festivals in Tamil Nadu are special in its own way and they have their own importance.
All these festivals are celebrated between 13 January and 17 January.
The names of these festivals are different, but the basic elements are the same.
New Year 2018's many wishes once more.
Thank you very much, dear people.
Man Ki Batt, September 2019
They're greater than us at the age, they're witnesses every step in the country and every age.
Before I left for a foreign trip, I got a chance to talk to Sister on the phone.
It was a lovely conversation with the brother-in-law.
I don't usually tell you about personal conversations like this.
Modiji- Latadi, Pranama.
I'm Narendra Modi.
Modhiji and Dadi's birthday, many good lucks, enjoy the past.
It is a prayer that Goddess's health will be good, and that we all have the pleasure of God.
Before he went to America, he was calling for the reference to David.
It was very happy to hear Lataji-Modiji's phone coming.
Would you go back to me
Everyone at home...
Lataji - I think it's because of my parents' admiration and the admiration of the stars.
You don't know what you are.
I know that India's picture is changing.
Modiji - Yes.
Modhiji - Mummy is happy with this love of Goddess.
I'm very thankful to Modiji-Diddy always remember me.
Once more, I'm finishing birthdays.
Modiji... when he came to Mumbai this time, it was good to see him.
Modiji, but I won't come late.
Modiji - Come home and eat something from the hand of Deepi .
Lataji, of course.
I think it's lucky.
Modhiji - Pranama Dadi.
Lata ji-Prince.
Modhiji and Didi are good wishes, Lataji - Namaste Namaste
Modiji - Namaste.
My dear people, the time of celebrations with Navaratri has once again come with new enthusiasm, new energy, new zeal and new determinations.
For weeks all over the country will be full of festivals.
Everyone in the family will be together in the festivals.
This is called the darkness of the call.
Perhaps this is not just words in this saying, it is an order for us, a vision, an inspiration.
On one side, when a lot of houses are illuminated, on the other hand, look at the darkness covered in the neighbourhood.
When this darkness is over, it is the real happiness of these festivals when it glitters light.
They find people from the houses of people looking for the needy, sweet and sweet food, and bringing them to them.
This time, can you try to blind down the bottom of the call with the awakening and determination of this season of festivals
The sweetness of the faces of many poor families will double your happiness in festivals, your face will glow more, your lamp will be more light, your lamp will be more bright.
Can we welcome Lakshmi in a new way this time
In our culture, women are considered to be Lakshmi because the women bring luck and prosperity.
And there shall be among us many women that shine the name of their submission, and their wiseness, and the name of the family and society, and of the country.
Can you organise a program to honor these Lakshmis of India on this occasion of Diwali
There are many daughters and daughter-in-laws who do something unusual about us.
Our society recognizes such women and honors them, proud of them.
We'll all propagate this as well as spread across the world, together with 'Selfie with Daughter'.
Likewise, this time Bharat Ki Laxmi's birthplace will be organized.
To promote India's Laxmi, it is to strengthen the path of prosperity between the nation and the nation's people.
My dear people, I have already said that many people who don't know and know me through the Manki Bath program are obviously enjoyed to observe.
A student from Arunachal, somewhere far away from the past day, Alina Tyang gave me a very funny letter.
My country is Roeing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when my results came, people asked me if I read the book named Exam Warriors.
After that, my experience was very good.
If I had read that book before the exam, I would have been very good.
And this little friend has given me a job.
But I have a request that you can help me.
I must read all this.
I'm sure I'll try to write in my words my own way.
I thank this little girl from Arunachal, student Alina Tyang once more.
Look.
This time, as he discussed the victory of the US Opinion, Ronner of Daniel Medev's speech was discussed, and social media was well known.
I also saw that speech, playing.
At Dan, 23, Madwedev's significance and his pride attracted everyone.
Surely it attracted me.
Shortly before this speech, he failed 19 times to Grand Slam Jetha and Raphael Nadal, the Historian of Tennis.
If there were others on this occasion, they would have been depressed and disappointed.
The visions of his words were welcomed with Harsharava.
He praised Nadal, a charming man in Dan, how Nadal inspired millions of young men to play tennis, and told him how difficult it was to play.
The joy of the man who failed in the same game was to see the joy of victory.
If you don't hear the words of Dan Medvedev, you must see the video, especially those young men, to tell me.
There is a lot of time to learn people from all sections of the population, and the great moments of the kingdoms.
The kingdoms are not very good.
Life is worthy.
In our country's sciences, it has been very beautiful.
The thinking of our ancestors is surely greeting.
It is said in the rituals that if Vidya Vinaya pattern Haratina Chethamsi Kasya Manujasya Manujasya Manujya Mani Ganjana is the world's fascinating thing that comes together in a person with efficiency and humility, the minds of a person cannot win.
In fact, this young player won the minds of the world.
My dear people, especially young friends, for your goodness, I'm going to tell you.
There will be debates, sides and opponents, but it will be beneficial to stop things before they grow up.
If it's too big, it's too difficult to stop some things if it's expanded.
But in the beginning, if we stop it from being very careful, we'll keep watching.
The habit of not getting rid of the intoxication of smoking is due to its nicote.
Eating this in childhood affects the growth of brain .
But today I want to tell you about a new thing.
You may know that e-cigarettes were blocked in India next time.
E-cigarettes are different from normal cigarettes, a type of electronic substance.
In e-cigarette a kind of chemical smoke occurs when the nucleus present in the e-cigarette is hot .
Like other cigarettes , smelling chemicals are mixed in it to avoid smelling from it .
Even if his father is a chicken smoker at home, he's trying to prevent others from smoking, and the children don't want to have a habit of drinking cigarettes and beedi.
He doesn't want to smoke at home or cigarettes.
He knows that smoking and smoking have a great impact on the body.
But the e-cigarette is completely different.
People don't even know about e-cigarettes.
It's very unaware of the danger, so sometimes it gets the e-cigarette to the house just like a curiosity.
You know if someone smokes near us, we can know it with smell.
Her pocket is cigarette packed, but she can know it with smell.
But the e-cigarette doesn't matter, so many children and young people seem to be rotating in the middle of their books, in office, in the pocket, sometimes in their hands, as fascinating as fascinating.
It's the future of the country.
This new method of intoxication prevents the e-cigarette country from spreading roots in the society, not to ruin the dreams of the family, not to ruin the lives of the children.
I request everyone to leave the habit of smoking and not to be wrong about e-cigarette.
You remember Fit India, right
If we go to Gym for two hours in the morning and evening, it doesn't mean Fit India.
Stay away from it for fit India.
Our Indo-Ba, our country is a brilliant desert.
Many human beings are on the ground.
India was the birthplace of such unusual people, the land of Karma.
They are dedicated to others, not for themselves.
That's a magnificence being honored on October 13 in the city of Vatican.
This is a matter of pride for all Indians, and Pope Francis will call Maria Tresya to be holy on October 13.
Sister Marion Tresya is an example of the activity of human life in the 50 years of their narrow life.
My dear people, now we celebrate Gandhi 150, and the whole world is proud that 130 million people have been able to get rid of the plastic used once.
India is looking forward to the world in terms of environmental protection, so the whole world's look is now close to India.
I'm very sure you're gonna be part of the generating generosity to get rid of the only application plastic on October 2.
People in each place share their share in this three.
But a young man in our country has made a different move.
When I turned my attention to his work, I called him and tried to know and understand his new way.
He said it would be useful for the nation and the people.
Mr.
When I heard the first plugging word, it was a new word.
Perhaps this word can be used a little overseas.
But in India Riputman Dalvi gave it a big deal.
Come on, let's talk to him.
If 130 million people put a foot on this, only once our country will move 130 million feet in accordance with the evacuation of the one-sided plastic.
Repudaman ji, thank you so many times.
Well, your team and this new imagination have many good wishes.
I'm gonna remind you of something.
But it's time for some to start training, and some programs take time to plan.
My dear people, on August 15, I told you to go to 15 places in India on 2022, you will remember.
Make a plan to stay at least one night or two nights in 15 places.
You see India, understand, feel it.
Dear people, you're once more enjoying the joys of different festivals of India with diversity.
Yes.
On the occasion of Deepawali, it should be kept in mind whether people are to be punished and ruined.
That's what you want to care about.
With enthusiasm, we can celebrate festivals with new dreams and new visions.
I'm so glad once more.
Man Ki Baath, November 2017
My dear natives are blessed.
Some time ago, I got a chance to meet the children of Karnataka indirectly.
They asked the children to write letters to the Prime Minister of the country in a program organized by the Times Group's Vijay Karnataka daily.
And they published the letters they chosen.
I'm glad to read those letters.
These little children also know the problems of the country.
They know about the churches in the country.
Kirti Hegde... Digital India and Smart City plans from Northern Canada, the child says that we have to change our teachings... and nowadays children don't like classroom reading, and they don't like to know about nature.
If we give children information about nature, perhaps it would be very good in the future to protect the environment.
From the place named Laxmeshwar, a girl named Reda Nadaf is proud of her being a daughter of a soldier.
Be an Indian who is not proud of our soldiers.
And it's natural to be proud if the soldier's daughter is too.
Irfan Baigam from Calburgi wrote that the school is 5 kilometers away from the house, so it has to get out of the house early and it's late to return home.
That's why I can't spend time with my friends.
But I love the papers that I wanted to bring the letters to me, so I could read the letters.
I felt it was a good experience.
Dear people, it's 2611 today.
On 26th of November is our constitution day.
This is the day in 1949 the Construction Council accepted the Indian constitution.
On 26 January 1950, the constitution came to light, so we celebrate that day as Republic Day.
India's constitution is the soul of our democracy.
Today is the day to remember the members of the Construction Council.
They ruled for almost three years to build the Indian constitution.
It will be proud of those who read about this church who have been dedicated to the nation.
Can we imagine how hard they worked to build the structure of our country with diversity
When the country gets rid of the clutches of slavery, they'll have to show how much of their viability, longevity.
It's not a spectacular life, it's not a matter of nature.
Everybody's equality and compassion with everyone is the face of our constitution.
It is our duty to retain the constitution literally.
Even if it's a citizen, it's a ruler, it's gonna go ahead with the imagination of the constitution.
The message of our constitution is that nobody should suffer from any kind of damage.
17 different committees were formed based on the important topics of this Council of Reforms.
Baba Saheb was the head of the drafting committee of the Ambedkar administration.
He was a great part of it.
On December 6, on the day of his great devotion, we recall him as usual.
Baba Saheb's contribution to making the country rich and strong is unforgettable.
December 15, Sardar Vallabhbhai is the sacred day of Patil.
Sardar Patel became a peasant of the country from the artistic son, and he performed a very unusual act of cutting the country into a clutches.
Sardar Sahab was a member of the Construction Council.
He was the head of the Councils of Advisers for the basic rights, moral rights, the welfare of the new birds and tribals.
The poor men, the police and the security personnel, remember the others who lost their lives and beat them.
This country will never forget their sacrifice.
Terrorism today has been making a immense appearance everywhere in the world, in a way.
We have been suffering from terrorism in India for the last 40 years.
Thousands of innocent people lost their lives.
Terrorism has challenged glory.
This is the land that Lord Buddha , Lord Mahavir , Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi gave the message of Ahimsa and love to the world .
Terrorism and insurgency make a terrible attempt to weaken our social relations.
Therefore, it is necessary to be more aware of the human powers.
My beloved natives, we'll celebrate the day of the Navy Day, in December.
You all know that our culture has grown on the banks of the river.
This country has an invaluable relationship with our landscapes.
If we look at history, it was considered as the most powerful nuclear force in the past 800-900 years ago.
In the development of the Cholasam kingdom, they had a great share of their civilian army in making them the timely economic power.
Several examples of chicken navigation and exploration journeys can be seen in sympathy.
Only a few people know that most of the world's civilian forces have been letting women in warfare too late.
But in the Challan Civil Services, even more than 800-900 years ago, a lot of women played a great part.
Women were also involved in the war.
The Chala rulers knew well about the construction of the ship.
When we talk about the civilian army, who can forget the power of the jungle in making a civilian army of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
Konkan coast was in the country of Shivaji Maharaj .
Several forts like Sindhu Durg , Murudjeera , Golden Fort etc . associated with Shivaji Maharaj were sometimes on the sea shore or surrounded by sea .
Maratha was a civilian army waiting for the protection of these forts.
There were big ships and small boats in the Maratha Civil Forces.
Their civilian army was very capable of attacking any enemy and protecting the country from the enemy.
How do we not remember Kanhoji Angre when we remember the Maratha Civil Service
He brought the Maratha civilian army to a new head and made the camps of the Maratha civilian army in many places.
Our Indian civilian army, after independence, appeared in the war of India in 1971, though in the wake of Goa's revolution.
When we talk about the civilian army, the war is sighted, but India's civilian army has been very excited to humanitarian things.
Sumitra's ship immediately helped save the people, and delivered many people from the sea safely to Bangladesh.
This year, when there was a huge flood in Sri Lanka in May-June, three ships of our civilian army immediately reached there and helped the government and the people there.
On November 21, when a businessman was robbed in West Galf, INS reached Trikund for help.
Though we can bring health services to Fuji, we can bring immediate rescue help, our civilians have been proudly proud to the neighboring country, and we are always proud of our security forces and honored.
Whether it is a prisoner or a civilian army... all Indians in the name of our people's patience, patience, honour, honour and sacrifice.
They sacrifice their youth for their country to live quietly for hundreds of thousands of people.
Every year, on December 7, the Russian flag is celebrated.
This is the day of proud of the soldiers of the country and proud of them.
I'm glad this time the Defense Ministry has decided to organize a program from December 1 to 7, to bring information to the people about the soldiers of the country, and to make people aware.
Every week, children and adults must wear a flag.
There must be an instance of respect for the army in the country.
You can call the soldiers in schools and colleges and know the army from them.
Let our new generation change it as a good opportunity to get information about the army.
This opportunity is to give money to all the soldiers of our armed forces.
This money is being used to rehabilitate the families of the soldiers who received the heirs in the war through the military welfare board, to help the injured soldiers.
Let's give us our contribution to their goodness.
I want to say something to our treasury brothers.
Soil is an important part of the Earth.
Everything we eat is connected to this land.
In one way, the food chains are connected to the soil.
Let's just imagine what happens if there's no soil in this world.
I'm afraid of thinking.
We've already thought about it in our culture, so we've been aware of the importance of the earth since ancient times.
On one side of our culture, there is a natural effort to possess the land, soil, devotion and grace, on the other hand, the scientific plans were part of life to keep the earth nutritious.
Two things were important in the life of the treasurers of this country - the devotion to the soil and the scientific care of the soil.
The treasurers of our country are associated with tradition, and we have a feeling of the interests of modern science, that they try and take suitable decisions.
I heard about the farmers of Tehu village in Bord Block of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh .
The yield decreased, so the income decreased, and the productivity of the soil decreased gradually.
Some of the farmers in the village understood the seriousness of this situation and suggested how many chemicals, other animals, microneutrients and biography should be provided at the right time.
You will be surprised to hear what the effects have been effected on the advice of the knowledge obtained from the investigation of the health of the soil .
And also increased the quality of soil.
If you want to think of the yield, the treasurers have started feeling that if you want to think about the geography first and you're ready to look after the geography, the geography will see us as well.
Our workers all over the country have built more than 10 million soil health cards to know and call the soil.
We have devotion to the geography, but do you think it's harmful to the health of the geographer with chemicals like uria
All types of scientific methods have proven that the geography is seriously affected by the use of more than necessary uria.
Would our farmers take a decision for our children of the soil to use the Uria in the field in 2022 when it was 75 years of independence
Agglomeration, climate change, we've all started feeling.
There was a time when the cold begins before Deepavali.
Now, since the beginning of December, the cold is gradually coming down.
The 8-year-old child, without talking, made Visil his weapon.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, he climbed into the village houses, woke up the people and started telling the lessons not to urinate in the open space.
Because of this boy who went to 30-40 houses every day and taught about cleanliness, he was free from excreting from the village of Kumahari.
The little child Tushar has been inspiring to promote purity.
Our divine brothers are definite, capable, courageous.
We'll be able to learn something.
Today they work well everywhere.
Whether it's in the Sports field, or in any competition, our divine people are not behind anybody.
Our divine players won 4 medals in Rio Olympics, and you'll remember the blind's T20 cricket worldwide and champion.
There are various types of competitions all over the country.
Last day the fifteenth national para swimming competition was held in Udaipur .
Our young Divya brothers who came from different parts of the country participated in this and showed their grandeur .
One of them is Giger Tucker from Gujarat, and his body does not have 80 percent of the muscles.
He chose the Sports Authority of India 2020 paralytics as a result of his naiveness.
He is one of the 32 para swimmers who are training in the Central For Excellence of Gandhinagar.
My salute to Gigger Tucker... and I enjoy him.
Today, Diwangar can reach any field, and there's a lot of attention to the opportunity.
We're trying to make everybody capable of the country... to become a society that includes everyone.
Id-e-Milad-Un-Nabi will be celebrated a few days later.
This day the prophet Hazrat Muhammad Saheb was born.
My heart is joyous for all the natives.
It's very good, but I think it's possible to join and change something with this purpose.
The elders in our village will always say.
Forget sorrows, don't forget yourself.
Can't you make your share in this
Come on, let's share good news in Nurrendramodi off, Miziov or social media in Positive India.
I'll remember the events that others are inspiring.
Remembering good things, there's a feeling of doing good.
The energy to do better things.
We can unite the strength and consequences of this united unity.
There'll be a lot of things to say.
Prime Minister, 2017 October 29
In the sixth puja the sun and water are important , but the utensils and pomegranates made of pearls and soil are essentially related to its worship .
In this festival of faith the message of worshipping sunrise and sunset is full of unique culture .
The world will be honored and worshipped.
But the sixth puja gives us a message that supplicates them surely.
The importance of purity in our life is also associated with this festival.
Six times before cleaning the entire house , along with the rivers , lakes , lakes , ponds , shores , worshipping places i . . the cleaning of the gates , people share a lot of enthusiasm .
The festival of sunrise or sixth puja , environmental protection , disease prevention and inclination .
It is natural to feel proud of anybody in this great tradition of India.
You'll be glad to hear that there was so much business in a store in Khadi and Hathri.
During Deepavali, Khadi Gift was recorded at about 680 percent of the sales.
Khadi and his handicrafts have seen about 90 percent increase this year compared to last year.
Today, it sees that young men, women, people of every age love Khad and handloom.
I can imagine how many families, poor families, how many families working in the handloom have benefited.
He says we should remember our brave security forces.
We also think we need to bring sweets to the house.
I once again got the opportunity to celebrate Deepawali with the brave security personnel on the border.
This time Deepawali celebrated with the security personnel at the Gures Centre of Jammu and Kashmir as an unforgettable experience.
The extent to which our security forces see the country directly on the border, and respect all the soldiers of our security forces for the fighting and dedication and excitement of all the locals.
If we get the chance, listen to their proud stories to know the experiences of our people.
Many of us don't know that the soldiers of our security forces are not only in our borders, but also in the world's peace.
They enhance Hindustan's credibility all over the world as a piece of citizenship.
On October 24, the United Nations Day celebrated the United Nations.
Everybody remembers the efforts of the United Nations Council to establish peace in the world and their actual contribution.
We think the Vasudhaiv family, that is, the whole world is our family.
Due to this belief India has been actively participating in various important steps of the Indian Council since the beginning .
India has also given importance to women's supremacy and the declaration of human rights of the United Nations is a living example.
It was suggested at the starting point that all men were born free and equal, as a result of the effort of India's representative Hamsa Meta, the volume was accepted by all human beings as free and equal.
Looks like it doesn't seem to be a terrible change, but it is a healthy thinking.
The greatest contribution to India under the control of United Nations is the peace mission of the United Nations.
India has lived in the peacekeeping missions of the United Nations.
Some of you would be the first to know about this.
More than sixteen thousand Indian security personnel have served in the peace missions of the United Nations.
Now nearly seven thousand soldiers of India are associated with the peace deals of the United States, in which India has the third place in the world.
By August 27, Indian soldiers have served at around 50 missions in the 71 peace facilities of the United Nations.
These missions were in many parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Lavos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Laban, Sudan.
In Congo and South Sudan, more than 20,000 patients were treated at Indian Army hospitals and saved innumerable names.
India's security forces not only saved the people there in different countries, but also conquered their minds through public procedures.
Indian women have already participated in establishing peace.
Many people don't know that India is the first country sent to the women's police team at the United States of peace mission in Libya.
This procedure of India is inspired by nations all over the world.
After that, all the countries started sending their women's police team.
You will wonder if India's share is not merely in sympathy, but that India is giving training to the peace union in nearly 85 countries.
Our deepest peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and George Wise Buddha have sent a message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peace mission procedures are not easy.
The soldiers of our security forces have to work to cross the inaccessible areas.
We'll have to live between different people.
You should know and understand different situations and different cultures.
You must change yourself according to the local needs and conditions.
Who can forget Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria when he remembers our brave Indian peacekeepers today
Remembering him, all Indians will be proud of their chests.
In 1989, at the age of seventeen, he was appointed Operation Fores Commander of Namibia, who served the freedom struggle of the country.
General Timmay, the head of the Indian Army, led the United States peacekeeping in the Cyprus, and enjoyed his best for peace.
India has always been a message of peace, unity and harmony all over the world as peaceful.
We believe that everybody will live with peace and harmony and progress in the creation of a good and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our sacred land was brightened by the glory that served decency freely.
We were one of those strange people who called Bhagni Nivadit.
Even though Margaret Elizabeth Nobel lived in the Ireland, Swami Vivekananda gave them the name of niece.
It is said that the word of injustice was completely dedicated.
Then they dedicated the name to their own name.
Yesterday was the fifth birthday of Sister Nivadita.
They are ready to offer their lives to serve the poor... with the influence of Swami Vivekananda.
In the attacks on the British rule, the mind of Sister Niedity suffered.
The British not only slaves our country, but they tried to make us mentally slaves.
They were constantly trying to create a disappointment between us by showing our culture.
Bhagni reconstructed the pride of Indian culture.
The renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati's daughter-in-law is famous in the name of women's destruction.
It is said to be inspired by Bhagni.
Jagdish Chandrabosu, the great scientist of Bhagini, worked with him.
They helped the research of Boss through articles and conferences.
India's specific beauty is that spirituality and science in our culture are mutually enriched.
Sister Nivadita and Jagadish Chandrabos are the strongest examples of this.
Hundreds of people died when a terrible plate broke out in Kolkata in 1899.
The syster's sensitivity, without considering his health, began the work of purification on the nerves and paths.
Though he could live a good life, Sister, a woman who went out to serve the poor.
Because of their inspiration, people came forward to cooperate with the services.
Thank you for your phone call.
In the childhood celebrated on the birth day of our first Prime Minister Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, many joys are celebrated for all children.
Children are the greatest heroes in the creation of new India, dogs.
Your tendency is that the disease that was already adult, which has been infected on the evening of life, has already started to appear in children.
It is surprising to hear that children are suffering from diabetes .
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are called lifestyle disorders.
The main reason behind the occurrence of such diseases to young people is the deficiency of physical activity in lifestyle like lack of physical activity , changes in food habits .
Society and family must pay attention to this.
If you think about it, you don't need to do anything special.
It's only necessary to make small things accurately, properly, and make them habitual, and make them their own nature.
Instead of the children climbing up and down in the lifts make a stairs and swimming habit .
After dinner, try to walk a little by taking all the children in the family.
Yoga for Young India, Yoga for Youth.
I'm telling you to habit, anybody in the age can do it easily.
It's simple to learn indulging in indulgence... because it can be kept anywhere... and it's simple.
It doesn't need equipments or fields.
There are many studies about how much yoga is doing in controlling diabetes .
We should not see Ayurveda as a medium of treatment and yoga as a part of both life.
My dear neighbors, especially my young friends, took good news from the games in the past.
In different games, our sportsman kicked the country.
In Hockey, India got the crown of Asia Cup hockey through a good game.
Our players played a good game, so India could become Asia cup champions ten years later.
Before that, India received Asia's cap in 2003 and 2007.
The whole team helped them with the support staff and many joys of my natives.
After Hockey, India also listened to the best news in Batminton.
The Batmin Starter Kidmby won the Indians by winning the open crown of Denmar with the best play.
After the Indonesian Open and the Australian Open, Super Seris is the premier crown.
I thank our young friends for this achievement and enriching India's proudness.
Friends, this month's FFA Andre 17 World Cup matches.
Teams from all over the world came to India and everybody showed their grandeur in the Footbol field.
I also had a chance to see a game.
The players and visions were very excited.
World cup matches were successful, all teams watched their best games.
Not to get the crown of India, but the young sportsman of India's handled everyone's mind.
The whole world enjoyed the festival of this game, including India, the tournament was very attractive and charming for Footbol lovers.
Footbol's future is beginning to see the signal.
I once again congratulate all the players, all those who worked with them, and all the jokes, and enjoy good wishes.
Some send pictures of small children's missions, some of them will be the story of a young man's hard work.
There, the team of a government organization called Ecological Protector Organisation -LRB- Ecologist Rescue Institute -RRB- went out to clean Chandrapur fort.
In this twenty-four-day work, people continued to clean up a group in the fort as a man without being tired.
I am surprised to see the picture, and to hear the disappointed and disappointed people who are dreaming of being disappointed and purity, seeing the hypocrisy of the surroundings, the youth of Organisation, their sweat, their swimming, their vision, in those activated images.
Your disappointment, faith, if you see it.
This purity of purity is a miraculous example of beauty and enrichment and humility.
My dear countrymen, on 4 November, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
By eating together, the minds of the people became hypocrisy of unity and equality.
Guru Nanak Devji gave three messages to a simple life - the name of the universal, the name of the universal, the help of the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev wanted to tell him.
In the coming 2019, we're going to celebrate the 550th year of Guru Nanak Dev.
Come on, let's try to move through the path of his message and his teachings.
My dear neighbors, on October 31, after two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We all know that he's slapped up for modern intellectuals.
We can learn a lot by traveling through the unusual life of that great son of India.
His patience was to bring thoughts to work.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was supposed to be working to put India in a rock.
He promised to bring millions of Indians under the guise of a nation, a constitution.
He gave the ability to take a firm decision to overcome all the obstacles.
He determined a goal, proceeded firmly to that goal, proceeding.
He could have done this thing to unite the country.
Everyone was a nation equal to him in his simplicity.
I always want to tell us that Sardar's grandfather Paul told us that he was inspiring.
"This words of Sardar Sab are still inspired and distractive to our new India."
That's why his birthday is celebrated as a national unity day.
I'm supposed to ask you to participate in this festival of mutual affection called Run for Unity.
My dear natives, after Deepawali's holidays, with new imagination, you'll resume everyday life.
All the people of the country take good wishes to witness their dreams.
Three years have been completed by starting the 'Man Ki Baath' program that you know through the sky.
Today is 30th episode.
When I talk to Manki Baath, I can only tell those who send their minds from all the corners of the country, but I get a full treasure.
Mostly I'm inspiring.
Some of the things are about making changes in the government matters.
Sometimes there may be personal complaints, sometimes it attracts attention to social problems.
When I say "Man Ki Baath", I remind you of what I told Acharya Vinoba Bhavya.
Today, three years later, I know that social scientists, artists, researchers and media experts will think of it.
I'm sure this church will be more useful in the future than Manki Baath, which will get a new chain and a new energy.
Manki Bath said that we should take as much as we need to eat and don't waste it.
But the letters came from every corner of the country, from social organizations, youth, that they had done this before.
After that, how many people came forward to do such things for purity.
And not only in India, the world's 'Self-Twith-Doter' program has become a major setback.
This is not just a social media problem.
Every woman has become a new self-esteem and a new proud event.
All parents began to take their daughter's papa selfie.
All females began to feel that you have importance, importance.
Last day I was discussing with the Central Tourism Department...
I told those who went out to tourism wherever they went, they wanted to contact India and send photos.
Millions of photographs and pictures of all the corners of weight have been a great privilege for those working in a tourist sector.
I realized that Men's Bathy was creating a little bigger event.
When you've been three years old, the events of the last three years appeared to be charming.
The country is progressing through the right path.
It's a big source for any country, it's a great power.
I'm sorry to the people.
Once I told Khadiya in Manki Baat, Khaddi was not a dress, but an ideal.
Girls, swords, swords, swords... seem to enhance young people's interest in the tail.
Khadhi's price has increased, so poverty's house is directly connected to employment.
Khadik rebates from October 2, and gets very cheap.
This will give strength to poverty in our country, we have to do it.
Because of the increase in the interest of Khadi, the people working in the Khadi area have increased their enthusiasm to think in a new way in the tail, which are associated with Khadi in the government.
How can we bring new techniques, how can we increase productivity, how can we bring solar-catherie
The ancient pilgrimage has been damaged for 20, 25, 30 years... to think of how to revive it.
We've been involved in a variety of work.
Many people got job opportunities.
The Khadi village department in Pampore, Kashmir, revived its training department, which is very much in Kashmir to contribute to this area.
With the resumption of this training centre, the new generation will be helpful in creating new products for making new designs.
Ordinary people and others have begun to give khadi products as gifts.
We can directly realise how a thing is naturally encouraged.
My dear neighbors, we all decided in Manki Batt last month that we will celebrate the purity festival all over the country for fifteen days before Gandhi Jayanti.
It was said that it would be associated with the people through purity.
Our respected president started this, and the country joined it.
The elderly people, men and women, cities and villages, are now part of the pure faith.
I thank the honorary president.
People from all sections of the country have considered this as their business, all are connected to it.
Whether the Spargangas is in the field, the people in the field of films, the school, the school, the colleges, the university, the treasurers, the workers, the staff, the government workers, the police, the soldiers, the soldiers.
A change has been made in public places to prevent others from being polluted, where working people have begun to feel some pressure.
It's a good thing I think that in the first four days of the launch of 'Peace Service', more than 75 lakh people have joined me with the activity of more than fourteen thousand starts.
This time, we're cleaning one place, and others care not to be aware...
But if purity is to be a habit, it must be changed as a desperate.
This time with the name of ' purifying service ' the fish also took place .
More than two and a half children attended the article of purity.
Thousands of children brought colorful pictures.
I don't forget to thank the media workers when you come to purity.
They pursued this birth very purely.
They merged with them in their own way and gave them a lot of contribution in creating a psychological environment.
A few days ago somebody paid attention to the work of 18-year-old Bilal Dar in Srinagar.
Mr. Srinagar has abandoned Bilal Dar for the purity of his brand Ambassador, when you think he'll be a hero in the Sparsus field.
On seeing plastic, polythene, utensils and other chickens, Billal removes it and makes a little income.
Billi's copper ration gave a car, uniform, and he went to other places to tell people the lessons of purity, inspire them to stay after it until they see the results.
He is inspired by all those who are interested in the purity of Billard's age.
I appreciate Bill Dar.
O dear natives, we must acknowledge that the history of the future is born in the uterus of history, and it is natural for me to remember the great men when I speak of history.
This October is the second month we remember many great men.
Twenty-twenty-twentieth centuries, Dipmaeki, who led us to the way, has been in front of us in October this month from Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, who has suffered many problems for the country.
This is also the centuries of Nanaji and Dinadaljisa.
What was the central point of all these great men
There was a common thing - live for the country, do something for the country...
Not only did Gandhiji, Jayaprakashji and Dinadayalji showed their lives, but they lived with life, worked for them...
Dindayal used to tell the superintendent and Mahatma Gandhi about the man standing in the last end of the society.
Sardar Sab united the country.
We have to run for unity and take the unity forward.
Understand the diversity of this India, touch it, feel its aroma.
You'll see these diversities of our country working as a big school to develop your personality.
On the day of the holiday, on the day of Diwali... we have the habit of traveling somewhere in the country.
Tourists' journey is natural.
But we don't see our country, we don't know the varieties of the country, but it's a matter of concern that we've started traveling abroad in accordance with the impact of color.
The people of western India don't know what is in India.
How many varieties of our country is full of
If Mahatma Gandhi, the world leader, Swami Vivekanandan and our former President Abdul Kalanji have said that they are inspired by India, then they have a new inspiration to see and understand India and live for them and die.
All these great men traveled in weight.
In the beginning of their activity, they tried to understand and understand India.
I tried to consolidate India.
As a student, can we try to understand our different states, different communities, people, their lifestyles, their traditions, their cultivatories, their food habits to learn their ideas
We don't see the value of tourism just because we don't see it, as a student, knowing it and trying to become part of it.
I'd have a chance to go to more than 500 districts of the country to tell my own experience.
In more than 450 districts, I must have had a chance to stay at night...
Today I am responsible for this in India and the experiences of those journeys are very beneficial for me.
I get a chance to understand things.
I want you to feel that you have experienced the solidarity of this variety of variety of India as a madness, not as a monster of our immense power.
There's a dream of "Ak Bharat Best India".
Food is in many ways .
If you eat all your life every day, you'll never have to repeat.
This is the greatest power of our tourism.
Not only do you want to get out of the house during these holidays, you don't want to get out for a change, go to know, understand something.
Understood India, the diversity of millions of people.
Your life will be more prosperous by these experiences.
The limits of your thinking will be wide.
Who is a greater guru than the experience
Normally the time of journey is from October to March .
People are traveling.
I believe that if you're going this time, you'll take my glory forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share pictures.
Please send a picture about the Hussein Tag incredibledia.
If you can interfere with the people in the surroundings, send photos of it.
Not only the buildings, but the natural beauty, but also the pictures of the life there.
Write a good article about the trip.
Send me to My Govi, send me to the narendramodi office.
I feel that all Indians know about the seven places or seven things that the best seven tourist centers in your state will be able to encourage tourism in India.
If possible, we'll go to the seven places.
Can you give some information about it
Make films about such good places, create videos, create culmination, encourage them.
You can also get an inspiration from this October to March to encourage tourism .
I invite you to it.
I have a deep impact on my mind.
I'm a man like you.
You must have noticed what happened last day, a great example of women's power and patriotism.
The unusuality of this is that the wealth and wealthy husbands serve the mother of India and sacrifice.
Would we imagine that if we hadn't lived in this young age, then what would be the mind
But Balindani Colonel Ananda Mahadik ' s wife Swati Mahadik directly observed this difficult situation and joined the Indian army .
For 11 months, he learned well and changed his life to testify his husband's dream.
His wife took a firm decision and joined the army.
We can be proud of this maternal power, and it is natural for all people to be honored with these virgins.
I enjoy many good wishes to those two sisters.
They are inspired by the new inspiration and chastisement of millions of people in the country.
Welcome to the two sisters.
Dear natives, there is a great opportunity for our youth camps between the Navaratri festival and Diwali.
Fifa Andre-17 Wald Cup is going on in our country.
I'm sure there's a football blanket around.
Each generation will enhance the interest of Footboll.
My dear neighbors, this is Navaratri.
It's time to worship Durga Bu.
The atmosphere is full of sacred and sacred smell.
All around is the atmosphere of spirituality, festival, devotion.
It is believed to be a festival of energy.
In 2022, when India is 75 years of independence, we can move forward by making a framework for five years to witness the dream of freedom fighters, the determination of hundreds of twenty-five million people, the supremacy of supremacy and vision.
Thank you so much.
Narendra Modi, on 27 August 2017, at 11 a.m. in the morning, the Indian population's special launch through the airways is the Malayalam transformation.
My loved dwellers are honored with blessings.
On one side when the country is drowning in festivals , on the other hand if you hear the news of Himsa from any part of Hindustan then it is natural to have humiliation in the country .
Our country is the country of Buddhism and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who lived for the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have accepted the common genius, Ahimsa, a mutual honor, which is part of our mind.
We've been saying that Ahimsa is a traditional life since childhood.
In the name of faith, I told the Red Fort that it would not allow Himself to believe in religion or political faith or tradition.
Babasaheb Ambedkar has the system of justice for all people in the administration that we have given.
Those who take the law, who cry in the way of himsa, whether it is a person or a society, will never allow this country, and will not allow any government.
Everyone will have to head in front of the law.
The law will determine the responsibility and punish the culprit.
Our country is full of varieties and these varieties are not merely in diet, in lifestyle or intellectuals.
We can see diversity in every head of life.
Our festivals are also diversified.
Because of our cultural heritage of the ancient classes, we can see cultural traditions, seeing social traditions, history events, no day will be celebrated in 365 days.
If we see all our festivals, we can see that there is no festival associated with the time of nature.
Everything is directly connected to nature.
Many of our festivals are connected to the farmers and are directly connected to those who are involved in fishing.
Today, when I talk about festivals, I first want to tell you "Mitchamy Dukadam".
The celebration of 'Santsari' took place yesterday at the Jain community.
In the Jain society the festival of ' tourism ' is held in the month of Bhadra .
The last day of the festival's tourism is the day of the weekend.
It's really a wonderful tradition.
Conversion is a symbol of forgiveness, ahimsa and Mithri.
This is called 'Peaceful Festival,' and this day there is a tradition that has been greeting with each other as 'Mithami Dukadam'.
In our sciences, the 'sufficient grace' is called a pardon of forgiveness.
He who forgives becomes a hero.
Mahatma Gandhi always said, 'Pardoning is the specialty of a strong man.'
Shekspeare insisted on the importance of forgiveness in the 'Marchant of Venice' the play he wrote, "Mercy Is Tyves Blast, It Blasset Him Datt Takes, that is, he who is forgives and forgives is the joy of God."
This is the time to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi in all the corners of India, my dear countrymen.
Ganesh Chaturthi festival is going on for ten days.
This festival is also a symbol of unity, equality and purity.
There are many good wishes of the Ganesha festival for all the natives.
Now it's time to celebrate in Kerala.
One of the colorful festivals of India Honour is the main festival of Kerala .
This is socially and culturally important.
Own shows the rich cultural turtle of Kerala.
With the message of love and beauty in the society, this festival gives people new enthusiasm, new confusion and new faith.
Now this festival continues to be one of the encouraging tours.
It is believed that the Navaratri festival in Gujarat and Durga Puja festival in Bengal have become one of the attractive tours in a way .
Our festivals are a chance to attract such foreigners.
Let's think about what we can do.
The 'Edul Suha' that comes after a few days will also be celebrated.
Besides the festivals of devotion and faith, we must make it a symbol of purity in the new India.
My dear neighbors, the denials of being modern are changing.
Several types of tests are carried out in every family.
Look how big it is, how happy it is to change.
As I said, the country is full of intellectual awakening.
It's very happy to know about someone's new discovery.
Someone told us that an engineer had collected some specific soil and mixed it, so that he would be trained to build a goddess.
When the glove is offered in a small skin water, it melts fast in the water.
He didn't stop with this.
Three years ago, the 'Peace Mission' started, it'll be three years on October 2.
Its results are beginning to appear.
The toilets were 39 percent now 67 percent.
More than two hundred and thirty thousand villages have been announced to be released from external separation.
Many people lost their lives.
But after the flood, when the water came out, the dirt was spread everywhere.
Let's make the environment of purity all over the country.
After the construction of the toilet, you can mix your name in Portel and the name of the family helped.
You can write articles in different languages, not old.
You can make short films on your mobile.
I can make a two-three-minute short film that inspires purity.
In whatever language it might be, it might be quiet.
Work yourself as part of it.
You can see how bright the Gandhi day will be on October 2.
After this 15-day dirty manufacturing, we can imagine that when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on October 2, we will be able to enjoy the pure joy of paying honourably to the honorable father.
My dear neighbors, today I want to make clear about a special point of view to you.
I'm waiting for your message as much as you're waiting for Manki Bah.
I'm waiting for jinns because I have a chance to learn something that you say.
There's a chance to change the things I do.
Your little things are useful for me to think of a lot of things with a new sense.
"Mr. Master, I'm talking to you from Poona.
I once went to Mall with her for shopping.
She spent two thousand rupees for a sari, spending 450 rupees for a pizza.
But he told the auto driver that went to the mall about five rupees.
On the way back, the vegetables were bought, and the price added 4-5 rupees.
I felt very bad.
We give money at bigger places without asking questions about price, but we'll ask the brothers who are dependent on us for a few rupees.
They're unbelievable.
You must tell me about this in Manki Batt.
Madam, I'm thankful to a great message from this heartbeat phone call.
I'm sure if my people are in the habit of drunken behavior, I'm sure you'll leave it.
My beloved young friends, on August 29, the whole country is enjoying the game day.
Great Hockey player, this is the birth day of Major Dhyanchand, who has worn Indrajal in Hockey.
His contributions to Hockey were permanent.
I'm saying this because I want to contact our country with the Youth Flood Sports.
Sports must be part of our life.
If we think we're the youngest country in the world, we'll have to see our children in the games.
Sports means physical fitness, mental alarmness, personality management.
What's more than that.
Playing is a great medicine for the unity of the minds.
Young friends, the Sports Ministry has prepared the Sports Talents Circuit Portal to find and enable them.
If any child from any country that has benefited from the sports sector wants his own personal observation in it, then you can do video and upload.
The portal will be uploaded tomorrow.
I'm glad to tell the youth that FIFA Andre 17 Wild Cups are going to run in India from October 6 to 18.
24 teams around the world are going to make India their home.
The enthusiasm and excitement of the six girls working in the Navy are all inspired by us.
These six girls left for the sea in a small boat called INS Tharini.
It's called the Navika Sagar transformation.
They'll return to India after months around the world.
This six kids will be very brave in the midst of the waves in the sea and this is the first time in the world.
These girls have many good pleasures and pleasures for me.
My beloved natives, on September 5, they celebrate the teacher's day.
He was the president.
But he said he was a teacher.
He was a scholar, a neologist, who lived as the president of India, but in every sense he was an excited teacher.
I'm sorry to him.
Great scientist Albert Einstein said that it is the Supreme Court of the Teacher to awake in creative oppression and acquaintance, that is, the greatest quality of a teacher's knowledge of creativity among his students.
Can we take a decision when we celebrate the teacher's day
Can you get an initiative as a mission
Teach to Transform, ducate to mpower, learn to learn to reverse to the head, learn to lead, to strengthen.
Can you take this mission forward with a determination
Whoever takes a determination for five years, guides to achieving it, enjoy winning life in five years.
For this, create our schools, our colleges, our teachers and our educational institutions.
When we talk of change in our country, we'll remember the teacher in the society as we recall the mother in the family.
Teachers have a great role in making changes.
One thing that could change someone's life through a simple effort must be in the lives of all teachers.
If we try together, we can play a bigger part in making changes in the nation.
Let's go through the mantra to teach for change.
Morning is the chief woman.
My name is Dr. Anya.
I live in Mumbai city and works for the Indian Research Center of Harvard University.
I am particularly interested in the economic analysis and social plans associated with it as an explorer.
Three years after the 1914 population begins to ask you whether India is more secure and more secure, more powerfully calculated than the summits of our women, farmers, workers and villages.
The move started on August 28, 2014 as a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, on 28 August, the Prime Minister will give birth to three years.
Thirty-thousands of new families were connected with this, and the bank accounts were opened.
It is more than the population of many countries in the world.
In the Prime Minister's Janardhana plan, our poor invested nearly sixty and five thousand crore rupees in banks.
Prime Minister Jeevanjioti Bima Yogena, Prime Minister Security Bima Yogena, gives birth to a new faith in the life of those poor today with a delicate premium of Rs one rupee or three rupees.
When the poverty broke out, some families got two lakh rupees in a few days because of the insurance of one rupee.
Hundreds of examples have come to me about how new energy is filled and how new faith is filled.
They can inspire the new generation by introducing such people.
My dear neighbors, I'm once more happy.
Thank you very much.
The specialty of human mind is that the rainy season is very attractive.
The result of changing weather and environment is extremely opposite conditions.
For the past few days, people had to suffer losses in some parts of India, especially in Assam, north-eastern states, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal.
State governments are making their own efforts to help the infected people.
Social organisations and cultural organisations are working hard to help people in this situation.
From the side of the Indian government, the soldiers, the Air Force, the NDRF and the Armed Forces are working with life money to help the victims of the flood.
Life becomes very thirsty because of swelling.
The NDRF team was used.
Climate warnings are almost sufficient for the development of technology and the improvement of the environment.
According to weather signals , if you slowly change the time period of our activity into a nature then we can be saved from big losses.
When I get ready for Manki Bay, I see the citizens of the country preparing it more than me.
I heard your speech on the Chartered Accountant's Day, which had a lot of effect on me.
Likewise, the Goods and Services Taxes (GSD) started last month.
I'm glad to hear things are worthless... in the north-eastern regions, in the remote mountainous areas, a person living in the jungles, I felt simple and simple when I wrote letters, saying that I was afraid and I started to understand things now.
The time to come from one place to another seems to be so low and the highway buses are so low.
Due to the speed of the trucks, pollution is decreasing.
The stuff quickly goes to the target.
The simplicity of this, the simplest change, the rapid shift from one way to another, the new registrations that led to a new faith in the entire country.
I believe, however, once the financial experts, management experts and technical experts will see the implementation of GSD in India as a model in the world.
There will be a case stadium for all the universities in the world.
Because such a huge change has led us to the summit of victory, with the involvement of millions of people in such a big country that it is successful.
The world must learn about it.
All states are involved in the implementation of this GSD, and all states are responsible.
All decisions and decisions were taken by the States and the Central Government together.
The great dream of 'a country-a tax' is successful.
I could see how the officers from the village to the center worked very carefully, how beautiful a climate was formed between the government and the traders and the government and the consumers, and how much part of the GSD was working in increasing their faith.
I'm grateful to all the ministries, all the departments, all the officers of the Central-State governments in this regard.
GSD is an excellent example of the victory of India's social power.
It's a history.
In a way, it is intended to social transformation.
I reassure millions of natives to gain such a great effort.
My dear neighbors, this is the month of revolution in August.
On August 15, 1947, the country was free.
In the month of August, there are many incidents related to freedom struggle.
This year we're going to celebrate the seventeenth anniversary of India Chhodo Andol's (Cwit India Movement).
Our new generation must know what happened on 9 August 1942.
People joined freedom struggle from 1857 to 1942, tried and suffered.
The streams of history are inspiring us to build a grand India.
India's minds together against the British rule.
According to Mahatma Gandhi's admonition, millions of Indians were offering to fight life with the mantra that will not work or die.
Millions of young people in the country have taken their studies and have spoken of books.
They got down on hearing the noise of freedom.
On 9th August Mahatma Gandhi went out of India Chodow, but all the big leaders were tied to the British rule in Jaili, the second generation of the country under the leadership.
The great men like Lohya and Jaiprakash Narayan were suppressors.
There was a public opinion behind all this victory, the ability of the people, the sight of the people, the fight of the people.
This effort from 1857 to 1942 brought this summit to its perfection in 1942.
Within 5 years, in 1947, the British will have to go out of India.
I want to connect you with this math.
We got freedom in 1947.
Today is 2017.
About 70 years.
The governments have come.
There were successes.
Hopes awakened.
Since 1942 to 1947, it was a definite year of obtaining vision.
From 2017 to 2022, we have been in front of us for five years, and we can celebrate 15 August 2017 as a chance for sure.
Let's have millions of determinations.
Let's try to facilitate millions of determines.
That's why we must take a look.
2017 must be our dream year.
It must be part of this August's vision.
It is not necessary to act or die today, but to join a new Indian dream, to work with mind and body to gain success, to live with this dream.
In the next five years, we have to take a decision to testify.
Social discussions can be organized for youth organizations, students and government-sponsibilities.
Let's bring new ideas.
Where should we go as a nation
What could be my contribution as a person
Enter through technology, video, post, blogs, articles and new ideas.
Make this goal a republic.
Nurrendermodi will start uittian quies for young people.
This problem is an attempt to connect the youth with the proud history of the country and introduce freedom fighters.
You must surely propagate it and bring it to the people.
This time, I'm telling you, you must know your opinions at the My Gov Apple or Narendramodi App.
I'll read it myself and try to tell them about them as long as it is available on August 15.
I think it's going to be completed in 40-45-50 minutes.
Dear neighbors, I want to tell you something today.
India's economy has a social ethics.
We don't see it cheaper.
Our festivals and festivals are not just a chance to enjoy.
Our festivals and festivals are the attempts of social perspective.
Person and society are connected to each other.
Thousands of jobs are connected to this festival, like those who make queens, those who sell sweets and sell sweet snacks.
The families of our beloved brothers are alive.
We burn the lamps to Deepawali - it is not just a celebration of light, it is not just a celebration or a decoration of houses.
It's directly connected to the poor families that have made ruins of soil.
But today, when I talk about celebrations and the economic condition of the poor people associated with them, I want to tell you about the situation.
I think when I see that people of this country are aware and more functioning.
For the last one month, the clients, aware of the environment, write me letters.
They have been asked to predict the environmental friend Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturthi, and people must now have a chance to plan to enjoy Ganesh with soil.
I'm buried with the people of such awakening.
This time I'm telling you this.
I'm sure you'll be with me on this.
This will help its architects and poor artists, and they will be employed by making idols.
The poor's stomach will be filled.
Come on, let's connect our celebrations with the poor, let's connect with the poor economic territory, let us enjoy our celebrations for the poor.
I enjoy many musical festivals for different festivals and festivals coming to all the natives.
My beloved natives, whether the country's educational or the economic sector, or the sports sector, the girls in our country are constantly watching the country's poverty and height.
We, people in this country feel proud of our girls.
Last day, our girls watched the best performance in the women's cricket world.
The pressure on their faces was evident.
I judged things in that conversation in another way.
I said, look, the media's hopes are very much in this period.
Whether you win the game, you won the hearts of hundreds of people.
Young stewards of the country, especially our girls, are actually doing a lot of work to enhance the credibility of our country.
I reassure the country's younger brothers, especially our girls with hearts, the musicians enjoy.
Dear neighbors, I recall the August revolution, recall the August 9, and recall the 15th of August.
2022 recalls the seventeenth anniversary of independence.
Take a look at all the natives, make plans for every countrymen for five years for dreams.
We need to go to the new heights of the country, reach, reach.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
Let's proceed with faith that the future of the country will be bright.
The weather is changing.
Climate is comfortable due to the rains in different parts of the country.
The cold wind after the rains remains relaxed from the heat in the past.
Whatever stirs in life, however stressed in your life or in normal life, it changes our mental condition.
Today the pilgrimage of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great respect and happiness in many parts of the country.
Now in many parts of the world Lord Jagannath has started celebrating the Rath festival .
Those who learned about Baba Saheb Ambedkar know, he praised the temple of Lord Jagannath and his traditions, because they include social justice and social harmony.
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor.
Only a few people know the word 'Geornatt' in English, which means that nobody can stop it.
On seeing the meaning of this guerrilla of this guerrilla this word is drowned from the chariot of Lord Jagannath .
We know from this how this chariot of Jagannath has achieved greatness in his own way.
Everyone celebrated Rumson's piously with worship.
Now I'm here.
On this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, many of this good wishes are enjoyed by everyone.
Rumson's month is a month of pure donation, a month of happiness.
In this pious month of Rumson I noticed a provocative incident that occurred in Bijnor village of Uttar Pradesh in Mubarakpur .
The families of our Muslim brothers, who are about 3500 years old, live in a small village, and the sisters of the Muslim family are more than the population.
During this Rumson, the villagers decided to build the toilet together.
Please spend this 17 lakh rupees for the rest of the village.
I am grateful to all the villagers of Mumbai to make Rumson's pure opportunity a good opportunity for society.
Everything of them is inspiring.
The most important thing is that they made Mubarakpur out of excretion.
Three states of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared as external free states.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana have been declared.

That's the same thing of purity.
Some bad habits are part of our nature.
I've got a very good thing about the past day, I'm gonna tell you.
The Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh is possible .
What was the target
Build 1000 toilets in 71 gram panchayats for 100 hours.
My dear neighbors would be happy to know that the general public and the government had successfully completed the job of making 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages are free from expellation.
Inlu, through jewels, and airplanes.
Mr. Prakash Trivandi reminded the time of emergency and presented the anniversary of June 25 in memory of the dark period in the history of democracy.
This awareness of the light of democracy is praiseworthy.
Democracy is not just a system, it is also a culture.
ETENL CHINES IS The Price of Liberty - is a constant awareness of the value of freedom.
Continuous awareness of democracy is required, so it is necessary to keep in mind the things that have hurt democracy.
And then it must move to the direction of the better things of democracy.
On 25th June, 1975, it was a night that couldn't forget a populist faith.

That's when Dul Bihari Vajpayee was in jail.
During a year, Dulji wrote a poem declaring the sympathy of the time he described in the poem.
My dear countrymen, all Hindus are proud of the world today.
On June 21, 2017, the world became sympathetic.
People from the sea to the mountains welcomed the sun rays in the morning.
It's a Hindu who doesn't feel proud.
The Yoga was not before, but when the Yoga was engraved by the chariot of yoga, the Yoga became a glimpse of enjoying the world.
Most of the world's countries made Yoga a chance.

About 50 thousand people in Ahmedabad in Gujarat together made a new world racada by doing yoga.
I also needed to participate in the yoga program in Lucknow.
Our armed forces, BSF, ITBP, CRPF, CISF, are all part of the job with their duty.
Some TV channels propagated it.
The respected Prime Minister, in the next time, heard that he had been in Kerala, would give good books as a gift to memories instead of giving buoy gifts at different places.
This started in Gujarat during your reign , but in the next time the use of bouquets is seen more .
Can't you do anything
Can you do anything to implement the book instead of the bucks in the country
Khadki told me that it would be Khadki's hand to get encouragement.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this program was going on, but the habit was lost after I left.
But I revived this in this program of Kerala.
Now, there's a scrutiny going down.
We'll gradually turn it into a habit.
Bucky's life is too low.
Leave it after you've bought it.
Welcome to Khadhi's cholera, so it's useful for some poor families.
It'll be less expensive, so it'll be useful.
It's been for years, but Elizabeth queen has kept the handles given by Mahatma Gandhi.
Several types of letters are available, many types of people burn.
I'm sure you're gonna have to tell me about it, if you could read a letter last day.
In the southern Tamil country, a family of sweets burnt me with a watermelon.
What was that guy.
Looking at children's studies, I thought something was going on in economic matters, and I thought the family could have a little financial help.
That's why I took a loan from the bank according to the printer plan and started the sale of some of the goods from the market.
I mean, the government's departments have been registered in the e-jem.
They're very interesting to write to me.
They said, 'I got money, business started, I got a list of what I could give in e-jem, and I got an order from the Prime Minister's Office, from the PMO.
'I also had a new news.
They suggested what they bought at the PMO - two thermos, got 1600 rupees.
This is the power.
This is the chance to encourage business.
It's beautiful, powerful, in which business is impossible.
Government this market place-jem.
My dear natives, on one side we are proud of yoga, on the other side, we can share our skills in Space Science.
Today India is not only on Earth but also on the environment.
Two days ago, ISRO-Cartosat-2 along with the cerebral grace of cerebrum, dispersed 30 nano images.
These graces were from India and 15 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, America.
This nano grace of India will help a lot in the field of fibrity, ultrasound and natural resources.
We're gonna remember that ISRO GISAT 19 was successfully launched a few days ago.
This was the weightest grace of the idols that India has ever launched.
The papers in our country compared it to the weight of the elephant.
That's what our scientists have done in the environment.
On June 19, Mughalian Mission completed a thousand days.
The mission was only six months after we found a successful survival path to the Mughal Mission.

T.

Sports play a very important role in personality development.
The importance of play is greater in the development of equal personality.
Revenge in the country is no less.
If children are interested in playing in our family and children, they will be encouraged.
We need to dream for the next hijacker.
Once again, my dear natives, rain and continuous excitement... and all this time are a new experience.
You'll enjoy the galaxies once more, let's say something else in the next mankie bath.
Narendra Modi on 28th May 2017 at 11 a.m. in the morning, the Indian people's special launch through the sky, the Malayalam transformation.
Today I'm speaking to you, Rumson started a minute.
In the ninth month of Rumson, I enjoy the heartache of the people of India and all over the world, especially the Muslim community.
Rumson gives great importance to prayer, soul and charity.
It is our country that believes in God, regresses God, idolaters and resists idol worship.
We have the art of living together with all thoughts, all kinds of worship and all kinds of traditions.
Religions, species, traditions and traditions are the message that we give is the harmony of peace and unity.
This Rumson's pious month will help us move the path of peace and unity and harmony.
Once again, I'm enjoying good luck.
I'm very happy to know that many people have experienced me.
I dare to tell you what you want to tell me.
I couldn't read everything, but I don't want to hear all the messages.
But I saw everything together... some tried to learn music, some tried to learn new words, some try to learn new things from the tube, and try to learn new language.
I'm very happy, a phone call wants to hear you.
I'm talking to Deepa Kattayal.
I've been able to give up the reading habit.
But I decided to read something in this holiday.
When it began to read the freedom struggle, it came to understand how many fights had to be fought for India to get freedom and how many freedom fighters had been in jail for years.
I'm inspiring from Lord Singh, who has suffered a lot of excitement at the young age.
That's why you insist on sending a message to the new generation on this subject.
The new generation is happy to know our history, our freedom fighters, the people who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Number of great men triggered their youth in prison.
In the years of independence, the past great men in the prisons literally worked a lot.
Their thumbs became the power of India's freedom struggle.
I once went to Andaman Nicobar a year ago.
Cellular went to see the jail.
It's the birthplace of Veera Savarkar.
The heroic public wrote the book 'Massi Janmathe' in prison.
The poems were written in prison's wall.
He was locked in a small cell.
A 'Light And Stando Show' is very inspiring there.
People from all the states of India , speaking all the languages , had sacrificed their lives by feeling the ' Kala Pani ' in this cellular jail of Andaman .
My dear neighbors, the first Monday of June 5.
What's the matter with nature
It's better to protect the earth from connecting with nature.
It's better than Mahatma Gandhi's words.
Mahatma Gandhi often said, "We need to take care of the world that doesn't seem to be..." ( We need to think of the world that we don't see."
Nature has a power.
You may also have experienced , when you reach tired , how much energy will be felt if you burst a glass of water on face .
If you open the windows of the house when you're tired, you can breathe in the windows that open the doors.
When we are concerned with these punctuations that are formed by the body, our body itself has a new mirror, a new energy mirror.
We've experienced all this, but we don't care if we don't care, we don't get it on a tub.
Now, when you're in contact with nature, you must be sure that there's no new significance inside you.
Therefore, the global initiative to connect with the nature of June 5 must be advanced to each other.
We've experienced the quality of our predecessor's environment.
If we see the environment, we'll get it to the surface.
Anthropologist, however, is the most important guidance of the environment, recall that it was refreshed thousands of years ago.
Grandma said, "Grandma's life, son-in-law."
According to the verses, the humility of ours is due to our land.
Earth is our mother, we're children.
Many festivals and rituals are connected to the environment in our country.
The love of nature is part of social life, whether educational or non-city or rural, or tribal community.
We'll explain it to the new words and explain the new reasons.
Some remarkable news from the states are playing.
Most of all, when the rainy season starts in every state, there is a big setback on the tree walking.
Thousands of trees grow.
School boxes and social organizations, the government's rare organisations, advance themselves.
This time too, we need to encourage tree walking and give our contribution to it, dear neighbors.
June 21, the world is now a special day.
This day is celebrated as World Yoga Day.
The fame of June 21 has reached every corner of the world, connecting people to each other.
On one side, there are many variations of powers in the world, when India gives a great contribution to the world.
Through yoga, the world's sword has been cut off.
As the body connects the mind, intelligence and soul to each other, today yoga shines the world.
Two days ago, I wrote letters to all the governments and all the leaders of the world associated with Yoga.
Last year I declared some competitions related to yoga, some ancestors declared.
Well, there's some steps in that matter.
I got some opinions about this, and I appreciate those who sent these opinions.
It's very funny.
Grandma or grandfather, grandfather, grandfather, grandfather, grandfather, grandfather, grandfather, grandfather, grandfather, grandfather and grandma, together with three generations of men and girls, and apploud the picture.
It's an opportunity to give a new idea to Yoga today and today and tomorrow.
This movie will be tomorrow's picture, tomorrow, it will be a happy tomorrow's promise.
I'm asking you too.
There's more than three weeks left to be a world class.
This is a kind of health care plan.
I'm asking everyone to be part of it.
When you took care of me as the chief server, I got a chance to talk to the Red Fort in Delhi on 15 August, I talked about purity.
Since then, I go to different parts of India today.
What are some Modi doing
I'm thankful to seeing him like this.
You'll know if you hear this phone.
Initially, Modiji, I speak Naina from Mumbai.
Modiji, wherever you go, I'm supposed to be careful of everybody's purity, and I'm regularly watching TV and social media.
Though in Mumbai or in Surat, people have enjoyed pursuit of pursuit of pursuit of pursuit of pursuit.
Not only adults, children are also awake about purity.
The children who blame the dirty people on the streets can be smashed everywhere.
The media also gives it great importance, and I went to Gujarat a few days ago.
It's a pleasant thing more than that, even with my journey.
Welcome to the Prime Minister, there may be a habit of doing all the rest of the preparations, but purity will be a big deal.
It gives pleasure to anyone who wants purity, it's inspiring.
"When Modiji decides to travel, ask him who sees me, where will the purity be in the head
How many tons of chickens will dedicate you to see if I want to come or not.
"The idea is very good, but I have to think.
Instead of giving gifts, it has to be an expedition to make such a dozen chicken poxes.
How many people can be saved from the disease.
How big humanitarian is it
Let's see these chickens as dirty as a wealthy one.
It's not just dirty.
If we start seeing these chickens rich, we'll have new ways of dirty transmission.
Youngsters associated with the startups will come with new plans, with new equipment.
With the help of the Government of India, the Indian government is determined to launch a major campaign for the manufacturing of the city with the help of resistance to the population.
On June 5, in the world's environment, there is a need to provide jewelry to collect mercury and mercury in nearly four thousand cities of the country.
There are two types of chickens, one green and the other blue.
The kitchen is dirty, green skin, the fatty skin, the eggs, the leaf and the fluids, and put them in the green tails.
All this is beneficial in the fields of agriculture and in order to keep in mind what is needed in greenery .
The other is to put things like mustard, iron, glass, cloth, plastic, polythene, broken dubbs, rubber stuff, and all these things are dry.
The responsibility of this is Versova Residency Volunteers.
Brothers, today, I want to tell you something very happy, and told me that Riyazi Block in Jammu and Kashmir is a free area of external external external externity.
I congratulate all the people of Riyazi Block and the rulers there.
I appreciate the mothers and sisters there.
My dear neighbors, for the last fifteen days, in the newspaper for a month, or in the TV channel, the government's account is going on everywhere in social meditation.
Three years ago, you got me responsible for being the main server.
A lot of people walked, a lot of opinions took place.
I see all this as a very healthy thing.
This three-year activity has been changed in all ways.
People from all the regions of the society reflected this.
This is a very good way of democracy.
Governments must be responsible in democracy, and people must give accounts of their actions.
I thank those who know different, important opinions.
Actual criticism strengthens democracy.
For the United States, which awakens, it is very important for the Chaitanya nation.
My dear natives, I am also a common citizen like you... with the effect of a better and bad world as a normal citizen.
I told you the effect of my mind as a normal citizen, that's important.
Two days ago, in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, honorable President Jee, honorary Vice President, honorary Spicture, George, enlightened a study of Manki Bath, as a person, this incident is very exciting as a genuine citizen.
Thanks to the President and the Vice President, Spiritual Glory, who found time and gave importance to Manki Bain.
In a way, Mankieback gave a new idea.
Some friends talked to me about the work of the book about Mankie Bath.
He said that he wants to make a sketch of what he has talked about in Manki Bay, and Akbar Sahab Manki Bambin gave a art to express his love without paying a rupee.
I'm grateful to Akbar.
My beloved natives, the next time Manki Bath tells, the entire country will be rained, the weather will change, the results of the exams will start, the new study life will start... and a new smell and smell will spread everywhere.
We can proceed with love for nature in this environment.
You're all my joys.
Narendramodi, on April 30, 2017, at 11 a.m. in the morning, the Indian population's exclusive launch through the airways is the Malayalam transformation.
My dear natives are blessed.
The jinns of children, the glory of the youth, the experience of the elders...
Normally seeing the others' advice is the nature of people.
On the train, when someone gets coughing, tell him who's close to it, do it, do it.
Please, tell me, it's our nature.
At first, when Manki Bath's suggestions were received, he heard the words of the advice, and there was something to learn, and when the team felt it was a habit for a lot of people, so he was sending it.
But when we tried to justify it, it was really funny.
Most of those who say these things, and those who try to bring me, are actually doing something.
They try their intelligence, strength and ability to do a good thing, according to the environment.
When I noticed this, this suggestion is strange.
I'm sorry to lose food in Manki Batt last time.
This is an example of how things are going on with the help of society.
Today is the end of the month of April.
May 1 is the founding day of Gujarat and Maharashtra .
On this occasion, people from both the states have many good pleasures.
Nature has changed all the rules of play.
The heat in our country in May-June has to be felt this time in March.
Some of the people have been asked to accept their favours for Manki Bah, so many have been sent to discuss what to do during this summer.
Everything is in progress, not new, but it's very useful to steal it at the right time.
Many friends, including cart, are worried about birds.
They said they need to put water in the utensils in Balkani and Terrace.
Small children in the family seem to be very excited about this.
If they take care of how to keep the water, they'll go ten times a day if they keep the utensil, there's water in it.
I'll take care of the birds coming.
We think it's a game, but it's really a good experience for children to wake up the past.
He lived till 103.
As his centenary birth anniversary, Bohra Samaj made a big initiative to save the rashes through the Burhani Foundation.
I got a chance to start.
About fifteen thousand firefighters were distributed to the world.
Ginny's book of vald records got a place.
Sometimes the newspaper givers, the milkmen, the vegetables, the post-moneys, forget to ask if we want the summer and the water.
Your friends, I want to tell you something.
Many of our young generations are happy to live in a very simple situation.
Parents also grow very safely on them.
But I want to tell you as a friend how your holidays should be.
New places, new experiences, new skills...
Sometimes watch some things on TV, or read in the book, or listen to the intellectuals... and feel the same thing...
Experiments may be sorry, let's get out of the luxury.
If we're from the middle family, we're from a happy family.
You can never see the happiness of playing in life.
Do you think how big changes will occur in their life when children leading such a life in society get a chance to play with you
This experience will teach you many things.
Go to the woods.
Perhaps summer gatherings will be organized, personality development sequences will take place...
There will be many development works.
Everyone will be busy in their world on the strength of technology.
Social life is a culture, it's a power.
Another thing I told you about Naypunya, you don't want to learn something new.
Today is the time of competition.
It'll be hard to buy the highest market, some coaching class in the holidays, and the next exam is in danger.
But keep in mind whether humanity is insufficient... and keep in mind whether it is left out of human qualities.
Can you take a little more care of the development of Naiputan
You can spend some time with yourself from technology.
Read some musical instruments, read 5-50 verses of a new language, Tamil, Thalango, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathis, Punjabi...
Try to learn something you don't know, you must have some good.
New places, new towns, new villages...
But wherever you go, look like a wizard, understand, talk to the people, ask them... it'll give you a different joy to see them there.
Try and decide yourself.
Don't lose time for a trip.
Go to one place and spend three to four days there.
Then go to another place and stay there for three days.
It can learn a lot of things.
Show me pictures where you're going.
Share your experiences with Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, this time the Indian government has given you a good opportunity.
The new generation has almost been freed from the rupees.
They don't need money notes.
They've begun to believe in digital deals.
Do you think you can do this to compensate the money
There's a plan of the Indian government.
Bheem up, you must have downloaded.
Your account will be invested ten rupees from the government.
One day, if you can join 20 people, you can pay 200 rupees.
Businessmen and students can compensate for this.
This plan is up to October 14.
Your contribution to the designation of digital India.
You'll be a guardian of new India.
Holidays for holidays, chances of wealth.
Meet the digital.
Normally in our country there is a hateful environment to the VIP culture.
But I have now realized that how deep the country's largest man, the government has decided not to stroll on a red light on the vehicle.
It turned into a sign of the VIP culture.
It's clear from the experience that the red light was on the car, but it's climbing to the brain of the people and becoming a visually visual culture.
Now the red light is gone, so nobody can claim that the red light on the head is gone.
We got a very funny phone call.
People are worried about the red light.
The government wants to talk about the red beaking light.
I read in the newspaper, each Indian is a VIP of the layer.
I was proud of it.
Thank you for that.
When IPI is called WIP, it means Everi Person Eis Emportant, everyone has the importance.
We can work together.
My dear neighbors, I always want to recall our history, our culture, our tradition.
We'll get energy, we'll get inspiration.
This year we celebrate the 10th birth anniversary of the Indians of Ramanujacharya .
That's how we're supposed to remind you of the centuries.
The centuries of other countries in the world may be very important.
Self, by way of practice, turned away those who didn't think of society.
Hundreds of years ago, he attacked them to enter the temple, successfully reached the temple.
How lucky are we to have born a great man in our society to avoid the evils of our society in all times.
When Ramanujacharya's 10th birthday is celebrated, we will inspire to awaken the idea that social unity is stronger.
The Central Government is illuminating a stamp on May 1 tomorrow to remind Swami Ramnujacharya.
Swami Ramanujacharya is honored and offers honourable flowers.
My dear neighbors, there is another significance of May 1 tomorrow.
Only a few people knew that we were borrowing to Baba Sahab for the benefits and respect of workers today.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today when we talk about Baba Sahab and Ramanujacharya , the great Karnataka Sanyasi of the 12th century , the social researcher reminds Jagat Guru Basaveshwar .
Yesterday I got an opportunity to attend a ceremony.
His verses got an opportunity to illuminate.
In the twelfth century he is deeply concerned about those who teach him and teach him in the Kannada language.
He said in the Kannada language, "Kave Kailas."
It means that you can reach the same climate of Lord Shiva through the desert.
I mean, heaven can be obtained by doing work...
I'm often said to be the winner.
About the importance of employment, the Degniti of Labor, the founder and thinker of the Indian Mussoorie group, Dattopant Tangdiji, reminds me often.
Today, it's natural to remember Dattopanth Thangdi when you talk about the workers.
My dear natives, we'll celebrate Buddhism after a few days.
People from all over the world associated with Lord Buddha will recite it.
The life of the Ashoka in India is an excellent example of the journey of Buddha from the war.
I am very lucky to see that the United Nations General Vessak Day is celebrated on this great mountain of Buddhism .
This time it's going to Sri Lanka.
On this sacred occasion, I'll have a chance to give Buddhist honors to Sri Lanka.
He'll have a chance to renew his memories.
Dear natives, an attempt has been made to advance in India and with the mantra of sub-cas Sath-Sabka development.
It is not only in India, but also in global, when it is called subcasath-Sabka development.
Especially in our neighboring countries.
On May 5, India's South Asian planet will be launched.
The efficiency of this planet and its conveniences will help to fulfil the economic and developing predictions of South Asia.
Though in the case of tele-medics, it is not in the field of education, but in the context of a more profound technical system, it will be helpful for people and people.
This is India's greatest step to enhance cooperation with all South Asia.
The priceless gift.
This is a great example of our resistance to South Asia.
March 26 is Bangladesh's Independence Day.
A history struggle against justice, a unique victory for the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangkok.
Today, on this great day, I enjoy the museums of Independence Day to the brothers of Bangladesh.
Rabindranath Tagore - His memories are traditional for us.
Guru Dev Rabindranath Tagore was also the national song of Bangladesh .
The most interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel prize in 1913, but also gave him the British Nighthood status.
But when the British massacred in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among the great men who had protested.
That was the deepest impact of a child at the age of 12.
The boy who laughed at fields and sports in his childhood made a new inspiration in the terrible massacre of Jalian Valabag.
In 1919, the 12-year-old boy, Lord, is the lover of ourselves, Shahid Bhagat Singh.
On 23rd March, Lord Singh and his friend Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British.
We know that even at the time of death, Lord Sing, Sukhdev and Rajguru were happy to serve India, not dead.
All dreams of life have been dedicated to India's independence.
These three heroes still inspire us.
We cannot describe the story of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
As an Empire of British, these three were scared.
The Britons were tied up in jail, the tabernacle was sure, but the British thought of what was more about them.
That's why he killed those who were determined to be hanged on 24th March.
They did it unusually without anybody.
Then their body was brought to Punjab today and the British burnt fire without knowing anyone.
When I had a chance to go there for a few years ago, I felt as if I had an impression on that planet.
I would surely tell the youth of the country - if you get the opportunity, go to Punjab, you must go to the constituents of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Badukeshwar Das.
Freedom, its intensity, its propaganda was a period of increasing.
On one side, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were inspired by the youth for civil dissolution.
In India's freedom struggle, Gandhiji's thought and his style appeared in Champaran.
In 1915 Gandhiji returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and became a new inspiration to the country .
Today, on the basis of the shape of Mahatma Gandhi in our mind, we cannot judge the truth of Champaran.
A man who returned to Hindustan in 1915... just two-year period...
It was just a beginning.
We can know how much he'll have to suffer at that time, how much he's trying.
The Chamber's honesty was the opportunity to identify Mahatma Gandhi's organizational power and the ability to know the country's publicity.
Mahatma Gandhi arranged in front of the British empire to fight the poor and illiterate people, inspired to fight and fight...
The magnificent power of the Chamber's true planet shows us, through which we can recognize the glory of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think of Mahatma Gandhi a hundred years ago, the monarchy is a big study for any person who starts a normal life.
Trying to change the wishes and replacement of a hundred and thirty-five people - this is the strongest slave of the new India.
The newborn is not a government imagination, but it is not an exhibition of a democratic party.
Newborn is the pride of a hundred and fifty million people.
It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people are mixing up and enjoying how terrible.
Hundreds of thousands of people have an idea, a gladness, a imagination, a gladness.
They're doing it like things, as they're supposed to be quiet servants.
There are many people who go to hospitals everyday and help patients.
If you know, there are many who run for blood donation.
If anyone is hungry, there are many who think of feeding them.
Let's say our country is brutal.
The hypocrisy of God is in our symptoms.
If we look at it with social understanding, how powerful it is to look at it.
When you talk about the newborn, you should think about it, think about it, and look at it with a different perspective.
If a hundred twenty-twenty-thousands of people determine the way, the dream of a hundred and fifty million people will be true in our sight if one-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-f-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-free-free-free-
All this cannot be taken by the government through the budget, through the government's plans.
If we decide that transport laws will be restricted, if all citizens decide that they will be responsible for my debts, then every citizen will ensure that one day a week does not use petrol or diesel...
It's a small thing, and you'll see the dream of this newborn in this country of hundreds and twenty-five million people.
This means that all citizens should pursue their privacy, and that they should pursue their rituals.
My dear natives, I want to explain the gratitude of you.
For the last few months, people in our country have been involved in digital developments called digital payments, and have been enjoying how they can exchange money without money.
Even poor people in the poor are trying to study it, and gradually people are moving forward to dealing without the council.
After the notice cancellation program, there are many systems of digital payments.
It's been two and a half months since Bheem started, but about one and a half million people have loaded it down.
We must take the fight against my dear neighbors, corruption and corruption.
Hundreds of thousands of people, if they want, don't wait for a year.
It's only six months.
We can do this in everyday life.
This is the greatest service you cannot imagine to the state, and you will be a heroic in the struggle against corruption and corruption.
This was taught to the people, and many destined fairs were held to relieve the people.
It's a plan to make 100 programs with the country.
80-85 programs have been run.
There were prizes.
About twelve million people got gifts to the consumers.
Seventy thousand people got gifts to the traders.
Everybody is determined to move with this method.
April 14.
As soon as it is decided, on 14th April, this degidhan festival will end on the occasion of Dr. Babasaheb's birth anniversary.
I'm doing a big job when I finish a hundred days.
There are arrangements for mega frustration.
In the rest of the days of the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, we can propagate Bheem App.
Please share our share in reducing the amount of money to be paid.
I'm glad to get a lot of opinions every time, dear neighbors, when Mankie Bath is consulted with the people, but every time the requirements of purity increases.
The girl studying in the eleventh grade called Gayatri from Deradun called the message: "Ministry of the Religious Prime Minister, please be grateful to you for the first time in this election with great majority.
I want to tell you my Manki Bath.
I need to tell you how important people are to understand.
I go across a river every day, in which people put a lot of snakes, destroy the river.
"Sahodri brothers, look how painful the river is for a boy studying in the 11th class.
On seeing chickens in that river, how much anger does the child get.
I see this as a good symptom.
Since the introduction of purity, there has been a new rise in the country.
I'm hating the dirt.
Wake up, be alive partner, be born... and it has great importance.
To tell me all those who listen to Gayatri in my Mankie Bay today, the message of Gayatri is to be a message to everyone.
All the things that see are filled in the plate, they can't eat.
It's not a matter of telling anyone.
When the mother calls the children in our houses, they say, "Mother or son, take it for yourself."
Secondly, if you want to get some profit from it, it's economically profitable to the family.
It's a good thing to think for society, but it's beneficial for family.
I'm not compelled to do this, but I ask you to be more awake.
I know the youth who do a great thing about it.
They've made a mobile up for it.
If you know there's a sweet diet somewhere, people call it, and they use it properly by combining it.
This teaching is the youth of our country.
We'll see people like this anywhere in all the states of India.
We might be inspiring to avoid their lives and diet.
Call as much as you can eat.
Look, it's the way to change.
Those who are cautious of health always say - keep stomach and little legs , keep plate and keep some legs .
When you talk about health, you should remember April 7, the world is healthy.
By the time the United Nations is 2030, the goal of the university health coverage, that is, everyone's health.
This time the United Nations concentrates on the subject of depression on the world health day of April 7.
We also know the word of depression, but if you mean that some people call it depression.
According to an estimate, more than 35 million people in the world are suffering from depression.
If a psychological environment is formed, it starts getting rid of it.
The first mantra is to speak openly than to stop the disease of depression.
Tell your friends, parents, brothers, teachers, what your mind is.
Sometimes alone, especially the children in the hostel, may have trouble.
The shape of our country that we live in the grown-up, the big family, each other's side, so that the chances of depression are reduced.
Otherwise, if everyone doesn't go out together, I don't come, listen to whether I should be alone.
Let those who can speak openly to him have a chance to stay with him.
Smile and talk to him and inspire him to talk, bring him out if he's in trouble.
It's a good way.
Depression becomes a cause of physical and mental disease .
As diabetes becomes equivalent to all kinds of diseases, depression is also unable to keep us safe, fighting, patience and all the ability to decide.
If you don't open your minds in front of the people, seek help from someone who has no other service.
Help your heart, share your grief.
If you try to understand the sorrows of someone else, you will have a new self-confidence in yourself.
You can reduce your mind's weight and disappointment if someone supplements with the help of others.
Yoga is also a good way to keep mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in many ways to get rid of stress , to get rid of mental stress , to get rid of psychological stress .
21 June is the International Yoga Day.
Last day, the Central Government took a big decision.
The number of women working in our country is coming daily, welcoming that their share is increasing.
Responsibility of the family, participants of home economic obligations, due to which the newborns have to act injustice.

My beloved young men, we have spoken of the hardships of science and scientists.
The country needs many scientists.
Today's scientists become the reason for a new change in the life of the age-long stairs.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say : ' No science has erupted from the sky in a specific form .
All sciences are developed and tied to experiences.
The priest's father also said, 'I express my heart with enthusiasm, teaching and dedication that led them in the search of modern scientists following truth.
'Science is aiming at the needs of ordinary people, how to use those principles, what the media should be, how technology should be, because it is considered the most important contribution to the general public.
Identifying and displaying such observations, informing people, how such observations should be helpful to the ordinary people, how much production can be, how its commercial use can be.
Sometimes problems show significance of science to find peace.
All the systems are going to be technical.
Technically becomes an inefficient part of our life.
In the past, the DG-Dhan plan was very important.
Especially young women are habitual to do digital payments through their mobile phones.
I see this as a good news.

It's a proven thing.
If a six-class family has a standard double-class toilet, it will be filled for about six years.
After that, the dirt can go back to the second trap.
In six to twelve months, the dirt of the tub is completely stored.
It's very safe to handle such a stored dirt, which is a very important tailor in the form of caterpillar.

Rajasthan, our child, our school, implemented a program called Apna Bacha Apna Vidyalaya, to encourage children who have been studying in school and to resume their children.
In short, the 'Beti Bachao, Bathi Pachao' plan has a lot of effects.
I see this as a good symptom.
Manki Bath, 2019 August.
When our country enjoys rains on one side , on the other side there is no festival or fair in all corners of India .
This is the way to Deepawali.
Perhaps, our ancestors have established the supremacy and economic condition of social life in any aspect of society.
In the past, we celebrated many festivals.
Everyone can find a solution to the problems of today from Sri Krishna's life.
Despite all this importance take the job of Sarathi in the battlefield .
Perhaps pick up the mountain, sometimes grind the food leaves.
I mean Krishna feels a new thing.
So when I talk to you today, I pay attention to two monsters.
One of the spectacular monstrous and the other of the churches.
The spectacular Mohammad left the Yamuna and stayed in the city of Dwaraka on the seashore and Mohman born on the seashore reached Delhi on the banks of Yamuna in the last minute .
We can learn from the message of Lord Krishna , even though the importance of the survival of the survival of the survival of the survival of the survival of the survival of the survival of all the highest weeks of life .
My dear countrymen, I'm talking about Jayantiya, a hundred of Mahatma Gandhi.
A new path to human character was established, a new pillar.
Serving, service philosophy, professionalism of service were always associated with Mahatma Gandhi, a part of his life.
In his life, the example went forward through the way of service.
This was the best person, society, humanity and humanity of Mahatma Gandhi.
Though in Africa's Finiks family, Tolstoi family, Sabarmati has always given importance to his own social gathering in a different way.
I'm very lucky to know that I got a chance to swim in many important places related to the priesthood.
I can tell you that Gandhi gave importance to the organization with service.
We have to bring the imagination of social services, social growth and social syndication to our utility.
In fact, this is what is called the consciousness of Mahatma Gandhi, the real businessman.
There'll be a lot of chances like this, we'll get together.
But what is Gandhi 150
Do you think you can share these efforts as a person
Think what valuable is to be alone.
Ladies Club.
Let's continue there at the latest Ladies Club, but all members of the Ladies Club can mix something to serve.
You can do a lot of things.
Specify old books, distribute information to the poor.
130 million people have 130 million ideas, and 130 million parks can be reduced.
My dear people, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
The salt glory that took place in Dandi in the freedom struggle was a great way.
I inaugurated an official museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi .
I'm asking you to go to any place with Mahatma Gandhi in the coming time.
It can be Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Champarana, Wardha's Ashram, somewhere connected with Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
When you go to such a place, you must share your pictures socially and others will inspire it.
This time in the Indian pavilion of Venice Binalay there has been a lot of interesting exhibitions related to Gandhiji's memories.
In that, the greenery pools were especially attractive.
You will remember that there was a conference of congress in Haripur in Gujarat and the history that Subhas Chandra Bose had chosen as president .
This art exhibition has a very beautiful past.
Before the Haripura meeting of Congress in 1937 - 38 Mahatma Gandhi was invited by the then Principal Nandal Bose at Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan .
Gandhiji desired that he would appear through the lifestyle of the people of India and the exhibition of his art in the Mahasam festival.
With his artistic regime, Nandal Boss was also synonymous.
Nandal Bose visited the villages near Haripur and finally brought some pictures of the life of rural India .
These priceless artistic artistic artists have been discussed in Venice.
Once again, Gandhiji's centuries of generosity intends to take a look at all Indians.
For the country, for society, someone else has to do something.
That's the best, real, efficient activity that can be papa.
For the last few years, we have been doing a programme to serve dirt free all over the country almost two weeks before October 2.
This time it will start on September 11.
This time I need to give special importance to plastic.
I remembered from the Red Fort on 15 August that hundreds of thousands of people organized a massage for the manufacturing of dirt and worked to get rid of external excretion.
Likewise, we need to finish the use of single-ice plastic only once together.
In this case, people from all sections of society are very excited.
Many of my brothers in business have put a board in front of the shop and wrote that those who came to buy the goods should bring the saggy.
This can benefit money and their share of the environment's safety.
This time on October 2, when Jayanti celebrates Baby's centuries, we dedicate him not only to a free India, but to a new masses against plastic all over the country.
Let's make it fuel.
What is more inspiring than Gandhiji
Dear people, our cultures are kind of knowledgeable.
We'll get what we want in our life.
I want to tell you a big thing in a cultured language.
It's a centuries ago, but it's still very important.
It's a very well-specific - Prithviaam Trini Ratnani water, a supplementary mui, Pashanakhandesh Ratnasu, which has three verses on Earth, water, food and supplement.
The fools call the stone as Ratna.
In our culture, Anna had great glory.
We also changed the knowledge of Anna to science.
The consciousness of the need for nutritious food is changing the country through modern scientific methods.
People fight against the lack of nutrition through new and attractive methods.
According to this, the serviles of the limbs are involved in every grain from the people in the yield days.
This grain is used for making hot food for children and women.
After that, the person becomes dedicated to this goal and becomes the warrior of the masses.
All of us must have heard of a ceremony called Annaprash in every part of India.
This is the first time to give rice to the children.
Not a fluid, a bit of food.
Sometimes people donate food.
When the people of the family come to nutritious food, tasty food and take them to anganwadi or school, then they call children from their families.
He shares his happiness and shares others.
There is a good balance of service and happiness.
Friends, there are many small things that can be successfully fought against nutritional deficiency.
Today, due to lack of information about nutritious food, poverty and wealth are suffering.
The whole country will be served as nutritious months in September.
You must be part of it, and join a new program, and you'll be part of it.
If you can save someone from lack of nutrition then it means that we will save from the lack of nutrition in the country .
Everything I left in the last week, where I saw people, Man vs.
But I never thought there would be a chance to suppress the minds of the youth around the world.
What's going on
Last week I went to Bhutan.
Since I have the chance to go as the Prime Minister, since then, since I have a chance to sit next to all of the international Yoga day, somebody has been asking me something about the yogi in five times.
This is my experience all over the world.
The Discovery channel plans to communicate in 165 countries.
I am sure that this episode of the Discovery channel is very helpful in introducing the world about environment, global warming and climate change.
Today people want to know about the steps taken in our country for climate conservation and climate.
Have you been shooting many times
"It's very wise to ask.
Look, there's no secret in it.
I'll tell you my secret because there's a question in many people's mind.
Or no secret.
The truth is that in a conversation with Bear Grils, technically used.
Whatever I said, the translation was going on in English, and he used to listen to the abdomen in the ears of the Bear Grills by a small device that was in the ears.
I mean, though I spoke in Hindi, he was listening to English, so it was easy to talk, that's a strange idea of technology.
After this show many people spoke to me about the Jim Corbett National Park .
You must go to a place related to nature and wildlife.
I've said this before, repeated... to the north east of India.
I want to spend some time there.
Dear people, in India there is an adversity and anxiety of environment, that is, the idea of protecting nature is naturally visible.
Last month I got a chance to get out of the country's Tiger Sensus.
Do you know how many tigers in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
A few years ago, it was just half of it.
In the case of tigers, Tiger Sammit in Sent Peters Burg in Russia in 2010, a race of lions took place.
It was decided to make a sense that the number of lions in the world was disturbed by decreasing.
Since 2022, it was certain that the number of tigers in the world should be doubled.
But it's a new India, and we're gonna go fast.
We doubled the number of tigers since 2019.
The number of tigers in India has doubled the number of protected sectors and community reserves.
In the Gir forest, it took several steps one after another.
In 2007, it decided to rule the women's guards.
Basic facilities have been increased to encourage tourism.
When we talk about nature and wildlife, we talk about protection.
We need to think of coexistence beyond safety.
Our sciences have a very good advice on this.
Listen to what we have been told in our sciences centuries ago, the wildlife, the desert, the first wildlife, the wildlife saved, the wildlife, that is, if there is no jungle, the tigers are forced to come in the midst of humans.
Dear people, who can forget the historical speech of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893.
This Indian young sanyasi, who has captured human beings all over the world, has established India's bright personality in the world.
On September 11, 1893, the words of a great man, like Swami Vivekananda, obliged the world to change the vision of India.
Come on, let us try to live in the real power of India, seeing Swami Vivekananda's appearance of India.
But I don't cross it anymore.
Wait till August 29.
To get rid of plastic, we'll all try to get out of the whole house and outside.
I'm sure that this emergence will be filled with social media.
Come on, let's move with a new vision, with a new vision.
We'll go ahead with the joy of the inner service.
Narendermodi on January 20, 2017, at 11 in the morning, the Indian population's special launch through the airways is the Malayalam transformation.
My dear natives, everybody is blessed.
On January 26, our Republic Day, everyone celebrated with happiness and enthusiasm in every part of the country.
This is a kind of cultural festival, consisting of all our resistance to the rights and rights of the citizens and the rights of the citizens of India, which makes the face-to-face environment aware of democracy and democratic responsibility.
But no matter how deep and wide and widely discussions are going on in our country as far as citizens are concerned about the activity and rights of citizens.
As long as two times, it shows social vision, vision and respect for the martyrs.
Everybody has a natural respect for the military and the security forces in our country.
I appreciate the horse jewels and their families, honored with different religious priests in the evening at the head of Republic Day.
Among these ancestors are chakra, Shaurya chakra, supreme specific service medal, specific service medal.
Can you do something that enjoys me, especially the youth, very excitingly interfering in social media
On one side, when we heard joyful celebrations on 26th January, the giants of our army came from Cauel for the protection of the country in Kashmir.
I pay attention to those gentlemen, and wealthy.
You know, my young friends, I'm mankiebath's programme that makes my mind clear.
The months of January, February, March and April are the time of exams in every family.
When I knew about this, many teachers, savers, students messed up, asked me questions, suggested, insisted, sorry, sorry, sorry.
I want to share with you the thoughts that I've seen after all that.
I got the telephone message of a child named Christie.
Listen, Christie says, "Sir, I'm telling you that at the time of the exam, there is a terrible atmosphere in our house and our society."
That's why the children get encouragement, instead of encouraging them.
It's just a few people who are happy to test.
It's a moment of pressure to test most people.
That's what happens in us, it's coming out.
It feels strong at the time of the festival of society.
The best appears.
At the time of the exams, there must be an excitement between the family, friends, and the neighborhood.
The pressure turns to the plasser, and you'll see the pressure becoming happy.
The excitement will make the mind weightless.
Look, look at the changes.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kachh to Kamrup, from Amrail to Arunachal Pradesh, these three-four months exams are exams.
You must understand that the power to call memories is the most calm.
If you're in the tension, all the doors are closed, the outside will not come in, the inside will not come out.
Thinking is a hindrance, it turns into a weight.
I'm telling my experience, if there's a mental stress, we're forgetful, if there's peace, remember things that we can't imagine, it'll be very useful.
It's not the problem that you don't know. You didn't learn to study.
But when you're mentally stressed, your knowledge, knowledge and learning are suppressed, your mental stress suppresses all this.
Life seems to be a problem.
You'll think you're a test of a year-long study.
P.
J.
If he was disappointed because of the failure, if he had failed to live, he would have been able to find such a great scientist to India, and would have been able to find such a great president.
That's why the competition has increased, and there has been an increase in mental stress among students.
Marks and Mark sheets have a very limited use.
That's not all in life.
Life is based on how much knowledge you've achieved.
If you believe in these things, you'll roll the mark ball after you, you'll never need to go after Mark.
You have knowledge in life, profitability, profitability, self-sufficiency, profitability, determination.
Look at his experience, knowledge and success.
So Mark's weight prevents us from going to the right path.
But if you focus on the Mark, you'll gradually limit you to summary certain things.
This is a very psychological fight.
Indeed, the competition is not useful to lead life, and it is necessary to fight with yourself to go forward in life.
How would it be better for the next day to come
How would the chance to come better than what happened
Sometimes you've seen it in the games, you'll get to know about it soon, so let's say examples here.
The specific feature of their life is that they fight themselves for most of the victorious games.
Before there was no sleep because of the stress of the test, is there any sleep now
Second, you're worse than him.
Third, the same.
Listen to how you can do better than you've done before.
It's been suggested about the share of beautiful defendants.
He says the role of the defendants in the exam is very important.
Because the mothers are more aware of the future of the children in the house, they are simplifying many things.
If you're learning to accept, more problems will end there.
That's why you're sometimes doing this to the children to tell me to the parents.
Do you think you'd give the children an end to laughter in the days of the test
Look, the atmosphere will change completely.
There's a very interesting phone call.
Because I worked like that in my childhood, I tried to copie once in my childhood.
I made a lot of preparations for that.
I tried to find out the ways, so I lost a lot of time.
"You're right.
I'm looking for a lot of money, and sometimes I don't believe in my own ability, I'm gonna say, "I'm gonna check if I wrote it right."
Maybe it's right to write the name, and the next one is wrong.
Seeing it, we'll be wrong and lose our trap.
I mean, there's nothing more than copper.
That's how it works to lie, so don't.
The coffee makes you bad, so don't coffee.
"What is a prime minister, tells the children to play at the time of the exams," I'm sorry.
Because it is generally supposed that students are ignorant of learning when they take care of the games.
This idea is wrong.
This is the basis of problems.
If you want a sufficient development, there's a life outside the books, and you know it's very wide.
It's time to learn to live.
It's time to make life.
It's called watching.
In my view of the exams, there are three things important, the right rest, the second sleep for the body, the third is a large part of the body.
So the rest of the body needs to work.
Have you ever thought that you want to see the sky, see the trees and trees out of the midst, and be cheerful
Long breathing leads to tension.
We don't have to stand in the room to breathe.
Some people think they'll stay late at night and study too much.
You must sleep for the body.
So you won't lose time to learn.
A guy who came to see me about it asked, How long are you sleeping
I asked you, brother, are you a doctor
He said, while speaking at the time of the election, your close voice is in touch with sleep.
If you slept enough, your vocul code will get no rest.
I didn't think of the sleep and the voice of Vocol Code and my voice. He gave me a big medicine.
But it doesn't mean just sleeping.
So don't do that.
If you can't, don't...
Or it'll be a weight, and I'm gonna join you with your family's parents that they don't have any weight.
Remember your determinations, trust yourself in your ability and go to the test.
Many of my good pleasures.
Festival to win all the exams.
And there's no exams.
Get forward with this magic.
Dear neighbors, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years on February 1, 2017.
On this occasion, I thank all the Coast Guard officers and the people for their service to the nation.
The Coast Guard has replaced 126 ships and 62 planes built in our country as the fourth largest shore of the world.
Coast Guard remains unhealthy at night in the opposite environment to protect the country's sea shores and sea shore conditions.
Last year, the Coast Guard jewelers took a big goal of their responsibility to clean the seashore of our country.
Thousands of people became participants.
They've thought of sea shore cleansing along with shore security, it's sure to be praised.
Not only men in our country's Coast Guard, but a few people know that the responsibility of women and the shoulders is successful.
Our great officers in the Coast Guard are working not only pilots and Observers, but also under the control of the Howard.
The security of seashore today is the most important thing in the world, so those who are engaged in the great job of protecting the seashore of India take hundreds of years in the fourteenth year of Indian Coast Guard.
On February 1, Vasant Panchami festival is held.
The spring is considered to be the best thumb.
It is known as the king of springs and sums.
In our country the festival of Vasant Panchami Saraswati Puja is celebrated .
It is considered a chance to worship the trick.
Not only this, it's a celebration of inspiration for the devils.
Mera Rang de Basanti Chola - This is inspiring.
My natives have thousands of joys at the Pavan festival of this spring.
My beloved natives, Manki Bath's Akashwani has a new pattern in their own way.
Since last month, my Manki Baat has started listening to Manki Bath in local languages.
I reassured the sky swimming and very much thanks to the natives.
Menkie Bath gives me a big chance to contact you.
Hundreds of good luck.
Today's life is an opportunity for service, sacrifice and sacrifice.
Jesus Christ said, 'The poor don't have our help, but we need our approval.'
According to St. Luk Suvish, 'It's not just Jesus to serve the poor, but to congratulate the poorer service.' This is the real power.
A story related to this is very famous.
Because the others gave a lot, but the widow gave them their surveillance, on 25 December today.
Two days ago, I had a chance to reduce the start of many development works in Banaras, the peninsula of Malviyaji.
I left for the Mahamana Madan Mohammad Malavia Cancer Care Center in Banaras Hindu University of Varanasi .
The cancer center built there will be very useful for people not only in north eastern Uttar Pradesh but also to Jharkhand Bihar .
Today our former Prime Minister is the birth day of India's honorary seal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country has never forgotten Dalji's contributions.
Under his leadership, we also served the nation with the power of sympathy.
As party leader, as a world community, as minister and prime minister, Dalji established a great honor.
On the day of Dalji's birth, I pray to God for his health.
As a worker, I got an opportunity to work with Dalzi.
Several memories prove to be visible.
I've shared an old video when I voted this morning... and you know how I had the luck of Mr. Dalji's loved one.
Today, in Christmas tomorrow, the natives are going to get the benefit of two plans as Christmas gifts.
In one way, the plan started in November second.
What's the castles between the country, the village, the city, the educational, and the observers, and how can the cashless be spent in the money, how to buy the goods without the rupee, the atmosphere of a specific ambiguity around.
Everyone wants to learn and learn each other.
In order to encourage this, the Government of India is initiating incentives for consumers and small businessmen to become e-payment habits for mobile banking.
This is not just a day today, but this plan has started from today to 100 days.
Every day fifteen thousand people get a gift of thousand rupees.
For hundreds of days, millions of rupees are available to families, and you are deserving gifts through denial of digital payments like mobile banking, e-banking, rupe card, UPI and USSD.
DG-Dhan trade union is mainly meant to traders.
This plan has been designed in all sections of society, especially the poor and the lower sections of the middle class.
So those who buy more than 50 rupees and more than 3000 rupees get this gift.
Those who buy more than three thousand rupees don't get this gift.
Feature phones, ordinary phones, can buy goods, sales, money can be closed, and they'll be the best of this plan.
This 30 million people can be part of the present plan soon.
I know if you ask them that all the next young people know these things, they'll tell you all, and they'll have children studying in your family and 10 and 12, and they'll tell them all well.
You're just as simple as you're sending the Watts of messages through the mobile phone.
Dear people, how to use technology and how to do e-payment, knowledge about online payments is very fast in the country.
In the last few days, cashless business has increased 200-300 times.
The Indian government has taken a big decision to encourage this.
It's a good idea to the business community how big this decision is.
The dealer who pays the digital is encouraging the online payment system, instead of looking at their business, in return for income tax.
And the Chief Minister of Andra.
Someone claimed that Asam government had decided to make 10 percent of the reduction of material and license fees in digitalisation.
If the branches of rural banks make at least two digital deals between their 75 percent dealers between January and March, they get a gift of fifty thousand rupees from the government.
On March 31, 2017, the villages that have been digital transacting 100 percent have been declared to be a gift of 5 lakh rupees as per the government's for digital transmission plan.
They also declared the Designal Krishak Shiromani scheme, according to which the first 10 farmers who have been paying a digital payment to buy sweets and cattle will pay five thousand rupees.
Assam congratulates the government and congratulates all the governments on the beginnings of this kind.
Several organizations embraced the victorious methods of encouraging digital dealings among poor farmers in the village.
The GNFC-Gujarat Narmadawali Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited artists focused mainly on the roots, established thousands of POS machines at the centres of sales centers and in a few days it has been done in just two weeks to give five lakh chocolate digital payments to three thousand farmers.
The most interesting thing is that GNFC's growth was 27 percent more than last year.
A country like India must be in the first place in this field.
Our youngsters have made a lot of progress in the startup.
This digital movement is a golden one.
With new ideas and new technologies, our youth have to give greater importance to this region with new plans.
So we can be part of the country's wealth and strength in order to get rid of corruption.
Dear people, I ask people first in Manki Batt every month to share your opinions, tell you to say.
Thousands of opinions received this time from MiGow and Nurrendramodi App were about 80-90 percent of the struggle against corruption and corruption.
Some people have explained that there are many other problems and inconveniences to the people.
Another guy wrote that it was a good thing for the country's goodness, and it is another thing to find out how many thiefs are going on and how many new ways of belief.
I'm grateful to the people to help me write so much letters.
"Like the words of Gurumani Kewal, it appears in every corner of the country.
We're all recognized.
When people are suffering, who are the people who are not suffering from it when they are suffering from problems.
I feel the same pain as you have.
I know clearly that if there are hundreds of twenty-five million people standing together, nothing is impossible and people are the image of God and the glory of the people is God's glory.
I thank the people for the enthusiasm of the people in this great manifestation against corruption and corruption.
The law is the same to everyone.
Individuals, organisations, or political parties, everybody must rule.
Those who cannot apparently support corruption and corruption are trying to find out the deficiencies of the government.
This government is for the common people.
He is constantly trying to know the opinions of the people.
What is the problem of the people, the reason for which law is the problem, the solution that can be found.
As a government that has always been sensitive, how many rules have to be changed by considering the comforts of the people, the goal is to reduce the problems of the people.
On the other hand, I already said it was an unusual fight, the eighth date.
For 70 years, how many powers have been mixed up in corruption and corruption.
How much is their strength
When they are determined to fight with such people, new methods are being used daily to defeat the government.
The government and the government have to adopt new methods to defeat those methods when they ignore new methods.
If you're one, I'm gonna ten, because it's decided to make corrupt people, thieves, without the country.
On the other hand, what kind of thiefs are going on, how they find new methods and other information letters are found from many.
In this case, I would like to offer my heart's pleasure to the loved natives.
The number of information that the government has in the system is more and more information from the general public.
It is often possible to win, because the common people are waking up.
Who can imagine how dangerous people in my country are to challenge to bring light of such malicious powers
The third man who writes the letter is very much, and they say, "Modiji, don't be weak, don't stand, don't stand, how hard the legs may be, it's necessary to go back to the target."
I don't want to thank the writers, especially because they have faith in their letters, and Ashishward.
I took it out, made a strong "Benamy Wealth Act".
The law will start working on it in the coming days.
For the nation, whatever you do for reproduction, it will be predicted.
I told you last time in Manki Bath that our farmers had improved the recode last year in the fielding of these troubles.
It's a good news about the fiscal sector.
In the world economy, India has proudly established its name in many areas, as a result of the continuous subversion of our people, India's rise in global ranking through different indicators.
India's rank has risen in the Wald Bank's Doing business report.
According to the August deposit report released by Dutch Italy, India's position in 'Top Prospective Host Economics for 2016-18' is the third.
India's 32-rang in the Global Competition Report of the World Economic Fore.
In the Global Innovation Industries 2016, we have forwarded 16 seats, and the Logistics Performance Industries of the World Bank has increased 19 rang in 2016.
Even if many other reports are evaluated, the same way is progressing, India is fast moving forward.
But in this situation sometimes it's very happy to see something going on.
The government is committed to the divine people.
I tried personally to speed up this move.
My goal was to get the right to the people of the divine and to get respect.
When we got four medals in Paralimbics, our divine brothers and sisters were powerful in our effort and trust.
They not only raised the pride of the nation through that victory, but they marvelled their capabilities.
Our divine brothers are wealthy and powerless as all the citizens of the country.
I am very happy to have the chances of gaining employment to Divisional people after the law is passed to the people of Divine.
The government has increased the limits of communication to 4 percent.
Through this law, special departments have been formed in regard to the education, other facilities and complaints of the Divine.
In the last two years, the government has organised four and a half sepulchres in the last two years of the government's reconciliation in the matter of the Divine, which has spent Rs 352 crore and has been distributed to fifty thousand brothers and fifty thousand sisters.
The government has passed the new law according to the wishes of the United Nations.
Before Divyangar was seven types.
Thalassemia, Parkinson and the dog are included in this group, my young friends.
For the last few weeks, the news that came from the games was proud of us.
It is natural for us to be proud as Indians.
The Indian Cricket Team won four virtues against England.
Some of these young sports were pleasant.
Kohli, the test captain, gave a good leadership with a good batting.
Offspinner of the Indian Cricket Team, Bowler Ar.
Junior Hockey team made the voluntary cup.
After fifteen years, Junior Hockey's team is getting a wood ship.
Many greetings to the youth for this gain.
This is good news for the Indian Hockey team.
Last month, our gentlemen wondered.
India's Great Hockey team also acquired Asian Champions Trophy, now a few days ago, in the Andar 18 Asian ship, India's Great Hockey Team Wenglemade.
Cricket, Hockey, congratulate all the players of the teams with heart.
Man Ki Bath, November 2016
In the last month, we were celebrating Diwali.
Some wrote poems, some picked up pictures, some came in cartoons, some made video.
I mean, how many houses were turned into military posts.
I am surprising to see how imaginative and visionful I see these letters.
With all your partnership, the book will be prepared by giving you the imagination of the country's army and the security arrangements for all of you.
A young man wrote to me, the chief minister, we'll take all the celebrations like Holi and Deepawali to the soldiers on the border.
Every moment we're thinking of protecting the country.
But you'll remember the house in the celebrations.
But it didn't happen this time if you tell the truth.
Festival, there's no thought of not at home.
We also felt like celebrating Diwali with hundreds of thousands of Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the soldiers, the strength of the army increases 125 million times.
A few days ago, all the heads of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir came to see.
They were the people of Jammu and Kashmir, the people of Confronts.
There were about 40-50 people from each village in the Kashmir Valley.
I got time to talk to them for a while.
But when talking was over, things like the situation in the valley, the law and order and the future of the children were very natural.
I'm glad I've got the word that I gave to all the rural chiefs from the Kashmir Valley.
They went to the village and awakened people from far off places.
About 95 percent of the children from Kashmir participated in the test a few days ago.
In the board exam, so many children attended, that our children in Jammu and Kashmir were determined to hold new heights of development through education for a happy future.
It was said that on 8 November at 8 a.m. when he spoke to the nation, a great move to bring about changes in the country began.
It must be done as important as it is... and I thought we had to face many problems in our normal life.
I told you that it would take 50 days to get out of the effect of this decision, and that it would be possible to return to normal ground after 50 days.
Notes of 500 and 1000, such a big country, such a large number of currency and millions of notes, are looking forward to the world, and all financial experts are humiliating it.
The hundred twenty-five million people in India see if they are able to overcome the problems.
There's a question mark in front of the world.
Twenty-twenty-thirds of India's people are honored.
There is a lot of faith that this decision will win, and our country will prove to be like gold.
That's why you're the citizens here, you're somebody, and you're not able to find this way to victory.
Throughout the country, the central government and state governments, all the factors of local technological institutions, one lakh and thirty thousand bank branches, millions of bankers, more than 1.5 lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are working in the morning with dedicated dedication.
Between different types of mental tensions, they are very calm and calm and enjoying it as a patriotism, as an attempt to make a great change.
Starting in the morning, working without knowing when the night is over.
All the officers of the bank and the post office are working in such a difficult situation.
When it comes to humanity, they seem to be two sides.
There was an accident in Khandwa
Suddenly we need money
It was very happy to know when he went to the old man's house to get the money for treatment.
A number of such stories are known daily by talking to TV, media, newspapers and others.
I'm encouraging the poor, encouraging their accounts, or trying to save the money by doing something else to them.
But please don't play with poor people's life.
He said, sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare.
Madhya Pradesh, from Tharli village of Taluk of Harda district.
It will enjoy the people, and the culture is very important for nation building.
I'm with the country.
It's very pleased to take the withdrawal of cashews and thousand notes.
You want to thank you, because nobody thought you'd be doing such a big step when you said you'd be on your own day.
Aunt and a thousand notes read good lessons to investigators and corrupters.
Every Indian soldier doesn't have a better day.
People from all over the world also learned to say that the tea paper was discussed.
But I didn't know she was married to the Chai Pe Church.
I know there was a wedding with Chai Pae Church on November 17.
In the city of Gujarat, a girl gave tea to all those who came to her wedding.
No procession, there was no food programs, because the notes were reversed because the money was a little difficult.
People find the best ways in a tragedy.
People find their own ways.
Did you see this change
A large number of people with relationships, who don't want to ask anybody, they don't pay properly, and their drunkards will be left.
If all the municipalities get 50 percent of the debt.
But this time, because of this decision on the eighth day, everyone ran to close their old notes.
Last year, in 47 cities, three thousand three thousand and three hundred crore were slaughtered.
You'll be surprised and glad to hear this, and this week you've been backed into a hand of 10,000 crores.
There are many such examples that can be seen directly.
Brothers, our villages, our farmers are stronger in the economy of this country.
On one side, due to this new change in the economy, all citizens are fighting with it in the midst of difficulties.
According to the printer plan, there is an improvement in their debt.
According to the Mudra plan, millions of rupees have been given to young people like this, because millions of people are doing these small businesses and are fasting for millions of rupees.
But it was natural for them to suffer from this decision.
But now our small businessmen, through technology, through mobile banking, serve their own way through credit cards, and businesses on the basis of faith.
I want to tell this little businessman that you're also supposed to enter the digital world.
You also do download off banks on mobile phones.
Keep POS machines to use credit cards.
That's why I invite you.
I'm sure you can bring this technology to the entire business of your village.
Don't let anybody kiss you.
You know, I know the young girls in my country liked my decision.
I know you support this decision.
I know you're going to share this thing in a better way.
Friends, you're my real soldiers, my best friends.
We have a surprising opportunity to serve motherhood, this is the opportunity to take to the country's economic supremacy.
My young men, can you help me
Your family might not have known the gentlemen, the parents, the parents, the parents and the parents.
You know what's up, online banking, all know how to book online tickets.
This is a common thing for you, you use it.
But today the country wants to build a society without notice.
It's true that there is no society that cannot be a hundreds of people without notice.
But we can't change as a little visualized society
If you start building a little-hour society once, you're not going to be far away from the unsubscribed society.
You know, for a non-sighted society, for digital banking, or for mobile banking, what are the chances today.
All banks provide online facility.
All banks in India have mobile apps.
All banks have their own wallets.
Walt means e-person.
There are many types of cards available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, there are hundreds of crores of poor families in India.
The use of rope cards used in a very small amount was 300 times more than the eighth date.
Like prepaid cards on mobile phones, prepaid cards are available to spend money from the bank.
Not only this, it's getting simple technology without a big smart phone.
I swore to make these arrangements more simple.
All banks try it.
My young friends, even though all this is a big generation that doesn't know.
I know you're all working on this great thing.
I see the creative messages you've given in the WTS hospital - poems, poems, short stories, cartoons, new imaginations and jealousy.
Yet, my dear young friends, I'm telling you again, I need your help in this.
Your mobile phone will be available for online expenses.
Not only that, every day, half an hour, at least two hours a day, teach how to use this technology to ten families, how to download the bank's off-down, how to spend the money in your account and how to give it to the debtor.
Whenever you teach people how to use rubber cards, the poor will please you.
If you read all this to the ordinary people, they may get rid of all the troubles.
I don't think it'll take more time if all the youths of India are involved in this matter.
Within a month, we can present a new India before the world.
You can do this through your mobile phone, you can go to ten homes every day, and connect ten homes every day.
I'm inspiring you, come on, not just support, but we'll be the soldiers of this change, rest on change.
We'll take this war to bring the country out of corruption and money.
That country was a revolution.
My beloved young men, I once again ask you to take this move forward.
All schools, colleges, universities, ENCCs, ENSS, and I intend to do this together.
Let's take it forward.
We have a chance to make a better service to the country.
You shouldn't lose this chance.
You'll see, the most well-known artist of this century, Amitabh's purifying prize leads to heart.
It seems that purity is spread over his molecules, so he remembered his father's birth anniversary and his purity.
He wrote a verse of a poem of Harivansh Rai, "Man body, joyful mind, drunken life, that's me.
" (Mitti Kaman, Masti Ka Man, Knan husband, ) His son, Mr. Ottabhaji's nerves flows like blood.
He has written to me with the poem of Harivansh Raiji: "Pleasant body, clean mind, clean India, that's what I am."
Harivanshrai ji is honored.
Thanks to all of you.
Deepawali is celebrated with enthusiasm and happiness in every corner of India.
India is a country to celebrate any festival in any corner of the country 365 days.
We've seen the courage to finish undesirable festivals.
Festival changes have been naturally adopted according to the needs of the time and society.
Do it through festivals.
Our ancestors dealt with these things very scientifically with festivals.
Today, we talk about the environment all over the world.
The trees , trees , rivers , animals , mountains , birds , were the festivals that give responsibility to everyone.
That is, in our country there was a tradition of celebrations with the brahmins and sciences of the holidays.
When we celebrate Deepawali today, as I said, our celebrations and knowledge comes with knowledge.
This Deepavali gives the message of Tamaso Maa Jyotirgamaya from darkness to light.
All the parts of the house clean up the floor.
This nature and tradition must be a little more vast.
Deepavali is no longer in the border of India.
Deepavali is remembered and celebrated in every country of the world in a different way.
Many governments of the world , the parliaments there and the rulers there are part of the Deepavali festival .
Whether the eastern countries or the western countries or the developed countries, the eastern countries, the eastern countries, the eastern countries, the eastern countries, the eastern countries, the eastern countries, the eastern countries, the eastern countries, the eastern countries, the eastern countries, the eastern countries, the eastern countries, the eastern countries.
Canada's Prime Minister Deepawali has been shot in the film.
In Britain's Prime Minister London, Divali joined all the communities and arranged a business, he also participated.
What's in that picture...
The Prime Minister of Australia has encouraged the people of different cities of Australia to participate in the Deepawali festival with the pleasure of Deepawali to the Indian society.
Last day, the Prime Minister of New ealand came.
He said he had to return soon to attend the Deepawali festival.
Deepawali, this festival of light seems to be a festival of inspiration to bring the world to light from darkness and darkness.
Grandma, to teach the parents, when children break down, adults must stand closer, carelessly, and abstain from a little fear in the mind.
The Deepavali festival in our country is a little longer.
Chhath Puja festival is a big festival in the eastern parts of India .
If I tell you about Deepavali, it's a chance for you to enjoy the sixth pooja.
But don't thank the locals, it's a chance to express gratitude.
Because of the events that have been happening for the past several months, our people have served their own supremacy for our peace and peace.
When we celebrate Deepawali, our people are suffering from all kinds of problems, some in the desert, some in the peak of the Himalayas, some watch the industrialists, some watch the airports...
How many responsibilities do you deny
Words, birds, thumbs, colors, innumerable visions...
I can imagine how proud the people of my country are.
Pleasure, pleasure, because you're rejoicing, I'm telling the truth that because of my freedom, and the gift of happiness, because you're quietly, because you're on the border, the mountain, the ambrosia and the flower of India wears you, and I'm supposed to wear the calm as you are.
) My dear neighbors, a sister Shivaani filled with the houses of his father and husband, gave me a message on the telephone.
Come on, let's hear what the military family says.
- Namas, Prime Minister, I am talking to Shivani Mohan.
Our soldiers' brothers are very encouraged to start this programme called Deepawali.
I'm from a military family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and husband's father were officers in Armi.
I mean my family is full of soldiers.
The officers in the border get a lot of encouragement, and everybody in the Army Circular gets encouragement.
The army officers and their families and their wives are doing a lot of excitement with the Solicitors.
There's a good message for the military group, and you enjoy Deepawali's wishes.
My dear neighbors, we can see soldiers staying on the border, not only in the border but in every field of life.
Even if there were natural disasters, if the law had to face the enemies, it would have been dared to bring the wrongdoing youth back... and all the lands of our people's life are working with nationalism.
The first Sikki, now the Himachal Pradesh, and the Kerala will be the same for November 1.
His village's name, Binhana.
He was there, and there was talk of making the toilet.
Some families didn't see how to build a toilet because of financial hardship.
Vikas Thakur worked, and gave 57 families a thousand rupees from his pocket and gave him his sweetness.
With that, the Himachal Pradesh has the power to make Operation Defection free.
In the jungles far away from Kerala, there is no way to go, but a tribal village that can hardly reach the whole day.
People don't go there.
Credit, National Service Skym's well-known workers and engineering students decided to make their own toilets there.
It's going on in every state.
Something I've just said.
As participants in this greatness, the citizens of these states rejoice in their contribution to the blindness of the destruction of the country.
My dear natives, the government's plans will be very much, and after the first plan, the first plan is to leave.
But generally nobody cares about these things.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always guided to us.
You decide on this decree.
Now we have to face the awakening hopes of poverty in the country, which is necessary for time.
Now there are toilets for girls in school, boys have toilets.
Twenty-five is the first century and it is no longer possible to be blind in the village.
That's why the program of electricity is going on successfully to get rid of the blindness of the village.
Efforts are being made to give smoking free life to 5 million families, moving forward to victory.
Little businessmen, small businessmen, vegetable businessmen, milk sellers, squirrels, squirrels, were trapped in the clutches of robbers.
The printer plan, the Stand-up plan, the Genetic Account, are successful programs to get rid of the robbers.
On the other hand, deposit the money directly to the looted bank, and pay the dedicator directly.
It's a chance for common people to get rid of the middle class.
My dear natives, on October 31, tomorrow, the great prince of this country gave life to the unity of India, and the life-saving Sadar is the birth anniversary of the grand grandfather of the soldier.
On October 31, on one side is the occasion of Sardar Sahab's victory, the birth day of the lifetime of the nation's unity
I think he's successful in it, and he mixed everyone together.
On that day, Idira Gandhi was defected and we could say that the country's oppression or bad luck.
At the birthplace of the great man who lived for unity, at the birthplace of Sardar, you give us a pain in history.
Stay away from the concerns of the separations and the acts of the separations, and the country.
The journey of Sardar Sahab's life began in the fight for the artists.
He was the son of the farmer.
Sardar Sahab's great and great contribution to bringing freedom to the treasury.
Now, sometimes we hear the name of Aul.
Even today, people outside India know all the products of the pomegranate, but little people know that the co-operative Milk Producers had thought of the Union was the result of Sardar Sahab's divine vision.
He gave importance to this thinking in 1942.
We are obviously in front of the farmer's well-known and prosperous base.
I respect Sardar Sahab.
In this solitary day, on October 31, we must remember Sardar Sahab anywhere, and understand the idea of unity.
My dear countrymen, this festival of Deepavali is a glimpse of Karthik Purnima, which is the light festival.
The knowledge given by Guru Nanak Dev is a guide not only to Hindustan but also to the whole of humanity.
The message of Guru Nanak Dev was good for everyone, truthfulness.
When there were deformities of foolishness, jealousy and hypocrisy, Guru Nanak Dev Bhai Lalo became his colleague.
Let's follow the wiseness that we inspire to leave the differences, to do something against the differences... and if we have to move forward with the mantra called Subka Sath, Subka Vikas, who is a better way than the God of Guru Nanak.
Guru Nanak Dev and Pranamas are on the occasion of this light festival.
My dear countrymen, once more in the name of the people of the country, on the occasion of this Deepavali, there are many museums for you.
Your dreams and imaginations can be fulfilled in all respects.
Your life is comfortable and peaceful.
Narendermodi, on September 20, 2016, at 11 a.m. in the morning, the Indian population's exclusive launch through the air.
My dear natives, you're all greetings.
In a terrorist attack on Jammu and Kashmir's Orissa sector last week, we lost 18 virgins of our country.
I love all these heroics and pay attention to them.
This loss was lost by the son, the brother was lost, not only of those families who lost her husband.
My dear neighbors, we believe in our army.
We're in our army.
There are many occasions to talk to traditional and political leaders.
All parents want every school and college to start functioning completely.
The peasants also want their crops and fruits to come to the markets of India.
I mean, the financial business also wants to be right.
For the past few days, business has started working properly.
We all know that peace and unity and harmony are through our problems and through our progress and through development.
For our future generation, we need to hold new heights of vision.
I believe we'll find peace together for all the problems, and the coming generation of Kashmir will prove to be the right way.
The security of the people of Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
The government will have to take some steps to continue the law.
The use of our power and regulations is for regulation, and for the comfortable and peaceful lives of the common people of Kashmir, which I would like to tell the security forces to maintain our security forces properly.
Sometimes those who think differently from what we're thinking, reflect new ideas.
I have a chance to know many things from the social media in the next time.
From all corners of India, there is a chance to understand and understand the feelings of every kind of people, which encourages the power of democracy.
Last day a child named Harshvardhan of the eleventh class presented a different idea before me.
He wrote, I was so upset after the hostility of Uri... and I wanted to do something.
But I don't know what to do, like me, what a little student can do.
Yes, the child presented it with a genuine perspective.
But when the war took place in 1965, we were led by Lail Bahadur Scientist, and there was an excitement all over the country, jealousy, humiliation of patriotism.
Everyone wanted to walk something, I thought to do something.
Lail Bahadur scientific worked very well to sympatheticize this territorial surface of the country.
He inspired the common people of the country to work for the country by giving a mantra called Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan.
Between the bombs and guns, Lail Bahodoor scientists showed that there would be other ways for all men to show patriotism.
Mahatma Gandhi also led the strike for freedom, and when the strike was strong, it was a very effective way to return that power to the community, if it felt a step forward for the strike.
Let us and the army demonstrate their responsibilities, let those who rule their rituals, if we possess all the patriots with the zeal of this country's patriotism, the country will surely win new heights.
Dear neighbors, Mr. T.
Carthique Nrendramodi, wrote to me, starving history, that went to participate in Paralimbiques, their performance is the victory of human intelligence, Human Spirit.
Not only of you, but all the people of the country have joined our players in Paralimbique.
Perhaps more paralytics than the game and the gain of our players have completely changed human vision to divine perspective.
I don't forget the words of our victorious sister Deepa Malik.
When the medal was received, the sister said, through this medal, I defeated indifference.
There's a lot of power in these words.
This time, in Para Olympics, 19 women, including three women from our country, joined the lights.
In comparison to other games, more than physical efficiency in divine games, greater than the imagination of games, will and determination.
You'll be surprised to know that our players have achieved 4 medals of the greatest benefits so far - two gold, one silver, one silver and one silver, the second in Volt and the gold medal after 12 years.
He was losing his hand because he was injured.
You think a man would have obtained a gold medal at the age of twentie, and then at the age of thirteen, to get the second gold medal.
Marypin got gold medal in Tangvelu Haijam.
Thanks to Thankselu only lost his right hand in five years.
And poverty doesn't interrupt his vision.
He's not a living man in a big city, not a middle class family.
Though it leads a painful life, physical hardships are sure to get a medal for the country.
If it's Light Deepamalik, there's a lot of victories.
Come on, C.
Venkala medals are available in the huge hydrum.
It is also important that in our country, in our society, we are inspired to look at the divine brothers of our neighbors.
We awakened our compassion, and we must change our perspective of this divine glory.
A few days ago, there were hiding competitions in the same place.
Anybody can think that even the recognition of the general Olympics is corrected by the divine.
This time it's going on.
In the coming days, India is trying to make a facilitator for the promotion of Para Olympics.
My dear neighbors, last week I had a very wonderful experience in the Navazari of Gujarat.
It was a terrible moment for me.
I told the people who were there... people were surprised.
Then I got an opportunity to illuminate a book, in which some of the victorious stories of the life of the Divine.
It was a very exciting event.
I think it's a very important thing to establish the world's record on the land of the Indian government.
Within eight hours, the people of fourteen divine people could be able to do their works that can't hear.
It got a place in the Ginns Book of World Records.
It means that the country has stepped hundreds of feet to purity.
It was sure to see what's going on in the right direction and how good the consequences are and what's going on in a little effort.
That's why, whether all the common men, rulers, government officials, the bus stand, whether the school or college, or the school college, or the hospital, from the children to the elders, the poor villages and the peasants, all play their part in the purity.
The media's friends also shared a genuine share.
For health, to glorify the traditions, especially the mothers and sisters, the syndrome of the open space should be finished.
So the Open Defection Free (ODF) has begun to generate the open space decay.
A healthy competition is being held between the states and the states, the districts.
The states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will be successful in the way of evacuation from the open habit.
Come on, let's move closer.
Especially in the next time, I predict to present a plan to young friends who use technology in a big way.
Everyone has the right to know what's in your city of purity, so Indians have given a number - 1969.
We know Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969 we celebrated the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019 we went to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi .
By calling on this number of 1969, you can understand the conditions of the construction of the toilets, but you can request to build the toilet.
You'll make a profit from it.
Not only this, there has been a clear beginning to know about the problems related to purity and the solution of those complaints.
You can use it as much as possible, especially the new generation.
Indians have been asked to go ahead with the corporate world.
Sponsor the young professionals who want to work for purity.
In the districts, they can be sent to the fallo.
In today's era, health is associated with purity, and purity is also a model of its own.
And the dirt must be part of it.
So, with the purity mission, we must turn to the West Two Compost.
Fertilizer told companies that they should be prepared to buy compounds made from dirt.
The ministers from all over the country, the chief ministers, the mayors and commissioners from the great towns, are going to purge only deep discussions about purity.
What can you do with technology
How can we create jobs through this
There will be discussions on all such issues.
I've seen new news coming out of purity.
The next day I went to the newspaper that students from the University of Technology went to 107 villages to initiate awareness of the construction of the school.
They used their subordinate power to make about nine thousand schools, a team of Wing Commander Paramvir Singh's proposed a clear message from Devprayag to Gangasagar to 2800 kms.
Every department of the Indian government has prepared Timetable for one year.
I'm supposed to teach the men that they don't interfere with them in the functions of these departments.
There's a surveillance surveillance.
Initially purification of 73 cities was presented in front of the people .
Now there are more than one lakh population of 500 Old towns.
This time we're back, next time we're gonna have a confidence in doing something better in every city.
On October 2, this is the birth day of Mahatma Gandhi and Lail Bahadur scientist.
It's been two years since Switzerland Mission started.
This will prove to be the light of Deepawali's house and this time on October 2, Sunday.
I don't want to be myself involved in removing the waste as a coloured one, two hours, four hours.
In the memory of Mahatma Gandhi and Lail Bahadurist, we can determine something to do for the country.
Joe of Giving Wheek is going to be celebrated in many cities from October 2 to 8.
It's an act of reconciliating food, clothes and things to the needy.
The monetary day begins today for the centuries of the teacher.
The universal and universal, universal sympathy is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the welfare of the man who lived in the last end.
How can the poor people get the quality of development
Let the attention of the society, the governments and everybody concentrate on how poor people can get the benefit of development.
It's a symbolic form of poverty welfare year, all of us were inspired by our physicians, with respect to the superintendent of the honorary monetary day that was rich with our physics.
My dear neighbors, I started Manki Batt in the day of Vijay Dasamy two years ago.
I've attempted myself not to be a program that the government has done.
This mankie bat should not be a program of political guerrillas and accusations.
How is the common man in this country inspire me
That is, Mankie Bath is not a reception 15-20 minutes ago, but a new chance of social change has increased.
Anybody would be more happy than that.
Narendra Modi, on August 20, 2016, at 11 a.m. in the morning, the Indian population's exclusive launch through the airways is the Malayalam transformation.
My dear neighbors, on August 29, Hockey Mantrik is the birthday of Dhanchand.
He played an important part in India's gold medal in Hockey in 1928 and 1932 and 1936 simplicity competitions.
We've heard the name of Bradman, all we love cricket.
He told me about meditation, "His Scores Gols Lyc Runs."
Dhanchandji was a living example of Sportsman Spirit and country love.
Once in a game in Kolkata a protester was killed by Hockeystick on the head of Dhyanchand.
Then there was 10 minutes left to end the game.
Dhanchand said he had three goals in ten minutes and responded to the goals.
My beloved natives, when Manki Bath comes, there are many opinions in Migav or Nurnimodi app.
Diversity is full.
But this time everyone wants to say something about Rio Olympics.
I'm very hoping to see the common citizens so close to the Olympics and so awake and the Prime Minister of the country to say something about it.
There is so much of love and sorrow among the citizens of India in respect of games without cricket.
Our daughters have once proven that they're not far behind anybody.
It seems that the women in India have taken a mission to capture India.
The summit in MiGov wrote that we could have performed better than the hijackers.
He wrote, "For the first time we won two medals in Reo, the modern Modelser.
But I would like to take care of you if our performance is good.
Our parents still concentrate on studies and academic issues.
Society still considers Sports to lose time.
It's necessary to change this thinking.
The enthusiasm of the society must be increased.
Nobody can do this better than that.
We can't deny that we can't do a demonstration like we're hungry.
Some of our players have a good performance in India, but they don't expect a good performance here.
We got only two medals in the medal list.
But if we don't get the medal, we'll see our stars showing good performance in different ways.
Well, in the shooting, our congratulations reached Bindraj's fourth position, and he lost the medal in a very small difference.
This is what happened in Tennis about Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopen and Jodi.
We showed good performance in the lexics.
The first time in 32 years after Usha, Laila Babar got the eligible for Track and Field Film.
It's a pleasure to know the women's hockey team arrived in Olympics after 36 years.
For the first time in the last 36 years, the man went to Hockey to the outstage.
Our team is very strong.
Many players, such as Aditya Ashok, Dattoo Bhokanal, and his thirst, were good.
But, dear neighbors, we have to do a lot of things.
But if you do more like you do, perhaps we'll be disappointed again.
We'll make a framework about how we can be better.
The plan must be prepared with a far-reaching thinking like 2020, 2024, 2028.
Imagine what we can do in the Sports field and what we can do to each state.
States must choose one or two of their own kinds of power.
I'm advising Sparts Associations that they must neutrally discuss.
I'm asking every citizen of India to give me the opinion of Norendramodi on anyone who wants it.
We're gonna get ready.
Dear neighbors, September 5 is a teacher day.
I spent a lot of years with students in the teacher's day and spent time as a student.
I learned a lot of things from small children.
For me, it was the day of September 5 teachers and the day of teaching.
But this time I have to go to join the G20 afternoon, so I decided to express my disgust in Mankiba.
As much as she has in life, she's a teacher.
I've seen teachers afflicted with more than myself.
They offer life for their disciples, for their students.
Now, after Rio Olympics, I hear a discussion about Punela Gopichand.
In the teacher's day, I select his way of enjoying his dedication to Pulela Gopichand, his penance to Sports, his students' victory.
We always feel the contribution of teachers in our life.
September 5, the former President of India, Dr.
Sarvepali is the birth anniversary of Radhakrishnanji, the country is celebrating this day as a teacher.
I remember many stories of my teachers because our heroes were teachers in our small village.
Even today, he seems to teach me in classroom.
I'll tell you he's giving me the Carspondence course.
It's wondering if he sees his signature in this nineteenth year, he'll write so beautiful literatures even in this age.
I'm very honored to see someone's good character because I'm very bad.
My dear countrymen, the Ganesh festival is coming closer.
Ganeshan changes the dissolutions... of our country, of our society, of our family and of each other's life.
The general festival started, the world-wide tribe, through which he turned this religious festival into a moment to awaken the country.
Even today, Ganesha festival has started going on not only in Maharashtra but in all the corners of India.
Every young man makes a lot of preparations for this festival, it will be very exciting.
Some people are still trying to persuade the disorder that the world's people have put forward.
Speechs about public issues, articles, flowers are performed.
The topics that touch society in its scenes are presented very artistically.
There is a great advance of public education that runs through the Ganesh festival.
The world-wide Thilakan gave inspiration that Swaraj was our birth-made right.
But we live in free India.
It's true that the festival is the strength of society.
Festival makes a new life for the life of man and society.
Life is impossible without the festival, but it has to be formed according to the time.
This time many people wrote to me about the Ganesha festival and the worship of Durga.
You can use Ganeshji made of soil in the village pond .
The statues made of the Plaster of Paris are not suitable for the environment.
He's too many other pains.
We can return to our ancient heritage by making statues of Ganesh and Durga Devi in order to teach me and you.
Ganesh is a madman.
Therefore, we shouldn't make Ganesh, who makes a break.
I don't know how much you're going to accept, but it's not me, but many say.
Many such institutions are very impressed and propagated to create a soil genesis.
Environmental friendly Ganesha festival is also a social service.
If the river of the lake is made with a ring then it melts again in itself and there is no harm to the environment .
You all have many good wishes of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna will declare Madar Terresa sacred on September 4.
Mother Terresa used to serve the poor in India throughout his life.
It is natural for all Indians to feel proud to have a holy position for Mother Tresa, who has served the poor throughout the life.
In this festival on September 4, for 125 crore people, the Indian government is sending an official representative group under the leadership of our foreign minister Shrimati Sushama Swaraj.
We can learn something from saints, shimmers, men and great men.
We're getting something, studying, doing something good.
My dear natives, how many changes are there when development is a generated.
People's power is considered to be another form of God.
In the past, the Indian government has made a successful attempt to connect the people to clean the Ganges for the construction of Ganga with the help of five state governments.
On 20th this month a group of village chiefs on the banks of the Ganges called in Allahabad .
I enjoy greetings to the ministries and ministers associated with the Indian government to bring this idea into the midst.
I thank the Chief Ministers and the five states in the name of the great legend of cleaning the Ganges with the power of the people .
Dear neighbors, some things sometimes touch my mind, sometimes those people who make ideas have a special respect in my mind.
On July 15, more than one-and-a-half million students in more than 1700 schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collected letters to their parents.
Some wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi, some wrote in Chhattisgarhi.
They told their parents that they needed toilet toilets in their homes.
That's why they asked, some people wrote that they didn't celebrate their birthday this year, but they must have made toilets.
That's what we inspire.
A sixteen-year-old girl in Coppal district of Karnataka is not a girl... who made her honesty with her family.
The family wasn't financially able.
The kid stayed in the centuries.
The village chief Mohammad Shafi, who knew he was sworn in for malm defecation, arranged a ten thousand rupees and made toilets within a week.
The male girl's strength and the chief of the village like Mohammad Shafi are congratulating.
My beloved natives, selfishness is the dream of all Indians.
Some Indians are definite.
Some Indians have made it their goal.
Web site will get information about this.
On October 2, Gandhi Jayanti will give the priesthood to the victors in this short film competition.
I'm telling TV channels that you're gonna come out to make films like this, and you're gonna play the game.
The activity and the manufacturing of the dirt, the new mirrors, the new methods, the new inspiration...
It's going to be a part of people and ordinary artists, not a big studio or a big camera to make films.
Many maybe the president wants to inaugurate a radio channel.
But this isn't a radio channel, it's a big step.
We have Bangladesh in the neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
Here ' Akashwani Mythri ' and ' Bangladesh Bethar ' where they will share their programs each other and the two sides of the Bangladeshi people will enjoy the activities of Akashwani .
The skies of the sky are very big in making personal relations.
President inaugurated it.
I thank Bangladesh for their involvement with us in this.
I enjoy the best wishes of the sky to share myself abroad.
My dear neighbors, you could have served as prime ministers, but I am a man like you.
Sometimes some virtual events touch my heart.
Such hypocrisy incidents offer new energy, inspire and inspire the people of India to do something.
Millions of mothers in India, who are suffering from their own suffering and helping others.
My dear natives, we suffered due to forgiveness last year, but this August month has suffered problems due to continuous rains.
Some parts of the country have been flooded again.
State governments, central governments, local independents, social institutions and citizens have tried a lot to do whatever they do.
But I heard the news about the whites and some other stories... that must be more remembered.
Whatever the power of unity, if it goes together, it will remind you of this year's month of August.
Agast 2016, the strong political variety of parties, together with nearly 90 parties in the country and all the parties in the parliament, accompanied by GSD rules.
Its credit is for all parties.
It's an example of how big things can happen if all parties are together in one direction.
Likewise, all the political parties in the country spoke together in the same heaven about the events in Kashmir and its situations.
I believe in the power of hundred twenty-five million people.
This morning I had a chance to spend with a few young people from Delhi.
In the coming days, I think all the youths of the country are dripping in the colors of the zealousy of the games of himpics.
The world's gyms.
In the coming days, we must do something to encourage our players everywhere.
I'm sure you'll get the messages that you're playing in the 'Narendramodi Ap' site.
Come on, let's all try to enhance the ends and souls of all our stars together and appreciate their efforts.
On this occasion, when I talk to you about Rio Olympics, I'll call you a poem sent to Suraj Prakash, a student of the Punjab Central School, who wants to poetry.
There are many other poems like this, he must have written such poems, some will write again, some will have musical poems.
I want to share with you the poem Suraj has sent me.
The young man named Shriman Angith Karke reminded me of the anniversary of the former President Abdul Kalam.
That's why your government has inspired Mr. Angli to ask what actions have been taken to test Abdullah Kalam's dreams.
The next century will be guided by technology.
If someone tries to capture it, then it will appear in a new surveillance far away, and if we want to join technology, we must be in front of it.
That's why we and our research and innovation are the vitalities of technology.
Innovation, experiment, entrepreneurship, etc. are in a layer, and there is also a growing risk of employment.
If we arrange the second generation of renewal process, our children will join it.
That's why the Indian government started the Atal Tinkering subs.
For the next 5 years, the drill of Rs.10 lakhs and another Rs.10 lakhs will be available to the schools who are part of this program.
Likewise, the incubation center is directly connected to the investigation.
If we are able to build enough incubation centres for ourselves, we can create a systematic system to bring it to the stort-up to investigate today.
It is necessary to build new incubation centres and renewal of old age.
We have to face many problems in everyday life.
If you want to get rid of the disease, you want to eat something antibiotic.
You'll get rid of it for a while, but you can stop taking antibiotics like this without consulting the doctor.
We don't eat antibiotics until the doctor writes.
We don't have to walk through such shit.
And this war goes on for years to create new medicines, scientific scientific science.
Until then, these diseases will continue to create new problems.
So we must always be aware of this.
Brother, take this antibiotic.
Eat 15 pills, and the doctor tells you to eat it for 5 days.
The doctor's advice is to finish the course by eating the pills on the same day.
If you eat more than necessary medicines then it can be beneficial for the bacteria .
So how many days the doctor's advice is to take care of the pills, it's a big deal.
It's called antibiotic resistance in medical terms.
Therefore, it is important to use the use of antibiotics as they use the rules.
Our government is committed to defending antibiotic resistance.
You'll see a red one on the tip of the place where you've given information about antibiotic medicines sold today.
I request you to take care of it.
I want to add another thing to health.
I'm worried about the lives of pregnant women in our country.
Deficiency of blood from pregnancy and subsequent bleeding , congenital infection , high blood pressure should not be said to be what kind of difficulty is that their life is destroyed .
This is why the Indian government has been implementing a new mission for the past few months, i.e., the Prime Minister's 'Secure Maternity'.
Under this mission, every month on the ninth and ninth of the pregnant women get free tests at government health centers.
I'm primarily asked gynaecologists that one day in a month, i.e., on the ninth day, I cannot provide this facility freely for poor mothers.
I believe you must be part of it.
My dear countrymen, today the world is concerned about climate, global warmth and environment.
Social discussions are going on in the country and in the world.
India has been insisting on this for centuries.
In the Kurukshetra battlefield Lord Krishna speaks of trees .
Shukracharya has also said that there is no narrowness of nasty i.e. no medicinal herbs.
Whoever donates the tree provokes the tree to transform it into a world like his children.
That's why parents who want their loved ones should plant good trees and protect them like children.
Whatever the Gita, Shukracharya, or the Ashasan mountain of India, some of those who live themselves in these honors are in the generations of today.
A few days ago, I've taken care of a daughter in Pune, Sonal, a monster.
It touched my mind.
The supervisory of India says that the tree is filled with the responsibility of the children in the world, and Sonal has taken a mission not only to his parents but to fulfill the desires of the society.
Kisan Ghandu Martyr Mahatra of the village named Narayanpur of Kejunor Taluk of Poona of Maharashtra was married to his grandson Sona in a very provocative way .
I saw the picture in the social media.
He didn't see the people of the wedding procession, but only the plants showed me.
This vision that touched the mind was in that picture.
Sonal is a teacher graduate, this idea is her own.
You'll see how much natural love was done by giving gifts to those who came to marriage.
In another way, Sonal's marriage turned into an innocence of natural love, and I'm enjoying the good efforts of Sonal and Mr. Mahatregi.
It can be converted into a natural birthplace in the middle of the tree.
The Maharashtra government told me that on July 1, this year, about two and a half million trees were planted in the state, and the next year it decided to build three crore trees.
It's not sure that 25 lakh plants are planted in Rajasthan.
Those who know about the land in Rajasthan know how hard it is.
By 2029, Andhra Pradesh has decided to increase its greenery by 50 percent.
There is a wonderful tradition of the forest festival in Gujarat .
This year many people like Gujarat Maav wilderness , Ekta wilderness , martyred wilderness etc . have been enjoined to plant millions of trees by giving them the forest festival .
But for me, the journey to South Africa was a pilgrimage.
It is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela when we remember South Africa.
As soon as we hear words of immortality, love and forgiveness in the world, it is the face of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
I went to the Phoney Settlement in my South African tour, known as 'Servodaya', the residence of Mahatma Gandhi.
I got a chance to travel from Peter Maritburg station on the train I traveled to Mahatma Gandhi, which was the incident that a Mohandas was supposed to be a Mahatma Gandhi.
I want to tell you this time I have a chance to meet many great men who have hoarded for all their youth and equality in society.
They fought with Nelson Mandela and fought with the shoulders for 20-22 years and spent their lives in prisons with him.
I'm so lucky to see Mr. Ahmad Kathada, Mr. Lalu Cheba, Mr. George Bezos and Ronnie Casserils, close friends of Nelson Mandela.
Even after such a huge suppression, the visions of gaining, accepting and becoming cannot be seen anywhere.
Personal phenomenon i . . the symptoms of the activity spoken in Geetha i . . I saw them as a witness .
"The equitable and equitable opportunity," no government has any specimen in it.
Their thinking is very natural.
They told me about a happening, and they speak from Bangalore to architectural work.
A woman buried in a chit in a meal and punched 11 lakh rupees, and then I read in a article that she committed suicide.
As a woman, I feel so sad about her family.
I want to know what you're talking about in such a chit-frod May.
Within a few minutes, he realized that he had left everything.
Sometimes you're going to be wrong.
They'll be so sympathetic.
But I had a very funny experience of this guy.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
The boys and girls were very excited.
They came as a big album, glad about their faces.
The artistic painting was done at the station.
Not only this, the plastic bottles and oil utensils found in the midst of silk chawls in the rural areas are collected and they are built in a virtual garden by filling the soil.
And on one side of the railway station this virtual garden was built on plastic bottles and gave it a new idea.
My dear countrymen have come to our country for years.
Listen, don't give her a gift to protect her life Not only that, women cooking at home.
There'll be a woman who cleanses her home, she'll be the daughter of a poor mother.
This is the right meaning of the defendant.
Many of us are born in the freezing time.
I was the first Prime Minister to be born in the post-independence.
Let the whole country swear by the zeal of freedom fighters once again.
We'll all create this environment.
And liberation day must be transformed into a nation's program without a government program.
We must celebrate ourselves like Deepavali.
I want you to do some good things related to it, with inspiration from patriotism.
Its pictures must be sent to the Nurendramodi hospital.
Create an environment of its own in the country.
You'd like to present those things in your mind from the Red Fort.
As a representative of your mind, as your main servant, if I want to tell you these things from the Red Fort, I'm intimidating you.
I don't want to be the prime minister's words from the Red Fort.
And nowadays the platform of technology is easy for you to reach me.
I am tied to the sky , because Man Ki Baat is presenting in local language at 8 in the evening.
Many of these suggestions help in the functioning of my government.
Perhaps, there's news of a week's interval to start the rain, so we're also worried.
In most parts of the country, there is a hot hot summer.
Climate change increases such problems.
The width of the forest was reduced and the trees were cut off.
In a way, humans are destroying nature and destroying themselves.
June 5 is the world environment day.
There are discussions about the environment worldwide.
In the past, the forests of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and the Himalayan valleys have become a fire.
I had the opportunity to meet the chief ministers of the 11 states of Uttar Pradesh , Rajasthan , Gujarat , Maharashtra , Chhattisgarh , Jharkhand , Karnataka , Andhra Pradesh , Telunga and Orissa .
I've listened carefully to every country.
Normally there is no such discussion about how much the central government has given and how much it has been spent.
In many areas, water conservation, environment, dry melting, animal conservation, and in a way for dry infected persons, was one of the best works for the whole country.
I told Niti Ayog: 'In order to make good examples of this, it will take steps to enforce it in other states.
Some states , especially Andhra and Gujarat , have been fully benefitted from technology .
I want to take out the successful tests of the states and take them to other areas.
In such problems, popularism is a major source of victory.
Perhaps, if there is a sufficient instrument, it can make a sufficient change if the systems are finished within time, using the right technology.
Water conservation is also important.
Their target is to include two to three lakh hectares of land in micro-rigen every year.
Chhattisgarh ' Local Suraj Water Suraj Abhyan ' has been implemented .
About 22,000 ponds were collected in the Bellam Talab John of Madhya Pradesh, which is not a small account.
They were aimed at water conservation, and in some states the plans to build small cells to protect 10 to 20 kilometres of water.
It's a good experience.
I want to tell you not to lose one drop of rain water from June, July, August and September.
We need to think about what is the place for water conservation and how it is.
God has given water according to our needs, the nature has fulfilled our needs.
Seeing a lot of water, we are ignorant and when the rainy season is over, we'll be worried about not getting water, how long can it be
In the past, the media was told about the problems of water supply.
I believe the media will be participants in the way of resolving water.
I'm despising them.
My dear neighbors, we have to build a new burden.
Make a beautiful India.
Our plans are to be carried out in all corners of India without a parallel breakdown.
We have to make small changes in our old minds.
But today the situation is completely changed.
The world looks like a culture society.
Electronic technology can send and handle money from the world.
Once we're together, we'll be finished as a money mosquito.
Perhaps you may have seen that the guy has given the RPA CARD with the account.
In the coming days this card can be beneficial on the floors like ' Credit Debate Card ' .
There is no need to take money from the pocket, count or anything.
That is 'Bank on Mobile ' - Niversal Pement Interface Banking Transction - PI, which can always change the systems.
Money Transction money through your mobile phone will be very easy.
Perhaps if it can be easily possible, then the RPA CARDs don't always have to go along.
Moreover, postoffs are also alive for banking services.
Forever, unlawful transactions.
The impact of the money will be great.
So, my natives, I want to- let's start this.
Once we start, we can easily move forward.
Twenty-fifteen years ago, we wonder if our mobile would be in our hands.
That's how we can't turn into a society.
It would have been better if it could happen without a call.
My dear natives, sometimes when the Olympics contests, or when we start playing, we'll be far behind the gold medal.
If you get the silver.
Everyone must enhance self-sacrifice and enthusiasm in their way to encourage our sportsmen to participate in Rio Olympics.
For the last week, we were very upset about what would be the election results, especially what would happen in Assam.
Encourage the fields of sports, encourage our sports activity, and encourage each other and greater soul and power.
Without mixing everybody in the potatoes of the metabolism, India must jump in front of the world with the Sportsman Spirit.
The students' results, who have been tested in the 10th and 12th classes, are coming after each other.
I want to tell those who don't get success... and there's a lot to do in life.
A Mr. Gain of Madhya Pradesh...
He presented a big deal in front of me, seriously.
33 percent of the market wasn't satisfied.
Everyone told me that I lost 90 percent due to lack of 4 marks.
I don't know what I felt as if I had a weight.
I read your letter carefully.
I think, perhaps this pain is not yours.
Like you, there are millions of students, because such an environment is consistent.
By finding happiness in all things, we can lead society to the direction of peace and prosperity.
Your relatives, assistants and friends are 89.
I am happy with Jodhpur, Giri Goswami. He also wrote that it is almost the same thing.
He says people around me don't accept our results.
I don't remember the whole poem, but I wrote a poet a long time ago and I painted a pain in the life's canvas.
Some said it would be better if it was yellow instead of blue.
Some said it would have been better if it was there instead of putting this line here.
It would be better if one or two of my eyes had fallen on this pain.
Everybody was talking about the dump.
Thousands of students like you are the same.
You can be able to fill the needs of the people.
I want to tell you so much that you don't lose balance in such a situation.
Everyone shows the requirements.
But stand firm in your position and try to fill up a little more beautiful.
But if we don't agree to achieve, then the new goal will never be fulfilled.
The strongest base of victory is based on great successes.
The favourite victory of victory does not take place.
It happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard of the rhetoric called Santoor.
There was a time when Santoor drama was associated with folk music in the Kashmir Valley.
But a man named Pandit Shivakumar handled it as a great drum in the world.
Shehnai- Our music world was in a very limited place.
Most of the kings had a place at its gate in the darbars.
But when Ustad Bismlakhan put it in Shehna, it turned into a worldly drama.
It is true that the cost of not being a patient is very low but if the disease comes then the cost of getting healthy is very high .
If anyone can help the poor, it's only for purity.
June 21 is the International Yoga Day.
There is a specific sympathy with Yoga all over the world, respect and faith.
Yoga gives strength to lead a balanced life to the world suffering from stress.
Every person should spend 20-25 minutes in his lifestyle or 30 minutes for yoga .
For this, on the 21st of June, we invoke.
Sometimes social observation is the reason for the changes in the life of a person.
I hope you'll take your precautions anywhere on June 21.
In your neighbouring areas, in your city, in villages, in your school, in the institutions, if you need it in office.
Start a month from now, and look, you'll be participant on June 21.
I'm going to attend the Chandigarh program this time.
I'm constantly connecting with you through this program called Manki Bath, my beloved natives.
A long time ago, I gave you a mobile number, and you could have listened to Manki Bath by making a missing call.
But it's too simple.
You need only four times to listen to Manki Bath.
If you miss this number in 1922, you can hear Manki Bath anywhere in any language.
My dear natives, you're all my namaskar once more.
Don't forget about the water I said.
Manki Baath, July 2019
Manki Bath is always a matter of waiting for you and me.
This time too many letters, commands, phone calls, many stories, instructions and inspirations...
People discussed books on science, technology, new findings, history, culture, business, lifestyle, and many things.
People asked me to discuss other things.
But I have to say that I can't move time to read a lot of books.
We'll start a permanent book corner at the Narendra Modi App, and we'll write and discuss it when we read a new book.
You'll suggest a name to this book corner.
I want this book corner to turn readers and writers into an active stage.
Many specialists have been trying their best to save water.
People share information about traditional methods.
For example , in the village named Kairam of Ormanji Block a little away from Ranji of Jharkhand , the enthusiasm of the rural water conservation of the village has become an example of everyone .
The magnificent state of north-eastern India, the Meghalaya has become an independent waterfall state.
I like the government there.
Very little water is needed in greenery, but the farmers are giving importance to the unsuccessful farming.
I specially appreciate the Green government to talk to the treasurers, remove them from traditional farming, inspire some water not to harvest.
It's time for the festivals.
Festivals are also held during the festivals.
You can use these fairs to protect water.
People from all sections of society come to the fairs.
In these fairs, the message of water conservation can be very good, displayed, street drains, with the festival, the message of water conservation can be carried out very unprecedented.
Friends, some things in life are enjoying us.
Especially children's achievements, their works give us new energy.
So you want to talk about some children.
And they are rich, Monis Joshi, Devamshi Ravat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Twari, Prati Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aryanesh Ganguli, Hrithik Almada.
You'll be proud and joyful of what I'm talking about them.
We all know that the word cancer is the most terrible thing in the world.
I don't want to be a champion after winning the game.
But before they joined the competition, it was a strange opportunity to be champions.
That's the champions of life.
In Moscow this month, Vold Children's winners gams were run.
That is, they fought with cancer in their lives... fights like shooting, chess, swimming, swimming and football.
 All these champions in our country have got a medal in the tournament.
Some of these players got medals in more than one way.
My dear people, you must have been proud of India's victory in the darkness beyond the sky.
Chandrayan-2.
Sanjay Haripura from Jodhpur in Rajasthan , Mahendra Kumar Dagha from Kolkata and P from Telangana .
About 2019 is a good year for India.
Our scientists launched A Sat in March.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this achievement.
On July 22, Chandrayaan saw the state proudly moving from 2 Sriharikota to the environment.
The pictures of Chandrayaan 2 filled the pride, enthusiasm and rejoice of the people.
Chandraan 2 missions are special in different ways.
You'll be glad that Chandrayaan is 2 completely Indian.
But we must always remember that it has the power to survive.
I have great hope that Chandraan will inspire the youth of two countries to look for the world of science and seeing.
Scientific science is opening the path of development.
We are looking forward to sustaining the time of Lander Vikram and Rover Pragyan Laund on the surface of the moon.
Today through Manki Bay, I want students of the country to get information about a very attractive competition to the youth.
To a queue competition, the genius of India's science mission and scientific techniques will be the main source of problems.
I invite young friends and students to attend this problem and make it attractive, pleasant and unforgettable by your partner.
I'm sure I'm very hard to try to win my school, and to the school, and to the adventurous princes and teachers.
Encourage all the schools to share it.
This would be a history of their lives for students who are victorious.
But it must take part in the problem, get the most market, be successful.
Inspire more friends.
Friends, you'll take care of something.
Our mankie bat has grown fast from time to time to greet his father.
From the walls of Over Bridges and the tribes to the ships, when they performed their nice observation with them, it became a big sword.
You'll see how Prayag king was decorated with street paintings at the time of the Kumbh festival.
Yogesh Saini and his friends also shared a lot.
We need a great deal of culture that makes wealth rich in dirt to grow into our society.
In one way, we have to move forward to bring gold from the dirt.
Dear people, last day I read a very charming version in My Giovi.
This young man belonged to Mohammad Aslam, a brother living in Shapian in Kashmir.
He wrote - It's nice to hear Mankie Bath show.
I was active in organizing the Back-to-Village for Community Mobilisation program in my state, Jammu and Kashmir.
The program was arranged in June.
I'm sure the programs like this are going to last three months.
Also, you need an order to monitor the program online.
This show shows how impatient the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development.
For the first time in this program, big officers directly reached the villages, and the officers, without seeing the villagers, came to their homes to understand the obstacles in the development, to overcome the problems, and the program lasted for a week.
Well, how can we increase the income of the people
The princes saw what the impact of the service was on the lives of ordinary humans, and the villagers open their minds and told them their problems.
There were discussions about literacy, women's ratio, health, poverty, water conservation, electricity, water, girls' education, problems of adult citizens.
Friends, the program was not a ceremony of the government as the officer roamed around the village all day, but this time the authorities spent two days on a night in the Panchayat, so that they got an opportunity to spend time in the village.
To make this program more attractive, many things have been added.
Shello played a game for children under the leadership of India.
That's where Sports Kit, the job cards of the National Employment System, the Portuguese species and the list category certificates are distributed.
Such programs and calling for participants of the people, our sister sister of Kashmir wants the rule of Saddam, which shows that the strength of progress is more than bombs and guns.
It is obvious that those who want to break tightness on the path of development, want to obstruct them, they cannot achieve their oppressive goal.
My dear natives, Gyanpitha priest, Jetta, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, said in his poem about the glory of the month of devotion.
In that, he said, "Hodige Madige Aguedu's Adarag land was magnificent, the relationship between rain and waterfalls is different, the earth is drew its beauty.
People from different cultures and languages of India celebrate in their own ways in the month of Shravana .
In this season, when we look at the environment, it seems that the earth was green.
We'll see a new energy all around.
On the other hand, many fast fasts and lives for generosity and hypocrisy.
During this time, the Rakshabandan Festival, a symbol of brother's love, came.
This time more than 4 years devotees participated in the journey of Amarnath while talking about the devotion .
Since 1 July till now more than three lakh pilgrims visited the sacred Amarnath cave .
More than participating in this journey for 60 days in 2015, more people participated this time in just 28 days.
I particularly appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their habituality for the victory of Amarnath Yatra.
People returning from the journey reverse the enthusiasm and self-esteem of the people of the state.
All of this is very helpful in the future journey.
On the other hand, it's time to rain in many parts of the country.
Dear people, it's very difficult to decide where to start Manki Bath, where to stop.
Next Manki Bath will be in 2016.
There is no shortage of festivals in our country.
Sometimes it seems India is a country of economic poverty through festivals.
Festivals change for the poor of the community as a result of economic poverty.
You know I'm using technology well, and I get a lot of information.
Ganesh V.
Savlesh Warker wrote to me that this season was a tourist season.
Many of the national and foreign tourists are becoming tourists.
People celebrate Christmas holidays.
Sometimes it hears disappointing things from different corners of the country.
It's the power of the country that millions of people do some good in their own way.
New opportunities for education and employment.
When the whole world was attracted to yoga and celebrated the International Yoga Day we believed and proud of India .
When we see India's widespread vision, we understand this vision.
The word of purity is heard in the houses today.
It is increasing the participation of the people.
That's also a service.
I've made a small effort on my own way.
I can't do everything alone.
My beloved young men, in the Red Fort on August 15, started the first discussion of Start of India and Stand of India.
Then it was discussed in government departments.
Can India be the Start of Capital
The new start apps and new inventions, in order to make a great deal of young people among the states, were discussed whether we could start in the production sector, in the service sector, and in order to clean the architecture.
If you think so, it's wrong.
The young men in any corner of India must give them a chance.
Start up India, Stand up India cannot be rolled in just a few cities.
It must spread to every corner of India.
I urge the state governments to spread it.
I'm sure I'll talk to you on January 16.
I'll welcome your instructions.
My beloved young men, January 12 is the victory of Swami Vivekananda.
Thousands of people are here, like me, who initiate from Swami Vivekanandan.
Since 1995, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti has been celebrated as a national youth festival on January 12.
This year from 12 to 16 January is celebrated in Raipur in Chhattisgarh .
A small India is going to be created there, a young India.
In one way, you can see the fools of dreams.
The power of the decisions can be seen.
Can your suggestions share with me about this youth festival
I think it's the activity that you've done before.
Thank you for a thousand.
Are you a person working in this area
So you can understand this, can you have to face many problems
Perhaps Vicalangar, sometimes those who are sex, sometimes different.
Every word has its own significance.
This year the Government of India started appreciating Sugamy India .
I hope you'll take this.
Have we started greeting Sugmaya Bharat
This will enhance all kinds of basic facilities and bring them to facilitation.
Schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, ramps at the railway station, parking, lifts, braille lips, they need to make it easy.
Technically requires, system requires sense.
It's been attempted, and it's getting popularity.
People are interested in it.
You shouldn't move the files before that.
In fact, the plans are for the common people and the poor.
In the past, the Indian government has conducted an investigation into how to benefit the right to plans.
In our country, the gas provides subsidies to the cylinder.
It wasn't checked whether he was keeping the accounts properly.
So the government has made some changes in this.
The mission is to bring a subsidie directly to the account of the eldest director of the world's largest director Benefit Transfer scheme by adjusting the card.
I prefer to say this is the world's most successful diarrhea called Benefit Transfer Skim, where it has a place in the Ginns Book of World Record.
On the one hand, the Card Campen, on the other hand, opens the Genetic Account, and the Central State Governments, together with the list of genius and connecting them with the bank account through the dhar.
In many places, the money is directly deposited in the labour account.
There were complaints about students' skillership, and efforts have been made to solve it.
About 40 million rupees through various plans have come straight to the accounts of investigators.
About three to fourty plans have been included in the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme.
My dear Indians, on January 26, are the golden moments of the Indian Republic.
In the parliament, two days had been changed to a special discussion on the constitution.
It was a good experience.
Most of us are aware of the obligations... ..the vote is our duty, and it convinces us through publications and wall writings.
Why don't we make sure we don't care about the works in everyday life as the choice is
In the 125th birth anniversary of the state Baba Saheb Ambdaker, can you organise discussions based on the works of schools, colleges, villages, towns and organizations, on 26th January
If 125 million people switched one after another and filled their duty, it would be an unprovoked history.
We'll start the discussions.
You'll get the opportunity to go somewhere.
Festivals have its own importance in social life.
The news of natural disasters from every corner of the world is regular.
We've never thought or imagined these dangers.
Now we are feeling faster that the impact of climate change is increasing.
The central government works closely with them.
But there is a need to think of changes when you see such misery in the environment.
That's a good start.
Today I received a phone message from Lakvindarsingh from Jalandhar in Punjab, Lakvindarsingh, who is speaking from the Jalandhar district of Punjab.
I'm glad to hear your question in the 1990s, Lakvindar Singh.
The main reason for my pleasure is that you're making biography.
Not only that, with biological farming, you understand the problems of farmers.
But it's not right to think it's only in Punjab and Haryana.
We are following the way we burn the residues of the Peninsula traditionally.
We didn't care about this loss first.
Everyone does, we do it.
Secondly, I didn't even train how to do this.
But your fear is true.
But it's not real.
The ruins of the plant are priceless.
Secondly, the surface of the earth gets burnt with fire.
Even if the heart is strong, we can't live.
The residues are burnt not only with the skin of the earth's mother.
Animal food can also be used, which saves our land.
Not only that, look at the roots from the same land, it doubles the profit.
Once I've got an opportunity to talk to the artists who worked for a volcano.
They shared their best experience.
They had to spend five thousand, ten thousand and fifteen thousand to change the ruins of the volatile.
The ruins of the sword will remain as long as the people who want to remove them are brought to the doctor.
But some farmers drowned the ruins of the volatile to 6-8 inches on the ground.
Last time I talked about serving organs in 'Man Ki Bath'.
I told you about the Helpline of 'Chhotachh'.
Many famous filmmakers including Revin Tandon have participated in this.
You can save many lives worthy of organ donation.
In one way, donation gives irregularity.
From one body to another, the organ gets a new life, and that life gets a new life.
What more important donors than this
Organ Transplantation's national-level registration was started on 27 November for patients waiting to replace the organ.
I believe that there will be widespread awakening in every territory and that the needy will get the best help.
It's necessary for each other to move.
I've already suggested that December 3 is supposed to be an international distinction day.
Those who are physically and mentally different, are the owners of immense desire and courage.
They're sorry when they're ridiculous.
We'll start crying when there's a little trouble.
When we think they're living, we'll see how light our pain is.
How do they live
Their decisive way of life, their zeal to make the crisis efficient, is praiseworthy.
Today I want to tell you about Javed Ahmed.
His age is 40, 42.
In 1996, the terrorists shot him in Kashmir.
Though he was a victim of the terrorist gun, he was surprising.
But one of his kidneys was destroyed and one part of the intestine was lost.
There was a severe damage to the spinal cord.
I lost my ability to stay in my leg, but he didn't give up.
The injury of terrorism didn't lose him.
How to solve the systems for physically different persons, whatever facilities should be made in public places and government offices.
Why is Javed's life sufficient to inspire every corner of India
I recall the life of Javed Ahmad, his penance, his dedication on December 3.
Because of lack of time, even though I speak only of Javed, such inspirations are floating on every corner of India.
Our country is very big.
There are many things that depend on the government.
More than one experience changes our perspective of government systems throughout the lifetime.
They are doing so many social acts in India.
How many millions may be working around us.
If you see the sick with lovers, what's the pleasure in it
Are they going to be partners in the grief of the society
I appreciate all those admirers in India in the name of 'Jamunami'.
In addition to discussing 'e' books, some of the youth must tell the students of eight or nine or ten classes of nearby schools, what happens here, what happens.
And you're actually becoming a good teacher of a society.
I'm welcomed by someone else's support for the nation's work.
My beloved natives, today the world is worried about climate.
A snake sent me to see that the friend who led me to share this unpleasant experience.
But if they say something they've done, it wouldn't be like some other academics have thought.
They've been working to bring light to the poor people in their territory using solar energy.
They fought against the blind and despised their name.
They built a platform of Ranthal, which lighted through a women's group.
They are paying rent to the local residents at a rent of just a hundred rupees per month.
We know what the world's largest people do about climate change.
Thank you very much for News.
But the beginning is very good.
Within a very short time, 66 lakh people could get four and a half thousand crore rupees (42,000 crore rupees) through the Prime Minister's Moody Plan.
Let's be a slave in the job, a journalist, a milkman, and any of the poor will get the real advantage of it.
Abhishek shared his happiness.
That's how many things are coming in front of me.
The other is from Mumbai to Shillesh Bhosla.
According to his mother-in-law, eight and a half million rupees.
I told you at the time of our Swachh Bharat programme that there was a new productivity through that plan.
But Shailesh Bhosle has succeeded in bringing it to work.
But people don't know enough about this plan.
How should the program be formed
How do you want Logo
But I'm expecting many more suggestions.
There are many basic plans.
It will also provide a certificate of publicity to those who are active.
Moreover, many other awards have been declared.
My dear brothers, it's been cold.
Make a fair atmosphere in the family and join each other in exercise.
You'll know how much of Chaitanya's brilliance is to be done through the exercise festival.
The whole body will be more provocative every day.
If it's a good weather, it'll be a good situation.
My dear daddy, you're funny once more.
Jai Hind.
For the first time on October 3 last year, I was lucky to present 'Man Ki Baath'.
One year through Manki Bay.
Our ancestors used to say, "Jana Janardan" means the voice of the people is the voice of God.
I can tell my experiences of the 'Man Ki Baath' program that our ancestors have greater power and truth in this thought because I felt it.
Several topics started coming from the bottom to the government.
And, it is true that information must come down from top to top and bottom, the principle of governance.
Did anyone ever think that 'Man Ki Baath' would be the source of information
But it happened.
That's how the 'Man Ki Baath' made a chance to show the strength of the confession.
I've been surprised all over the world by calling one day selfie with daughter.
It was a silent revolution.
Millions of pictures have been sent from every corner of India.
We don't even think of the Indian government or state government or the tourism department.
'Man Ki Baath' became a stage for the government, and the people took the job without paying a rupee.
I'm glad to discuss Gandhiji in my first 'Man Ki Baath' program in October last year.
When I consulted Gandhi Jayanti , I invited people to celebrate on the day of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2 with the encouragement of the whole nation of Khadi products .
There was a time called Khadi for the nation.
Can't you make it as a fashion now as a khadi
I wished people to buy you, something to do.
I'm glad that Khadi's sales are almost doubled.
This wasn't publicly done by the government.
It's not the achievement of millions and millions of lives.
It's a result of the power of the people.
Once I told 'Man Ki Baath', the poor smokes in his house, the children cry.
Don't they get a cooking client
Today I can say very happy, 30 lakh families in our country have left the subsidies of cooking.
I saw a retreated school teacher in the channel staying in the queue to keep a widowed woman's subsidy not.
Middle people, the lowest ones are hard to leave the subsidies.
But these people have left the subsidies.
Isn't this silent
We can't see the power of the people.
The governments must include the lesson that there is a large mass-powered, energy-strong and visionary society outside the clutches of what our government is doing in the clutches.
Is there anything else to be happy with this
I thought of doing a new test this time in Manki Bath.
There's no place in India where people don't call.
That's a comfortable experience.
The people of every age have sent a message.
I wanted to hear some messages myself, and I liked it.
My team is taking action on the rest.
All the departments of the government must consider your instructions.
But one thing surprised me and enjoyed me.
Perhaps we think we're all decisive.
But my experience is wrong.
Twenty thousand people told them their way.
How much of the country's ordinary people think about it, and how much of the rich it is for the country
Perhaps only one or two phone calls will be seen after serious complaints.
More than 90 percent of it was a joyful thing to give a variety of energy.
They must have heard radio.
I sent a message from Alwar in Rajasthan, Pavan Acharya.
Prime Minister Mr. Narendramodi is my message to them. Please ask the people of India to use as much as Man Ki Baath.
Besides being environmental, it makes thousands of manufacturing brothers a chance to get jobs.
I believe that like the Indian Pawan Acharya, your imagination will reach the corners and corners of India.
I say to the locals, if we enforce what Pawan's preachings in the coming festivals, then its archives will prove to be in their homes, but the lighting will be in the poor's houses.
My dear neighbors, on the day of Ganesh, I got a chance to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army
With our army to protect the oceans.
In 1965, the war with Pakistan ended 50 years.
In the name of this, a 'Shauryajli' exhibition was organized at India Gate in Delhi.
What wasn't there
If you want to create history, it is necessary to know and understand the slightest levels of history.
History connects us to our roots.
If the relationship with history is lost, the chances of historical creation can also be fulfilled.
Don't look like me.
I'm back in two and a half hours.
That kid's right.
And I've heard the criticisms of what happened.
I don't think it's a bad thing I've been discussing India's purity even in the fine parliament that I see.
On the other hand, Parliament, on the other hand, a boy in this country speaks about the purity of both sides, and what is the greatest luck for one country
This disintegration of ideas creates an atmosphere of hate for hypocrisy, awaiting purity.
This will force the governments to work.
We must take this work for Mahatma Gandhi's dream witness when Mahatma Gandhi celebrated the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi said
If there is a need to choose one of these purity and freedom, I will first choose purity, then free.
Gandhiji gave the importance of freedom to purity.
Gulshan Arora Mygov from Delhi.
In the year, Dain wants to know the birth anniversary of Dayalji.
My dear natives, the life of great men always provokes us.
Our work, the great men don't guess what the idealistics were.
Every person who lives and dies for the country is our inspiration.
These days there are occasions to remember many great men.
On September 25, the President of Pandit Dean Day, Mahatma Gandhi on October 2, Lal Bahadur Scientist on October 11, Jaiprakash Narayan, on October 31, Sardar Vallabhai Patil, many names like this.
I'm moving forward with a special joy on October 2.
If you use it, you'll give it equal importance to Khaddi's hand.
Brothers who are drunkards are doing a lot.
The poor widow will be in the house.
That's why this lamp must surely put a place on the houses and bodies of one of you.
Look, the last time the sale is almost doubled.
I'm glad about one thing, my loved countrymen.
I'll share it with you.
When I went to Kolkata in May, the family members of Subhas Chandrabos came to see me.
Everything was arranged by his grandfather.
I got a chance to spend a lot of time with the family members of Subhas Chandrabos.
Nuclearly, my name is Bhargavi Kanade.
I want you to know that you want to make a sense of the voter registration, so in the coming days, the participation of the younger level increases, and in the future, the government will be more involved in election and administration.
Thanks, Bhargavi said that he was involved in the name of the new voter's list and that he voted.
I want to appreciate the election commission in India.
A few years ago, we saw that our electrical commission was the only rugletor, but for the last few years, it had a big change.
It's a very good change, but it's not just working for the election commission.
Generally, I want to tell you if you vote for a few days before and drink.
One, a seven-year-old teacher is studying in the 7th class at the Central School of Banaras Hindu University.
I want to increase scientific importance and interest in our country's children.
Only 9 years old.
When she asked her father, she said she's been saying it since 5.
I asked, where did you learn from
So I thought I could share with you.
We're doing a lot of things that you don't know and you don't know through papers on TV.
What's wrong about doing once a month
Friends from Akashwani have to wait for half an hour.
It's better for a month's launch.
Starting from Germany, the citizens of Hindus were inspired by radio on the freedom struggle.
The beginning of Azad Hind Radio was through the Wortaboolton.
He used to launch in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathis, Punjabi, Pushto and Urudu.
I've also completed a year by exhibiting 'Man Ki Bath' through the sky.
We'll meet next month at Man Ki Baath.
Let's keep your instructions.
It's the government to use your instructions.
It starts a better change.
Your partner is priced, invaluable.
Once more a lot of joys take place.
On 30 August 2015, Narendermodi, at 11 a.m. in the morning, a special launch of the Indian population through the airways, is said to be my dear countrymen.
I have a chance to present things to you.
So far southern people celebrate on their own, and at the same time they celebrated me the sacred festival of the defendant throughout our country.
The Indian government has implemented new schemes for social security to the common people.
For a very short time, all dignitaries have adopted these plans.
I asked our sisters to enforce security measures in the sacred festival of the Rakshabandhan.
I see this as a good sign.
On the sacred festival of saving all mothers and sisters, all goodness is celebrated.
Today I had a year ago to talk to you to the people in a great deal of the noble plan.
The main source of communication is in the banking sector, which has been designed as a bank supplier plan to bring the Arpa to the poor.
Today, more than a million bank friends are working all over the country.
Young people have been employed through this.
Within a year, you'll be very happy to hear that banking sector economic system and money have made a million and one thousand economic innovation camps to deal with it.
I've made such things to you... and now it's your job to take this connection.
All our accounts must be neglectful.
In the past, I got a chance to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
Their voices, their conversations, i.e., the generosity and beauty seen in the Sufi tradition.
I'm glad they invited me to Bodhgaya.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru went to Bodhgaya.
We'll have a chance to go to Bodhgaya with these widows all over the world.
It'll be a pleasant moment for me, my beloved artists, I want to tell you about my mind again.
We've already discussed these things.
You might have heard me in the Parliament, and you may have heard the common words 'Man Ki Baath'.
My beloved farmer, sister-in-law, there's nothing to be afraid of you.
I don't give anybody that time.
We were in the middle of an ordinance.
Tomorrow, the Ordionsin's term is over.
I've decided to finish if the period is over.
I want to betray you, not just a madman, but a man of ours.
I want to tell you something else.
Two days ago, the war in 1965 ended 50 years.
Whenever you remember this war in 1965, Lal Bahadoor is a reminder of the scientist.
With this, the Hindujay Javan will remember his madness as Jai Kisan's authority.
At the same time, it is very natural to recall all the martyrs of India's triangular flag and its glory and mastery.
I provoke all those associated with the 65 warfire.
Great warriors also wear.
Such murmurs of history are inspiring us.
Last week, as I had an opportunity to contact the people of Sufi tradition, I had an opportunity to talk to the country's leading scientists and listen to their opinions.
India is showing great activity in the varieties of science, and I am happy about it.
Our scientists actually do great things.
How should such research be carried out among the common people
How should we use these principles in a professional way
I told the last mankie bath that we need to lead our students to the science sector.
I thought there was a lot of chances after this church.
I want to tell my loved young friends something special.
In the next time, many guests came to India from the world's nations.
Why don't we connect our festivals with purity
This time the beginning of the rain was good.
In our country, food grains, oilseeds and leafy vegetables are symptoms.
The poor people need food and oil to cook vegetables.
But this time there is a lot of happiness, approximately 50 percent of the phone calls and 33 percent of the oil markets have increased.
I appreciate my treacherous brothers because of that.
My dear countrymen, on July 26, the history of our country has been recorded as a victory day in Kargil.
As much as the country's farmer is concerned with the earth, the military and the nation's relationship.
Each of our soldiers in the Kargil war has called a hundred enemies.
As a result of all their enormous excitements, India can speak to the world today.
That's why my hundreds of greetings to our brave soldiers are successful in Kargil today.
Srimati Suttaraghavachari in Chennai has sent a lot of instructions.
I believe you're all gonna send good instructions.
I want to make my point of view clear.
I don't want to give any advice, but I don't find ways to get the state governments, the central governments, the governments, the governments, the governments and the governments out of their obligations.
Two days ago, I noticed the scene of a hijacking in Delhi, and after 10 minutes the square traveler was roaming on the way.
He didn't get any help.
Likewise, a lot of people write to me more about immigrant matters, you talk about road safety subjects and make the common people foolish.
Maybe the Hoskot resident of Bangalore would be a happy man of Mudubidri in Karnataka - people are very much, I don't remember everybody's name.
Every accident takes place every day in our country.
A death occurs every four minutes in road accidents.
The most distressing thing is that about three-thirds of the deaths are young men between 15 and 25, each of these deaths captures the entire family.
Another thing in my mind is that a small group of government officials in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, and their work was very sufficient to touch my mind.
'Brother No. 1' means an excellent brother to give his brother a hospital as a gift on the day of his savings.
Encouraging all such brothers and their sisters to build toilets, and all the districts and mothers and sisters don't have to urinate in the open space.
Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh is a small village where workers live.
The people of that village started and completed the plan to build the toilet for the last few months.
Now no one in that village has to urinate in the open space.
Bhavesh Dheka writes to me about the problems of the north-eastern states.
So a team of Central Government officials decided to go to north-eastern states to organize seven-day camps in Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim.
In the coming days, the result of this effort will take place.
It's very irrelevant to disappearance of science.
In a way, science and technology are the ideals of development.
Our IAS officers came to a great deal of things, and they must often sit in a conversation with the children in school or college near two or four hours a week, and their experiences are their strength.
We've started it, we'll get 24 hours of electricity in our villages in the coming years.
While studying in the exam days the children of the village do not have difficulty .
If you want to start small and big business in villages, you need electricity.
Today, if they want to charge the mobile, they'll go to the next village.
The villages must be available in the cities.
That's why, Dinaya started the Deputy Grammayoti program.
I told you to talk about every Indian in the 'Man Ki Baath' today.
Well, the month of August, September is our time for celebrations.
We have many festivals.
Manki Baath, June 2019
Sitting in the midst of the needy, many of the 130-crore people in the terrible environment had heard many things as they said to the family members.
Perhaps it turns into inspiration for those who want their things.
I merely used my words, but I didn't think I didn't want to use my voice, but you are.
I felt a gentleman.
Anyway, it's the last chance.
In a family test, 'Man Ki Baath', little, little little things.
I'll continue this program, in a way, with the creation of a new Ozzs that causes changes in society and life.
A lot of messages came in the last month, in which people said, "Manki Baath" is worried.
Sometimes I think this is my journey from my swimming sword.
This is the journey from I to Nami.
For me, my consent with you was a part of the experience of my spiritual journey.
Many people asked a lot of questions about why I went to Kedarnath during the election.
I had a chance to meet me for me.
I went to see me in a way.
Sometimes because of my thoughts being inspired... and sometimes it may lead to foolishness.
When people put forward challenges in front of the country and society, they suggest solutions.
People in the letters explain the problems, with peace and some instructions, showing some sympathy, evident or indirect.
I mean, in your words, I can understand a sign of how peace is available to the society.
'Man Ki Baath' is like a mirror for the nation and society.
It says to us that there is no lack of soul or strength or gain within the people.
And the power must be accomplished and the accomplishment, and they must be given a chance, which must be implemented.
'Man Ki Baath' says 130 million people in the progress of the country are strong and active.
You can imagine how happy my mind is when I imagine these things and how much energy I get.
This faith was the slave of your faith.
We'll continue 'Man Ki Baath' with this disappointment.
So not for the country, the choice was not for selfishness, but for the protection of democracy.
Perhaps in any country in the world, the people there would not have voted for democracy alone for their remaining rights, powers and needs.
That's what the country saw in 1977.
In India, more than 61 million people voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, and we can see that this number is normal.
But if it sees the population worldwide, it will see that more people than any other country than China voted in India.
The number of people voted in 2019 is more than the total population in the United States, almost twice.
The number of votes in India is more than the population of Europe.
It reveals the vastness and vividness of our democracy.
The world-wide elections in 2019 were the largest populist choices in the world.
You can imagine how much wealth and human power is needed to make such choices.
Hundreds of teachers, officers and other officials have been subjected to this election.
Nearly 3 lakh members of the Armed German sections have been responsible for making this great victory of democracy, and 20 lakh police in different states have established their duty and rigged.
As a result of their hardship, more than once more people voted for this time.
About 10 lakh police stations all over the country had more than 40 lakh electronic voting machines and more than 17 lakh vivid machines.
You can think how much you're ready.
A voter can't use his vote, so he did all this.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, only a woman voted for the police station.
You'll be surprised if the electorate had to travel for two days to get there.
This is the right respect for democracy.
The world's highest polling station is also in India.
This polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet at the place named Lahole-Spiti of Himachal Pradesh .
In this election, the vote percentage of women and men was almost equal.
Another truth is that this time there are 78 female members to reduce history in the parliament.
A lot of praise is made to each other associated with the election commission and wear the vigilant vote of India.
My dear neighbors, you must have heard me often saying, "Boke no book".
I told you to use a book instead of flowers to welcome people.
Since then, people have started giving books at different places.
His stories include all the psychology of India.
When he reads the story of 'Nasha' (Lahari), my mind turned back to the economic unrest that spreads in the society.
I remember the days I was young.
It came to the mind about how it was discussed all night.
If you are not able to learn from this story of the son of Jamindar Ishwari and the beer of the poor family, then you can not understand when it comes to the effect of the bad guys.
The love of a sensitive child to his grandchildren, the foolishness of his young age.
When we get to the grandmother from the Hamid Festival of the age of 4-5 years, we see that when we get to the maternal grandmother, we really get to the sympathetic sense.
After losing the crop, the farmer Haldu wonders if he doesn't have to sleep on the field in the cold winter.
These stories are almost a hundred years ago, but the beauty of these things, even today, will be the same.
K.
Mercury and little tea.
Today, this library is a guide for everyone including tribal children.
In Gujarat, the birthplace called 'Vamche Gujarat' was a successful test.
Millions of people from all ages have been involved in this campaign to read books.
In today's digital world, at the time of the Gugul guru, I found a little time to teach you and give books for some time between your daily things.
You must give it a good experience... and write about the reading book 'Narendramodi App', and all the stars of Manki Bati know about it.
I'm glad the people of our country think about the challenge in the future.
I was reading your opinions in 'Narendramodi App' and 'My Geo'... and a lot of people wrote about the problem of water.
Besides the Pavan Gaurai of Balgavi, Sithamshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written to me about the challenge of water.
Water has great significance in our culture.
Please glorify yourself as a gentleman.
Water deficiency affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water available throughout the year is covered.
Just 8 percent.
It's time to find peace for this problem.
With the participation of the people like other problems, we will relieve the problem with the ability and vision of one crore and three million people with the power of the people.
Giving the highest importance of water, the Ministry of Water has given the form of new water resources in the country.
This will determine all the problems related to water.
A few days ago, I decided to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the villagers of the country.
I wrote that the people of the village called the people's association to keep the water safe, to sustain the water, not to lose every rain, and to think with the villagers.
I'm glad they did it and on 22nd of this month thousands of panchayats tried millions of people.
The people of the villages decided to share every water.
Today I want to tell you the story of a sarpanch in the Man Ki Baath program.
Listen to what message the village chief of the Lupung Panchayat in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given to all of us: 'When we wrote letters to the Prime Minister of Water Safety, we did not believe that the Prime Minister had written such a letter.
The people there are once more ready to share their lives for water conservation.
I congratulate all the villagers and all the villagers for their excitement.
The people of the village now seem to be competing to build a temple for water in their village.
Like I told you, social efforts can create a virtual change.
There is no 'a solution' in the country to face the problem of water.
That's why efforts are being made in different ways.
But everyone's goal is the same - it's water, water conservation.
Drinking lines in Punjab.
With this effort, we can get rid of the problem of water.
The life of rural people has changed due to the construction of tanks in Timmaippli of Teluguna .
In Kabirdham of Rajasthan small ponds made in the field of agriculture have been made a big change .
I read a social campaign in Vellore in Tamilnadu where 20 thousand women organized to revive the Nag river.
The women of Gwale, who were trying hard to enjoy the rain water, were also read.
I believe it can be impossible if we make a strong effort.
When people come together, the water will be waited.
I say, water is a spring, that spring of water will create a new life by touching the water.
Let's get a 'a water supply' to protect every drop of water.
In this, we can tell about water related problems, as well as spread water safety systems.
I'm specially asking the remarkable characteristics of different fields to make a different circulation for water safety.
Everyone in the field of films, in the Sports field, in the media, in friends, in social organizations, involving social organizations, in their own way to narrate stories and songs.
Let's wake up the society, unite the society, join the society.
Look, we can see a change in our eyes.
I ask you all to share the information about the traditional methods of water conservation.
If one of you has a chance to go to Porbandar, the birthplace of Porbandar, Porbandar, where there is a 200-year-old water treasure.
There is an arrangement to stop rain water.
I always say that all those who go to the Kirti temple must see the water supply.
There are many types of hydroelectric systems in different places.
You and Janshakti4alShakti Hash Tag will give you information to share.
My dear people, I have to thank you for one thing, and thank you to the people of the world.
Everyone, everybody, who loves yoga as soon as the sun rises on every side of the world, is a journey until the sun is over.
The world-wide nationalists, prime ministers, well-known people, ordinary people, have seen through the point of view of how they celebrated yoga in their country.
The world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that those who are healthy and sensitive to the creation of a healthy society, the Yoga is determined.
That's why Yoga is a matter of great importance associated with society.
Doesn't such a service be accepted and respected
In 2019, it was very happy for me to declare the prime minister's priesthood for those who shared the importance of encouraging and expanding yoga.
You can't imagine how important they have played to propagate yoga.
'Japan Yoga Niketan', there are many institutes and training courses.
Miss in Italy.
The most inspiring examples in front of us.
It's a matter of yoga, can the Indians stand behind it
The 'Behar Yoga Vidyalaya' in Munger was also honored, and they worked with dedication to Yoga for the last decade.
Likewise, Swami prince honored Muni, he established Life Mission and the Lakulish Yoga University.
Yes.
I'll wait for your instructions.
It's a great journey for me to join your thoughts... and it's just a 'monkey bath'.
Come on, let's stay together, let's share the ideas.
I'm listening to what you've got, I'll keep it safe, I'll understand it.
Sometimes you'll try to live with your feelings.
You must be a joyful one.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Come on, let's share the happiness of 'Man Ki Bathy' and continue the responsibility of life.
Manki Bath, February 2019
(Muslims say - 53th Luckam) Namaskara, the famous natives.
These adventurous heroes sacrificed themselves for the Indians of hundreds of thousands.
To sleep peacefully, our slaves stayed away from the night.
At the same time, the attackers responded to their own language.
You see how the attack took place in 100 hours.
The army has demonstrated to make terrorists and those who help them out of their roots.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the reflection of their families in the midst of midwives could be seen, which enhances the entire country's enthusiasm.
The hypocrisy of Ram Ranganji's father Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar is inspiring for us all.
The country conveys the bold courage of the martyr Prasanna Sahu's wife, Menazi, in Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
It's supposed to mix only one son in SRPAF.
That's what we see in every house of our brave and brave witnesses.
I want to tell the youth that they want to know their minds and understand the imagination of these families.
This is inspiring about the future of the glowing India.
Dear people, the war memorial that we all waited in this long time since independence is being witnessed.
It's natural for people to be generous and excellent.
Mr. Omkar Shetty is happy to fulfil the national warfare of Karnataka in Nurendramodhi Ap.
I was surprised and painful that there was no such time for a national war in India.
For the protection of the nation, there was a war memorial that could possess the gentle stories of the devils of their own life.
I decided to want a memorial.
I'm glad to decide to build a national warfare and finish it in such a short time.
Tomorrow, that is, on February 25, we will bring millions of natives to our forces to this national military memorial.
There's a small attempt to lose the country's debt.
This new memorial is built near the heart of Delhi i . . India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti .
I believe our people are like going to this national military memorial to go to a pilgrimage.
The national military memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the nation to the great martyrs after independence.
The design of the memorial shows the immense courage of our poor soldiers.
The National Military Memorial has been designed in three curtains, in which every soldier's journey from birth to martyrdom is painted.
The jewelry of the Amar Chakra symbolizes the ruthlessness of the martyred soldier.
The second chakra shows the courage and courage of the soldiers.
This sentence shows the martyrdom of the soldiers.
Among them the names of the most important martyred soldiers for the country are recorded in golden letters.
After that there is a rescue chamber, which shows protection.
In this tree, you can see the slopes of dense trees.
Last year I got the opportunity to offer a national police memorial to the country in October.
It was also the recognition of thinking that the country should be grateful to men and women's cops who have been unprovoked for our safety.
I believe you must come to see the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you come, you must share pictures from there in social media, which inspire others, they'll be glad to see these memorials in this pure place.
Dear people, I've got thousands of letters and opinions for Manki Bah.
On 3rd March, the birth day of Jamshedji Tata.
The tradition and history of Jharkhand has been enriched from the entirely different family members of the two personalities.
In order to offer respect to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata through Manki Baa, it is as if the honourable history of Jharkhand and the tradition.
These two glorys have increased not only in Jharkhand but in the entire country.
People are thankful to their contribution to the whole country.
Do you know why the English people have snatched the path of so terrible
Because he was afraid of the Englishman who tied such a big kingdom.
Birza kicked the British rule with guns and cannons using her traditional amp and wild.
Birza Mani fought not only for British freedom but also for the social and economic freedom of the tribals.
He did this in his short life.
He spreads the light like the sun in the dark life of the defiled and dreaded.
He died at the age of 25.
Like Birsa pearls, the giants of India have formed everywhere in the country.
The centuries of this freedom struggle will be no longer part of the Indian divinity.
If the personalities of Birsa kiss make us aware of our existence, then the personalities of Jamshedji Tata were awarded to the country's largest institutions.
He knew India needed scientific education and it must be a business center.
Today, the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, called the Indian Institute of Science, was a result of his long-term depth.
Not only this, he established global-class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
The meeting between Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekananda is in the ship between the US trip.
It is said that this church had to be established by the Indian Institute of Science.
Dear people, the birth of the former Prime Minister of our country, Mr. Morarjibhaiyai, was on February 29.
As you know everybody, this day comes once in four years.
Lalitamer, the owner of calm personality, Morarjibai was one of the country's most disciplined leaders.
Most of the time in the parlor of independent India, the privilege of presenting the budget was achieved by Morarjiba.
He had to pay his price in the old age.
The then government arrested him and put him in jail.
But when Jantaparty won the elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
This was the 44th fate of the parliament and the legislative processes to be published in the papers.
Some of the powers of the Supreme Court were reconstructed and the moral rights obtained by the Constitution by 20 and 21 could not be revoked even in emergency.
If the ministry asks, the president can declare an emergency, and the emergency period cannot be used once more than six months.
In 1975, declared insurgency and killed the monarchy and proved that it would not repeat in the future.
His great contribution to maintaining the greatness of Indian democracy will always remember the generation.
Once again, he offers honor to the great leader.
Dear people, this time, like every year, there is enthusiasm among the people about the puppet ancestors.
They bring a positive change in the life of others in different ways of their own superiority.
It's a great thing to bring a rare painting to the new storehouse.
The artistic Tree of Life, built by Abdul Ghafur, gave me a gift to the former US President Barak Province.

If you hear about the Tao Porchon-ynch of America, you'll be surprised to bathe your mind, Lincoln is now a big institution for yoga.
This year, 12 of the 10th ancestors are the most artisans who are awarded this year.
Ordinarily few people associated with the farm sector have come to the list of puppets.
The present change shows the life-style picture of India.
I'm gonna tell you something like a heartbeat today, my dear people.
Brothers, in the last five months, nearly twelve lakh poor families got the benefit of this plan.
I saw how big it brings to the poor lives.
If you know someone who doesn't care if you don't have money, tell them about this plan.
This plan is for such poor people, the school is going to start exams.
In the next few weeks all over the country, different education board exams, tenth classes and twelveth classes will start.
All students, their parents and all teachers, who are going to write the exams, enjoy their hearts with happiness.
A few days back a big event was organized at Town Hall in Delhi with the name of Exama Pa Church.
In this town hall, with the help of technology, I have been able to speak as a teacher to millions of students and refugees from the country and abroad.
Through radio, I've been talking to millions of families for a month.
I guess you're part of my family when you hear the words you're sending on the phone when you talk to you and read your letters.
It gives me a very comfortable feeling.
Friends' election is the biggest festival of democracy.
I've been telling you Manki Bath for years.
Once again, you've been grateful to everyone.
Manki Baath January 2019
This month, on the 21st of this month, we got a news of a very sad country.
Dr . Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji of the Siddhaganga monastery located in Tumkur district of Karnataka became Divangat .
Shiv Kumaraswamy dedicated his whole life to the social community.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us - Kayakve Kailash i . . Kayakvey Kailas i . . hardly impressed and performed his duty , is like being in the hall of Lord Shiva 's residence .
Shivakumar Swamiji was a follower of this vision.
He worked for the social, educational and economic upgradation of thousands of people in his 111 years.
He was famous as a scholar in English, culture and Kannada languages.
He was a social judge.
He tried his whole life to spread food, house, education, spiritual knowledge to the people.
The farmer had all kinds of goodness, his precedence.
The Siddhganga monastery used to offer kaikali and artistic fairs regularly .
I've been felicitous times to get Swamiji's pleasure.
Kalam Sahab has heard a poem about Pujaya Swamiji on this occasion .
Once again, I give respect to that soul.
Dear people, on January 26, 1950, in the middle of our country's constitution.
That day, our country, for Republic.
Yesterday we celebrated Republic Day as Kenkama.
But I want to tell you something else.
The National Voters Day celebrated this day as the National Convention Day.
People from all over the world are surprised to see the great election process in India.
It is natural for the citizens of our country to feel proud of the election commission.
It must have been heard that in the Gir forest of Gujarat there is a Poling Booth for only one voter.
This is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the election commission that is constantly trying to strengthen our democracy.
The election commission in all the states, and the security personnel and others, who are participants in the vote process, ensure free and unprotected choices.
This year there will be world-wide elections in our country.
This is the first time young people born in the twentieth century use their vote vote in the world election.
They have an opportunity to cough the responsibility of the country.
They're going to determine the country's territory.
It's time to mix our dreams with the dreams of the country.
I'm asking the young generation to register a voter if you're supposed to vote.
We need to think that we're going to vote for yourself.
If you don't vote for any reason in your life, it must be a pain.
I'm sorry to see something wrong in the country.
Our country is brilliant.
One of those great things was Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.
On 23 January, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary in different ways.
In Netaji's birth anniversary, I have the privilege of inaugurating a museum dedicated to the heroes who shared in India for freedom.
Since the time of independence in the Red Fort, some rooms and buildings have been suppressed.
These buried rooms of the Red Fort have become a beautiful museum today , the museum dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandrabosin and Indian National Army .
Every stone of this museum is filled with the aroma of our proud history.
Everywhere in the museum revenges the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle, inspires us to go to history.
At the same place, India's giant sons - Colonel Prem Sahagal, Colonel Gur Baksh Dhillon and Major General Shanwas Khan - had committed a case with the British government.
I wanted to keep the hat in the museum, and the visitors coming and see the hat, from which I wanted to inspire the patriot.
Anyway, our leadership's patience and patriotism must be repeated to the new generation in different ways.
A month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman Nicobar Island.
Netaji Subhas Chandrabos, 75 years ago, took up the three-wheeler flag... and I raised the three-wheeler flag.
Likewise, in October 2018, when the three-wing flag rises in the Red Fort, everybody will be surprised, because there's only a way to grow the flag on August 15.
Now the 75th year of the establishment of Azad Hind government was celebrated .
Dilly Chalo, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
For the last several years, it has been necessary for Netaji to get the files to see the public.
I'm glad I could do that.
I remember the day Netaji's family came together to the Prime Minister's residence.
We talked about Netaji and offered Netaji Subhash Bose's honors.
I am happy to try to develop many places related to the great people of India in Delhi.
Despite the 26 Alipur road connected with Baba Saheb Ambedar , Sardar Patel museum , even though the Kranti temple is pleased .
If you come to Delhi, you must go to see these places.
Dear neighbors, when we talk about Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose today, in Manki Bay, I want to tell you a story about Netaji's life.
He also chose radio to interact with the people, and in 1942 Subhas Babu Azad Hind radio started.
I understand that this radio station was launching the Warta bulletin for weeks, in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathis, Punjabi, Pushto and Urdu languages.
In this radio station, Gujarati M.
Who.
Vyas played a great part.
The common people liked the programs launched in Azad Hind Radio.
These programmes were very powerful for the warriors of freedom fighters.
The museum of Darshankala is also arranged in this Kranti temple .
Trying to explain Indian art and culture very attractively.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum where more than 450 paintings and other artistic forms are kept three centuries old .
In the museum the excellent paintings of great artists like King Ravi Varma , Avendranath Tagore , Ganendranath Tagore , Nandal Bose , Jamini Rai and Cylos Mughalji etc . have been decorated in the museum .
I'm specially asking you to go there and surely to know the scriptures of Guru Rabindranath Tagore.
You think I'm talking about the art, why do you think I'm talking about the great scriptures of Gurudev Tagore
Perhaps you might have known as a writer and a musician about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
He has drawn pictures of animals and birds, a lot of natural scenes, moreover he has inspired humanity through art.
It's a matter of fact that the Gurudev didn't name any of his writings.
He thought that those who saw his drawings would understand the painting themselves and know the message that he gave them through his own perspective.
His pictures are exhibited in European countries, Russia and the United States.
Our great man has given a message of harmony, harmony and social harmony through their thoughts and actions.
That was a gentleman, Santh Ravidas.
February 19 is the birth anniversary of Ravidas.
Santh Ravidas ji's dresses are very famous.
Guru Ravidasji was born in the sacred land of Varanasi.
He's been trying to convince the greatness of the people who teach and teach him all life through his messages.

The navigation equipments have been distributed among the brothers who are involved in our fishing, which helps their safety and economics.
We use a colossal technology to ensure the responsibility of the government's services to the people effectively.
The Housing For Ol, that is, everybody's home, has targeted around 40 lakh houses in 23 states.
At the same time, about three and a half million earthquakes have been tagged under Mandega.
Our planets are the symbols of the growing power of the country today.
India today expands the geography of the developing nations, not of the developed nations, through our competitive satellite launch service.
The children's sky and stars are always attractive.
Our surroundings are likely to go beyond the limits that the children think it is impossible today.
It is also a perspective of observing stars for our children and inspiring to find new stars.
Six thousand players participated in 18 games in India Youth Games in Pune in January .
This time in India, players from all over the states have shown their own performance.
The lives of many medalists are inspiring.
In the book, the young player got the sky Gorkha silver medal, and I read that Akash's father Rameshji worked as a guard in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with the family.
And in Maharashtra, Antar 21 is a man who lives in the Captain of the Cabadi team, Sonali Helvi, Sattar.
She lost her father in a very young age, and her brother and mother encouraged Sonali's ability.
It's usually seen that girls don't get this kind of encouragement to participate in the games like kabdi.
But Sonali chose the kabdis, showed the best performance.
The 10-year-old Abhinav Shaw of Asansol, Khello, is a gold medal at the youngest age of the Indian Youth Games.
A farmer's daughter, Akshata Baswanikamati, received a gold medal in Bharodwahan.
When we talk about the creation of India, we must remember that Youth is a new India imagination.
These stories of Khello India should remember that there is not only the contribution of the people of big cities in the building of new India, but also the contributions of young men and children from small towns and villages and villages and young Sports neighbours.

In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi began his first Satyagraha, with strong opposition to diversity.
He established Phoenix, Tolstoy Fams, from where the glimpse of peace and justice was drowned all over the world.
He was inspired and inspired to live in prison for so many years.
He wrote about Mondella Baboo, "Mahatma is an indifferent part of our history because here he started testing the truth.
This is where he has a strong stand for righteousness, where he has developed the vision and struggles of the truth.

Like Ambush Kumar from My Geo, Amer Kumar from Delhi and Vikas Yadav from Patna, Monica Jain from Nander Model and Burdwan from West Bengal, and music scientists from Nagpur asked almost the same question.
They say usually people are connected to you through modern techniques, social media, mobile apps.
I want to tell you a story.
It happened in 1998.
I was working in Himachal as an organization worker of the Indian Janta Party.
It was May.
It was a little dad.
I didn't understand.
Seeing my reaction, he said, "Look, Sab, listen to the radio."
Next time, Akashwani made a survey of Manki Bath.
Some of these Facebook reactions are very funny.
Around 70 percent of the surveys are usually listening to Manki Bath.
Most people feel that Manki Bath has developed a positive thinking in society.
Many reproductive rates have been encouraged by Mankiba.
There were widespread discussions about India Positive.
I'm glad to see Radio becomes more popular because of Manki Bath.
If the leader gets a mike, millions of people can hear it, what else do you want
They found that there was no political in this program.
Even when Manki Bath started, it decided not to be political, not to be the government's virtues, and not to be mooded in it.
The most inspired of my determination was from you.
Small stories of 130 million people will remain.
This country will bring to the new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
When I read the knife, a symptom like that gets a symptom in my mind, it squeezes.
I share it with you in two words with my experience.
Selfie seed dotor, when can a government get power to start in a small village in Haryana, not only in the country but also abroad
People from all sections of society, known as celebritis, joined with it and changed the thinking of the society to a new language known to the generation of today.
Mankibat is not a government, it's a matter of society.
Manki Bath is a matter of India that wants progress.
India's life is not political, not political.
India's life is social justice, social power.
There are thousands of heads in social life, which are political.
If everything is political, it's not a good arrangement for society.
Sometimes political events and political activity, and other talents of society, and their livelihoods, are suppressed.
) Thank you very much for the phone call.
Actually, Manki Bath is a very easy job for me.
Every mankie bats get the people's letters before.
I'm trying to see the maximum number of letters before Mankie Bag and read the commands.
A lot of phone calls are heard.
I'm very carefully reading the ideas and ideas that you're sending to Mankibath's episod.
So whenever you read a letter, the situation of a man who writes the letter becomes a part of my thoughts.
That letter isn't a paper piece for me.
I have lived a prince without stopping the last 40-45 years, mostly in every district of the country and has spent a long time in the remote districts of the country.
Efforts are being made to take care of the departments concerned with the instructions of the letters that cannot be included in the Manki Bay.
Akashwani, FM radio, television, other TV channels, and my friends in the social media.
Because of their hard work, Mankieback can lead to more people.
The Akashvani team is prepared to launch all the episods in many languages.
Some people hear Manki Bath with the same imagination in the heavens used to Modi in the local language.
So they turn into Modi for 30 minutes.
Let's enjoy their best wishes in the name of their ability and naiveness, thank you.
I'm asking you all to listen to this program in local languages.
In their channels, Mankie Baath wants to thank the media friends every month.
A person in politics is not happy about media, and they think they're getting a little less correspondence, and if they get the correspondence, tell me it's a negative coverage.
If you didn't have any cooperation, this journey of Manki Bath would have been incomplete.
I'm gonna have to go to every family.
It's easy to understand if we don't get in the middle of our old stripes in our own life.
I don't understand that a man abandoned his thoughts and accepted the ideas of Aparan.
The specificity of today's youth is that they don't do their own unconfidence, if they believe in anything, they will leave for it and go after it.
Sometimes people can hear what they talk about individuals in their families.
In fact, most of the families and young people are very narrow.
It is said that you don't do that for more time learning things, or about habits and lifestyle.
Through various programs, I have been trying to talk to the youth through social media.
I'm trying to learn what they're doing, what they think.
They always have ideas.
They are very powerful, new and focused.
Through Mankiba, I'm trying to handle the problems of the youth and their work more.
Sometimes there's a complaint that young people are making more questions.
It's better to ask the youth questions.
We think today's youth are very important and think of a lot of big things.
It's very good to see big dreams and to lose big achievements. It's a new India, New Indian.
Some people say the youth want to do things at the same time.
I'm asking what's wrong with it.
Doing many things at the same time, because they're capable of doing multi-tasking.
If we look around, it's social gardens, even if it's startups, even if it's sports, it's somewhere else... it's young people bringing big changes to society.
Young people who dare to ask questions and see new dreams.
If you bring the youth's concerns to the ground, they can bring a psychological change in the country, if they give an open environment to express it.
My dear people, written in the Great Gram's Vineetaji MiGovi, in this Manki Bath, I'm gonna tell you about the organization day.
Vinita says that the day is important because we enter into the seventh year of the formation of the constitution.
Thank you very much for this opinion.
The Construction Council took two years and 11 months 17 days to fulfil this historical thing.
Within three years, imagine that this great man gave us such a comprehensive and comprehensive state.
Today's Time Management and Productivity are examples of their creation of a regime in such a strange pace.
It also inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities in record time.
The Construction Church was a confluence of the great genius of the country, all of them were compelled to give India power, to the state of regime that enables the poor.
When 60 years of India replication was completed in 2010 , bright journey was organised in Gujarat by keeping an elephant on the elephant .
It was the opportunity to remind the youth of awakening the constitution and linking them to the various heads of the constitution.
In 2020, we will finish 70 years as mathematics and Republic, and in 2022 our freedom will be completed 75 years.
Come on, let's go ahead with our structures and ensure peace and progress and prosperity in our country.
He used to say that even though Indians are different, we must be the kingdom before all.
India First - India first, Dr.
In every state government and central territories, it has been instructed to celebrate this opportunity as a measure.
This will be celebrated in all countries of the world.
Along with this Guru Nanak will run a train on the path to the sacred places connected with Devji .
I remember the Gurudwara of Lakhpat Saheb when I participated in the yoga associated with this last day.
During the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001 the Gurudwara had great losses .
Our journey will continue.
As much as we are connected to you, our journey will be deeper and happy to everyone.
Sometimes there's a question in somebody's mind... what did I get with mankie
Your great wishes are my great wishes.
Come on, let's go a long way.
October 31 is the winner of all our dear Sardar Vlabhbhai Patel.
Like every year, the nation's youth are ready to run for the unit of the country.
Now the weather is very comfortable.
I'm sure you must join the Runfor Unit with enthusiasm.
Approximately six months before Independence, the world's most famous international renowned 'The Time' Magazine became the picture of Sardar Patel on the lecture coverage published on 27 January 1947.
With the main article, they gave a picture of India, which we didn't see today.
It was a picture of India that has been scattered in many parts.
At that time there were more than 550 kingdoms.
The British had not been interested in India.
In 1920, how did he do rescue operations at the time of flooding in Ahmedabad
Burdoli says how he gave a sense of truth.
From the treasurers and workers to the industrialists, all were determined to believe him in his faith and resistance to the country.
On October 31, the jealousy of the SAARDAR PATEL will be more special, and on this day the SARDARDAR will be dedicated to the State of Unity by giving the true attention to the country.
The height of this statue situated on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is double the ' Statue of Liberty ' of America .
This is the world's highest and supreme image.
The highest statue of the world is in India in which all Indians can be proud of it .
The Sadar Patel, which is connected with the earth, will be decorated with the sky.
Dear brothers, we all celebrated the Infantry Day yesterday.
I swear to all of India's part.
I salute the family members of the soldiers for their courage.
But we, the people of Hindus, do you know why you celebrate 'Infantry Day'
This was the day when the soldiers of the Indian army came out of the land of Kashmir and snatched Kashmir from the stairs.
This historical event has a direct connection with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an interview with Sam Manek Shah, the great military officer of India.
In that interview, Feeld Marshal Manek Shah, he's talking about the time he was a field marshal.
At that time, in October 1947, a military strike started in Kashmir.
October 31 is the memory of our former Prime Minister Mr. Indira Gandhi.
Indiraj will be honored.
My dear neighbors, who doesn't like games, Sports
Spirit, Strength, Skill and Stamina are the main things in the world of play.
This is not the source of any player's victory.
There were two meetings in memory next time.
The first time, the Asian Para Gyms, which took place in the public, is a chance to join our para adults in 2018.
Likewise, there was a chance to see the Jews of the Samper Youth Olympics in Argentine in 2018.
Youth Olympics showed the best performance of our youth in 2018.
In this we got 13 medals and three medals in Mix.
This is the story of Indian Sports, which touches new heights every day.
India is creating new records not only in sports but in areas where nobody thinks.
He lost his father when he was 8.
He lived in the orphanage for the next 8 years.
After leaving the orphanage, he cleaned the DDC buses and worked as a waiter on the streets of Delhi.
Today, the same Narayan International is receiving gold medals for India.
Not only this, however much of India's heights of excellence in sports.
India never received a hijacking medal at Senier Lovely or Junior Love in Judo.
But Tababi Devi enjoyed history by gaining a silver medal in Judo in Youth Olympics.
The 16-year-old young player Tababi Devi is living in a village in Manipur.
The boy's father is a laborer, mother is fishing.
Sometimes this kid's family was unable to buy anything for food.
Even in such a situation the fortress of Tababi Devi is not supposed to excite her .
That's why history was gained by a medal for the country.
There are so many stories.
Every life is inspired.
The enthusiasm of all young sports is the bottom of wealth.
Dear people, in 2017 we were successfully organized by Fifa Inter-17 Wald Cup.
As a comparatively victorious tournament, the world conferred on it.
This year India has got the privilege of organizing man Hockey Wald Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey Wald Cup will take place from 28 November to 16 December.
In the minds of all Indians, whatever game you play, you must have a tea with Hockey in any game.
India has provided great hockey players.
Whenever you talk about World Hockey, Hockey's story will be incomplete than this great player in India.
Hockey majesty knows Mejor Mechanchand all over the world.
After that, Balwinder Singh Senier, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, from Udham Singh to Dhanraj's children have been traveling for Hockey.
Even today, the players of team India inspire the new generation of Hockey through the victory of their subordination and offerings.
Sports lovers have a good opportunity to see thrilling games.
Go to Bhubaneswar and encourage the Indian team not only to encourage them but also to encourage all the teams.
But in the new era, in the new way, the new generation is moving forward to do this with new dreams, with new enthusiasm.
Some are teaching children, some are teaching elders, some are concerned about purity, some are helping the farmers.
There is no desire behind doing all this, but there is dedication and vision and unsuccessfulness.
A young man learned to play Wheelchair Basquetbol to help the team of Divyangs.
This enthusiasm, this dedication is the work of Mission Mode.
Does any Indian feel proud of this
My dear brothers, when I looked at the opinions of Manki Bath this time, I found a very attractive note of Mr. Manish Mahapatra from Pondicherry.
He wrote in MiGio: Please tell in Manki Bath how the people of India and their lifestyles and traditions are the best exploitation of co-operation with nature.
For sustainable development, we must learn what we need to make traditions part of our lives.
Manish ji, I'm glad to have this matter before Manki Bath's stars.
This is a matter of inspiring us to look into our proud past and culture, which is today in the world, especially in the western states, seeking new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
Our tribal brothers worship trees, trees, flowers and goddesses.
People of Bhil tribe of central India especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship the tree named Almora and Arjun with respect .
In the desert like Rajasthan, the Bishnoi community has shown us how to protect the environment.
In particular, they don't think of protecting trees, but they don't agree to harm a tree.
The giants of Arunachal think they are directly connected to the tigers.
They think they're like their brothers.
People from the Warli community of Maharashtra see the tigers as guests, for which the presence of tigers is enriched.
The Gaud tribes of central India stop fishing in some parts of the Kethan river during fishing .
They see these regions as the shelter of fish, and they get good fish because they're thinking about it.
In the solitary areas of Nilgiri in southern India, a small group of Doda, traditionally building their homes, is due to the materials available in that area.
My beloved brothers, it is true that tribal society believes in living together with calm and calm, but if anyone harms their natural resources, they will not fight to defend their rights.
It is not surprising that there were people in the tribal community in our first-time freedom fighters.
Come on, let's make clear their respects.
Dear people, Manki Bath speaks of those who do unusual things for society.
A few days ago I was reading about the artist Bhai Gurubachan Singh of Punjab.
A common teacher was the marriage of Gurubachan Singh.
But you wonder if a common farmer like Brother Gurubachan Singh told the bride's father that he was in front of us, that it was the real strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told them, I have to promise you not to burn the wheel in the field.
You can imagine how big it has social power.
It seems to be simple that Gurubachan Singhji said, but this incident tells us how great his personality is, and there are many families in our society that make personal things a matter of harmony.
The family of Sriman Gurubachan Singhji was a example of this before us.
I read the stone mazar near the other village of Punjab .
The people of Stone Majra drive it to the floor, instead of burning the wicket, to use the technique.
Goodbye to Brother Gurubachan Singh.
Welcome to the people of all other places that are trying hard to keep the atmosphere dirty.
You are the real survivors of Indian tradition as a healthy lifestyle.
Oh . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the fossils, in the heart, in me, in the particles of the heaven, there shall be peace everywhere.
For India, the first world war was a big event.
Obviously, we didn't have a direct connection with the war.
Even then, our soldiers fought gravely, played a great part, and witnessed great martyrdom.
When Indian soldiers came to war, they told the world that none was behind.
In the first world war, the world saw the destruction of destruction.
It is believed that more than a million soldiers and almost the same ordinary people gave life.
The whole world knows what the importance of peace is.
In the last hundred years, peace has changed.
It's not merely a war that is peace and charm today.
From terrorism to climate change, economic development and social justice, it is necessary to work together and collaborate with the world.
The development of poor people in poverty is a real symbol of peace.
Dear people, our north-eastern region is different.
The natural beauty there is immense, and the people there are very talented.
Our north-eastern region is now known for many cleanses.
The North-Eastern region is very simple about biological farming, that is, organic farming.
A few days ago, the Future Polysis Gold Award, 2018, was created to promote simultaneous sustainability.
Oh, that means food and aggreacherial organisation.
The priesthood given to the best guidance in this area is similar to the Oscar of that region.
Not only this, our Sikim state has achieved priesthood following 51 policies that have been given the name of 25 states.
In this the people of Sikkim enjoy many good wishes.
Dear people, the month of October ends.
There's a lot of changes in weather.
There is also a time of festivals according to the change of weather , in a similar ways like Dhanteras , Deepavali , Bhayadhuj , Chhath , etc . are the months of November .
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the nation.
