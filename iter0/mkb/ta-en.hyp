Man's voice, October 2019
Especially if you want to say, it is not the only Indian society that participates in this:
Now many state and its citizens and social movements celebrate Deepawali with full kiss and enthusiasm.
It may also be said that there is only a country of India.
Friends, there is an attraction of the world's festival tourism.
The festival has a lot of potential for tourism.
Whatever of our efforts, whether it is Holi, Deepawali, Ounce, Pongal, Pihu, We shall swear by them.
In our country, there are various types of trends in each state and every part of our country, of which people from other countries take more country.
Hence, India's participation in expanding festive tourism in India is very important.
O people of the country, we have decided in the voice of the last heart, saying, We shall do something different on this day of uncleanness.
We all celebrate the women's power and its achievements on this day, i.e., we would respect the Indian country's monks, didn't we
In a few days, there have been a lot of enthusiasm stories in the social media.
Ramesh, a colonist from the neighborhood, told his mother that he was his power.
In the 1990s, at the time of my father's time, my mother accepted the commitment to maintain five children.
Today we are sitting in good jobs for five brothers.
Rumesh, these are my cattle to your mothers.
On the other hand, Geetika Swami, who is very angry at the Twitzer, has said that Major Kushboo Kanwar is the Indian country's dead.
For them, Kavitha Divadi is the daughter of the Indian country, and she gives her power.
My mother is very proud of her daughter's close painting.
He also has good values in the CLAT legislative election.
People are partitioning such information.
Behold, you shall surely study, and be glad, and part you, as they that are in it, and some of you that are in your stead: for in this time I have spoken of my favours with respect to all these saints of the land of India.
We know that the foundation for this was established in the 17th century.
My loved countrymen, on November 12 this year, Sri Guru Nanakdev will celebrate his 550th birthday worldwide.
The impact of Guru Nanakdev on them is spreading not only in India but in the whole world.
Our Sikh brothers are living in many countries of the world, who are fully dedicated to their high objectives.
I cannot forget that I went to the blind people in Venuvar and Tehran.
Sri Kurunakadeva is divided into many things about them, but many parts of the mind's voice will be fully required.
Nanakdev considered their service as the most.
Guru Nanakdev thought that the service was not priceless.
He strongly voiced and acted against social evils such as depression.
Sri Kurunakadeva's news spread all over the world.
One of those who traveled too much during his time.
He went to many places, wherever he went, he would win everyone's minds through his simpleness and work.
Guru Nanakdev has made many important visits, which are called Utasi.
He carried the messages of goodness and equality from north to south, from east to west, and from all sides, to the people of all places, and from the sovereignty, and from the pious.
It is also believed that Shankardev, a famous pilgrimage of Assam, was received from him.
And he made a sacred journey to the land of Harithwar's place.
It is said that Sri Guru Nanakdev had stayed in Gurudwara, a shrine of Kasi.
He also went to pilgrimages like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
In the south, Guru Nanakdev has travelled to Sri Lanka.
While traveling to Karnataka's Peter, Guru Nanakadeva solved the water supply there.
It recalls all of us that a famous place called Guru Nanak Jeera Sahab is in Peter, which was dedicated to him.
At one time, they travelled to the north, Kashmir and its neighbouring areas.
This led to a very strong junction between the Citizens and Kashmir.
Guru Nanakdev went to Tibet and the people there accepted him as a blind man.
He is also worshipped in the country of Uzbekistan.
He is part of his pilgrimage to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He took place in the minds of millions of people, who pursued his teachings with full intention and are still following.
A few days back, state ambassadors from around 85 countries went from Delhi to the United States.
There they sighted Portuguese, and all this happened on the 550th day of their birth.
This is the day they were born by Sardar Valpai Patel, the iron man in India, who joined the country in a different way.
The Sardar Patel had a wonderful ability to coordinate people with them, while there was also a power to convince those who had differences.
He really deserves to see Man of Detail, sneaking.
Besides, there are specialities in organisational operations.
He has been art of making plans and designing the tactics.
While reading about their actions, we know how strong his plan was.
Thousands of representatives were coming from all over the country to attend the Congress conference in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the organisations of the conference were imposed on them.
He used this opportunity to improve the city's drinking water network.
He confirmed that nobody should have water supply.
He contacted the peasants and appealed to them to make grave bids.
At the same time, a substantial increase in retail sales was confirmed.
Our country would have been thankful to them at any time for giving a good contribution to the constitutional council.
He was very important to determine fundamental rights, and there was no place for any inequality on the basis of caste and time.
Friends, as the country's first home minister, Sardar Bakpai Patel won in an attempt to wreak gold in the layers of a large and history to unite the confluences.
In fact, while we speak about their efforts, we only talk about the contribution he has given to some specific sections of the country's coordination.
With the news of Sardar Patel, he did not delay for a minute, and immediately went into a protracted operation.
And when he was supposed to be snatched, he was snatched in the wicked desire of the enemy to seize the goals.
After this incident, they asked the brothers to ensure that all the help required for the development of Lakshadweep has been made.
Today, lakhs of islands are making their significant contribution in India's progress.
This is an attractive tourist spot .
I hope you all shall go to the beautiful islands and sea coasts.
The unity statue was dedicated to the country and the world to remember the memory of Sardar's doubt on October 31, 2018, my nations.
This is the world's largest figure.
This is a two-pronged statue above the statue of the independent goddess in the US.
When it is the world's highest statue, every Indian has a grown up.
Every Indian's head is very proud.
In the same year, more than 26 lakh tourists have come to see the image of unity.
And they observed the glory of the idol of unity every day 8500 men.
It is known that they have expressed faith and dedication in the hearts of these people.
Now there are several attractive centres, such as Sapathikala Gardens, Battam Pulses Gardens, Wildlife Sanctuary, Child Health Organisation, unity, Narsari, which have seen the economy of the region and has been getting new opportunities for employment for the people.
Friends, for all the states for the country, for the tourism sector, this unity image can be a research material.
Within a year, we also witness that a place can be converted into a world famous tourist place.
There are people from our country and foreign countries.
Many of these organisations have been embarrassed one after another, including transport, shelters, guides and environments.
And I also ask you, saying, Let your priceless time go, and see the image of unity.
But at the same time, every Indian who is traveling, go to at least 15 places in India with your family, stay there at night, I reinsurge my request.
Friends, you know that we are following the country's unity daily on October 31, beginning in 2014.
This day, we report that our country's solidarity, unity and security should be saved by what price is given.
On October 31, every year is being arranged for the exchange of unity.
All sections of the society and every section of the population will be replaced.
In the same way, this trend is being implemented not only for physical, but for intimate and friends, for India's unity and for India to touch new peaks.
My neighbours, Sardar Patel joined their country with the help of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a miracle in our lives, and in a variety of countryside, we must be strengthening this mantra for unity in every stage, in every stage, in every stage.
Our society has always been very provocative and awakening to strengthen poverty, nation's solidarity and mutual goodness.
If we look around us, many examples of those who are involved in pursuing each other's goodness will be seen.
But in many cases, the effort of the society, its participants, disappear quickly from the reminder.
Friends, I am well remembered in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict in the matter of Ramadan Bhumi.
But after the ruling of Ramadan Bhumi, the then state, political parties, social organizations, social organizations, representatives of all the time, the Sadhus and the Punitars have spoken of very quiet and mediating views.
This is an attempt to reduce the pressure in the environment.
That day shall the moments remind us of our sins.
This is an example of the solidarity of the nation.
Even Gods who have experienced benefits, 125 crore Indians are themselves.
But there is a comfortable experience and interesting experience.
I'm asking, I'm speaking why you shouldn't share with you.
Just imagine... the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature is 50-60 degrees below the project.
The air-of-the-virus is merely a name.
In such a opposite situation, living among these challenges is nothing less than any militarism.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders, but also running a clean ionist movement.
I express my appreciations to the people of the country for this miraculous obligation of the Indian Army, and I see my thanks.
It is difficult to lose anything in the severe cold there.
In this case, all the most important tasks are to maintain and organize the pockets.
There is an environmental organisation where it lives in the life of rare animals like ice, and there are rare animals like iPex and brown bears.
My hearts, our nations, the dresses, and the life of all ours, are not the days of a new waking up.
Moreover, on the day of Deepavali, particularly buying something new and bringing something out of the market has been declining in every family.
I once said we should try to buy local things.
If we get the necessary material in our village, what is the need to go to regional level
What is the need to go to the district level if there is only one thing in the circle
As much as we want to buy locally available things, Gandhi will grow in 150 itself as a great opportunity.
I repeat my request that we buy something in the hands of our neighbours, dressed garments, produced by our father-in-law.
Deepawali shows goodwill, and I am hoping that we will become more liked to buy local goods.
Through this, we must prove how important we can contribute to denying the dream of Gandhians.
I have once again told the sacrifices for this blessed thrill.
On the day of Deepavali we burn many kinds of snares.
But sometimes it is due to our neglect.
It hurts.
Therefore keep yourselves also, and be glad to celebrate the feasts.
My sacrifice is good.
Thank you.
It is always ready to express its happiness and express its support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indian nationals celebrated the gains of a virtue called 'Paurav'.
We remembered the precise attack in 2016, and our soldiers responded strongly to the hijacking war that was demanding an extremist war on our country.
In order to inform the citizens of the country, especially the youth of our power, our soldiers arranged for museums at various places in the country.
Look how eligible we are, how our soldiers save our nations by paying their lives.
One day, like the mountain of might, youth reminds of the great tradition of our soldiers.
And we intend to ensure the unity and unity of the country.
I am also participating in a program in Jodhpur, a virgin, Rajasthan.
It is now decided that our soldiers will give a strong answer to those who are seeking to participate in our country's peace and development environment.
India has only given its determination to maintain peace and dedication has come from feelings.
In the two world wars of the twentieth century, more than one lakh soldiers have sacrificed their greatest sacrifice for peace, even if we have no connection with the wars.
This is also a militarism that our soldiers have expressed in the direction of peace.
Our virtuous soldiers have been wearing a blue helmet and have played a key role in establishing peace in the world.
And it shall be different, O nations, that the things of heaven shall be different.
In this way, it is not surprising that Indian aeroplanes have expressed their power in the heaven and attracted attention to the countrymen.
They gave us a security feeling.
One of the people's desires and admirations for the mobilization of the Freedom Freedom Federation, in which our airlines will express their powers with irritating operations.
We celebrate the air force day on October 8.
In 1932, our aircraft carried out a small-scale launch with 6 airplanes and 19 airplanes, today in the 21st century's most powerful airplanes.
I express my greetings to all the airplanes and their families who provide their services to the country.
In 1947, when the Pakistanis attacked in an unprovoked way, our airplanes decided to defend Sri Nagar from the attackers and landed the arms and war bases of Indian soldiers at the right time.
The air force responded strongly to the enemies in 1965.
Who are those who do not know about the 1971 Indigenous freedom struggle
In the Tiger Hill area, the enemies snatched their soil overnight.
The country has been grateful to the air force because of the messenger actions of our airplanes, until the repayment and relief operations are arranged.
Their sentiment is strange to combat all the betrayals from the floods, floods and wildlife and help the people of the country.
The air force has advanced an observation to create a Palan equality in the country, opening the doors of each of their departments to women.
Now the air force will be able to join women, and simultaneously with short-term jobs, and I have announced that I had from the Red Fort on August 15 this year.
We can say for a long time that the role of women's power is growing with the Indian military forces, not just the male power.
Women are powerful, but now they are being armed.
My countrymen, in the past, a navy official, Abilash Tommy, faced the struggle for life and death.
The whole country was concerned about how Tommy was saved.
You know that Abilash Tommy is a very comfortable officer.
He is individually the first Indian to travel to a small boat, without any modern technology help.
For the last 80 days, he has been participating in the Golden Globe Race in the southern part of the Indian Sea, without decreasing its speed in the sea.
A few days ago, when he was rescued from the sea, I spoke to him by phone.
I have already met Tommy.
I pray for Abilash Tommy's special health, his pride, his intimidation, his indifference, his morality, his hostility, the power of war, will surely invite our youth.
My neighbours, every child in the country knows what is important for our country on October 2.
There is another feature on October 2 this year.
For this year, we have been preparing for a number of events around the world before the 150th birthday of Gandhians.
The comments of Gandhians have provoked the whole world.
Today, I want to talk to you about a more important act of mind in the voices of the mind, the hypocrisy, and the people of the country must know it.
In 1941, Gandhians started writing some ideas as the Constructive Programme.
Later, when the independence struggle was intensified in 1945, he prepared a combination of the ideas.
He put forward his views on many issues such as hypocrisy, peasants, villages and workers' rights, safety, cleanliness and spread of education.
This is also called Gandhi Sartre.
Everybody has experienced this in the most illustrated form of his personality.
He made every human feeling that everybody is very important and unnecessary to the country.
It was his biggest contribution to the freedom struggle that turned it into a widespread mass struggle.
All sections of the society, following the chamber of Gandhians in the freedom struggle, have encouraged themselves.
And what has she said, 'I give you a guardian', and whenever you are obsessed,' behold, the feeling of this solemnness is in you: look at the man who is very weak and weak, and remember his face, and listen to your heart, and ask your mind what you are doing, and ask your mind how much of that man's profit is.
So shall his life and his future be illuminated
'My loved countrymen, this protector of Gandhians is still equally important.
Today, the growing middle-class people in the country, their growing economic power, their purchasing power...
If we go to buy something, can we remember one hour's brother
Can you recall that survivor
Whose face is glad
If you buy, someone will be happy directly or indirectly
My joy is strong, if there be great profit from this.
While listening to this mantra of Gandhians, when we all buy anything in the days to come, when we buy every thing at the time of the 150th birthday of Gandhians, recall what kind of profit should be given to all our countrymen, especially those who have made it their sweat, who have invested their money, who have sown their capabilities in it.
He could have been unaware of how this would happen - but this happened, India got freedom.
This is how we seem to see how the poor can give a greater contribution to the fight against their poverty in my country's economic membrane and economic power.
But today I think this is the real patriotism, which we can give to the oil.
All of these doors are painful, he said, all of them should be used.
And it came to pass in the land, that there was a snare in the people of the country, and a snare, and a small snare in every corner of the maternal corner.
We are celebrating two days after Sastry's birthday with a foolish man.
His anger, Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, is a sign of his mind's personality.
As a result of his unhealthy indulgence in the country, he was able to give him a mantra to win the country's soldiers and peasants in less than a year and a half.
Hundreds of people joined themselves in this movement and I had a chance to serve with the children of Ambethkar school in Delhi.
The founder of that school is worthy of Baba Saheb.
All kinds of people throughout the country were engaged in this service on 15th.
Organisations also gave their share with great enthusiasm.
The school children, college students, national students, national health workers, youth organizations, media groups, and corporate corporations, served on a large scale.
I express my heartful appreciations to all those who want to be cleansed.
Let's hear a phone call.
But if you had not been able to telephone to tell you how it was a proliferation after the seizures had occurred, it would have been unlikely to see the attention of the people associated with this movement.
I'm telling you my thanks in a special way.
My eyes are many nations, the pure India movement, not only in our country but also in the world, but also in a successful story.
This time, India is organising the world's largest cleaning congress in an unprecedented manner.
Mahatma Gandhi participates in the International Safety Conference, the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, together with health ministers and departmental experts all over the world.
The celebration of Mahatma Gandhi International Cleanliness Convention will take place on October 2 this year, on the occasion of the 150th birthday celebrations.
In the constitutional law of Babasaheb Ambethkar, there are several critics of the defence of the basic rights of the poor.
The NHRC was established on October 12, 1993, 'National Human Rights Authority'.
The commission has been established and completed for 25 years.
This swearing is not only protecting human rights, but also working on improving human eye.
Adal Bihari Vajpayee, the closest leader to our hearts, said that they and human rights are not our principles.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Authority, the principle that comes from the tragic period is 'Sarvey Pawandhu': 'This has been wrecked.
This commission has created widespread awareness of human rights, and has enjoyed a compliment to prevent its misuse.
This 25-year-old journey has created a hopeful and reliable environment to the countrymen.
This provides an activity to a healthy society, which can rely on particular democratic phenomenon.
Today, 26 state human rights commissions are being operated along with human rights works.
As a society, we understand the significance of human rights and need to follow it in practice, which is the source of progress for everyone and everyone.
In October, Jaya Prakash Narayan and Rajmatha Vijayraje Scindia are coming to the fore.
All these maternal grandsons have instructed us, and we will remember them.
On October 31, Sardar's birthday comes, and I will speak extensively about this in the voice of the next mind, but why do I want to tell him today, for some years, the Opinion for unity on October 31, the birthday of Sardar is being organized in every small town, region and villages of India.
This year we must try and arrange for this trend to unite our villages, regional, cities and big cities.
The wave for unity is a specific way to see us in particular about them because he worked for the solidarity of the country throughout his life.
I appeal to all of you, on October 31, through the course of unity, we must force our efforts to unite every section of society and every sort of thing in the country to unite with unity, and this will be the greatest splendor for his name.
Man's voice, August 2018
Today, Raksha Bandhan is celebrating the festival all over the country.
To all the nations this sacred day, and my good life.
Raksha Bandhan is pursuing love and confidence among his brother and brother.
The festival is also a great example of social goodwill for centuries.
The Raksha Caire, which is also the rescue rock, has many important stories in the history of the country, which are associated with the faith of people in two different parts or times.
After a few days, Genmashthamy is coming to the fore.
The glimpse of elephants, horses, teeth and jay Kanhaiyal is swinging as much as Gee, Govinda and Govinda.
The joy of Sri Krishna's devotion is a good experience.
In many parts of the country, especially in the state of Maharashtra, our youth will be preparing for Tahi-Handi.
For all the people of the country, Raksha Bandhan and Jenmashtami lived a lot of good.
Thanks to your mind, sister Chinmai, for preaching a particular thing.
Besides Raksha Bandhan, we are celebrating the cultural day on Chiravana Poornami day.
And I will see my livelihoods to all that dedicate themselves to this great treachery, and to bring it to the people of Maruchoti, and to every one that dedicated them.
There is a significance of every language.
In India, Tamil language is the world's most foolish language:
Likewise, there has been a great deal of Indians and all of us that cultural language and wise have been enlightened.
Wisdom gallery attached to every section of life is accumulated in the language and its literature.
It would be a technological, technological, peculiar, healthy, sky-vision, architectural, mathematical, economistic or environment...
You will be happy to all of you, except that the Battur village residents of Shimoga district of Karnataka still use socialism in the case.
There are prospects of creating unprecedented words of the society and Sufix and society, i.e., prospects of compositions 200 ago, i.e., Prefix, 22 percent.
Hence, any hot sentiment or thing can be correctly described.
Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan always remembers them.
On his birthday, we celebrate the day of teachers all over the country.
I am telling my livelihood before the day of the teacher coming to all the teachers of the country.
At the same time, I'm telling my greetings to science, education and dedication of teachers to students.
Our peasants who are hard working, have brought this seasonal expectations.
In some places, there has been a natural condition of more rain than other places.
We also saw how bad people's life was suffering from the hazardous floods in Kerala.
Though we cannot fully enjoy their misery, I am confident that 125 crore Indians stand with you in this sluggish moment.
I pray that those injured in this natural betrayal should be quickly treated.
Everyone decides how to reduce the seats of the people of Kerala and how we share their misery.
We know that the soldiers were the heroes of rescue work in Kerala.
They did not leave any attempt to save the victims in the flood.
Everyone has made a major contribution to this movement that the air force, the naval, the ground force, the border security forces, the central factories, the security forces and the accelerated force.
In particular, at this time, I want to mention the hard work of the Suras of the NDRF, the National Petroleum Management Force.
Tomorrow, the festive festivity was celebrated, and we must give power to the country, especially to Kerala, and they must rise faster from the impact of this betrayal, and we also demand that the development journey of Kerala be faster.
Once again, I reassure all the nations and the people of Kerala and all the people suffering from the betrayals across the country, that the entire country is supposed to be on the side of you when it is confused.
Behold, my loved nations
This time I was watching the suggestions for the voice of the mind.
I saw what the people of the country had written too much - 'This is a favourite model for us.'
Kaziaabad's Kirti, Switzer Wats from Soneib, Pravin, brother of Kerala, and Dr. from West Bengal.
MyGov has also asked for an operation in Narendra Modi Mobilee App that many people should talk about the brilliantity of their lives as Akhilash Pandey, a member of the Sweepbanker's Kadihar.
On August 16, the country and the world were drowned in sorrow, listening to their time.
He fled the post of prime minister 14 years ago.
For the past decades, he has been away from intense politics.
He did not find a place in the news, but he was left out of public life.
Though the new year is a big gap, after August 16, the country and the world saw that there was no gap in the minds of the common Indians for this decade.
Adula has increased the country's love, grief and sorrow for them, which shows his greatest personality.
For the past few days, Adal's most important features appeared before the country.
People recall him as the best parliamentarian, understanding writer, the best speaker, the prime minister of public interest.
And the sea shall be thankful to them, that it may be a land to bring good news, that is, Good Governance into the main waterfall
But I want to tell today about a more comprehensive aspect of their widespread ruling elite, which would be very beneficial in the coming days because of the political culture that they gave to India, the attempt to change it and the attempt to make it formally.
It's confirmed.
India would be thankful for the 91th political law in 2003.
This change led to two significant changes in Indian politics.
First, the number of state ministers must be only 15 percent of the total bill members.
Secondly, according to the law against the party, he increased the amount of one-third of the previous members and became two-thirds of the members.
With this, clear regulations were made to ensure membership of party parties.
The political culture, which has created a large-scale cabinet in India for the last decade, was not to divide the large cabinets and tasks, but to maintain political leaders.
Atal changed the situation.
Due to his actions, money and expenditure were damaged.
Moreover, there was an improvement in ability.
This is possible only by a prophet like them, which began to develop a healthy tradition in our political culture.
Atal, they are a real patriot.
During his tenure, it was changed when the financial statement was submitted.
Financial statement was dedicated at 5 in the evening before the British process.
In 2001, Adul changed the time to dedicate their financial statement from 5 in the evening to 11 in the morning.
Likewise, in the country today, you are watching the discussions about the election being held for the central government and state governments.
While we are determined to deny his dream of a rich and developing India, I dedicate to them on behalf of us as well as Shirtaanjalis.
While negotiations about the parliament are raised, they are spoken of suppression, noise and austerity, but if anything is good, they do not speak much about it.
A few days back, the assembly's rainy season meeting was over.
You will be glad to know that the economy of the Lok Sabha was 118 percent and the state's capacity was 74 percent.
All the parliamentarians, who attacked the party's differences, tried to make the monsoon session more useful, resulting in the completion of 21 bills in parliament and 14 bills in the states.
Both of them will be reminded of this rainy meeting for social justice and youth welfare.
In this session, a number of legislative legislations were carried out to the youth and the restored classes, who feared interest.
This process will substitute to achieve the aim of social justice.
Amendment bill was also carried out to protect the rights of the Shedulet tribes.
This law will further defend the interests of the subordinated and tribal communities.
And he shall restrain the evils of the guilty, and believe in the hearts of the poor.
No civilized society can bear the injustice to women's power.
The land is not ready to bear the sinners that are in synagogue:
Hence, the parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and has taken the lead to a severe punishment.
A court in Mandsore, Madhya Pradesh, may have been studying a few days before two of the two accused, who had asked for a case within two months and sentenced the child to death.
Earlier, a court in Kadney in Madhya Pradesh finished the trial in just five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have urgently given judgments in such cases.
This law will be aimed at preventing crimes committed against women and girls.
When we proceed to the nation's wealth, we can change the lives of poor, backward, exploited and ruined.
In the rainy season, they joined together to create a special frontier.
I thank all the parliamentarians of the country for my heart.
Today, a number of millions of nationalists are focusing on the Asian sports competitions in Jerta.
It is only the Indian soldier who has won tension every day in public newspapers, televisions, newspapers and social networks.
Asian sports competitions are now going on.
I want to show my appreciations to all the sportsmen who won tensions for the country.
I am telling my blessings to the sportsmen who are now participating in the contest.
India's sportsmen, especially the shooting rivalry and the malicious rivalry, have achieved the most important achievements, but our sportsmen are getting tensions even before such areas such as Wushu rivalry and boating.
These are not mere tensions - the evidence of Indian sports and sportsmen's appeasements and dreams...
Our women also have a growing number of tensions for the country, which is a very aggressive sign.
In any case, our youth, who are 15-16 years old, will be among the young sportsmen who won tensions.
The national sports of everybody have lived my sacrifice every day.
We have seen all of us building houses and buildings with bricks, but you can imagine that nearly 1200 years ago, a large mountain has been descended into a very special, broad and magnificent temple, but this is what has been done, but it is also the Kailasnath temple in Ellora of Maharashtra.
India's land has been a engineering checkpoint.
Many engineers have emerged in India, who have achieved unprecedented imagination and have given examples of wonders in the engineering world.
Hundreds of farmers and others are still benefiting from Krishnaraj Sagar Dam on the banks of the Kavira river.
In these parts of the country, he is supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be, and the country also gives him respect.
In his memory, we are pursuing engineers daily on September 15.
In the way he has shown, the engineers of our country have responded to a separate picture all over the world.
While we speak about the wonders of the engineering world, a incident recalled in 2001 when a terrible earthquake occurred in the Garch region of Gujarat.
When I was working there as a self-sacrifice, I had a chance to go to a village, where I had to meet a grandmother who had given 100 years of age.
He was listening to me, calling my house to park it in the garden.
He added, 'This has seen three landscapes of my house.
I've met 3 landscapes.
I understand them in this house.
But there is no harm anywhere.
Several centuries ago, how the engineers of the period built buildings, according to the regional environment, as it was possible for the public to live safely.
We must think for the future when we follow the engineers daily.
The world is suffering from natural betrayals.
We shall be in the voice of the mind, and we shall speak openly, and we shall proceed to the land through our hearts, and be united.
With this feeling, live my strength to all of you.
Thank you.
We'll meet again.
Man's voice, July 2018
And he said, O people of the land, drunkenness.
In spite of India's vast and variety, rains sometimes pour their burden.
But why should we reduce the rain
As a result, nature reveals its anger sometimes.
Therefore, we must be natural lovers, protect ourselves, defend ourselves ourselves to maintain our nature, only then will there be a deterioration in the summers of nature.
A few days ago, the natural betrayal of the incident attracted attention to the whole world, enjoying human society.
Normally it takes a few hours to come out of that cave.
But on the day the game of law was different.
After they went a long way inside the cave, due to sudden obstacles, substantial water stopped at the entrance of the cave.
They stopped the way out.
And they stayed on a small rock in the cave, not two days, but for 18 days.
And, behold, when the little ones shall die in front of the eyes, surely imagine how the situation of every moment is to be spent
On the one hand, they were very sick, on the other hand, all human society was united and expressing the humanity of God.
People from all over the world were engaged in prayers to bring these children out safely.
And it shall come to pass, that the fathers shall not be sorry, neither shall the eyes of the mother be increased:
The children were astonished all over the world, seeing they did not lose their faith, while they revealed so much emotion and anger in a dark cave full of water.
This incident makes us feel as if human society is united and wonders are happening.
But it is necessary that we look at the goal of calm and solidarity and work for it.
Nearly a few days ago, the poet of our country, poet Panij, fled all of us.
He has a special significance - faith, self-confidence and depression.
July-August months are the most important months for farmers and all youth.
Because these months they are the peak season of colleges.
Hundreds of young people like Sathya come out of school and join colleges.
The examinations of February-March months, if asked, are sweet in the month of April-May, and are determined to determine the choices and the direction of travelling in life, which work should be done.
This is the most important time in July that the youth's client goes away from questions and goes to the cut-off values.
Students' attention go away from home and go to the students' house.
Students flee from the maternal thighs and join under the thighs of the professors.
I am fully convinced that my young friends will be very encouraging about starting college life.
For the first time, leaving the house, leaving the village, leaving a safe environment, starting to direct themselves.
All these youths have emerged from their homes for the first time to create a new direction for their lives.
Many students will join their colleges and some will join.
Be calm, as I want to tell you, and experience your intuition in life, and there is no doubt that the books are inevitable, but reading is important, while you have the nature of looking for new things.
There is a lot of value for old friends.
Little comrades are very valuable, while the election of new friends is a very intelligent activity.
We can learn some new things, some new capabilities, new languages...
My best wishes to all young people who started the new labour.
While speaking about the college season, Ashram Sawdri, a student from a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh, was able to overcome the hard challenges of life.
He has been elected in the first attempt to test the medical care of the Jodhpur AIMS hospital.
His father is working as a troop worker and denying his family.
I'm telling him my good life for his success.
Students from all such poor families have achieved their unprecedented efforts and resistance to the worst conditions.
Their achievements predict us that Kushi's father-in-law from Nagpur is a driver in the school bus, the father of Karthik, a resident of Aryana, works in the cool breeze cool, the father of Jamsh Sahu of Jharkhand, and the student is also selling sports goods in the fair.
Likewise, Anushka Banda, a opposite woman from Kutka, was suffering from a spinal muscular atrophy from birth...
All of them are accustomed to psychiatricity, and have the achievements of reversing the world.
And if we behold ourselves, we know many such examples.
And some good thing that is on one side of the land is filled with power in my heart, and it gives joy:
When I tell you about such young people, I'm taking care of them, this is the meaning of life.
I want to hear the songs of the poems of the utensils and the songs of the utensils. I want to call the bright light to the light, and I want to remove the brutality from the flowers. I want to sing the mountains.
My eyes went on a news a few days ago, my countrymen, saying, 'Two young men despised Modi's dream.
While reading it further, how today our youth have been trying to make a change in the life of the common people using technology as intellectual and instrumental.
I was once speaking to Indian youth in the city of San Jose, known as the technology center.
I urge them to take time to think of how they can use their capabilities for India.
I quoted information and ability to exit foreign countries, how to use the country.
Two information technology experts from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu, and Rajneesh Vajpayee, joined me in a new attempt to accept my challenge.
Using their jobs, Yogesh and Rajneesh joined the SmartGaon App and intellectual villages.
This secretary combines the rural people with the world, and makes ways to get any care and information in their mobile.
Rae Bareli's patriots, Panchayat chief, district judge and district ruler, were all aware of the use of this secretary.
We must assume that if you look at this event, these youths are living in the United States, living between lifestyle and impressions... many years ago, even if they leave India, they know their village summary, understand the challenges, are sensitively connected to their village.
Because of this, the village's needs have been well understood and facilitated.
It is natural for every Indian to bear a breach of their villages and their roots, and to achieve something for their motherland.
But sometimes this feeling is slightly relaxed because of the necessity of time, television and conditions, in which a little bit of defying the island, the sentiment is simultaneously dragging them toward the past days.
Bandarpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
Around 15-20 days before the audience, Varkari, i.e., the pilgrims are walking for pure pilgrimage to Bandarpur with teeth.
This journey is called Vari, in which lakhs of devotees participate.
Gyaneshwar swamis and Dukaram swamis are walking towards Bandarpur, singing, singing, singing and musicing music.
Tirthankaras are called VTOPA or Pandurangan and they come there to visit God.
He that saves the benefits of the poor, the reproaches, the sinners.
Devotees from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states are filled with penance and devotion.
To go to Pantarpur's Vitopa temple, its gloriousness, beauty and joy are all the most extraordinary experiences.
I'm appealing to the sound leaders of the mind that if you get a chance, you can experience the Pandarpur ride once.
Gyaneshwar Swamis, Namadevar, Eknath, Ramadoss Swamis and Tukkaram Swamis are still being the guides of the common people of Maharashtra.
The tradition of these greats is inspiring every corner of India.
We get great news of the importance of Parud's songs, harmony, goodwill, love and brotherhood.
And how was the great tradition of the great men in our land, as they had dedicated themselves to the mothers of the mothers of the mothers of India, whom they had given them in the footsteps of the Lord, and they have seen them again.
Such a great man is Lokmanya Telakar, who has recited an unprecedented picture in the minds of many Indians.
While we celebrate Tilak's birthday on July 23, we attended his memorial on 1st August.
The LORD is full of treasure and self-confidence.
He was filled with the power and buddenness that directly pointed out the faults of the British rulers.
Barthar Bakpai Patel and Logamanya were very attractive.
On August 1, 1920, when Lockmanya Tilak was missing, he confirmed that he had a memorial.
When Sardar Balpai Patel was elected Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, he immediately chose Victoria Carton, known as UK ueen, to establish the memorial of Lokmanya Tilakar.
As such, the British discovered this act, so the ruler refused to allow it.
The most interesting thing is that Gandhians, who spoke at the opening ceremony, said that after the post of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipality has not only received a good man, but also got a brain, for this reason it has been able to build Tilkar's pilgrimage.
My beloved countrymen, the significance of this silver statue is that this silver statue is very unique, in which he is seated in the chair, and the self-esteem is wrecked under it as my genius.
I am parting with you only about the years of the British.
Because of the efforts of the Logamanya Thilagar, there is a tradition of socially celebrated Ganesha festival.
Our ancient tradition and history can be understood from this, even today, about our virtuous heroes, which have great attractions in our young society.
Today, we can see the patterns of democracies in almost all streets of many cities.
I want to make a widespread campaign of deliberate patriotism to the environment in every city and to provide honours to the various rivals, including the MayGov and Narendramodiapp.
I must take your opinions to the public.
Every Indian has to go to goodwill and development figures.
This is what will create a new India.
Tilkar was born 50 years later, that is, on July 23, another Satbudhan of the mother of India was born.
He dedicated his life to the countrymen to breathe the free air.
I am telling Chandrasekhar Asad about them.
Any young man in India would be unhappy with these words - 'We'll see the devotional thirst in our hearts, the power of the opponents... these poems are ideological to many youths like Ashfakulla Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Asad.
Chandrasekhar gave rise to the prosperity of Azad, free hunting and his tiredness to many young people.
Asad paid their lives, but did not interfere with the other regime.
I have a great deal to go to Alirajpur village of Chandrasekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I have seen my memories with trouble to these two great sons of Bharat Maa - Lokmanya Tilakar and Chandrasekhar Asafat.
A few days back, Hima Das, the immigrant and peasant's daughter, has won gold tension in the 400-meter race in the world-class championship camp in Finland.
Ekta Bayan, another woman in the country, wrote to my letter through email from Indonesia, now she is preparing for Asian sports competition.
'Whatever time we have a very important moment in the life of the warriors, it gives me a lot of glory that I have done it,' he said.
Ekta, we all think of you.
And you shall possess the glory of the land.
In Tunisia, Grand Prix won ecstatic gold and white tensions in 2018.
His achievement is that he turned the challenge of replacement into a means of his success.
Due to the road accident in 2003, Egypt Bayan lost his underground organs, but he did not lose his chest and strengthened himself and took the number of numbers.
Moreover, an alternative captain, Yogesh adunia, has won the world's record by winning gold tension in Grand Frie in Berlin.
I am telling you that Ekta Bayan, Yogesh Kadunia, Sundar Singh and all of them have a sympathy for their self-sacrifice and not worthy thirst.
You need to move forward, and play, joy and shout.
My neighbours, many events of history in August are accompanied by tensions, but sometimes the diseases also reverse homes because of the weather.
Live my salvation for this August, and for many things that come to the way for centuries, that rise to the greatest health of all you, and to the prophets of nations.
Once again, we must meet in the voice of mind.
The voice of mind , June 2018 .
A few days ago, there was a historic cricket break in Bangalore.
You all understand that I'm telling you about the test competition between India and Afghanistan.
It is a matter of pride to every Indian that this has happened with India's historical test venture in Afghanistan, the first international test venture to participate in Afghanistan.
As the Republican President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Khani also describes me as a tag, he said, 'The Afghan people are very promising about their hero Rasheet Khan.'
I thank our Indian friends for setting up a base for our sportsmen to express their talents.
Rashid is a representative of the important aspects of Afghanistan.
This lap will be unforgettable for everyone.
This is the first lap, but on one side, I consider it as one of the most important reasons.
The Indian march showed an explanation all over the world.
We can understand the character of the players from this incident.
This shows that the game is an effective way to connect the world and bring out the capabilities and capabilities of our youth.
I live for both Indian-Afghan parties.
I am confident that we will play and develop soon with someone like this.
When we celebrated the fourth International Yoga Day on June 21, the whole world was associated with it.
I was told that for the first time in Saudi Arabia, the historical event of Yogakalya was held, in which a large number of asanas were made by women.
In the highest peaks of Ladakh, India and China's soldiers together studied yoga.
And some of the soldiers learned yoga in the watered ship.
Likewise, some soldiers studied Yoga on the snowy peaks of Siachen.
Our soldiers, in the middle of the air force, embraced all of them at a height of 15,000 feet above the ground.
It is a matter of fact that they did not do this as they sat on the plane, but they did it in the heavens.
Georgeon training took place everywhere in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings, sports grounds.
A scene of Ahmadabad touched the heart.
About 750 transparent brothers gathered at the other side, together with yogi training and gaining world fame.
We have lived for centuries with the feeling that the wealthy family and the world are together without any control of caste, time and geography.
Moreover, people will make it part of their lives.
We remember the doctors only when there is trouble.
But on this day we celebrate the services, dedication and achievements of doctors, I bless them my thanks.
Our country doctors have responded to their pupils worldwide because of their ability.
While there are skills and hard works in the medical industry, our doctors are renowned to solve complex medical problems.
India is a country of enriched history, not a day or month, without a historical event.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to McHar on 28th.
You know why Kabirdasar went to McHar.
Pious Kabirdasar pressured social unity, peace and brotherhood through his poem forms of poetry and poems.
This was his goal.
We see this goal in his works, and in today's world, it is the same sympathy.
Behold, listen to one of his faults: Kabir Soi Peer Hai, Joe Jane Peer, Joe Peer Na Janahee, So Ka Peer Men Peer.
Kabirdasar gave special pressure on social harmony.
What he says in another dhoha...
And there is sin where there is glory and grace.
And he said, The wise is the wise, the wise, and the wise, and the wise, and the wise.
Neither hearken to the saints what their caste is: seek wisdom to them.
It is necessary for the people to accept and value the urgency of the people to suppress the people's appeals to the people.
His comments have been affecting many centuries and even today.
The gurunatha God will say that the service of the poor and the needy is the throne of God.
Wherever he goes, there is a lot of throats for social good.
All castes, all sections, all times, can come and eat food, and the God of Guru Nanak introduces them to the cooking system of Langar.
In 2019, Guru Nanak Dev is to celebrate his 550th birthday.
I want us to participate in this with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
The very long, wide, deep and many sacrifices of India's free war.
There is another history associated with the Punjab state.
The Jalianwala Bagh massacre in 2019 is about 100 years, which is likely to inspire human society.
People who are in my mind, Raman Kumar from Rohini area of Delhi, in the Narendra Modi activity, Dr. Murthy will be on July 6.
I thank you first, Raman, they.
I am excited to see the interests of you in India's balance.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee is their time day, i.e. June 23.
In 1937, Dr.
In his invitation to Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, he also knew that Gurudev Rabindranath Tayur had spoken in Bengal in the grave festival at Kolkata University.
It is notable that this was the first time the British had spoken in the Bengali language at the sword festival at Kolkata University.
Dr. from 1947 to 1950.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first industrial minister of India, and even if he said he founded the foundation for India's industrial development, it was not surprising if he founded a strong base.
In 1948, the first industrial policy of independent India revealed an unprecedented picture of his comments and telephone.
Dr.
Mugharji's dream must make India self-sufficient in every sector and transform it into self-sufficient.
While India improves big jobs, he wanted to pay his full attention to medieval and small jobs, handlooms, neighbourhood and immigration industries.
During the period from 1948 to 1950, he built all the handicrafts weekend, all the handicrafts, doors, and rural jobs weekend to get a financial and systematic base for the entire measure of small and small jobs.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee is his part.
He was devoted to the development of West Bengal.
As a result of his consciousness, intellectuality and dynamic activity, a large section of Bengal was saved and part of India.
In the last few weeks, I have the chance to speak with those benefited by the government's various welfare programs.
The opportunity to learn directly from them about the changes in life is far beyond the curse.
While he knows about a common man... his simple words, his language of experience, his incident, as if he was seen.
Women from far-reaching villages are providing services from pension to passport to the elder civilians living in villages through the public service center.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister is collecting silver and selling ice cream.
Like the Anjan Prakash of Jharkhand, millions of young people of the country are working with medicines and providing expensive medicines to the villages in the area.
The schoolchildren from Tamilnadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important things like toilet management at the Tingring Lab at school at their young age.
In the entire event, I realized that more than the success of the state, the things of the success of the simple people, the energy of the country's power, the energy of the dreams of the new India and the power of the mindset of the new India.
On the contrary, there are others in the society - unless they talk about disappointment, they are unavoidable, unless they inspire unconsciousness, unless they seek the path of individuality.
While talking about the events in their lives with simple people, new hopes and new enthusiasm, I do not regard it as a victory for the state's rejoicing.
The story of a small woman from a small village far away turns to 125 crore countrymen.
I'm sworn thanks to the nations.
40-50 lakh people join this video bridge program, and you have served to give me a new power.
I want to tell you my thanks once again to all of you.
I have always seen the truth that if we look around us, some good thing will be seen in our eyes.
There are men who are good.
We can also smell the aroma of good things.
One thing attracted my attention in the past, which is a very distraught combination.
On the one hand, there are industrialists and engineers, while on the other hand there are agricultural brothers who work in the fields and associated with agriculture.
The peasants added themselves to it, denounced the plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Experts and engineers trained farmers through this mockery to learn the new fields of agriculture and how to do natural farming, how to combine a cattle in the fields and what other crops can be produced.
The result has not been special, profit has not been sufficient, today they have not only served vegetables, they are selling their vegetable marketing and selling their vegetables to the good price, and farmers who produce cereals have joined them.
What I have another pleasure is that these youths belonging to the world of industrialists, engineers and technicians have left their circles and have joined themselves with the peasants, combining them with the villages and working together with the fields and crops.
Friends
Your age is actually supposed to give precept to any young man.
Other youths of the country will certainly go to their Internet and take care of their works, and they will also insist on how to act in various sectors of society in their areas.
It is conscious that a country is a single tax for all the people of the country.
If anyone wants to appreciate the same tax reform system, I would like to fulfil the applause for states as I am.
So far, 27 GST meetings have been held, people with various political implications sit in it, part of various states, part of different preference states.
Before we were defeated, there were 17 different taxes in the country, but the system was changed to just one tax now.
The success of the GST currency is the continuation of currency operations.
As a result, the checkpoints have come to an end, the transportation of the serpents is faster, and the time is delayed, and there is considerable profit in the serpent service sector.
Maybe the world's largest tax reform.
Normally, such a major reform, such a big country, was considered to take 5 to 7 years to complete it when it was a large population.
This is the great success, and 125 crore people have won this victory.
Live you very good.
Man's voice, May 2018
Come on.
There's a chance to meet all of you once again through the voice of the mind.
I think a group of 6 female commanders of Indian shipping has been traveling for months to remember all of you.
They traveled to various oceans and many seas, about 22,000 oceans.
This is the first trip in the world.
Last Wednesday, the woman met with jewels and had a chance to hear their experiences.
I once again express my applaudments to them, to prove that their special activity, particularly the women of India, is not slaughtered by anybody in the world, as I have repeated their essence, the navy's pride and the country's importance.
Nobody knows the feeling of pride.
For centuries, the Everest Summit has been a challenge to human society and the denials have been facing this challenge.
On May 16, a group of five tribal students from a Ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, including Manisha Duruwe, Premesh Ali, Umanand Madvi, Kavitas Kathmote and Vikas Soyam, have climbed the world's finest peak.
These students at the Ashram school started their training in August 2017, where they were trained in Wardah, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Le and Ladakh.
These youths were elected according to the program of the Shaurya movement:
According to the name, they established the country's pride at the Everest peak.
I'm telling people from Chandrapur school and my young friends and heartbeats.
Accordingly, Shiwangi, a 16-year-old woman from India, is a youngest Indian woman from Nepal to the Everest peak.
Happily for Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter-in-law, Dia and the first father-son of the country that touched the Everest peak will join.
It is not that some youths are climbing the Everest peak.
On May 19, more than 50 years old, Sangeeta Behl climbed the Everest Summit.
Some of the climbers on the Everest Summit have shown that they have power and feeling.
In the past, the Switzer Ganga Abiyan, according to the clean Ganga movement, a group of border guards climbed on the Everest peak, but they came down with a single pitch.
This is a pleasant thing, while it reveals the opposite of the environment in order to cleanse them.
For many years, people have climbed the Everest peak, many of whom have won.
I'm telling all the soldiers, especially women, that my heart is full of appreciation.
I don't even notice that there will be such replies when I spoke about Fit India two months ago.
All sections of the sector did not even see that they would support it.
While I speak about Fid India, I agree to the extent to which we are engaged in sports, the country will be involved in sports.
In social media, people are divided into problems related to Fitness Challenge, one by one, decking and leaving the challenge.
Everyone is joining this movement called Fit India today.
Not only they are film fields, but also from the sports sector, but also as soldiers of the country and as school teachers, India will be determined anywhere, if we are physically on all sides.
Likewise, I think it helps us to keep ourselves safe and encourages others to activate their sex.
Thank you for calling your phone, Savi Yadav.
The fact is that the games played on the streets have been part of every child's life, which are being close to today.
In particular, these games may be a part of the summer holidays.
And it shall come to pass in the sword, when you have dinner, that they shall play children for hours, that they shall not bear any concern, nor any concern:
In some of these games, the entire family was playing and playing.
Many of the games from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Katch to Kamrupam have been part of the young man's combination.
Yeah, at different places they might have been called by different names.
The so-called 7 stanzas, for example, is known as Lahori, Pittu, Satolia, Tigori and Sadodiya.
We will be present in these games in the background of our country's populism and indifference.
One game is known in different names, in different places.
I know about a game so-called Somal-Iso, where I belong to the Gujarat state.
It is played in 8  8 square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square square squirrels.
It was played almost all the states.
In Karnataka, it is called Saukabara and Atu in Madhya Pradesh, which is called Bagitakali in Kerala, Sampal in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Shangabo in Rajasthan.
Even though I don't know how to speak in every state language, he came to know after playing, yes, we've been playing it too.
Is there any of us who don't wear kitchen, kitchen
It is known as different names in different parts of the country.
It is called Kotibilla or Karrabilla in Andhra, it is called Kulibadi in Orissa and Vithitalu in Maharashtra.
When everyone winds, when everyone plays, we can express the variety of characteristics that we have with us without sustaining.
You can see that many children are sweet, but when they play, they will become very tired.
They reveal themselves, create the deepest, and the childhood that is hiding within them comes out.
To determine the goal, how to reach the mind, how to create the committee's feelings, how to create a mutually helpful character.
In the training programs relating to business management, I can see that all our traditional sports are being used.
When everybody plays together from children to elders, it is ruthlessly disappearing.
At the same time, we can know our culture and traditions.
Many sports make aware of social and environment.
Animations can create films, play on streets and sands, they will also see and play and develop these games that appear to our new generations.
My poor countrymen, on June 5, India has officially arranged for world climate routine programs.
This time the BEAT Plastic PolUTION is a matter of fact.
The appeal to all of you is that we will take the decision to avoid the use of this product, understanding its significance, and to reduce the negative impact on the nature of plastic destruction, and on the wild animals and on our health.
Enter the unparalleled wed-india2018 world climate, with a number of suggestions very surprisingly - see, know, and try to follow them in your daily life.
When there is heavy heat, when there is no rain, when there is no rain, when there is no cold, they all become experts, talk about world warming and environmental change.
Over the past few weeks, we have seen swelling in many parts of the country, strong winds and bitterness, it is not a natural season.
This also led to death.
All these are the main consequences of the change of wine.
Our culture and our tradition have not taught us to fight naturally.
We must live naturally, together with nature.
Gandhians have come forward in their entire life and in every step.
We will organise a way of maintaining it until it grows, not just with the middle of the tree.
My natives, especially my young friends
This is the news that the world has re-experienced for the past few years.
The psychology is produced by yoga, which always saves us as father.
But the sense is like that of their mothers in children, and mental peace turns into our continued friends.
And it shall come to pass, that the vain shall be our children, and our brothers, and our brothers, and the earth, and our bed, and our wiseness, and our hungryness.
If all these characters are one's companions, the yogi is supposed to win all kinds of fears.
I once again call to all the nations, saying, Go forward to the tradition of yoga, and come to make a country that is healthy, joyful and pleasant.
Today's May 27, India's first prime minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, is his memorial.
I'm telling Panditji my request.
In May this month, he is a virgin author.
In 1857, during the same May, our countrymen expressed their strength against the British.
Our soldiers and peasants in many parts of the country have opened their march against injustice and expressed their evil.
The tragic thing is that, for a long time, the syphilis was saying that what happened in 1857 was a riot.
In fact, it is not merely an attempt to reduce the incident, but an attempt to embrace our self-esteem and self-sacrifice.
Veer Savarkar, who wrote in 1857, was not merely a problem, without fear that it was the first free war.
Many freedom fighters joined Savarkara in India House, London, celebrated the 50th anniversary of it as a mess.
An expert in managing both arms and weapons.
We generally appreciate the courageous witnesses for his bravery and his struggle against British imperialism
But apart from all this, he has been pushing for strange poets, social reformists, always goodness and unity.
I remember Savarkar telling them of our favorite value Adul Pihari Vajpayee.
Besides being a poet of understanding, he also became a courageous revolutionary.
Our lady, with desires and hopes, is telling good life for the bright future of the sounds.
If you are willing to achieve something, then you will determine it, you can win all the troubles
It is the story of some of those who dedicate themselves to the dreams of others, who live in the city of Orissa.
Prakash Rao is theirs.
You will be amazed to know that a simple man who sells tea today is taking up education in the lives of more than 70 children.
All children coming to school make all facilities like education, health and food.
I am expressing his immense appreciations to Prakash Rao in his unprecedented labour, his sympathy in the life of poor children and to give him a new direction.
He has removed the darkness in his life.
Who knoweth not the word of the law of Damascus, which is a jealousy
But if there is someone who showed it, then he is a T.
His life is a concept of all of us, social and all over the country.
And it shall be, that there shall be such things that compass you round about.
In a few more days, they will be waiting for the arrival of the other chakra.
I believe that everybody will celebrate this with great enthusiasm.
Man's voice, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games competition took place in Australia from April 4th to April 15.
71 countries of the world, including India, participated in this.
You should imagine how much climate will occur when such big arrangements have been made, when thousands of sportsmen from all over the world participate.
Would there be no one who has no effect on such an environment, if there was enthusiasm, hope, encouragement, desire, aspiration, aspiration to achieve
..India has achieved unprecedented achievement.
Though it is a matter of boasting of tensions to the soldiers, it is possible to boast all over the country and the people of the country.
Encouragement and encouragement.
We all are together with one feeling.
I have no words to express this feeling.
But I want to share with you what these sportsmen told me.
If I don't know why many things have happened for the first time.
This time, all the malware soldiers who participated in India's level in the Commonwealth contest have won tensions.
Manika Batra has put tensions in all the games she has participated.
He is the first Indian woman to win gold tension in the Daily Dennis Point.
India received a higher amount of gold shooting competition.
The only Para Power Lifter of India won the Sauthri Commonwealth contest.
Moreover, if this time the competitions were specific, most of the successors would be women.
And they played their talents, playing very well with women's swords, and swords, and swords, and guns, and competitors.
The last rival of the Popular Blair is China Nehwaal, two of India's hostilities.
V.
It took place between Sindh.
I'm asking you to join Fight India, come to the top.
I am happy that people have joined it with great enthusiasm.
Many have written letters to express their support for this, partitioning important things and Fight India information on their sex in the social media.
A person named Sasikanth Phonsle has written that my body is my weapon, water is my solitude, swimming world.
Do you know what is written by Rumah Godnath I am glad and healthy after the morning walk
For me, the smoke was mixed with smoke, and we wrote that when we were happy, we had to smoke.
After seeing all this, it is better for many populars to invite our youth to the most interesting ways for FIT India.
Akshay Kumar, a film star, has given a shower.
His other approach is even more popular, in which he can see playing with the people.
Many youths have joined themselves with FIT India's efforts and shared their experiences.
Not alone - try to join your city, your village, your part, your school, your college, all agents, men and women, together with yoga.
How to experience holidays and how to go.
I'm calling you a new job today
I can see many young people spending their time to learn something new now.
The significance of summer training is increasing, youth are also engaged in search of this, as well as training is a new experience.
Outside the four walls, writings and calculations, life is experienced to live in a new angle.
My young friends, I ask you to do a special exercise.
The three ministries of the Indian state - as a field of sports and humanity, and as a hydroelectric sector - have organised these three ministries of the state together for clean India's summer exercise 2018.
You go to the MaiGov Internet and register yourself to participate in the Swachharat Summer Internationalship.
I believe our youth will further advance this movement for cleanliness.
Destroy your information, and send photographs, and despise yourselves.
Come on
We will create a chance to learn in this holiday.
A few days ago, young people from Delhi were showing a thing about some in India, Kut News, who served to teach poor children.
These youths have pursued a larger movement of education for the streets of Delhi and children living in the dwellings.
The new activity began because the conditions of children engaged in the streets were supposed to suppress them.
The movement, which began with 15 children in the immigration area near Delhi's Gita Colony, is now joining 2000 children in 12 places in the capital.
The youth, teachers, who have joined themselves with this movement, have been trying to seize them for two hours in their daily routine synthesis, and transform themselves into society.
Brothers, similarly, some farmers from the mountainous region of Uttaranchal have become inspired by sympathy for peasants across the country.
Because of their integrated efforts, they have not only enriched their position but also the future of their part.
Parli, especially in Pargeshwar, Uttaranch, is being produced.
Because of being a mountainous area, farmers did not get the right price for this
They formed a collaborative organization in Munar village, where they produced a factory to prepare biscuits.
In view of the peasants' minds, the administration has joined it with the nationalist state of life-saving movement.
The biscuits are being collected not only at 50 Anganwadi centres of the Bageshwar district but also from Almora and Gausani.
Because of the farmers' hard work, the income of the organization has hired not only 10 to 15 lakh rupees, but also the employment of more than 900 families, it is also blocked from the district.
Everyone speaks about it, but we are not obliged to do it
Does it not seem to us that water saving is the responsibility of society
This must be the responsibility of each individual.
How can we save every drop of water in the rainy season
Our ancestors have been working for centuries.
They have given priority to the importance of every drop of water.
They have discovered new methods and have come to know how to save every plant of water.
If anyone of you had a chance to go to Tamilnadu, you might have noticed that there are larger inscriptions regarding water supply system and dry environments in some of the temples there.
Big inscriptions are found everywhere in Mannar temple, Cheranma Devi, Mandirpatti and Pudi.
Even today, various educational wells are known as tourist spots, which are still not forgotten as the live examples of our ancestors about the water supply movement.
In Gujarat, Adolescents and Rani Keeva in Patan have been describing the UN's education, science and culture as the world traditional place, perhaps seeing their excellence.
In April, May, June and July, they have the most important opportunity to save rain water, as much as we are already prepared.
Mahatma Gandhi is spent on the budgetary programme of the Fourth Plan of Employment, this water supply and water management.
In the last three years, everybody has been attempting to sustain water supply and water management.
Every year, Mahatma Gandhi has spent an average of 32,000 crores of rupees in the field of employment, water supply and water management.
If you want to speak about 2017-18, about 55 percent of the cost of 64,000 crores, i.e., approximately 35,000 crore rupees of water supply and water management.
In the last three years, nearly 150 lakh hectares of land have been benefited through such water supply and water management.
7,000 people working hard worked hard on the seventeenth day and revived the Kuttamberoor river in Kerala.
The Ganges and Yamuna are water-rich rivers, but in some areas of the northern region, for example, two rivers of Sasur and Katheri in Fatehpur district have dried up.
The district administration confronted a large number of land and water supply operations, according to the programme of Mahatma Gandhi's district headquarters.
With the help of nearly 40-45 rural people, the dried Sasur and Katheri were revived to six.
Did you see how big hungry it is, as a bird, as a farmer, as a farmer, as a village
May, June and July are coming, we will also restrain some responsibilities for water supply and manufacturing, and we will also resolve some plans, and I once again ask you to achieve something.
My fascist countrymen, there are reports from all the four sides of me before the voice of the mind, letters are kissed, calls are coming.
Ian Kumar Benazi, a resident of Deotola village of North 24 Barganas district of West Bengal, has recorded his comments in MyGov - we celebrate Ravindra Jayanti every year, but many have not known the doctrine of the Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore's 'Peaceful, Beautiful and Beautiful.'
Please talk about this in the voice program of mind, asking people to know about it.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tayur became a complete form of wisdom and discretion, and his writings replaced an unprecedented picture of everyone's mind.
Rabindranath - the intellectual, populist, but we can realise that every moment a teacher was alive.
'He wrote in his sympathy, 'When the recognized thing as the responsibilities to impart it to the students' state, which has wisdom, is their responsibility to teach students.
I am not aware of the language of Bengal, but I was habited to wake up early in my youth, and radio broadcast in eastern India will start faster and start late in western India.
And Anandloke, Ahunneh, and Porroshmoni, when there is a chance to listen to these poems, there shall be a lot of enthusiasm in the mind.
Rabindra Singith must have spoken of his poems.
My loved country, Ramlan is in the holy month in a few days.
Ramallan is celebrated worldwide with full distress and respect.
The social side of Norbin is that when man is hungry, he feels the hungry of others, when he is thirsty, he feels the feeling of others' thirst.
This is the time to see the message of the sovereignty, and of the supplication of the supplication of the supplications of the supplications of the prophets.
To travel on the path of equality and brotherhood is a singing from his life.
Once a man asked the sovereignty, it was very important to do anything in Israel.
For this, the sovereignists said, 'We know, if we don't know, we don't know them, but it's good to everyone.'
The sovereignty had faith in the prophets, wiseness and grace.
The sovereignist Mohammad Nabi said, If you have a thing more than your requirement, you shall give it to the man that needs it: therefore it has been given greater significance to the slaughter in the month of Ramlan.
People give donations to the poor in this sacred month.
Any man is rich because of his pure soul, not because of his wealth, but because of his wealth.
Lord Buddha inspired equality, peace, goodness and brotherhood.
Baba Saheb gave power to millions of people who are oppressed and oppressed, until they were undermined by the Constitutional Law.
There is no better example for the utterance.
In the pushing of the people's fate, the idea was one of the greatest characteristics of Buddhists.
In many Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, the brilliant tradition, the methods of Buddhism are linked to their roots.
This is the reason why we are enriching infrastructure for powder tourism, which connects important places of Southeast Asian countries to India's special pious places.
Today, there are conflicts and people's sorrows all over the world, and the Buddhist pavilion shows the way to remove the war from depression.
I express great greetings for Buddhism to those who have faith in the Buddhist Buddhists, and those who believe in the theory and all others.
I assume hopes from the Buddhists to the whole world, through which we can fulfill our responsibility for creating a peaceful and contemporary world based on his postures.
While you have heard of the images of Laughing Buddha, it is said that this laughing Buddha would get the shock, but some people know that Buddhists are associated with an important event in the defence of India.
Well, you can imagine what is the connection between the Buddhists and the Indian soldiers.
The new self-esteem has been broken by the Indian families spread all over the world.
That day is a Buddhist tradition.
On May 11, 1998, India carried out a nuclear test in the state of Rajasthan in its western border.
In one way, India's testing was successful, and in science and technology, India could say that India had defended its power.
On that day, in the history of India, he stirred up the power of our forces in gold.
Lord Buddha showed that the power of Indrathma is necessary for peace.
Likewise today, if we are strong as a country, we can be peaceful with all.
We reflected on the day of the world that India was able to achieve new goals and peaks every day under the strong leadership of India's enormous scientific land.
We already see the new joy and new joy that they have started on the journey they have started.
O people of the country, we can reconcile in the voice of the mind, when we talk about many more things.
Man's voice, March 2018
The day of Rama Navami is celebrated today.
On this holy day shall all the nations live in my hearts.
We could see how much the power of 'Ram Ram' was in his life in every moment of his life.
On January 26, when all the leaders of the Asian Union came here, they brought together a collection of the Kalasaras.
The most interesting thing is that most of the countries have provided Ramayana before all of us.
That is, Rama and Ramayana, not only in India, but in Asian countries in this region of the world, still have the same effect and affection.
I have once again told Rama Navami good life to everyone.
Like every time, my loved countrymen, this time, all your letters, emails, phones and comments have been received in large numbers.
You have asked Gomal Toker to start cultural studies in their MaiGov-Anline style, which I read.
Besides being from the calculation, it is joyful to see the attraction of the culture.
I have told you about the efforts of the concerned sector.
I'm supposed to ask all those who listen to the voice of the mind and are working on cultural works, to suggest how you apply to Gomal's idea.
Kanshyam Kumar, a resident of Bihar state, Nalanda district (B), Paragar village, had read their comments in the secretary of Narendramodi.
You are worried about the fall in the surface water level, of course, this is an important thing.
In the summer, you are asking to keep drinking water for animals and birds.
I will bring your sentiments to all the neighbours.
Do you know what they said to Yogesh Batrasha is asking young people about physical health this time
In comparison to Asian countries, he considers our youth to be physically weak.
Yogesh, this time I think I want to talk to everyone about health - I talk about healthy India (Fit India).
You young people, together with you, can implement a healthy India movement.
During the past, the French Chancellor had gone to Kashi when he came to our country, and the scenes of the trip were supposed to be touching the minds and not to create an impact.
I ask you to lock them now, re-deviate, bring your friends.
Anaga, Jayesh from Chennai and many more children have sent me to the gratitude cards that were found behind my book Exam Warrior.
I want to tell Annaka, Jaisesh and all the children that, after seeing your letters, all the tiredness of my day disappeared as snow.
If all these letters, such telephone calls and comments, if I can read from these, many things in it are in touch with my mind.
I would have to say for months only if you want to talk about them.
This time most of the letters are written by children and they are written about the choices.
They share their holiday plans.
They are worried about the water for animals and birds in the summer.
There are letters from agricultural brothers about the activities of farmers' festivities and peasantry throughout the country.
Some civilians have been consulted with water supply.
Our festivals, our culture, our traditional issues are being discussed in the festival.
That is, the matters of mind are changing the weather, and the truth is that the voice of our mind has changed the climate of life.
Why shouldn't you change
In these things, in these things, in your experiences, in these examples, your supplications reflects such supposedness, so powerful, so comfortable, to do something good for the land.
These include the potential to change the entire country's environment.
When I get the opportunity to read your letters, how a Rickshaw driver Ahmad Ali, a resident of the Kareemganj district of Assam, found out that he had built 9 schoolhouses to read poor children with the help of his deep desire.
13 years ago, Kolkatha's taxi driver Saidul Laskar's sister died due to lack of treatment at the right time.
He found in his mind the determination to build a hospital for not killing any poor because he was unable to get treatment.
Saidul sold his snakes at home, collecting money.
Many of the travelers traveling in his taxi paid money in a bit of money.
A labourer gave his first month's salary as a sister.
In this way, collecting money, spending 12 years, finally gave rise to the fate of Siddle Laskar's imagination.
Today, due to his hard work, due to his depression, a hospital with 30 beds is ready in Bunny village near Kolkata.
Such a variety of sympathetic species are introducing and significant to my country.
Today, when the name of India is highly respected, the unparalleled acts of the wealth of India's mother's wealth are overturned.
This belief is born in every one's mind, that in the whole country, in the youth, in the women, in the transgressors, in the poor, in the middle of the people.
We can proceed, progress can be seen by our country.
There has been an aggressive and enormous atmosphere of self-confidence.
This self-sacrifice, this is a possessive sentiment, to measure our dream of a new India, and to measure our mindset.
My neighbours, these months will be very important for the peasant brothers.
Because of this, many letters have come from agriculture.
This time, when I saw the invitation of discussions with farmers in the Kisan channel for the farmers of Dordharshan, I feel that every farmer should join himself with the TD Kisan channel, see, and let the illustrations shown there be put to their fields.
Not only Gandhians, Lal Bahadur Sastry, Lohia, but also Sautra Saran Singh, or Sautra Devi - have come to the fore as an important part of the economic and public life of the country.
Likewise, Lal Bahadur Sastry also often speaks of trees, plants, vegetation and importance of the specific agricultural system.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia has urged our farmers to ensure all the special income, special water supply facilities, and increase the production of food and milk and create a larger mass awareness.
In his speech in 1979, Sautra Saran Singh urged the farmers to use new technology and create new findings, strengthening the need.
In the past, I went to the peasant festivities held in Delhi.
While speaking to peasant brothers and scientists, I had a comfortable experience of learning, understanding and knowledge of the explorations related to agriculture.
But the most affected thing is Megalia and the peasantry's hard work there.
The low-lying area has served as a major task.
Our peasants from Meghalaya have achieved a record in Mahsul in comparison to the last 5 years in 2015-16.
If the goal is determined, and if the mood is full of inspires, they can be achieved and achieved.
Today, the technologies of farmers' labour are being handled, due to which there is a substantial strength to agricultural producers.
In the financial statement this year, brothers, a major decision has been taken to provide a price for farmers' consequences.
Moreover, work on agricultural marketing reforms in the country is being carried out in order to get the right price for farmers' products.
Attempts are being made to connect the rural regional markets, gross markets and world markets.
The APMC and the E-NAM base will be coordinated while farmers are not urgently able to drive more to sell their products, while there are 22,000 rural markets in the country.
That is, from the outskirts, such an organisation is being formed with any market in the country.
My loved countrymen, this year the beginning of the 150th birthday of Gandhians.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Apart from this, pure India is our psychology, how can 125 crore people together with the shoulders and shoulders be seen as the most important part of the Gandhians
Can you organise new events
Can you create new methods
And I ask all of you, that you share your opinions through my gov.
What could be the sign of 'Kandi 150'
What can be the anger
Let me write your comments about these.
Today, the health sector has been hit by a normal approach across the country.
All health works in the country have already been responsible for the Ministry of Health, but now all the departments and ministries - the Ministry of Physics, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Vegetables and Surveys, the Ministry of Consumer Health, or the Ministry of Women and Child Welfare or States - are working for healthy India, together with healthy health and low-cost health.
Disease health is very low and is also very easy.
The extent to which we are aware of immunity health, the extent to which we are concerned, the family and the community will have the right advantage.
First need to be healthy, clean.
We are also pledging to be a country, resulting in the increase in health care by around 80 percent in the last 4 years.
In addition, widespread work is being carried out in the direction of creating health centers across the country.
As a disease prevention is a health care, Yogasanam has created its identity worldwide with a new power.
Yoga guarantees both body and body .
This is the result of our surroundings, which has resulted in the dissolution of Yoga as a popular movement today, and has a place in every house.
There are more than 100 days left on June 21 in the coming International Yoga Day.
In the last three international journals, people participated in the country and all over the world with great enthusiasm.
This time also we will ensure that we will enjoy yoga, family and friends.
It must be further popularised to all the elderly and elderly, children, youth and the elderly.
Moreover, televisions and emails across the country are providing various events related to yoke throughout the year.
But from now on to yoga day - can we create awareness about Yoga as a movement
My foolish nations, I am not a yoke.
But some have turned me into a yogi professor through their instruments, and I have produced a humble sympathy like yogi.
Efforts are being made widespread to ensure that health care is available to all, priceless and easier for the goods.
Today, more than 3000 people across the country have been opened and more than 800 medicines are available at cheap prices.
Moreover, new centres are being opened.
I'm supposed to leave the voiceless leaders of the mind - that you take care of these people's drug centers.
This would be their biggest service to you.
The price of heart stents for heart patients has been reduced to 85 percent.
The cost of supplementary surgeries has also been determined and reduced from 50 to 70 percent.
According to the Ayushman Bharat Suitary Program, about 10 crore families, i.e., nearly 50 crore civilians, are to be paid 5 lakh rupees for the family in a year.
The number of medical sites in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
New AIMS hospitals are being opened in many states to provide special treatment and health facilities to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened between every three districts.
Within 2025, the target of liberating the country from chicken pox is determined.
Today, the movement of Mag in India and India is being successfully created in the country.
On that day, Dr. Ambethkar dreamed of India as their industrial power and his television encourages us all today.
Today, India is expanding a bright center in the world economy, the most straightforward investment-FDI is coming to India.
Throughout the world, India is directed as a centre for investment, renewability and development.
Baba Saheb was firmly confident of self-sacrifice.
He does not want any man to spend his time in poverty.
Moreover, he did not think that if he had some participants of the poor, their poverty would be lost.
Today, the Mutra program, the Start of India, the Stand of India, has created newcomers and youth from our younger community.
Today historical efforts are being made to deal with the water resources and ports of the country.
New ports are being built on different coasts of India, and the structure is being strengthened in the old ports.
Most of the 40 debates were around the 2nd World War, the emerging ice war and the partition of the country.
During that period, Dr. Ambethkar founded the foundation of Team India's sentiment.
He spoke of the coalition's significance and strengthened the central and state governments to work together for the progress of the country.
Today we have accepted the mantra of the co-operative federalism - the co-operative federalism of all aspects of the administration - the competitive federalism - the rival.
The most important thing is that Dr. Baba Saheb Ambethkar is a concept of millions of people like me from the other class.
He has also shown us that there is no need to be born in the big family or the Seeman family to proceed, and the dream of born in poor families in India, and that we can be able to fulfil those dreams, and that we can find success.
But the pictures of the new India are completely different.
I'm supposed to put before you, that's what you want to participate in this movement with enthusiasm.
My loved countrymen, many festivals are coming in the next few days, like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Anuman Jayanti, Ester and Baisakhi.
Every day Lord Mahavir's jyanti, his supremacy and supremacy come to mind.
And the life of the Lord, and the doctrine, and the doctrine, which we have spoken of Ahims, give us counsel.
Mahavir Jayanti lives for all the people of the country.
As soon as he talks about Egypt, he will recall the instructions of Aishwardhan's instruction, which he has always given mankind peace, goodness, justifying, contempt and patience.
In April, the festival of Baisakhi is celebrated in Punjab and western India.
On the same day, Jud Sheetal and Sathuvain are celebrated in Bihar with joy and joy and joy, in Assam and in the western jungle.
Repeat once again for all yourselves, and for all the coming feasts.
The voice of mind is February 2018
I start with a phone call from the beginning today.
My young friends have asked me many questions about science, some have written letters.
Even if we know the color of the sea is blue, we all know that there is no color for the water because of our daily experience.
Have we ever thought that you shall see the river, and the sea, and you shall see it with color
The same question was raised in a young man's mind in 1920s.
This question has created a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about modern science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
Their name, Sathendranath Bose, was given to popular moderates, known as Boson.
A few days ago, the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Mumbai had to participate in the program to launch artificial surveillance company.
It is interesting to know about the miracles in science.
This artificial microscopic demonstration in creating ropes, ba (B) and specific action machines.
Today the machines continue to make their microscopic and sharp through the machines.
This technique can be used to make the lives of poor and poorer.
In this program of artificial microscopicism, I have asked scientists to think of how this artificial surge can be helpful.
Can you know more about the occurrence of natural sites through artificial microscopicism
Can you help farmers on the outcome
Can this artificial microscopic health services be easily accessible and helpful in discounting diseases through modern methods
A few days ago, I went with Israel's prime minister to start the I-group program in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There was a young and digital device ready.
The young man said that if the unable to speak through this tool, the tool turns it into a tone, and does it as one speaks to someone.
I think we can use artificial microscope in such a way.
Science and technology are a medium value.
They don't realise themselves.
Any machine will function as we want.
Thomas Alva Edison, who found the Little Pulback, had failed in many of his tests.
Once asked him about this, he said, 'I have found ten thousand methods of how I cannot produce the Light teeth.'
That is, Edison has also turned his defeats into his power.
Today I am in the Great Aaron of Magrishi Aravind, not just an accident, but also a great deal of me.
As a revolutionary, he became a challenge to British imperialism, fought against them and raised many questions against their regime.
As a great Rishi, he raised a question against every angle of life.
He discovered the responsibilities for them and pushed the way for human society.
It is important to know the truth, to raise questions again and again.
This is also the real concept of scientists' search.
Why don't you live until such questions are answered.
I greet my blessings to all of our scientists and scientists about national science day.
Rabindra Singh, a resident of Pune, wrote on the Operational Safety in Narendramodi App, i.e., industrial security.
In our country, the security conditions in factories and construction works are not equally important.
Since the National Security Day on March 4 next month, the Prime Minister must speak in his heart about security, asking the people to be aware of the security.
While we speak about civilian security, two things are very important - one is precautionary and the other is ready.
Defence was two, one of the most important in the days of the budget, otherwise it is necessary in daily life.
If we don't care about the safety of our daily life, but not safe, it is difficult to test the situation in the days of the dealer.
That is why these words do not usually have any use in our lives.
While seeing the natural betrayals, most of the places are the result of some misunderstanding of us.
If we are awake, we have followed the necessary rules, we can save our lives and save our society from larger places.
We may have seen many comments on security in our workplaces at times, but we may have seen that they are not pursued.
I ask the municipal corporations that there is a fire brigade, once a week, or once a month, to be exercised in schools.
The country includes many natural betrayers and man-made betrayers of chemicals and factories that we experience.
Today, the National Petroleum Management Festival (NDMA) is heading the country's betrayal management.
In the districts of floods and polar dangers, autonomous administrators have been trained and named as dangerous people.
Till 2-3 years ago, thousands of people died due to the heat wave.
After this, the National Petroleum management organised training sewers to protect the warm wave and carried out a movement of awareness among the people.
There was a good effect on everyone's participation.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat waves decreased from expected to nearly 220.
If we give preference to security, we can be safe.
We must turn into a social warner against danger.
We have been traveling several times and provide security references at the start of the airplane.
Well, was there a way to provide information
This is how we have experience in every sector of life.
In the financial statement this time, the countrymen, under the Clean India Program, have been significant to wealth and energy production through natural gas in villages.
The initiative for this has been named GOBAR-Dhan-Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Research, i.e., accumulation of lives and humorous evidence.
This is the purpose of the Copper's programme to purge the villages, cultivate the minerals of the fields, change the nests and natural gas, and create wealth and energy.
Some European countries, China and China, use the liquid and livestock and energy products:
India, however, did not function fully in this area.
Under the rural program of the Swachh Bharat movement, we are now looking forward to this direction.
It has been decided to improve natural energy productivity through footprints, agricultural catastrophe and synagogues.
Under the Copper-Den Program, India has been encouraged by farmers, brothers, brothers and sisters, and they should see the money and leprosy not only in a simple way, but also as a wealthy wage.
There will be prospects for new jobs in seizure, transport and natural gas sales.
Copper's plan will be sufficiently implemented by the Internet business base, connecting peasants with the buyers and harvesting the right price for farmers' cropping.
I am favourite countrymen, so far we have heard about music festivals, food festivals, film festivals.
But a separate effort was made in Chhattisgarh's Raipur - the state's first Kuppa Festival.
Other districts also celebrated Kuppa festivals for their share in the interests of Raipur.
Everyone shared the new ideas of cleanliness in their own perspective, in discussions, organised the poets.
There was a climate like that of the festival in the center of cleanliness.
Especially schoolchildren participated in this with great enthusiasm, which was a strange thing.
I have expressed my great appreciations to the Raipur municipalities, the people of Chhattisgarh, the state and the state executives, to celebrate the stage in this fair in a very fine manner, including the importance of excavation management and the importance of cleanliness.
Every year, on March 8, we are celebrating international women daily.
Many events are being organised in our country, well, well, all over the world.
In the past, women who have worked in different fields have been awarded the fourth power awards this day.
Today, the country is pushing for women's progress and moving towards women's progress.
This time I remember Swami Vivekananda's penance.
Today, it is our duty to ensure that women's participation in every sector of social and economic conditions is equal.
Today our women are expressing strength and self-confidence in their actions.
Where women are powerful and participants of all kinds of development and development of the country, it is the dream of our new India.
In just 20 days since January 26 this year, these women have built one lakh and seventy thousand toilets, including about one lakh women groups.
 Women from Jharkhand have made it a woman's strength to transform it into a vast majority of the population, enjoying the pure movement and pure culture in the lives of the simple people.
I am aware of the news two days ago, brothers and sisters, in 3 villages of Elifanda Islands, we were free and joyful about how they were getting electricity after 70 years.
Despite all this special tourist destination, it was very surprised to me that it was not going to power there for many years, even near Mumbai.
For 70 years, three villages of Elephanta Island, Rajbandar, Morbandar and Senthbandar, left the darkness of the lives of the people who were flooded in the dark.
I express my greetings to the administration and the people there.
Tell me, that the life of the nations may be lightened, and the joys of their lives may be greater, and more joyful, and more joyful,
My brothers and brothers, we celebrated the festival of Shivaratri a few days ago.
This is the month of March, and the green fields, and the beauty of the sowing crops, and the beauty of the charming flocks of the heart: these are the splendid features of this month.
At the same time, Holip Puntik, which comes in this month, is close to our breasts.
On March 2, Holip Festival will be celebrated with great enthusiasm throughout the country.
As much as the colors of the Holips are in the feast of Holigah, so is the significance of Holikah: for it is this day that we put all the evils in the neighbourhood.
The Holip Festival gives this real news to forget all the differences, participate in each other's joy, a fascinating aspect of unity and brotherhood.
My beloved nations, thanks, and humility.
He has written a long letter to the Narendramodi App, the countrymen, Prakash Tripadhi, asking me to talk about all the things in it.
Kalpana Chawla, who went to the space on February 1, was hiding every day.
They are not with us today because of the danger of the Colombia shuttle, but they have been inspiring the youth around the world.
In this way, Kalpana Chawla told her last day and I thanked Prakash for her introducing her letter.
In such a small age, Kalpana Chawla has left the news that we have lost them, but they have left the world, especially thousands of women in India, not limited to women's power.
It is very pleased that women in India are very fast in every sector and are sustaining the country's pride.
Having been close to time, respect for women in our country and their contribution to them in society has been surprisingly embracing the whole world.
This speaks extensively about the importance given to women in our society.
Because of this, they have given the status of power to women in our society
It indicates that the penetration of the painful illustrations like Lopalmutra, Karki, Maitrei, Aka Mahadevi, Meerabai, the knowledge, scriptures of Ahilyabai Holgar's ruling organisation, and queen Laxmibai's virtue have been enlightened for us, and the pride of the country has come together.
Prakash Tripadhi has given many more examples.
Our defence minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, told Sukoi that their warfare flew in 30 in the air and gave him a sympathy, and the women's group of Indian navy, led by Varthika Josi, was traveling around the world at the INSV TARINI.
The three defective women, Pawana Khand, Mogan Singh and his squarewethi, have been in warships and are conducting a training to direct Sukoi 30.
It's absolutely right to tell you.
Today, women are coming forward in all sectors, not only in the fields, but also in the leadership.
Today, in many sectors, the first thing is understanding of the female-skilful achievement, establishing a milestone.
In the past, the President of the Pedestrian Party has made a new impression.
Our Republican leader met a group of unusual women who had the first achievement in their respective fields.
The women's recorders in the country, the first female captain of the ships, the first female drivers of the passenger train, the first female bus driver, the first female bus driver, the first woman in Antarctica, the first woman to touch the Everest peak, are the first women in every sector - who have lost the conservative conditions of our women-sky and society, and made unusual achievements.
With the help of hard work, motivation and restraint, they have demonstrated that they can cross all the barriers and places and create a new way.
On this route, they are not only from their age, but from generations to generations.
They have filled new enthusiasm and new enthusiasm.
A book has also been written about the lady's recorders and the first woman to know about these women and powers throughout the country, to enjoy their lives.
This book is found today in the Narendramodi app in the form of e-book.
Today, there is a significant contribution of women's power to the economic changes in the country and society.
Today, when we are talking about women's power problems, I want to mention a railway station.
You can think there's a railway station, women's powers, and what's the connection between them.
All workers and women are at Mumbai's Maduka railway station.
This time, after seeing the Republican Festival rally, a number of people in Deuter and other social networks are particularly important about the biking section of the border guard.
They understood the sympathetic acts, and the zeal was astonished by the residents from abroad.
A form of self-sacrifice, power cuts.
Today our female-skirm leadership is holding.
It's being self-sufficient.
I am aware of the surprising work done by our tribal women in Satisgar, who have given a new sympathy.
While speaking about tribal women, there is a definite sight in everyone's minds, where there are forests, roads, including women loading their heads.
But Satisgar's women, our tribes, have created a new scene in front of our country.
The Dantewada area of Satisgarh was suffered by the Maoist extremists.
The Maoists have created a terrible environment here as violence, repression, bombs, guns and gardens.
In such a horrific environment, tribal women are becoming self-sufficient and self-sufficient rickshaws.
It also strengthens environmental protection.
I am also greeting the state administration here, since they have been training since their financial war, they have played a sufficient role after the success of these women.
Abandoning the disappearances and accepting changes in the required.
Continuous efforts have been made in the country individually and socially for centuries against social disorders and disorders.
A few days ago, a tasty process was carried out in Bihar.
To root social deterioration, a human chain program was organized in Bihar, more than 13,000 kilometres away.
Through this movement, awareness was inspired against evils such as child marriage and dowry harassment.
All the people of the state decided to fight against dowry and child marriage.
All of the young, elderly, enthusiastic and enthusiastic youth, mothers and sisters have joined themselves in the movement.
From Patna's historical Gandhi Maidan, this man chain is close to the state's border, without sustainability.
If all sections of society want to get the benefits of real progress, then our society must be freed from such deteriorations.
And we are afraid that we shall gather together with all these evils out of the community:
Come to create a new India, powerful and powerful India.
For the past few years, people have been writing and telling me about this.
I have seen many appearances and social media about those who have benefited from this program.
And the darshan was given to them, and the thought of the others was to be found in his heart, and he gave me comfort.
The objective of this programme is to improve health care and sustain life.
Popular medicines are less than 50 percent to 90 percent rather than commercialized medicines.
In this, simple people, especially routine drugs, provide economically benefits to the elderly, which increases the savings.
Generic medicines that are bought here are the same medicines as the conditions of the World Health Agency.
Because of this, good medicines are available at cheap prices.
Today, the central government has established more than 3000 drugs across the country.
Through this, medicines are obtained in defect and the industrialisation has created a new opportunity for the employment of individuals.
Black price drugs, Prime Minister Bhartiya people's medicines and hospitals are available in the commercial markets.
The only objective of all this is to create a healthy and regulative health care of the poorest people in the country, which can enable to establish a healthy and rich India.
Mangesh from Maharashtra is participating in a photograph at Narendramodi Mobile App.
That film attracted me very much.
One of them joined his mother and participated in the movement, 'We clean the Mornana river.'
The citizens of Agola carried out the process of cleaning the Morna river, regarding this pure India movement.
Though the Morna river is a 12-month-long flowing river, it has now turned into a climate.
Another thing that is tragic here is that the river has wild flowers and waterfalls.
The cleaning movement was carried out in January 20, 2018, and I was told that the movement would continue every Saturday until the Mornana river was fully cleaned.
It shows that if someone has taken a decision to try, it cannot be achieved by him.
The mass movement can also lead to major changes.
I'm telling Agola people, its district and municipal administrations, all the citizens participating in the public movement, my favourite admirations for this effort, and your efforts will be sympathetic to other citizens of the country.
There is a conversion about the Padma awards given to the countrymen, the Republicans.
News and televisions are attracted to this.
But slightly surprisingly, it is very great for you to be glorious among us, and to get awards and recognitions without any recommendation.
Now it is not necessary for a person to be popular, but his actions are marked.
He has been preparing sports materials from the pocket for 40 years, so that he acts as a scientific interest for the children.
He has been trying to see the children doing scientific checks with insufficient things:
For this, he goes to 3000 schools all over the country and circulates films made in 18 languages.
Look what a wonderful life, a fine sacrifice
Their life is also the same as the Siddhavva couple of Karnataka state.
There is no point in calling him as a goddess who gave her power to women.
For the last 30 years, he has played a immense role in changing the lives of innumerable women.
Since his seventh year, he has dedicated himself to God, and has served all his life for the good of the gods.
Not only this, he has worked unawarely for the poor women's health.
You may have heard of them from Bajju Shayam from Madhya Pradesh, and they were born in a very poor tribal family.
Though he had done simple jobs for his livelihood, he had a terrible country on the painting of the traditional tribals.
This is because he has a value not only in India but in the whole world.
His paintings are shown in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
Bajju Shayam, who has specialized the name of India overseas, has shown his talent identity and has been honored with Padmasri awards.
Laxmikutty's life, a tribal woman from Kerala, can make you surprising.
Laxmikuti served as an editor in the rock area, even today, he is living in a hunted dwelling place in the dense jungles and tribal settlements.
The snake is chosen to produce medicines to be used after the snake is destroyed.
Laxmi continues to serve society through her medicinal knowledge.
Seeing nobody being found, he has been honored with Padmasri awards for his contribution to the society.
Today, I am supposed to tell someone else, and the 75-year-old Subhasini Egyptian of West Bengal has been elected to the award.
Subhasini Egyptians washed the utensils in many houses and sold vegetables.
Today, his hard work-made hospital is providing free medical treatment to thousands of poor.
Sometimes, in schools and colleges, such people should be taken and shared their experiences.
All the awards should be done and socially must be tried.
We celebrate the day for foreign-foreign Indians every year on 9th January.
This is the same day that Annal Gandhians returned to India from South Africa.
This day we celebrate an unprecedented tendency between India and the Indians around the world.
This year we arranged for a program for foreign Indians, in which parliamentarians and Mayors from all over the world immigrated from India.
The program was attended by many countries such as Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portuguese, Portuguese, Fiji, Tasania, Canada, Canada, Britain, Surinam, South Africa and the United States, where there are immigrant Indian mayors and parliamentarians.
Some of them have branded Indian literature as a research on Internet safety, Ayurveda, music, poems, climate change, and in many fields, they have marked their own identity.
Some have built blind people from the drag drivers, some have created mosques, that is, all our people are, they have suffered somehow from all those countries.
I thank my members of the European federation for recognising the Indians' special tasks abroad and for the recognition of these information to the two wars worldwide.
Even today, we look at every stage, how truthful we are the tests of the soul.
If we decide to go by the sword of the oil, what can we give him more than that
I am fond of you, O people of my beloved country, telling you all good things for the year 2018.
We have shared many things throughout the year.
The exchange of your many letters, opinions and ideas for the voice of the mind has always been giving me a new power.
We'll spend more hours and change the year, but our shares will continue as always.
In the coming year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
Let all of you live for a sacrifice for the year 2018.
A few days ago, on December 25, people from all over the world celebrated the Christmas celebrations.
We can also see the sympathy of service individualism.
This shows us what is the significance of service entertainment.
In our country, we talk about 'profit hate', i.e., there is no hope for reflection in such activity.
'Seva Paramo Dharam,' i.e., service is the best source.
That's the 350th year of Guru Gobind Singh's birth.
Guru Govind Singh's unusual life, with his passion and patience, enjoys us.
Guru Govind Singh gave an instruction on their enormous life-long slumps, and on the basis of these slumps he lived his whole life.
Guru Govind Singh, a blind, poet, a great warrior, served to encourage the people through all these contributions.
He fought against repression and justice.
In this struggle, he had to lose many things in personal life.
But he has never left his mind for indifference at any time.
Every moment of life gave the message of love, sacrifice and peace.
Have you seen such immense specialty
I have been interviewed by Guru Govind Singh, who was held in Patna Sahib earlier this year, in his 350th birthday.
Come, let us all learn from their great teaching, and from his sensible life, and we will try to improve our lives.
All those who were born in 2000 or after that, i.e., in the 21st century, will start becoming voters who gain ballot in 2018.
I welcome the voters of the 21st century and the new Indian voters in the publicity of India.
I'm telling our youth my blessings, and I'm appealing to all of you to go and register you as voters.
Throughout India, the 21st century voter stands for you.
The ballot is a major impact on millions of people's life.
You will not be the only authority to vote.
Today, I want to talk about the younger community of our commemoration of the 18-25-year-old, psychological and powerful celebrations of my mind.
I consider these as young people of New India, young, youth, youth, youth, youth, youth, enthusiasm, energy.
I hope our dream of our new India will be fulfilled by the ability and strength of these powerful youth.
While we speak about new India, we must be free from new India's caste, religious, extremism and corruption.
It must be free from dirt and poverty.
Everyone in the new India must get equal opportunities and fulfill all their desires and expectations.
We must be the only guiding power of peace, unity and goodwill in the new India.
My new Indian youth, let's come forward and see how to build a new India.
At the same time, young people from 18 to 25 years of age can sit together and join the exchange of new India, find ways and plans
Can we think how to fulfill our resolutions before 2022
Do you think of the dream that our freedom fighters dreamed of India
Gandhians turned the freedom struggle into mass destruction.
My young friends, we must also create a mass destruction of the 21st century higher India.
How can it be achieved through stress
Today there have been many new opportunities before young people.
Our youth are coming forward and seeing success, from the emergence of ability to renovate and to the emergence of industrialism.
I have spoken of the significance of my polygamy and aristocratic thinking in the voice of the past.
There is also a case in English - Passimism lads to wake, Optimism to power.
Participate the crucial moments of the year 2017, and I was asking in the voice of the last mind that we would welcome the year 2018 in a crucial environment.
I am very glad that a large number of people have responded to the social organisations and the MiGov Internet and the Narendra Modi secretary.
The Postitive India has also made millions of duplicates, which has reached more than 150 crore people.
This widening of sympathy has spread throughout the world, beginning in India.
The incoming duplicates and answers are really conceptive.
It was my comfortable experience.
Some of the people of the country have indicated some events this year that had a significant impact on their minds and adverse effects.
Some share their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Patia.
I live in Festival on Packet on Mayurvihar, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
He wanted to study.
For this, I needed a debt, which has been very easily available to me, and my daughter too could continue to study.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vade.
I'm staying in the mail.
My husband did the risk of paying one rupee a month.
He had to die unfortunately in danger.
We know about the worst situation we have.
We had a lot of advantage because of the government's help, and we could just supplied.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
Our (BHINNAR) background was established on the national highway since 2017.
Because of this, our roads have become very special and our business has begun to grow.
My name is Deepans Ahuja, in the Saddganj area of Sharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Sathish Bawani.
Over the last 40 years, we have been dependent on the military's hydroelectric system.
Now alone we have already built a liquid tube...
This is our biggest achievement in 2017.
Many of the working conditions have led to a profound change in life.
In fact, this is the new India, which is combining us all together.
Come on, with these little joys, we will take part in Putandi, start the botany and take a firm step towards India from pro-political India to desperate India.
When we talk about all the innovative ideas, I feel that I have to share a thing.
I have heard the story of Angju and Bashir Khan Kadak's provocative choices in the Kashmir state government missions.
He has emerged from the bailout of extremism and escalation and has been the leader of the Kashmir state's regime.
In the 1990s, you will be surprised to know that the extremists have burnt their homes.
While extremism and violence were slaughtered, his family was forced to break out of their ancestors' soil.
He didn't give up hope.
He set a way for himself - the way to serve the people.
He attacked the opposite conditions and he liberated his victory.
Today, he is not only to Jammu and Kashmir but also to all India as a provocation.
Anjaz has also proven that however worse the environment is able to dissolve and dissolve the clouds of disappointment through the prudent acts.
Last week there was a chance to meet some women from Jammu and Kashmir.
These are my young treasures, these are the days of my land, which I have spent with those women, and have given me the power of the land.
Thousands of devotees come to this world famous temple every year to get the pleasure of doubt.
But the Sabarimala temple is an example of how to transform cleanliness into culture and how to find a way to solve the problem and how to make people participants strong.
B.
The police officer, Vijayan, launched a program called Punyam Parkavan, in which he started a nutritious cleaning movement with awareness of cleanliness.
This pilgrimage, which has seen so much improvement in Sabarimala, has become a part of the plantation movement and every traveler's journey.
Even with harsh distresses, the firm resolution on cleanliness is also mixed up.
On October 2, 2014, my neighbours, we made a resolution on the birthday of Gandhianan, that is, the unprecedented work of the water, i.e., the clean India, the flesh.
He has served for this work throughout his life and tried.
On the 150th day of his life, we had decided that we would dedicate to him the purified India which we had dreamed of, and we would give our contribution in that direction.
Efforts are being carried out in the entire country towards cleanliness.
There are widespread changes in the rural and urban areas of the population.
The world's largest test is to be carried out from January 4 to March 10, 2018, in the name of purifying, 2018, according to the level of purifying in urban areas.
The study will include about 40 crore people in more than 4,000 cities.
Freedom from the opening of the cities, accumulation of poultry, accumulation of poultry vehicles, system of scientific clusters, attempts to make changes in conduct, capacity building and new initiatives for cleaning, and public participation in this service are sufficient.
According to the study, other groups will go to the cities and examine.
Talking to the citizens, they will get answers from them.
They will examine the use of the cleaning secretary and the management of various types of service centers.
It will be considered that all the organisations have been created by the cities in the nature of the people to make the city clean.
It is not merely the government's purity.
It has a huge share of every citizen and civilian organisation.
On the basis of this study, if the population in your city is more than one lakh, the country-class level and the population of less than one lakh will be provided with a territorial level.
Today, in the voice of the mind, I want to share a thing with you through this program.
If anyone wants to take a Islamic woman, Haj pilgrimage, it was brought to me that she could not go without 'Mahram' or her male defender.
When I asked for the first time about this, how can it be
That's all the reason for this foolishness.
For many years, there has been an injustice to Islamic women, but there is no discussion about this.
Such a system is not even in many Islamic countries.
But this right has been denied to Islamic women of India.
I am happy that our government has taken care of it.
Our minorities have taken necessary actions and finished the tradition that has continued for 70 years and removed this control.
I am glad that even today Islamic women can go to Haj pilgrimage without a man's defender, 'Mahram,' and this time 1300 Islamic women have been asked to visit Haj pilgrimage without men and women from different parts of the country from Kerala to North India have been interested in visiting Haj.
The minority has been instructed by the Ministry of Health to ensure that all women who have applied for a separate trip are allowed to go to Haj.
This is my consciousness that India's development journey, the strength of our women's power and their intellectuality, has seen progress and progress.
We must sustain the efforts of men to get closer powers, opportunities and women, and they will see the progress of men as well as on the development path.
O people of our country, on 26th January, we all have a historically important day.
But in the coming 2018 January 26, it will be specially remembered.
In this year's Republican Tirthankaras, leaders of ten countries in the Asian organisation are coming to India as prominent residents.
On the Republic Day, there will be no one but ten prominent residents.
This is not so far in India's history.
In 2017, the Asian system was particularly important for India and India.
The Asian organisation completed its 50 years and in 2017 India's combination with the Asian organisation was 25 years.
On January 26, these great leaders from 10 countries of the world will participate here as one of the most important points of concern for the Indians.
The most unprecedented thing would be without any schedule any day.
Now we have celebrated the Christmas festival, and the next year is to be born.
The next New Year will snatch a lot of joys, joys and fulfillment.
We will advance our country with new sympathy, new enthusiasm, new incentive and new determination.
During the sun's invocation in January, this month will be celebrated with great concentration.
This is the time connected with nature.
Though every festival is connected to nature in some way, we have a habit of celebrating this wonderful event of nature in our cultural, variety of varieties.
If Lohri is enjoyed in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, Kishti and Dil Sanghranti are expected in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
'Sangranth in Rajasthan,' says Mag-Bihu in Assam, 'Pongal' in Tamilnadu.
All these festivals are celebrated between 13th and 17th January .
Though it is nominally different, what is the substantial element of these - linked to nature and agriculture.
To all the people of the country, they will be happy to celebrate these festivals.
Once again, the new year of 2018 will be sacrificed to all of you.
Thank you folk of love.
We met again in 2018.
The voice of mind is September 2019
It is doubtful whether any Indian citizen would have no respect for him.
He was more senior than us in age, witnessed in different conditions and different times of the country.
Not only our new generation, it is a great learning experience to all of us, but you are very supposed to all of us, even though you have finished all these achievements in your life, you have come to the forefront of the growing and working place of your fathers.
This sentiment is very simple to me.
I don't want to give you any trouble.
Why, I know how much you're doing, I'm gonna see how much work you're doing.
Moti ji: Yeah.
And Mothi said, Your love is because of us, and we have great joy.
And Mothi said, I have sworn with thanks to me for you have continued to wait on me.
Once again I'm telling you my beloved birthday.
Modi ji: When I came to Mumbai this time, I thought I could talk to you.
And we shall celebrate many festivals of Navaratri, Mahotsav, and Karba, and Durka, and Puja, Dasara, and Deepavali, and Baia Dhuj, and Sadbujah.
In many cities, many state organizations and youth starts are engaged in this work.
They coordinate all the clothes, sweets, food items in the houses of the people, and find the needy and bring them together, and do it without any publicity.
This time, in this season of festive festives, shall we break the time that is in full swerving, humility and lightning
The smoke that is on the faces of many poor families, and the joy of your joy in the feasts, and your face, and your face, and your light, and your light, and your uncleanness, and your light.
My beloved brothers, my beloved brothers, on the day of the day of Deepavali, the dead are welcomed in the house, to give abundant vows and abundant life.
Traditionally we welcome the sweets.
This time will we welcome the monks in a new way
In our culture, we worship women as stealers, because the woman is considered to be sufficient and sufficient.
This time will we organise programs in our society, in our villages, cities and women to respect
The accomplishments of their hard work and pursuit will be among us, among our families, in society and in the country.
Can we organise programmes to give respect and value to these strangers of India during this Diwali
The women who do many abnormal jobs may be among us.
Some may have attempted to awaken cleanliness and health, some may have been engaged in a social service that is a medical, engineered and impoverished children.
Prosecutors may have been trying to fight for justice.
Our society has identified such women and must grow up on them.
As we all have directed a cellphy with her in the world, we will surpass the movement called Bharat Ki Laxmi.
Incentives to the Indian country's monks are to ensure a lot of lives of nations and nations.
I have already told them about the voice of the mind, my countrymen, so that I can get the chance to exchange speeches with many who do not know.
In the past, Alina Thaing, a student in the remote Arunachal Pradesh, wrote to me a surprising letter.
I joined the Roying area of Arunachal Pradesh.
This time, when my choice results came, some asked me if you were reading the book by the xammers.
I told you I didn't read the book.
But after returning home, I read this book and read it twice or three times.
After that, my experience was very thrilling.
Thank you for writing letters, my child's student.
And thanks for the sins thereof, when they shall read, for they have told me.
I will walk under your commandments.
What is your experience in your daily life
I once again thank my young friend Alina Thaiang, a student from Arunachal.
My minds, many nations, you know through newspapers, through TV, about the unleashed events of the Prime Minister of the country, and discuss the lack of rest.
This time, however much talked about the victory in the US Opinion race, Medvede's speech, which was the second in the final contest.
I also asked for a more spoken speech on social websites, and then I saw the lap.
Medwede's simpleness and his testimony, which took place for 23 years, was to suppress everyone.
If there were others, he would have been distressed and disappointed, but he had no argument on his face, but smelled on the back and stomach of everyone through his words.
The observers from there welcomed his speech.
In a single lap, the enthusiasm of the producer and the story of the successor has been a matter of concern.
If you don't hear Medvett's speech yet, I'm asking the youth, please, please go and listen.
There are a lot of things to learn about all standards and all agents.
These accounts are supposed to be a failure of success, and there is no point in the failure of success.
Life succeeds, and our characters are most importantly telling us all about this.
The idea of our ancestors is really surprising.
Hour communication : . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In fact, this young sportsman won all the hearts of the world.
My heart is many nations, especially my young friends, which I say now, for your direct good.
But in the beginning, we can be very safe if we are waking up and stop them.
I would like to talk to the younger community, especially in mind, this feeling.
It is very difficult for you to know that smoking is a smoking drug that is very cruel to health.
Those who use smoke have more danger of occurrence of diseases like cancer , diabetes , blood pressure .
It affects the growth of brain in childhood because of its consumption .
But today, I'm coming to share a new thing with you.
You know, there is now a ban on E-Cigarette in India.
E-cigarette is different from ordinary cigarettes, a type of electronic device.
In e cigarettes smoking of nicotine substances produces a kind of chemical smoke which is used to include nicotine.
We all know well about the dangers of ordinary cigarettes, but the wrong opinion about E-cigarette is widespread.
That means there is no risk of this E-cigarette.
Like other cigarettes, there is no odour in it, which includes a smelling cereal.
If a smoker is constantly smoking in a house, we may have seen in our concern that the others in the house will not be smoked, and he would like that his children should not have a habit of smoking like themselves.
His attempt would be to smoke none of the family.
For he would be glad how much the body will hear from smoking and using smoke.
The smokers know that they are smoking and they are well aware of it.
But this isn't the case with E cigarette.
People don't care about E cigarettes.
They don't fully know the danger, because sometimes the e-cigarette is quietly entering the house.
In fact, E cigarettes are mixed with many chemicals, which will have adverse effects on health.
Whosoever smokes in a strife, let his tongue show us.
It is because of not swinging every family's dreams into legs.
Avoid the habit of smoking, do not take any wrong idea of E cigarette.
Come, let us together with a healthy India force.
Yeah, don't you remember FIT India
Fit India doesn't mean that if you go to the gym for two hours in the morning and exercise.
It is necessary to stay away from these.
I hope you don't feel sorry to say, of course it will happen to you.
They all sacrificed themselves to others, not living for themselves.
It is the honor of such a grandfather in Vedican city on October 13.
Christian tree Treasia is an example for the entire world, in its low livelihood of 50 years, in the interests of human society.
He was particularly interested in social service and education.
It is a matter of not only India, but also India, that today, when we are celebrating the 150th birthday of Gandhians, 130 crore countrymen have been determined to get rid of poverty and poverty once used.
In the environmental defence direction, India is heading in a way to the whole world, seeing it today, the vision of all countries is replaced by India.
I am confident that all of you will be able to participate in the movement that will be released from the neighbourhood that once used on October 2.
In many places, people are giving an unprecedented contribution to this movement in their own methods.
But one of our country's youth has conducted a very distraught movement.
When I noticed the milk of his work, I photographed him and tried to find out about his new test.
When I heard this word for the first time, it was new to me.
Perhaps these words may be more useful in foreign countries.
Hello Ributhman, they are drunk, I am talking to Narendra Modi.
My pleasures to you.
If 130 crores of countrymen had taken one foot in this direction, India would only proceed to 130 crores of feet in the direction of liberation from the neighbourhood used once.
Repentants, they, once again thank you for my sacrifice.
And for you, and for your company, and for such a new imagination, rejoice in my gifts.
Thank you.
We are fond of nations, preparing for October 2 is working in the world on the continents, but we want to travel on the obligation of Gandhians to 150.
We want to improve in our lives with a change in patriotism.
I'd like to remind you of something beforehand.
I will speak extensively about it in the voice of the next mind, even if I speak to it just before, why don't you also have a chance to make preparations for it
And it shall come to pass, when you shall remember, that on October 31, the day of their birth is Sardar Shaphai Phatel.
Thousands of people in all children, elders, schools and colleges, India's millions of villages, we need to drive to unity that day.
Well, my countrymen, you all may remember, I spoke from the Red Fort on August 15, asking you to go to any 15 places in India in 2022.
At least 15 places, if possible, one or two, or the other, must set up programs to stay there.
When holidays come to the Deepawali festival, people are sure to roam around, so I once again ask you, please go to some 15 places in India.
And all this has been done only because of your collaboration, particularly because we understand the importance of tourism.
My heart, many nations, live for a sacrifice of many kinds of feasts in the multitude of India, once again to all of you.
A few days back, there was a possibility of a distant communication with young friends from the state of Karnataka.
The Times Committee's 'Vijay Karnataka' newspaper issued a journal about the children, in which they asked the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
In that journal, they published some selected letters.
When I read those letters, they were good to me.
Girthy Hecta, from North Karnataka, praised the digital India and Smart City program, while saying that children are not interested in studying classes in today's time, and enjoying knowledge of nature.
If we give information about nature to children, they are likely to be destitute in future natural security.
The child from Laxmeshwara, Rida Nataf, writes that he is the daughter of a military volunteer, and gives her a great reward.
If you are a militarist's daughter, there is no wonder what Irfana spoken from Kalpurgi is 5 kg from his school and his village.
I'm glad that a newspaper has taken such a look, people of the country, and these letters have come to me, and I have the chance to read them.
It was a good experience for me.
My countrymen, 2611 today.
Our constitutional law day is on November 26.
In 1949, today, the Constitutional Law of India was accepted in the Constitutional Council.
The Constitutional law of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is the recall day of the members of the Constitutional Council.
They attempted to lend 3 years to the constitution of the Indian country.
Those who read those discussions are well aware of how their dedicated sentiment to the country's interest in those discussions.
Do you know how hard they will work without a constitution for our country with variety
And they did this when the land was delivered from the slaves of understanding, and from the vision of telephone.
It is our obligation to create a new India to confront the clear ideas of those who have given the constitutional law in support of the light of this constitution.
Our constitution law is very large.
There is no point of life that does not seem to be a matter of nature.
It is our obligation to follow without any rise in the constitutional law.
As citizens, they must go forward to understand the feeling of constitutionalism.
The objective of the Constitution is to ensure that no one has any part of it.
It is natural that Dr. Babasaheb Ambethkar will remember them today's constitutional law day.
17 different groups were formed on the important issues of this constitution.
One of the most important groups is the Tirthankara group.
Dr. Babasaheb Ambethkar was the chairman of the draft constitution committee.
He was enjoying an important role.
Today we are experiencing the greatness of India's constitutionalisation, which has been replaced by a destructive picture of their efficient leadership.
He confirmed the interests of all sections of the society.
On the sixth day of December, on the sixth day, we will recall him as always, and give him humility.
And it shall come to pass, that Babasaheb shall be partakers in making the land strong, and strong.
On December 15, Sardar Bahabai Pahal is a day they sit down.
As a farmer's son, the transformation of the iron man has been done by the Sardar Patel, which has done unusual acts of working the country in one labour.
Sardar also served as part of the Constitutional Council.
He was a member of the Council of Administrative Rights, Children and Tribals.
Though 2611 is our constitution day, how can it be forgotten by this country 2611 that took place 9 years ago
The country reminds of the virtuous civilians, police and security forces, and offers hunger to all the dead.
And this land shall not forget their sacrifice.
The radicalism is today a world-reaching event is taking place every day, in an extremely dangerous way.
We have been suffering from extremism for the last 40 years.
Our father-in-law has killed thousands of lives.
But a few years ago, when India spoke about radicalism in the world stage, it was not taken seriously by many of the world, but today, when the radicalism sustained their nationalism, the world governments see radicalism as a major challenge.
This is a sign of destruction of human powers.
Therefore, not only India, but all human powers of the world must unite and defeat radicalism.
Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Gandhi sages have given birth to the world this soil and love.
Terrorism and terrorism are weakening our social system and intensifying its tiny endeavour.
Hence, human powers must be aware of the time.
O my loved countrymen, we are celebrating the navy day on December 4.
The Indian navy protects our coasts.
I'm telling my blessings to all those associated with the navy.
You all know that our culture was on the banks of the rivers.
Our rivers, seas, economics, and wars, are very important in both ways, to the rivers of Sind, to the Ganges, to the Yamuna.
This is our entrance to the whole world.
In the expansion of Chola empire, their navy had a huge risk in making it economic bigger.
The navy invasions of Choles, many examples of analysis, are still present in union literature.
Most of the world's navy had spent a long time with women in the warships.
But in the Chole's navy, nearly 800-900 years ago, a large number of women have played an important role.
Women were also involved in the war.
The Chola ruler had a minute technique of ship construction.
When we talk about the navy, cannot Sadrpati Shivaji Maharaj speak about the opening of his navy
The coastal coasts of Konkan, which were suppressed by Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts associated with the empire of Shivaji Maharaj, Sind Durg, Murud Janjeera, Golden Durga etc. were surrounded by sea coasts or seas.
The responsibility for the defence of these forts was the Marathi army.
The Maratiya navy included major ships and small ships.
His navy was capable of attacking or defending any enemy.
Would you like to talk about the Maratian navy and talk about Kanoji Angre
He took the Marathian navy to a new peak, setting up Marathian navy bases in many places.
Sumitra immediately joined the rescue ship and saved many fishermen from descending down and handed them over to Bangladesh.
In May this year, when floods in Sri Lanka were flooded, three ships of our ships immediately went there and accomplished the country's government and the people.
In June, when the Pappua New Guinea government sent us urgent information, our navy helped rescue the fishermen from their fishing boats.
Our navy has been engaged in encouraging the country's pride to bring medical aid to the Phizzian country, and to bring humanitarian aid to the neighbouring countries in the event of immediate reliance.
We have brought respect and great respect to our defence forces on the ground, as an airplane of our navy, the courage, courage, courage, courage, immortality and sacrifice are worthy of every citizen's dwelling place.
The relaxed life of 125 crore countrymen is due to soldiers who sacrificed their youth for the country.
Every year, on December 7, we are following the militia day.
To finish this week, they will put a flag on everyone that is small and big.
The movement to assess the soldiers in the country will be initiated.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flags of our military personnel.
This fund is spent on the welfare of the soldiers and the families of the soldiers who survived in the war, for the benefit of the injured and their resurrection.
You ksb to know various methods of economic contribution.
Come on, we'll use this opportunity to enable our soldiers to work to enhance their mood.
We also give our contribution to their interests.
And it came to pass in December, O nations, on the fifth day of the world's earth.
I want to tell our agricultural brothers some things.
Everything we eat is connected to this soil.
In a way, the entire food habits are also related to the soil.
Just imagine what if this rich soil needed to produce is not in this world.
The trees do not grow, how can human life be possible
How can the microscope be formed
The peasants of this country are giving great importance to their lives for two matters of pursuing and sciencefully pursuing it on earth.
While our country's peasants are associated with traditionalism, they are nationwide on modern science, attempting to be psychological and psychological.
When I went to the battlefield of Dohu village in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh, I heard the peasants there.
The peasants here have used chemical liquids in the past, which have affected the soil.
The masses were decreasing and the income was decreasing, and gradually the productivity of soil was decreasing.
In 2016-17, the outcome of the winter crops increased 3 to 4 times per acre, from every acre to income increased from 4 to 6 thousand rupees.
Moreover, there was also humidity on the earth.
Due to the low use of the fertilizer, economically damaged.
This gave me great pleasure, and my peasant brothers have advanced to absorb the suggestions given to them on the soil plant, and their enthusiasm increases when they see the outcome results.
If attention is to be taken to the masses, first take care of the earth, then it has begun to explain to the peasant brothers that if we take care of the earth, it will take care of us and us.
Our peasants all over the country have more than 10 crores of soil strips, through which they can well know their land, sowing.
Have you ever seen how much harm shall be done to her when we bow down to the earth, but when we put a sword like a uran on her
It has been proven in all types of scientific methods that there is a serious impact on uria over the Earth.
When the peasant is the landmass man, how can he be happy to be sick on earth
This mother and child must be renewed once again.
Would our peasants, the participants of our soil, be able to ensure that their use of uria will be reduced to a half-finished in 2022 when we are free from 75 years
We began to experience world warming and environmentalism.
There was a time to start the cold before Deepavali.
But even in such circumstances, some examples of the effects of Saddam everyday awakening people.
Tushar, an 8-year-old man in Madhya Pradesh's replacement, has attempted to free his villagers from the outbreak of secrecy.
And he shall not speak to this young man, which is eight years old, but he shall have his weapon to cheat.
And he rose up at five o'clock in the morning, and went out to his village, and rose up, and set them up, and made the ignorance of the signs, saying, Let not the anus go out in the open field.
This young man, who paid 30-40 homes every day, education for cleanliness, was freed from the habit of dysentery in the opening of the village of Kumhari.
In order to propagate cleanliness, the little bitch is engaged in the work of encouraging Tussaur.
It shows that there is no age for the cleaning service.
It is necessary for everyone to take part in a small and big part, women, women, and cleansing.
You may also remember that our opposite sportsmen have won 4 tensions in Rio Olympics and become part of the T20 World Cricket match for the blind.
There are varieties of competitions across the country.
In the past, in Udaipur, the 17th national rainbow competition was organised.
Our younger brothers, who came from different parts of the country, shared and expressed their capabilities.
One of them is the 19-year-old igger Ducker from Gujarat, who has no 80 percent of his body's muscles, but look at his sex, mind and work.
As a result of this, he will now be trained in the Central Excellences Agency in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, as one of the 32 Para swimmers elected to 20-20 Paralimbics by India's Indian Sports Authority.
I'm telling the young igar Ducker, I drive my good life.
Today, special attention is being paid to the nuclear and potential for the transformants.
A few days later, Ith-e-Milat-Un-Nabi is to be celebrated on the third day.
This is the day they were born by the sovereignster Hasrat Muhammad Sahib.
He is the prime minister, I am speaking water singer from Kanpur.
And I prayed to you, This year, you shall share with us ten best things that you said in the voice of the mind.
And there shall be no elders in our villages, neither shall they forget the sorrow, nor forget the gladness.
We look at the past in the year's definition, we are engaged in discords of opinions, succumbing to their decisions and deciding plans for next year.
We are trying to recall the interesting events in the media last year.
It also includes a negative thing, and a negative thing.
But in the year 2018, if we cannot remind you of the best, do we not remind them of the best
I'm telling you a suggestion - if you're participants of 5-10 practical things you've heard, seen, experienced, wouldn't be a good sense.
Can you take part in this
Can we share this time 5 constructive experiences in our lives
It might be a telegraph, maybe a short story, maybe a little sight - through which we call for all of you to welcome the year 2018 in a clean environment, and we will welcome with good memories.
We will remind others of the things that give instruction.
We'll recall good things and create a better environment.
Good news provides energy to do good things.
This combination will combine the strength of dry energy and its impact to us.
In my next heart, I will surely try to bring you to the people of this Positive India.
And it shall come to pass, O people of my love, in the voice of the next month, and in the voice of the mind, that I shall come again among you.
There will be a chance to recall many things.
After six days after Deepavali, the pure day prayer is one of the festivals celebrated with many appointments and rules.
Traditional appointments are followed in every matter of what to eat and what to eat.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also linked to this festival.
The house is fully cleaned before the Satbuja, and all are involved in the cleaning of rivers, lakes, waterfalls, shores and pilgrimages.
The celebration of sun worship or sunlight is the celebration of environmental protection, disease relief and order.
The feeling of destruction of salvation is behind this tradition that enjoys prosperity, which can be a major barrier to the progressive line.
The natural thing is that all this great tradition of India can be gained.
My favourite nations, the voice of the mind is praised, and is humbled.
Let us take the prescription of the doors and the utensils.
Only one shop has so much sales, the heart is joyous and joyful.
Approximately 680 percent of the earliest sales have been registered before Deepawali.
About 90 percent of the total sales of ears and handicrafts are expected.
Today, it shows that all agents like young, aged and women wearing garments and handcuffs.
Through this, I can imagine how many neighbouring families, poor families and the families of those who work in handicrafts will be benefited.
They wrote the Narendramodi Apple Rajan Patt, saying they want to share my demon's experience among the security forces, how they celebrate the convocation.
And you shall celebrate Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
For me, this time too, Deepavali took a special experience.
Once again, we received an interview with the desperate security forces on the border to celebrate Deepawali.
This time, it was unforgettable experience that Deepawali was involved in the security forces in the Kuraj area of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our defence forces are defending the country by facing the most difficult and difficult situations in the borders, from all the countryside to the struggle, dedication and sacrifice, and from all our security forces.
And whenever we seek a chance, we shall know the experiences of our survivors, and they shall hear their devouring works.
Many of us may not know that our security forces are engaged in a number of important tasks not only in our border areas, but also in resting peace all over the world.
They are pride in India as a calm defender.
As for us, we are following the principle of a family in the world, the 'religious family'.
India has always put pressure on women's equality and the United States.
It can seem to be a small change in heavily interpretation, but it reveals a sympathetic idea.
In terms of various functions, India's largest participant is the U.
In the United Nations peacekeeping activities, India has always played its practical role.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served in nearly 50 operations in 71 peace processes throughout the world.
The operations took place in all parts of the world, Korea, Cambodia, Lavos, Vietnam, Cango, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Kango and southern Sudan, India's military has treated more than 20,000 patients through medical services.
Some people knew that India was the first country to send the first female guardian part through the United Nations peacekeeping movement in Liberia.
This activity of India is a conception to all the world's countries.
After this, all the countries started sending their female guards.
It is a matter of pride that India's contribution is not only with peace-saving activity, but India is engaged in training those who are engaged in the peace-saving work of nearly 85 countries.
Our profound peacekeepers from this land, which lived in Gandhians and Gauthambuts, have brought the message of establishing peace and goodness all over the world.
Peace process is not a simple act.
Our security forces have to go to hard places.
It has to stay among the various people.
We have to understand various conditions and different cultures.
They have to replace themselves according to the regional fields and environment.
When we look at him, the eyes of all the nations are very supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to have been awarded by Paramveer Chakra.
In 1989, 72-year-old he was appointed as a Force Commander for operations in Namibia, dedicating his services to ensure the independence of Namibia.
India has always provided messages of peace, unity and goodwill in the world as an ambassador of peace.
Although he was born as a Margaret Elizabeth disease in Ireland, Swami Vivekanandar named him 'Nivedita.'
If not, it means that he was completely dedicated.
In the following period, he dedicated himself to his name.
Yesterday's 150th birthday of sister Niwaditha.
He was very attracted by the Swami vicinity, cut off his luxurious life, completely dedicated his whole life to the service of the poor.
Brother Needita was mentally affected by the unjust in the British regime.
The British not only slave our country, but they have been trying to keep us in mind.
The work of humiliating our culture has been continued.
Brother Needita reconstructed the pride of Indian culture.
He raised the country's awareness and worked to unite the people.
He went to various countries of the world and voiced against the wrong propaganda of Sanathanism and theories.
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Supramania Bharati has explained in a revolutionary poem of renovation, about the New York Fendier and their neighbouring equality.
It is said that he was received from his brother's representative.
Brother Niwaditha has also helped great scientist Jaktishandra to serve.
Through his articles and congresses, Bose has encouraged cooperation to pursue and spread their research.
It is one of the most beautiful features of India that fulfils a human and science.
Brother Nivadetha and scientist Jaktis Chandra Bose are a special example of this.
In 1899, there was a severe Black disease in Golkatha, in which thousands of people died.
Brother Niwadida did not care about her health, but started the work of cleaning the streets and nails.
He may have lived a happy life, but he was involved in the service of the poor.
And he was encouraged by this sacrifice, and began to take part in the public service service.
He studied the singing of the importance of cleanliness and service through his works.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is very surprising to hear that children are suffering from diabetes.
In the early hours, such diseases are called princesshood.
Such diseases were found to be irritable to young people.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today we know that these diseases are a lifestyle problem.
The main reason for suffering from such diseases in young age is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and changes in food habits.
It is very important to pay attention to social and family.
If you see this, you will feel that there is no unusual need to do anything.
We shall change our old habits slightly, and do little things properly, and we shall naturally make it.
People in the family should take care of the children's habit of playing in the open fields.
If possible, the elders in the family can join these children in sports.
Children may have a habit of climbing stairs rather than using lift.
Everyone in the family after dinner can walk a little closer with children.
Yoga is most beneficial, especially for our young classes to create healthy lifestyle and prevent lifestyle problems.
First 30 minutes before starting school, look at how much benefit you get
If I say it's easy, it can easily be learned, if it is very easy, it can be done anywhere.
There is no need for specific equipment or field.
Yoga is very beneficial in controlling diabetes, many tests have been carried out.
The study is being conducted at the AIMS hospital, which is very incentive when they see the results that have been received so far.
We not only see Ayurveda and Yoga as a cure, but also as part of our lives.
My favourite countrymen, especially my young friends, have received many good news in the past few days in the field of sports.
Since our soldiers played a lot, we have been able to become successful in Asian catastrophe after decades.
Earlier, India won Asian Cooperation in 2003 and 2007.
Rejoice in the full sword, and with the helpers, and with my portion, and with the nations.
After Hockey, India has got a good job in the Petminton game.
Srikanth has won the Teenmark Opin and won India.
After Indonesia Open and Australia Open, this is the third Super Seris Fremier Pandya victory.
I express my favourite applaudments for our younger sportsmen and their achievement that they have earned, for India's pride.
Friends, this month, FIFA began world-class competitions for 17-year-old people.
From all over the world, the teams came to India and all expressed their skills in the field of football.
I had a chance to see a lap.
Sportsmen and observers were encouraging everyone.
The world is focusing on the immense programme called world world worldwide.
Seeing such a big labour, all the young men's power, enthusiasm and daring to be achieved, the confusion was overwhelmed.
The world began successfully and all the marches expressed their greatest potential.
Though India could not win, the younger sportsmen of India won the hearts of the people.
All the world nations, including India, have enjoyed this great stature, attracted the film fans who continued the total budget.
The symptoms of the fact that the future of the football is very fast.
I once again express my best wishes and appreciations to all the sportsmen, those who helped them, and all the sports fans.
If I have to value their sentiments, my loved countrymen, with the number of writers to me on pure India, I will have to offer a daily voice of mind, and I will offer a sacrifice to the voice of every heart.
Some are sending a photo of small children's efforts and some are sending information about the efforts of the youth group.
In some places, there is a renewal of cleanliness or somebody is getting information about the changes caused by an official's attempt to tackle.
I had a comprehensive statement about a remarkable story in the Chandrapur Fort of Maharashtra.
At the same time, the government organisation, called Ecological Protection Organization, has been engaged in cleaning the Chandrapur fort through its gross march.
The movement, which took place for 200 days, was engaged in cleaning the fortress without suffocation, without suffocation.
Two hundred days.
As soon as you see this, your disappointment will turn into faith.
It is an excellent example of this necessity for cleaning, beauty, social action and intervening effort.
The fort is the symbol of our tradition.
The responsibility of the nations to protect and purify the historical traditions is to us.
I fervently applaud the ecologist Protection Organization and their overall mobilisation of the pundit citizens.
O people of my heart, on the coming day of November 4, we celebrate the day of their birth to Gurunath.
And the God of Christ was not only the firstborn of the Sikhs, but also of the world.
He thought of the fulfilment of human society, and served all castes equally.
He pressured women on power and respect for women.
He gave a message to establish equality in society, not only with words, but also in his activity.
The gurunatha God has given three reports of their livelihood: to highlight the name of God, to help those who need hard work, and to those who need.
And the God of Gurunatha wrote a holy book called Guru Granth, saying, They have taken their teachings.
On the coming year 2019, we celebrate our Guru Nanak God as their 550th birthday.
Come on, we'll take initiatives to go ahead on his teaching and newsing path.
O people of the country, on October 31, the day of their birthday is to be celebrated.
The speciality of the Sardar Babbai Phole is that he was not only a manifestation of the idea of change, but also a procedure to implement it, even if the most difficult issue erupts.
He served as a specialist in implementing the idea.
Sardar Babbai Patel accepted the great responsibility of joining India in one labour.
He initially confirmed that millions of nations should be brought under the jurisdiction of the same country as the single political establishment.
His ability to take the decision gave him the power to cross all the barriers.
Their philosophy is still synonymous with our new India's wealth, and is currently sufficient.
That is why we are following the national unity day of his birthday.
His contribution to the country's coordinated form is unnecessary.
On October 31, Sardar's birthday has been organised for a wave of solidarity throughout the country, with a number of children, youths, women and all-year-old people to participate.
I urge you to participate in this run for unity and join each other's best wishes.
My hearts, you nations, after the dwelling of Deepavali, will you all begin to resume in your daily life with new determination.
Thanks to my good dreams of all of you.
Three years have been completed in the sky, starting to speak to you through the voice of mind.
Today is 36th.
In a way, there are allegations of India's sophisticated power and feelings, desires and expectations, all the borders of the country, but I have given a voice to my mind to a strange opportunity to interact with the sentiments in the minds of the people.
You may have noticed that I've never said this, my heart's voice.
Not only emails, but also telephones, migovs, and Narendramodiapps, all of these reports are available to me.
Sometimes, the individual-related defects, sometimes social problems, are intended to attract attention.
I take about half an hour a month, but people are sending information to me about the voice of the mind for 30 days a month.
I have been thankful to the nations for getting me the opportunity to understand the sentiments of the country's ordinary citizen in such a short period.
In the voice of the mind, I have always reminded of the words of a miracle.
Thereafter, a lot of letters came to me from everywhere in the country, saying that many social organizations and many youths are engaged in the work of eating and drinking.
While watching, Selfi was a big movement not only in India, but also in the world, with daughters.
This is not the issue of social media.
Every woman turned into a new self-esteem and a new mass.
Every mother-in-law, however, appeared to have to take shepherds with her daughter.
Every woman has a feeling of its own importance.
In the past, I joined the tourism department of the Indian state.
Wherever you travel, I'm asking those who take the trip to send me pictures about India (incredible India).
Hundreds of films have come from India's borders, in a way it has become a big source for working people in the tourism sector.
The country is moving every moment to travel on the right path.
Every citizen of the country is seeking to do something for the benefit of others, for the benefit of society, for the progress of the country.
In this three-year-old movement of mind, I understand and learn from the people of the country.
This is the largest capital and the largest power for any country.
Catholic sales have increased, due to which employment has increased in poor homes.
It is substantially dismantled in the doors from October 2.
I'm once again asking, we'll take forward the movement on the doors and further strengthen it.
When we buy the doors, we must reflect the feeling that the Deepavali is lighting in the poor houses.
In this process, we must do this because of the power of the poor of our country.
Due to the growing interest in the doors, there has been a new sensitivity and encouragement to the workers in the gates and to those who are involved in the Indian state.
How to extinguish the new technology, how to increase productivity and how to introduce the sun power equipment.
For 20-30 years, how they have begun to revive the tradition that has been missing from the law.
In Uttar Pradesh, Chevapuri ear ashram has been closed for 26 years in Sevapur, Varanasi, which has now started functioning with a new emotion.
That is, we had decided that the day of Gandhians were born on October 2, 15 days before, we would be in cleansing place all over the country.
We will unite people's minds through cleanliness.
Our republic leader began this work and the country was united.
All the elders and children, men and women, city-village, are now joining themselves as part of this cleaning movement.
We have promised to win and win, this pure movement is spreading in front of our eyes, while traveling towards victory with the help of our determination.
Everyone is making it worthy of them, helping them, and giving a golden role to achieve this.
People from the sports sector, cinematographers, academics, schools, colleges, universities, peasants, workers, officers, officers, policemen and soldiers are all connecting themselves to this movement.
There is a kind of pressure on the people to listen to the criterion of the public, and to keep the workers there clean, and I feel that it's good.
This time I had to pay attention to another thing - it is a matter of wickedness, and we're not ruined from awakening.
At the same time, it is important to turn clean into our nature and implement a ideological movement.
This way, there were many rivals of service on cleanliness.
More than 12 crore children participated in the column.
Thousands of children took their imagination to paintings.
While we speak about cleanliness, I don't forget to show my thanks to the media sector.
They have advanced this movement with a very clean sense.
They have enjoyed a great deal of contributions in the snakes of everybody, together with them, to create an artificial environment.
We look closely at how much of our country's electronic media and patterns are doing to the clean service movement.
A few days back, a 18-year-old youth from Srinagar told me about Bil Dar.
The largest lake in Asia is near Srinagar, in which he was removing plastic, polythene, utensils, cotton clusters.
Since then, income has also come to an end.
As his father died of cancer, he joined his livelihood with cleaning work.
Bil Dar, a young man, is an inspiring and encouraging factor for everyone interested in cleanliness.
In October this month, many of our maternal grandfathers are mixed for months.
On October 2, on the birthday of Gandhians and Lal Bahadur Shastri, on the birthday of 11 Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Teshmuk in October, on September 25, Din Dayal Upathya was their birthday.
This year, Nanaji and Tin Dayal are centuries.
While Nanaji Cheshmuk fled their political life and joined itself with the rural movement, it is important for us to look after his work on ruralism.
When India's former Republican leader Abdul Kalam speaks to their youth, Nanaji Cheshmuk will always present things about their rural progress.
He also went to the villages to see Nanaji's works.
Like Gandhians, Tin Dayal Upathia will also speak about the man in the society's market.
Tin Tayal will recall how to change the life of the poor, half of the poor, the poor, the poor and the ruined.
And if we see these maternal grandfathers, not the gift that we give them, and why do we see these maternal grandfathers, then the way goes forward, when we think so.
The process of transportation of this unity in every city of the country is sufficient, and window is also sufficient, and it is necessary to obtain iron like them.
And Sardar made the land united, not them
We must also participate in this movement for unity and move forward the unity mantra.
We are very naturally saying that India's unity individually is a record.
While we were glorious of populism, didn't you try to experience this variety
I want to repeat to the people of the country, especially younger generations, that we are alive.
And you shall experience the multitude of our nation, and you shall understand it, and you shall see the dwelling thereof.
You can see that this variety of our country will be a school for the development of personality within you.
Holidays, the time of Deepawali, there has been a mood to go somewhere on the four sides of our country.
People from North India do not know what is in South India.
Those living in the West do not know what is in East India.
Do you know how much variety is in our country
If you told Gandhians, Lokmanya Tilakar, Swami Vivekanandar and our former Republican leader Abdul Kalam, one thing would be well known - when they roamed around India, there was a new welcome to understand and understand India and sacrifice their lives.
All these dignitaries surround India completely.
Prior to their operation, they tried to understand and understand India.
They tried to see India alive within themselves.
Cannot our various states, various communities, groups, their habitual practices, their traditions, their folks, their food habits, their beliefs, be able to learn, understand and live as a student
It is the value of tourism that we understand as a student, not to go and stand.
I have a chance to visit more than 500 districts in India.
The dream of unanimous India lies in it.
How many types of foods are there
If you have every kind of food every day in your whole life, there is no chance of eating the same food again, there are so many types.
This is the greatest strength of our tourism.
During these holidays, you must leave the house without stopping, not going to change, go out with the intention of knowing and surviving things.
Your life will be fulfilled through these experiences.
Your eyesight will be expanded.
Say, who else could be greater than your experiences
This time too, if you go, you will go ahead with my movement.
Participate your experiences wherever you go, share photographs.
Definitely send your photographs to incredibledia.
If you have to meet the people there, send their photographs.
There is an idea in my mind - to encourage the tourism sector in India, what will be the seven most important tourist places in your state - every Indian should go to the 7 places of your state if possible.
With this help, can you give any information about this
Does it reveal in the NarendramodiApp
Do you know this in IncredibleIndia
If a number of people from a state say so, I would look into it and tell the government to release advertising cards about which 7 places have been reported in every state.
I.e., how can we go to tourist places in a way with people's views
Likewise, you can think of the places you have seen in the country, where you have 7 of the most important places, and others must visit and get information about it, and you must send it to MyGov, NarandramodiApp, 7 places you loved.
Come on, join me.
In the period from October to March this year, you can become inclined to encourage the country's tourism sector.
I'm calling you.
Our countrymen, many things touch my heart, as a man.
I'm a man like you
And it shall come to pass in the past, perhaps your attention: and in this the nations shall see the magnificent light of women's power and nationhood.
The Indian army has received two homes - Lieutenant taste and finance, which are abnormal surgeon.
If I say that they are abnormal, they lost their lives in the service of India, and the husbands of both the finance.
You imagine how their mood would be when they snatch the world in this little age
But Sudhi Mahadik, wife of Tigyai Colonel Santosh Mahadik, faced such a difficult situation, strengthened her mind and joined the Indian army.
He joined the military for 11 months with hard exercise and encouraged himself to deny his husband's dream.
Similarly, Financial Tubey's husband Mahesh Dubey served as a hero in the army, lived in the country's work, his wife, Financial, possessed the discord of joining the army.
There is no doubt that every citizen has the doubt that this mother will be respected on the power of our survival.
My beloved countrymen, among the Navaratri festival and Deepawali, there has been a great opportunity for the young people of our country.
FIFA, the world's penetration for the 17-year-old.
I am confident that my football will be against all four sides.
Every generation will enhance interest in football.
Everyone must be involved in this game that there are no youths who do not play football in the field of any school-callory of India.
Come on, when all the world countries come to play on Indian soil, we will make the game a part of our lives.
My new countrymen, the Navaratri is going on.
This is the time to fulfil Mother Durg.
The environment is suffering from pure happiness.
And on all four sides there shall be an eternal environment, and a joyous environment, and a folly, and a folly.
During this sacred day of Navaratri, I repeat many good lives to the people of the country, and I request the Mother Bara Shakti to fulfil the desires of the lives of the country's ordinary dwellings, and to impose new peaks in the country.
The ability to confront every challenge must be achieved to the country.
The country must proceed in the fast door, in 2022, India is free and 75 years, and in an attempt to fulfil the dreams of freedom fighters, with an uninterrupted effort, uninterrupted labour and unemployment of 125 crore people, and we must proceed with five years of plans for new India, and give us our favours.
Give good to all yourselves.
Engage in the thumbs, spread the thumb.
This is the land of our country, Buddha and Gandhi, and the land of the country's solidarity with the whole of the country's unity.
For centuries, our ancestors have enriched this in our minds for surplus life, generally for survival, and for accomplishment.
And Ahimsa said to Parmothermah, We have heard this word from the beginning of our young age, and have also spoken.
This variety is not found only in food habits, shelters, dressing clothes.
This variety is seen in every activity of life.
You must have seen that all our festivals have been arranged according to the nature's card.
All of these are directly linked to nature.
Many of our festivals are associated with farmers and fishermen.
When I talk to you today, I want to tell all of you that Michaam is sorry.
The Jains celebrated the Samvatsari festival yesterday.
In the month of Pathra, the festival of Purushan is celebrated.
Samvatsari is coming on the last day of the Buryshon celebrations.
This is a wonderful tradition.
On the day of Samvatsari, he mentioned forgiveness, accomplishment and friendship.
This period is considered to be a sign of unity, equality and cleaning.
For all the people of the country, the children are clean and good.
Now a festival of comfort is celebrated in Kerala.
In India's colorful festivals, Kerala's festival is the most important one.
Now our festivals have become a factor of tourism attraction.
I want to tell the people that this is a program of tourism attraction in the form of a navy festival in Gujarat and a furious festival in Bengal.
Our other festivals have also made an opportunity to attract foreign nations.
In this direction we must think what else we can do.
It's Ul Suha to come in a few more days to continue the festival.
At the same time, in the new India, festivals must be a factor for cleaning.
Festivals and cleansing are associated with family life.
Preparing for the festival is to pay attention to cleanliness.
It is not a new thing for us, but it is necessary to change it in a social nature.
They pour colors in it, someone pours a vegetable, and someone puts a coffee piece of paper in it.
Every family is doing various types of applications.
In a way, the biggest exercise of climate awareness has been seen for the first time in this summer festival.
We started the cleaning movement 3 years ago, and in October, 3 years will be completed.
Its adverse consequences have emerged.
The areas of the seizures are from 39 percent to about 67 percent.
A specific example of insisting on unity in order to purify, is not an instruction to everyone, but from the Jameid Ulema A Hindu organisation.
If the attempts made in order to purify, with dedication, change our sustainable nature, then no summit can be raised by our country
When we get the opportunity, we'll find opportunities where we get.
But we all have to join it.
We consider this as a preparation for Deepawali, or a preparation for Navaratri, or a preparation for the Durga Pooja.
We'll serve physically.
We will work together in holidays or Sundays.
We go to the neighbouring territory, we go to the neighbouring villages, but we can do this as a movement.
I apply to all state-owned organizations, schools, colleges, social-political leaders, state officials, district rulers and famine leaders - 15 days before the day of October 2 of the birth of Gandhians, we will create an environment of cleaning, it must really be a October 2.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Physics, My Gov.
After setting up a toilet, you can register their names and names with whom you have helped to set up your name and toilet.
My socialist friends can pursue some of the constructive movements, and you can conceive in determining work at the stage.
A genuine rivalry of 'a victory in cleaning' is being organized by the Ministry of Water and Physics, which is organised to column competitive, competitor-making competition and painting.
In this you can write articles in many languages, there is nothing older.
You can make a diamond, you can prepare it in your cell phone.
It can be produced for 2-3 minutes, which is enabled to provoke cleaning.
I call for all of you to join all of you in this movement on cleanliness.
When we celebrate on October 2, after the 15-day cleaning system of service, see how purer enjoyment will be seen if we have given to the humiliated Gandhians.
Hundreds of thousands of letters write, report, many are reporting by phone, which is very valuable for me.
This is the biggest opportunity to understand the minds of the nations.
Moreover I wait for the reports that you give than the sound of your heart.
I'm thirsty because every thing of yours gives me a chance to learn.
Yeah, I'm still trying to make such a mistake.
Sometimes we don't even say we're wrong if some things change naturally.
"He is the first minister, I speak to Aparna from Poona.
I want to talk to you about my companion
She has always been trying to help everyone, but her action makes me sorry.
Once I went to the business premises to buy things with her.
He spent 2000 rupees without any trouble buying a bug and then spent 450 rupees and bought bits.
But with the auto driver used for the premises, he was seriously involved in a 5-rupee deal.
While buying vegetables on the way back, the deal was spoken at every vegetable price and smoothed 4-5 rupees.
I'm very upset.
We buy things without hearing any questions in bigger places, fighting for simple money with our brothers who are working.
After asking this phone call, I'm sure you might be condolences, and you might assure your mind that why the wrath can snatch away, and I'm not going to do so any more.
Have you ever seen what will run in the mind of that poor
I am young friends, on August 29, all the country's sports are to be celebrated daily.
This is the birthday of Major Thyanchand, who is considered to be the hawk sports brave and hawker of the world.
His contribution to Hockey is inappropriate.
I recall the fact that the younger community of our country must join you with sports.
Sports must turn into part of our lives.
Since we are the youngest country in the world, we must reflect in this youthful field of sports.
The sports of physical, awakening mind and ruling elite - what else to say than these.
Sports are very close to joining minds in a way.
I want to say that the younger generations of our country must move forward in the sports world, which is also important in today's calculation in the world than the field of sports and the calculation of sports.
In the calculation, FIFA's footballs can play all but I'm watching the football in the field.
You can play cricket in the calculation, but in the field, play below the sky, its joy is the best.
When all the children in the house went out, Mother asked when to return.
This has changed in today's time, when the children come home, sit on a corner, start watching the cartoon film or shut down in mobile camels.
Here, there is a record in the sports sector, any child in the country, who has talent, can describe their details or videos in the battlefield.
The war plan is initiated by the Ministry of Sports, which provides training to the elected and growing sportsmen.
In India, from October 6 to 28, FIFA has been organised for the 17-year-old world-called football supplies.
24 teams from all over the world are playing in India.
Come on, let us welcome young social comrades from many countries through sports activities, and we will experience sports and create such an environment in the country.
While speaking about sports, I would like to embarrass you about the event that took place in the last weeks.
Six such women work on the navy.
Their sentiments and their incentives are to encourage all of us.
These six women's wealth are traveling to a small film INS TARINI, trying to cross the seas.
And the name of this act was Navikah Sagar Samaria, and the sea of women's flocks.
They shall round about the world, and they shall return to India after months.
Sometimes they will spend about 40 days in water.
Sometimes they may have to spend about 30 days in the water.
In the midst of the waves of the sea, our 6 women travel with pride and this is the first time in the world.
I also create a way for their experiences in Narendramodi App, and you are planning to study
You must read it, because I am happy to share the experiences of this woman's wealth with you.
Glad tidings to these women, and great good wishes.
O people of the country, we celebrate the day of the teacher in September 5th.
Former Republican leader of our country, Dr.
This is the birthday of Radhakrishnan.
Though he was the president of the Republic, he preferred himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always wanted to live a teacher.
He was devoted to education.
One of the lawyers, as a monarchy, was the Republican leader of India, but at every moment he was a living teacher.
I remember him.
This time when we celebrate the Teacher's Day, can we all together make a commitment
Due to his efforts, the events that have succeeded in changing the livelihood of anybody will certainly be in the lives of every editor.
If we are socially attempted, we can change our country, and we can get the largest contribution.
Let's learn to see changes, let's take this mantra forward, let's come.
Ananya's austerity.
I live in Mumbai, working for the Indian Research Centre at Howard University.
As an analyst, I am particularly interested in financial inclusion, i.e., financial content and social programs associated with it.
The question that I want to ask you is, in 2014, you have started your plans by the people, and in today's three years, if India is financially more secure, if the power is increasing, this power and facilities have increased our women, peasants, peasants, workers, villages and plantations, and what are the statistics to show.
They have heard of the country's 'financial minister Jan's plan.' Financial content - has been a discussion not only in India but also in the economic world.
In August 28, 2014, I began the program with a dream in my mind.
Tomorrow, in August 28, the movement, which is being launched by Prime Minister Jan, will be completed for 3 years.
About 30 crore new families are connected to it and bank accounts are opened.
This is a higher number than in many countries of the world.
Sometimes, if money is in hand or in a bike or in a house, it's intensifying to spend home.
Prime Minister Jan through his plan, through our poor, the amount of money deposited in banks is 65,000 crores.
This shame of poor shall be their strength in the future.
Prime Minister Jan, who opens the bank accounts through his plan, also gets insurance benefits.
Prime Minister Jeev Jodie's life insurance and prime minister's risk insurance plan - a simple payment of Rs 30, a new reliance has been created in the lives of the poor today.
In many families, due to the fees of one rupee, if there is a union for the poor, if the family leader dies, then the family gets two lakh rupees.
The Prime Minister Mutra Program, the Stand Up Program - has been a means of getting money from the banks without any binding on the banks, as a result of the Prime Minister's Mudra Programme, the Start Up Program, and the subordinates, the tribal classes, the women, the learned youth, and the youth who have been able to stand in their own feet.
They stand in their own legs, not only in their own hands, but also in their successful efforts to provide jobs to one and two.
During the past, some of the bankers told me that when they came to meet me, they had received a number of ideas of the benefits of the common people because of their plans, insurance plans, Rupay cards and Prime Minister Mutra's plans.
And I will bring them in your sight, and I will take all the efforts:
The media also includes the events that can be fully used.
They can also synthesis with such individuals and create a new concept for the new generation.
My people, you nations, once again, you all of you shall be ashamed of Micham.
The Tamil Empire of the Indian radio in Narendra Modi Agal today's speech.
The rainy season is the time to enjoy people's minds.
All the animals, birds, plants and natural are flowing due to the arrival of rain.
But sometimes, when the rain is great, we know how great it is.
Natural mother gives us life, develops all of us, but sometimes natural settlements such as floods and landlords cause great destruction.
Changing climate and environmental change have adversely affected.
For the past few days, in some parts of India, especially in Assam, north east, Gujarat, Rajasthan and parts of Bengal, natural betrayals had to face a lot of rain.
Full surveillance operations are being carried out in flood affected areas.
State governments are also making big efforts to help the people suffering from floods.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and serving citizens are doing their best to help the people in this environment.
Consequences, footwear, construction facilities, roads, electricity and information related organizations are all affected.
In particular, in order to meet the consequences of our agricultural brothers and the loss of their crops, we have urgently fulfilled the demand for the compensation of farmers, in particular, to the insurance companies, particularly to the crop insurance companies.
Moreover, the 1078 system is fully functioning 24 hours of help to overcome the floods.
People are expressing their problems in this regard.
Prior to the start of the rainy season, the training system was conducted in the majority and the entire state apparatus was prepared.
The National Petroleum Residency Forces were dismantled.
In many places, training was provided to them to create a supporting organisation, to do what to do, to determine self-reliants, to create a mass organisation, to act in such conditions.
All this has already been calculated about the window, technology has increased, space science is very much responsible for calculating it, for which we have almost the right results.
Gradually, according to the weather calculation, we must change our nature to establish our operations and prevent the impact of the disasters.
Whenever I lay myself ready for the voice of the mind, I can see that the people of our country are engaged in their works.
This way there are many letters and phone calls on the circular and service tax:
Even now, people have expressed their joy about this circular and service and have expressed their expectations.
I'll hear this phone call: Princess, Prime Minister, I speak from Kurqawn, i.e., from Gurugram to Garg.
In a month's past, are you expected to have consequences
Thank you, I want to know your thoughts about this.
The circular and service tax has been delayed for nearly a month, and its consequences are beginning to be known.
I see how this new rejuvenation system has been affected in the transport and services sector.
Items are also very fast.
Despite this facility, it has been strengthened mainly for the economic growth.
Due to the earlier separate taxation, the majority of the resources of the transport and services sector have been spent in maintaining documents, and there was a need to create new storage to stay in every state.
This tax, which I say is good and simple tax, has actually created a very draconian impact on our economy.
The speed in which the reconstruction changes have occurred, the speed in which new records have been replaced, has created a new hope all over the country.
Of the world university, it will be considered as a test.
This is because, in such a larger way, such a major change could be regarded as a high-ranking victory, with the insistence of millions of people, successfully abolishing this system in such a large country.
S.D.
All states have shares and responsibility for the implementation of the LTTE.
All decisions have been taken in a united manner by the states as the central government.
What was the price of something mentioned by the secretary before this restructuring and how it was after the new reconstruction is all found in your mobile phone.
This is a historical victory, historical achievement.
This is also a social reform movement.
I don't see my Kodanukodi countrymen and my Kodanukodi clients, which have very naturally successfully achieved such a big effort.
And it came to pass in August, ye nations, that in the month of Revolution.
Obviously we have been questioning about this, because the collaborative movement in August was launched on 1st December, 1920.
Then in August 9, 1942, the white emerging movement began, we know that it was the August Revolution.
The country was free on August 15, 1947.
In one way, many events in August are particularly associated with the history of freedom.
This year we are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the outgoing movement.
But this white man has proposed the anger that he would come out.
Some people knew it was Yusuf Meher Ali.
Our new generations must know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, all the historical sides of the nations who joined themselves in the free hunting, tied themselves and succumbed to oppression should be encouraged to invade a horrific India.
What can be the greater concept of our freedom fighters than sacrifices, sacrifices and sacrifices
The white emerging movement is the most important struggle of the Indian freedom movement.
This struggle made the mindset of the entire country to get rid of the British regime.
During that period, all of them joined hands with the shoulders, poor and rich, and participated in a whitely exit struggle against the British regime, in every corner of Hindustan, villages, cities, lessons, lessons.
People's anger was at the peak.
Thousands of nations listened to the chamber of Gandhians and took up the struggle in the minds and minds.
Hundreds of thousands of youth in the country have sacrificed their studies and books in the free hub.
The throne of freedom was sounded, and they went forward.
Mamanithas like Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan have played an important role.
The collaborative movement of 1920, the Whiteen Outgoing movement of 1942, both of which glitter two different emblems of Gandhians.
The dimension of collaboration was different, and in 1942, the extent to which the free candidate was increased, it was required to pursue a mantra like Gandhians, who had to do or die.
The independence struggle, which began in 1857, has continued in any part of the country every year by 1942.
This long-term period had created a free race in the minds of the nations.
Everyone was determined to do something.
The generations have changed, but there is no slight depression in stress.
People continued to come, encouraged themselves, went, and the new ones came, they joined themselves, attempted to engage the British regime in the country.
From 1857 to 1942, this struggle was a new situation, which led to the higher stage of this situation.
That was when Sangnath shouted out of the white, and within 5 years the British had to leave the country in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, the free candidate went to all the people.
This 5 years since 1942 to 1947, which was the outbreak of the mindset of the people, had been the cause of liberation of the country.
These five years are their own deciding years.
Now I want to join you with this account.
We were free in 1947.
Today we are in 2017.
About 70 years have passed.
The governments came.
Organisations have grown, changed, developed and developed.
Everyone attempted to relieve the country from its problems.
Efforts were made to increase employment, eliminate poverty and develop.
Attempts were made in their own ways.
Success has also been received.
On August 15 this year, we have to celebrate the weekend and weekend, and the country will be released in 2022 to 75 years, and we have reached the success of this weekend.
On August 9, 125 crore people will recall the Revolution Day and on August 15, if everybody is determined, as a citizen, as a citizen - I will do this to the country, as a family, as a family, as a society, as a city, I will do it, as a state sector and as a state.
Hundreds of people must be killed.
Efforts must be made to fulfill such promises.
That is why we must join the 5 years of India's future, from 2017 to 2022, just as 5 years since 1942 to 1947, as well as 5 years of determination for the country's release.
We are going to celebrate after 5 years of the 75 years of liberation of the country.
Every citizen, every social organisation, local organisations, schools, colleges, and various organisations, will take a certain commitment to new India.
This will be determined to win our dreams in the next 5 years.
What goal should we go as a country
What can be my contribution to it as a personal person
Use of technology, faculty, posts, plagues, articles and new ideas.
Let us turn this movement into a public movement.
In Narendra Modi's secretary, the younger social friends will be competing for the release of the white.
An attempt to compete with this question, link young people to the great history of the country and to know about the freedom struggle democrats.
I hope you'll spread and widely expand this news.
I am likely to speak to the country from the Red Fort as the country's prime minister on August 15.
I'm a tool.
I read them, and I will try to show them how long I have on August 15.
Accusation was made to me that the speeches made on August 15 last three times were slightly long.
I'm trying to make rules for me, I don't know if I can do it.
But I am supposed to try this time how to make my speech brief.
I can see if I have a victory in this.
People of the country, I want to talk to you about another thing.
India's economy includes a social economy.
We should never assess it.
Our feasts, and all our vows, are not just the occasions of joy.
Our festivals and functions are also a movement for social resurgence.
But even then, each of our punctuation has direct connections with the economic life of the whole world.
After a few days, Raksha Bandhan, Krishna Jayanti, then the children's square, then Saudh Chandra, then Ananth Chaudasi, Durka Pooja, Deepavali, came together.
These include individuals and social.
The natural journey between these two is continuing.
Ah, i.e., I'm a chance to move forward from the situation we are.
As economic conditions, even months before the Raksha Bandan festival, many families have started making rocks as a small immigration industry.
Several kinds of rocks are made from cotton to silver.
But today people have begun to enjoy the rocks made at home.
This is directly linked to the poor handicrafts that produce small lamps.
But while I speak today about the festivals and the economic conditions of the poor associated with them, I want to explain the environment.
Sometimes I see that the countrymen are more awakening and wise than me.
For the last one month, aware citizens have been writing letters to me regarding environment.
You have already asked me to talk about the child's childhood square, when he wants to increase the desire for the child on the soil and plan from now on.
I'm telling my first thanks to such aware citizens.
At the same time, we must be sure that a child made of silly and soil should be produced to protect the environment.
This time I have said very early:
For all nations, and for the coming multitudes, and for the congregation, I have spoken of sacrifices.
A few days ago, our women and women have committed a profound act in the cricket world competitive competition.
This week there was a chance to meet all of them.
I was very glad to have spoken to them, but I felt that the burden on them was suppressing that they could not win the world's anger.
The pressure on their faces, the crisis was surpassed.
I gave a different assessment to those women.
Look, today's time is the media world, the expectations have been over, the extent to which success has not been achieved, it turns into anger.
If India's sportsmen fail, we have seen the country's anger in many sports.
Without stopping, they praised the achievements of these women and glorified them.
In fact, young people of our country, especially women, are engaged in many things to gather the country's pride.
I once again congratulate the younger communities, especially our women, my hearts offerings.
We must take and take the country to new peaks.
Come on, let's travel together, let's do something.
The future of the country will certainly be very important, and we will move forward.
Have a good life.
The weather is changing.
After the rain, the cold wind breathed slightly from the summer heat in the past.
No matter how many places have been opposed in life, we can realise that individual life, in public life, the arrival of rain, a better change in the mindset of all of us.
The poor people of the country are admiring with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor.
In English, there is a word called juggernaut, which means that nobody can stop any particular blood.
When it was seen in Agarathi, it was known that the word 'Jakarnaut' has been created in accordance with Jagannath's chariot.
When we see all this, we can understand how the world's people have accepted this glory in their own ways.
At the time of the journey of Lord Jagannath, I have told my goodwill to all the nations, and I have worshipped Lord Jagannath's arrows.
Come, let us all pass through this holy bed, and divide the treasures of joy, and proceed to the country.
In this sacred month of Ramlan, we have noticed a highly sympathetic episode of Uttar Pradesh's state of Bihar's Mubarakpur village.
There are around 3500 Islamic brothers living with their family in this small village, a large number of brothers of Islamic families.
In the month of Ramallan, villagers decided to build a toilet together.
Therefore, they said you should spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I am applauding all rural residents from Mubarakpur to replace Ramlan's pious time for social welfare.
We know that states such as Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been freed from the habit of abandoning the toilets in our country.
This week, Ariana and other states have been declared unprecedented.
I observe my special thanks to the administration and rulers and civilians of these five states.
We know that if we want to do some good things in private life, well, social life, then we must work harder.
If our signature is bad, we think it should be corrected, we'll have to take a long time effort to get awake.
That's when it turns into a habit of physical and mental.
Similarly, some other bad habits are naturally ours.
We must attract everybody's attention.
We must recall the provocative events.
I am happy that cleanliness does not stop at the state level today.
This has served as a movement of people's society.
This is one of the districts of Vijayanagar in Andhra Pradesh.
What is its goal
At 100 hours, 71 grams of pancreas have to be built at 10,000 homes.
You will rejoice that the country's people, civilians and governments, have managed to work for 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
(Instairs) are coming through letters and airstrikes.
Prakash Tripadi reminded them of the urgency and stated that in June 25 it was the biggest snake in the history of the masses.
Prakash Tripadhi is a culture, not just an organisation, but a publicity system.
At the same time, we must take forward good news of the populist system.
On June 25, 1975, it was a dark night, and nobody could easily forget it.
No Indian will leave it.
All the country's largest leaders, including Jayaprakash Narayan, were locked in prison.
Today's media students and public works are engaged in a series of attempts to recall the draconian period.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
As the country was declared urgency for a year, Adul wrote a poem, describing the atmosphere in the country during that period.
We must further strengthen this tradition.
O people of our country, every Indian today feels great respect for his head.
On June 21, 2017, the entire world was sympathetic.
And all the people from the water to the hill, and the sun rays in the morning, and through the yoke.
Yoga was not the first, but today all of them joined Yoga Kali, Yoga became a bridge to join the world.
The world's almost all countries have changed the opportunity to enjoy this gain.
More than 4,000 people were engaged in yoga in the wrath of China's masses and the world traditional small Machu Pichu, 2400 metres above the sea level and in the absence of the United Arab Emirates.
In the Herah of Afghanistan, the Indian Offensive and Sulma Dam joined Yoga and established a new program to the ally.
Even at a small place like Singapore, the programs were arranged at 70 places and they carried out the movement for one week.
This time Yoga has regained world achievement.
Nearly 55,000 people have joined Gujarat's Ahmedabad and built a new world record.
I also got a chance in the yogkalaka pavilion in Lucknow.
But for the first time in the rainy season, it was also a good place in Yoga Pass.
Menons 20, 25 and 40 degrees of temperature in Siachen, our soldiers were also engaged in Yoga art.
Our troops, border security forces, Indian Tibetan border guards, Central Reserve Police personnel and Central Industrial Security Forces, are all engaged in their obligations and yoga training.
Since this is the third international yoga day, I have asked the family members of 3 generations to participate in the film and participate with me.
Some television channels also moved forward.
Many of them had sent me photographs, some of whom were selected in Narender Modi's secretary.
These are the respected Prime Ministers, I am from Gujarat's Ahmedabad.
I'm talking about Sonara.
I remind you of recent saying in Kerala that we cannot give good books to memories instead of pouring out at different places.
Wouldn't we do anything to absorb this idea all over the country
I liked it too much.
I've been reminded of a thing that escaped from my memory.
Because when I was in Gujarat, we shouldn't be able to supplied anymore, we have created the method of giving a handcuff or welcoming books.
We also give it to the door's hand, because it can encourage the doors.
When I was in Gujarat, it turned into a habit, but since I came from there, this habit has been released.
But when I went to Kerala, I again felt awakening.
But when we give books, in one way it becomes part of the house and becomes a member of the family.
Do you know how many poor people are helpful in this, even if we can welcome the letters
Expenditure declining and proper use.
These things have more historical importance.
When I went to England last year, Elizabeth's queen in London city called me to the festivity.
He had a glimpse in his eyes, and when he married me, Gandhians congratulated me and expressed their feeling that he had visited the arrest.
Over many years, but Elizabeth Rani defended the arrest of Gandhians.
A great love of Gandhians has become part of his life, and has become part of his history.
These habits don't turn into night, while speaking, criticisms are also subject to it.
At the same time, attempts must be made to engage in such discussions.
For this, when I go somewhere, if someone snatches, I don't deny it, I can't do that.
To weep criticisms, we must repeat and gradually have a change.
There are many accusations in the country's people as prime ministers.
Even if I have to be covered with columns, I am creating a habit, i.e., reading something in the letters coming to me, setting up an opportunity to join me with ordinary people.
There are many letters, and many different people write to me.
I think it is necessary to share with you a letter I read a few days ago.
I am, therefore, starting the work of buying money from the bank, according to Mutra's plan.
Meanwhile, I noticed the Indian government government government government government E-Marketplace, an organization called state electronics.
Whoever wants to give anything to the government - if they think of selling anything like electric teeth, pipelines, pipelines, chairs and tablets, they can register themselves at this base.
It has been forced to take stock of what they have, what they can sell, and the state sectors should go to this base and see who are paying less and costly things.
In the same way, all the departments of the government are paying attention to whom they register in the E-GEM.
Due to lack of intermediaries, things are available at cheap prices.
This is the opportunity to encourage the entrepreneurship.
It also has immorality, with power and enforcement.
All those who want to sell their belongings to the government, I want to register themselves on this Internet.
People of the country, while we grow up on Yoga, the achievements that we have produced in space science are also restraining our chest.
While our legs lie on the earth connected with yoga, it is the greatest speciality of India that we are fulfilling the dream of touching the far-flung application.
In the past, India has shown a great achievement in playing and science.
Today, India is not only on the earth but also on the application.
Two days ago, the Indian Space Research Institute of India has successfully received 30 ornamental satellites with cartosad-2 artificial cells.
These artificial objectives include only 14 countries, such as France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the US, apart from India.
This artificial movement of India will be very helpful in obtaining information regarding agriculture and natural misery.
The passage of 1000 days is an important milestone in our scientific journey.
Now we see that our youth have improved in the field of sports.
Besides education, they realise their future in the field of sports.
Our sportsmen, their efforts and their achievements, the country has been proud.
Recently, India's Peteminton sportsman Gitambi Srikanth has won in the Indonesia Open scene and has glorified the country.
I'm telling him and his neighbours my heart's greetings to achieve this achievement.
T.
The entire ruling class plays a major role in Membad.
There is no shortage of skills in the country.
If our families and children are engaged in sports, we must give them a chance.
And they shall not leave them out of the field, neither shall they put them in the room, and teach them.
And it shall come to pass, that he shall not study, neither shall he progress therewith: but if he has greater ability, or joy in his sports, then all shall provoke him to the school, and to the college, and to the house, and to the house of the house.
Everyone has to see the dream of participating in the next Olympics.
Once again, there is a time for the people of the country to create new experiences for the rainy season and continuous periods.
Once again I tell you all my good life, I join you in the voice of the next mind.
This year the heat of summer remains an unforgettable experience.
At the same time, we are expecting rain.
When I am speaking to you this day, Ramlan has started in the holy month.
This time Ramallan is born in the holy month, I express my heartful greetings to the people living in India and around the world, especially to the people of Islamic society.
In the month of Ramallan, there has been considerable importance to prayer, anaemic and action.
It is a matter of increasing the 125 crore people of our country that all the time in the world are in India.
We must be blessed that our ancestors have established this great tradition.
There are gods and repentants in this land: there are gods, and worshipers of the idols, and who oppose the idol and there are many swords in our land.
The art of uniting various types of thoughts and diversity and diverse traditions has joined our sense.
Not only the times, but the methods, not the principles, but the traditions: all these are the ones that give us, peace, unity, goodness.
In this holy Ramlan month, we will be helped to go forward on the path of peace, unity and goodness.
I'm once again telling my blessings to everyone.
I am happy that many people have registered their backs.
Everyone wants to share with me with enthusiasm about their experiences personally.
"I am talking to Digsha Kadam.
I have decided to study in holidays when it is almost removed from me.
When I began to read about the struggle of freedom, I realized how many sacrifices and struggles to get freedom of India had to be carried out and how many fighters experienced prison oppression.
I'm asking you to give a message to today's generations about this, because Bhagat Singh's life, which has shown me the biggest achievement in the youngest age.
I am glad that the younger community is enjoying knowledge of our history and our freedom fighters, for this country, about the bodies, materials and the soul-free sacrifices.
Innumerous parents have lost their youth in prison.
Many youths have kissed the streets with their faces.
We can breathe the breathing air of independent India today because they have experienced everything that they say.
The maternal grandsons who spent all the time in the Liberation War, wrote books, reads, performs all the greater jobs, and their writings also enabled India to get freedom.
Several years ago, I went to see the Cellular prison in Andaman Nicobar.
Today, Veer Savarkar is his birthday.
Veer Savarkar wrote a book called Maji Janmadeh in prison.
He wrote poems in prison walls.
They kept him in a small room.
Do you know what tyrants the freedom fighters have suffered
When I had to read the book with the Maje Janmad, the Charker wrote, I was supposed to see the cellular prison.
They organise a bright sight there, which is very exciting.
So-called Kalabani, the Andaman Nicobar had met with many sorrows from all the states who sacrificed their youth in the prison, all the language speakers of India.
And in June 5, the first Monday of the month, the people of the country.
Well, what does it mean to connect naturally
As for me, it is to join us, join us.
The creation of a specific land is a combination of nature.
Who can express it better than Gandhians.
The Gandhiites once said, 'One must carboot a World One will not see, it is our duty to look forward to the unprecedented world that it cannot see us, that is, it is our duty to be attractive to it.
You may also have experienced that the nature is mighty.
Perhaps you shall be very tired, and you shall take water, and sprinkle your face, and see what kind of joy you have reached
The new power emerges when we are formed from the fifteen colours that are connected to the fifteen colours.
That is why in June 5, the world-class movement that connects with nature must be a combining movement with us.
The earth and environment have been painted on the basis of power.
The entire guidance of the environment provides us in a sense of arthritis, which is a thousand years old book.
Mother Earth: Bhudro Ahm Prudhivaya: This is the case of our country.
It is said in the laws that the cleaning of ourselves is due to the earth.
Natural worship and natural behaviour are a natural lifestyle for many festivals, many purchasing methods, non-services, urban residents, tribals and people who want to be social.
We must, however, combine it with temporary opinions in equivalent terms.
I have so many reports from the states.
Without rains in almost all the states, a large movement of trees starts.
Hundreds of trees are being planted.
We must also give more importance and contribution to the work of planting trees in this season.
My neighbours, on June 21, it is a day of great significance throughout the world.
Everyone in the world celebrates this as a day of World Yoga.
In June 21, the world is spread all over the world as the day of Yoga in the shortest period, which connects the world people.
On the one hand, when the separatist powers in the world are showing their evil faces, India's largest hatred for the world.
Through Yoga, we can join the world together.
How Yoga connects the body, mind, intelligence, soul, as well as yoga can connect the world.
Today, due to lifestyle, due to urgency, due to increasing responsibilities, life has increased.
We see that this situation has happened even when we are young.
During the days of taking unsuccessful medicines, we would be opposed to the yogi's ability to live a stressed life.
The simultaneous yoga that gives guarantees to both health and sex.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible only through yoga art if we say we have to experience such an inner journey... how to take a healthy journey with physical, mental, thoughts and habits.
Two days ago, the journal has written letters to all the governments and all the leaders of the world.
Last year I announced some competitions and some honours about the art of yoga.
Slowly works are moving forward in this direction.
I have been advised, and I am greetings to give this basic advice.
It's very interesting.
I have been asked to ask if 3 generations of family members will not be able to do yoga together with the next three international yoga gatherings.
3 generations of people like Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, son and daughter can work together to give such a photo.
Tomorrow, this will be a magnificent combination as tomorrow, and a new dimension for yoga.
Tomorrow, this will happen tomorrow's film, which will guarantee the surprising future.
I'm calling all of you.
If the international yoga is more than 3 weeks a day, start training from today.
And you also share things related to yoga, and spread, and join the people.
In one way, this is the pre-defence health care movement.
You're all calling you to join it.
From the beginning of the day, I am traveling to various parts across India.
I'm very fond of seeing what Modi did.
I had an interesting telephone call, and I didn't think about what was said.
But I thank you for creating such a distinct approach.
I believe this phone call will happen to you too.
"Hey boys, I am speaking Naina from Mumbai.
I have often seen all this on TV and social websites that Modiji is going where you go, people there pay more attention to cleanliness.
As far as Mumbai is concerned, the people are listening to your calls and are inspiring as a social and clean movement.
If the elders are on one side, there has been awakening of cleanliness among children.
Many times I have seen their elders cast their dirt on the streets.
After you started the system of cleanliness in Kasi's stairs, it has been desperately discouraged from you.
'You say, well, wherever I go, the state apparatus takes up the cleaning service, but now all this is being purely even socially.
Five days, 7 days, 10 days before I go, there are substantial cleaning works.
The media also gives greater importance, and I went to the Garch region of Gujarat a few days ago.
There was a large scale cleaning movement.
I didn't see it combined, but only after this phone call came to me, yeah, that's all right.
Other preparations to welcome the prime minister are a common man, but it gives great pleasure to give importance to cleanliness.
It is enjoyable for anyone who likes cleanliness, and is supposed to be obsessive.
I'm telling my favorite blessings to all those who strengthen the cleaning work.
One has given me a suggestion.
This is a funny advice.
It's a good idea, but I should think about it.
What is the right thing to create a movement is that I will remove all these tons of slaughter clusters, rather than assigning things.
With the help of the Indian state government states, the city representatives have decided to conduct a very important movement on the management of the harvest.
On June 5, world climate is required to gather hydroelectricity and liquidity in nearly 4000 cities of the country.
There are two types of cotton bags, one green, the other blue.
There are two types of excavations - one liquid excavation, the other dry excavation.
We must follow the order, in 4000 cities, the pipelines are being placed, and the dry toilet should be placed in a blue pipeline, and the liquid outbreaks must be placed in a green pipeline.
The vegetables, which are unnecessary in vegetarian vegetarians, food, eggs, leaf of trees, etc., must be put on green ponds.
If we recall the colorful greenness of the fields, it will recall what to put on the green ponds.
The second type of buffalo contains coffins, iron utensils, glass stores, clothing, plastic, polythene, broken duplicates, rubber materials, metals - all of these must be placed in the dry buffaloes and refuted into machines.
A few days ago, a thing has come into the ear, and Versova beach, considered to be a sacred beach in Mumbai, has become a clean and beautiful beach today.
For this work, Afroz Shah gave them the United Nations Environment Programme - the UNEP, the largest award.
This is the first Indian who receives Champions of the Earth.
My favourite countrymen, for the past 15 days, and for months, there have been discussions and analysis in newspapers, TV channels and social media about the three-year process of the current state.
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of being the chief servant.
A number of opinion polls have been carried out.
I see all these as a very healthy symptom.
The last three years have been addressed in every address.
People at all levels of society have studied this.
This is a special activity in public opinion.
My obligation to repudiate governments in public opinion must be dedicated to accounts for the work of the people of Machesters.
By spending time, by examining our work deeply, by consultations, by advising, and by showing my thanks to all those who expressed deficiencies, I remind these things of great importance.
I also thank those who have given important references to observation.
Whatever crimes are, it is only when it is revealed that it is likely to improve.
The activity may well be, less gains may be scared, bad, however, and it may be possible to get out of them, through which it can improve.
Comprehensive criticism strengthens the populist system.
This analysis and research is also very essential for the country of awareness and discrepancy.
My neighbours, I am also a common citizen like you, all that is bad as a normal citizen, and as if any simple immigrant suffers me.
Some see the 'Manadin voice' as a description, some criticise it in political perspective, but I don't even think that the program 'Manadin's voice' will change me as a member of every family of India, and I feel it after a long experience.
I have to sit in the house and talk about home matters.
I am obliged to the Republican leader and the chief of the Republican and the chief of the opposition, all those in such high positions, dissolved their golden time and gave importance to the voice of the masses.
In a way, the voice of 'Mannatin' has created me a new dimension.
Some of our friends spoke to me sometimes when they were working on the book 'Manadin's voice.
I'm credited to Akbar Shahab.
My poor countrymen, when we meet the next time, the rainy season comes everywhere in the country, the results of the weather change, the results of the choices will start again, the learning will start... when the rain comes, the new happy environment, the new wind and the new wind.
Come on, let us all go forward to love nature in this environment.
Live my sacrifice to all of you.
Significant tests are being carried out in the state-level of these powerful instruments every time.
What kind of complaints are the experience of the people
We generally see that it is man's nature to provide suggestions to others.
While we travel in the trains, buses, if someone gets cough, we are naturally here to suggest suggestions that someone should do this immediately.
Initially, when counsels came to mind, the word of advice was found that it might be a habit for many people, but when we tried to see it, I really felt very happy.
After I pointed out, in the Narendra Modi activity, do you know what the new methods have been carried out to prevent all from the country's neighbourhoods from eating and drinking
I do not even think that the younger generations of our country have been working for a long time.
We know that some social organisations are being done for years, but the youth of my country are engaged in it - it was only after me.
Many have sent me homes.
Routy banks are being run in many places.
People pay bread from their roti in the bank, bring vegetables, whom they need and receive them.
The supplier doesn't need to think of the suppliers and those who buy themselves down.
This is an example of how to collaborate in society.
Today the last day of the month of April.
The company of Gujarat and Maharashtra states is coming in May.
At present, the people of both the states lived a little bit on me.
Both states have been attempting to accelerate the new development peaks, which have contributed to the progress of the country.
In the two states, great men have emerged, and in every section of society their lives are inspiring us.
In memory of these great men, on the day of the rise of states, on the day of the year 2022, when we are free and 75 years, we must take the determination of our states and our country to increase our society and our city to what extent our family.
We must go ahead with the collaboration of all civilians, to resolve that commitment.
I reiterate my good lives to these two state people.
At one time, environmental change was a matter of merely being spoken at the level of academics and pregnancy, but today, in our daily life, we are feeling it, the consciousness is over.
Nature has changed all the rules of its labour.
This time we have experienced temperatures in our country in the month of May-June in March-April.
While I was reviewing the advices of the people to the voice of the mind, the more suggestions were about what we should do during the heat.
All things are known and not new, but at the right time it would be very useful to re-examine them.
Prashant Kumar Misra, T.
They said that water should be placed in the palanquin, the upper layers.
I have seen small children in the family doing this particularly.
And if they replied, why water should be filled, they shall see whether they are in the utensils ten times a day.
Not only that, the birds shall come and drink water, but they shall be observed very carefully.
It may appear to us as a game, but actually, the punch is encouraging a unique experience of articulation in the minds.
In our country, musical life with birds and birds and nature is natural, consistent with our nervous systems, but at the same time it is important to strengthen the efforts made at the social level.
While I was the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, Sayyidna Sahib, the religious leader of 'Thaudi Pohra community' had been 100 years old.
He lived for 103 years.
To celebrate her 100 years of age, the people from the Bohra community carried out the largest movement to defend blind people through the Burhani court.
Kinnas got the world's achievements in the book.
Sometimes we are so busy, we forget to hear if you drink a mouth of water in the summer, even if you come to our home to call the ballistics, vegetable sellers, smugglers.
My young friends, I want to remind you of some things.
Sometimes, many of our young generations have troubled me that they want to live in a comfortable place, in a wealthy circle.
Parents are developing them very safely.
There are other fans, however, but most of the people are in a virtual circle.
Now the choices are over, and you will plan to spend holidays.
After the heat is over, the summer holiday will be slightly sweet.
I've given you three suggestions to use the holiday time, but you're special, but I'm trying to do something of them.
Get a new experience, try and find a new power, let us go to a place where no one can hear, see, not counted, unaware, unaware.
New places, new experiences, new capabilities.
We need to check out, come out of your spell circle.
We are from the middle families, happy family members.
In the evening, take your footprints or sheep or take other sports and go to the neighbourhood of the poor.
And you shall see the joy of playing with the poor children there, and you shall see that you shall be found when you have no pleasure in your life so far.
Do you think how big a change will occur in their lives when such poor and poor children get the joy of playing with you
If you go once, your mind would like to go back there.
This experience will teach you many things.
Many autonomous organisations are engaged in service.
You'll join you with the blind, and join you for 15 days, 20 days with an organization.
Sometimes the summer camp will be held, the ruling growth camp will be held, and a variety of constructive camps will be held, and join you.
After you are elected by joining such camps, learn to poor people without any chance to learn what you learn as a service, freely.
You can teach them how to do.
Though technologies seem to be declining distances and destruction of borders, the evil consequences of this are drying up my mind.
Six people are sitting in the same room, but they cannot even imagine the distance between them.
Why
Everyone is ruined because of technology.
Social nature is a good solution, social nature is a energy.
Doesn't your mind want to learn something new
Sometimes there is a fear that our younger generation is becoming a rope.
Our younger generation lives as an instrumental life, friends, the dreams we see in life are all good things.
But we must see the human beings that are in us not to interfere, and be careful of not leaving our humanity.
Can't we just pay attention to the capability barrier
A little away from the technology, we try to spend time with us.
If you don't know swimming, you can learn swimming, you can get a picture, you can't get to a very special extent, but you can't find a swimmer in the paper
The feelings within you will start reflecting in it.
All these capabilities and these operations will be rejoicing to you, not only that, the limits that you have built on one side will be removed.
Do something different, friends
This is your chance to build your life.
After all the choices were over, if you thought that I would imagine all this after a new position in your business.
Then you may have to suffer from another problem, so I want to tell you that if there is a Magic studying country, you must learn the bitter measure.
Please do this to your friends.
If you don't know anything, try to learn it, it will certainly benefit you.
Awake up the sufficient energy that is within you, which creates a pretty base for growth.
We can't even imagine how many things we have to learn in the world, friends, I share with you what I saw in my experience.
There are many new places, new towns, new villages and new circles.
Don't think of traveling too much.
Go and spend 3-4 days there, then go to the next place and spend 3-4 days there.
This will give you a lot of things to learn.
Friends, this time the Indian government has given you a very good opportunity.
The new generations have almost released a lot of sympathy.
You're involved in this, but you can earn through this program, do you know about a plan of the Indian government
But someone else can recommend it.
You can add others to it, and if the new person does three references, then you will get 10 rupees income.
10 rupees will be added to the government's pay.
If one day you said you'd add 20 people to it, you'd be paid 200 rupees in the evening.
Businessmen and students will also get income through this.
The plan will be up to 14th October.
Give you your contribution to creating digital India.
You are the defenders of the new India.
I got a very interesting phone call.
"He is the Prime Minister, I speak Shiwa Saube from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
I want to talk about the lightning red light.
I don't want to be caught in the traffic crisis, nor do I have to wait for anyone.
That's why I want to tell you my favorite thanks because of this conclusion you did.
The government's decision to demolition of red light is a systematic action.
But this culture, which is enlightened in mind, has to be rooted.
It can be overcome if we all try to waking up with awareness.
My aim is clear when I say - Avery Barson Is Important, everyone is important.
Each person has a significance, if we accept the importance of 125 crore people, we recognise the significance of the 125 crore people, the greatest power to consciousness of big dreams will also be.
We must do this together.
This year we celebrate the 1000th year of Mahan Ramanjujar, the 125 crore people of the country.
Because of some reason we skipped in the curtains, we were very small and we were mostly able to think about the centuries.
The centuries in other countries of the world are also considered to be very important.
Just imagine.
Even today, how hard is it to break out social conditions
How would it have been a thousand years ago
Some people knew that Ranajujar had built a major struggle against the state of caste, the feeling of the bitternesses in society, the higher and poor, the destructive.
Whom the society considered not to be destructive, slapped him and made him through his actions.
And thousands of years ago he led him to the entering of his house, and successfully went into the temple.
The Indian state is to release a postal head to celebrate the memory of the pious Ramanujacharya on May 1.
I bow down to the princes of purity, and see my faithful flowers.
My neighbours, there is another significance in May 1.
In many parts of the world, labourers pursue it as a day.
While working people speak day, there is talk of labour and workers, and I naturally remember Baba Saheb Ambedagar.
Today we are thankful to Baba Saheb for the privileges and respects of the workers.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is unable to forget.
While we spoke about Baba Saheb today, there was a chance to recall the great pious and social reformist Jagatguru Pasaveswar of Karnataka, who lived in the 12th century.
There was also a possibility of the release of his phones.
In the 12th century, he published deep comments on working and working people in Kannada.
In Kannada, he said, 'Kaya Kave Kailas,' that means that you can only reach the handicraft of Lord Shiva through work, that is, only because of the action.
While speaking about the labourers, it is natural to think of them.
My loved countrymen, we have spent a few days to celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha all over the world are happy to celebrate it as a function.
When the world sees violence, war, destruction and armed conflict, the opinions of Lord Buddha are very appropriate.
Buddhism is the best example of breaking the life of Ashoka in India.
This great day of Buddhism is celebrated by the United Nations on Thursday.
This year, the festival will take place in Sri Lanka.
On this sacred day, I am hungry to dedicate my brilliant flowers to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Especially for our neighbouring countries.
We must be close to foreign countries, and we think they should go forward.
There are many potential.
On May 5, India is paying for South Asian artificial application.
Due to its artificial potential and facilities, there will be substantial support for economic and development processes in South Asia.
This is an excellent example for our endeavour to South Asia.
On every corner of the country, many families have joined the preparations for their children's choice.
Today, on March 26.
Rabindranath Tagore and his memories are very proud of the wealth we all celebrate.
In 1919, the Jalianwala Bagh massacre was slaughtered and at that time, Rabindranath Tagore was one of the mamaidens who gave their voices against the massacre.
The massacre had a deep impact on a Palestinian mind, a twelve-year-old boy.
Three days before this day, on March 23, the British snatched Bhagat lion and his companions Sukdev and Rajguru.
When this tragic incident took place on March 23, the brother-in-laws like Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru had joy in the faces of the Indian mother, and there was no fear of death.
They sacrificed all dreams of life for the release of the Mother of India.
All of them are still sympathetic to all of us.
We cannot reverse the ears of Bhagsingh, Sukdev and Rajguru.
The entire British empire was supposed to see the three.
They were locked in jail, the execution was confirmed, but the British were worried about how to treat them.
Many years ago, when I had the chance to go there for the first time, I could feel a kind of shock on that soil.
Whenever you have the chance, then go to Punjab, I request the youth of the country to go to the place where the monuments of Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, Rajguru, Bhagadsingh's mother and Badukeshwar Dutt.
It was a period of free race and its intensity.
On the one hand, soldiers like Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru were urging the youth to take up the armed revolution.
About 100 years ago, in April 1917, Gandhians took Champaran chapter.
This is the centenary of Champaran Satigraha.
The expression of Gandhian thoughts and methods of Gandhians in India's freedom struggle was emerged in Champaran for the first time.
This was a turning point in the freedom struggle, particularly from the point of view of the methods of struggle.
It was the beginning of a profound impact on Gandhian thoughts and methods in Champaran Satigraham, Cata Satigraham and Million workers' strike in Ahmedabad.
In 1915, Gandhians returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave a new instruction to the country.
Today we cannot estimate Champaran Satigraha with the idea of Gandhians in our minds.
Just imagine, one who returned to India in 1915, experienced only two and a half years...
Through Champaran Satigraha, he revealed a marvellous significance of Gandhian integration, the ability to know the nervousness of the Indian society, the ability to provoke the people who are very poor and uneducated to the British and to bring them to the struggle.
We can learn from everyone how to start public life and how to work and how Gandhians worked.
During that period, Gandhians served to go to the village, including great leaders like Rajendra Babu and Acharya Krupalani.
He learnt how to join the masses and join their works with the freedom struggle.
Today we are traveling in the 21st century, who does not want to change India in today's time, does not any Indian want to participate in the country's transformation
Their attempt to transform this game of 125 crore nations, which will be a strong foundation for the creation of a new India.
New India is not a government plan.
New India is 125 crore people's chamber.
This is the feeling that a new India should be formed together with 125 crore people.
This is a desire, a joy, a comfort, a thirst in the hearts of 125 crore people of the country.
Peacefully, they are engaged in such work as those who don't dwell.
Many people go to the hospital every day and help the patients.
As soon as he asked for the news, there are many who go to Ooty and donate blood.
Whosoever walks in the shovel, there are also many that perform good works to feed them.
Our land is a country with many priceless fertilizers.
People's service is called Macheson's service, which is everything in our nervous system.
If we see this entirely, it is integrated, how immensely powerful it is.
When we speak about the new India, criticisms of this opinion are natural, which can be accepted in public opinion.
But if 125 crore countrymen are confirmed, if they finish their ways, they start slaughtering one after another, the dream of the 125 crore countrymen of the new India's slaughter will begin to flourish when we are watching.
It is not necessary that all matters should be discussed in the budget plan, whether government plans are to be spent on government money.
That is, I want to say that every citizen of the country should take his own obligations as a citizen and recognise the responsibility.
Why shouldn't we take this journey, which we have enabled to stabilise autonomy, with order and mentality
I'm calling you to come to participate in this trip.
I would like to tell you my thanks today, O people of the land.
Over the past few months, the largest number of people in our country have been involved in the movement of digital money laundering.
After the withdrawal of currency, there are many improvements in digital payments.
As we started the Bim Secretary for 2-3 months, so far only one hundred crore people have paid it.
We must proceed in the war against my loved countrymen, black money and corruption.
Can 125 crore nationals enjoy this year's twelve million crores of digital edifice
To enforce this, we can pay the school installation digitally, we can take the passenger fare for traveling in Rhille or Airways in digital forms, buy medicines in digital forms, if we run cheap foods shops, we can take methods for digital payers.
In the past, a number of events were organized for the digital concentrates for the people's awareness.
It was promised to do 100 events all over the country.
80-85 events have been completed.
70,000 businessmen won their honours.
Everyone will not be determined to move this task further.
There is also a big clutches.
I hope we will be aware of the image secretary, even as it is possible for the days of the birthday of Baba Saheb Ambadger.
We must take part in reducing the use of rocks.
You, nations of Nazareth, have you given me multitude of suggestions, every time I ask you to give you counsels for the voice of the mind.
But in your suggestions, I can see that you've always put a lot of pressure on cleanliness.
This river is passing through Rispana bridge, it runs near my house.
We went to the territory against the destruction of the river and tried to make people aware of walking, but it did not make any use.
I ask you that you have sent a group from your supplies, and that it should be awaited by the newspapers.
Brothers, see how much pain is in the mind of a student studying 11th class.
I see it as a good sign.
Since the movement of cleanliness has started, it has also been awakening.
Everyone has been involved in it.
This has developed as a public movement.
The hate against uncleanness is increasing.
The significance of awakening and becoming a positive part of the movement is certainly important.
The work must be done, though it's hard.
I am very sympathetic that this sentiment, created by the country's new generations, boys, students and youth, shows a better sign.
Today, in the voice of my mind, all of you are asking for the opinion of the wounded, one thing I want to tell them - the information given by the wounder must be given to all of us.
From the very beginning of the sound program of the mind, people of Pasamica, there are many suggestions of me to dispose of food.
We also know that when we eat at home and in public events, we are eating more than necessary food in our layers.
Have we ever seen how much harm is done by the remnant that we leave
If we don't relieve the mice, do you think how poor it will be helpful to feed
But the oppression of this matter is a major treacherous act of resistance to society.
This is an injustice to the poor.
On the other hand, if we don't lose food, the family will be economically benefited.
This is a good thing when socially imagined, whenever it is a family aimed, this is a useful thing.
I want to be more aware of this.
I know some youths who have created a mobile secretary and are conducting the movement:
If any food remains, they will be informed and they will collect the remaining food and share it to the needy.
This method of proper use of food is being done by our young people.
You can meet such people anywhere in every state of India.
Look at these ways to show changes.
They will always say that those who are aware of physical health, slightly less in leaf and slightly less in stomach.
World Health Day on 7th April.
Within 2030, the United Nations has set a target of health care for all.
A study says that more than 35 crore people worldwide are suffering from tension.
Speak to the brethren, and to the brothers and sisters, and to the teachers, and speak to them as you are in.
Do you think of why they're doing that
Surely you understand that they are in the first lesson of stress.
Mentions stress, mental and physical diseases.
Just as diabetes gives a comfort to all kinds of diseases, stress and stress enforces all our capabilities as a ability to fight against the harsh environment, its political ability and decisive energy.
If you can't speak openly to those who are dependents, lay in public work with service at some place near you.
Please serve, take part in their luxury, and see your own slumber with your eyes.
And if you try to understand the travail of others, and do that work with service, then you shall incline a self-confidence among you.
By confessing to others, you can easily drive down the burden of your mind to the service of others.
Likewise Yoga is a good way to keep your mind healthy.
Start your efforts from now on.
Please ensure that millions of people are socially involved in yoga.
If there is any advice in your mind about the third International Yoga Day, then you must send your advice to me through the mobile secretary, and guide.
You can create songs and works related to yoga, so that people's greetings can be increased.
I want to talk to parents about one thing today and we have spoken of many things about health today.
In the past, the government has taken a major decision.
The number of women working in our country is increasing day by day, their contribution is increasing, it is a welcome matter.
My loved countrymen, Rama Navami, on 5th April, Mahavir Jayanti on 9th April, Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April and his birthday.
Let the life of these great men come to us, and give us joy, and give us comfort to wear new India.
After the spring, the crops began to grow, if they were to get the benefit of farmers' labour.
In many corners of our land they celebrate this uttermost part in the altar.
Live my new year for all of you.
Snowfall is now missing.
The spring is recording its attendance in our lives.
After the yield, new drops of trees are beginning to flourish, flowers grow, jungles and gardens are blooming green.
Not only the flowers, but also the sweets are sweet in the audience's thread.
The spinal cords of Mangoni, the summer drizzle, have started to appear in the spring.
Thousands of yellow flowers of mustard in the fields give confidence to the farmers.
The flowers of the flowers call for the Holip Festival.
Ameer Kusru has described these moments of weather change as very tasty.
The fields pour out roots of mustard crops, the marbles grow, the flowers flow, the caterpillars blossom, and the caterpillars blossom, and the environment shall be comfortable when it blossoms in natural domes, and man also faints the surrounding.
The Vasantha Panchami, Mahasivaratri and Holip Festival are flowing in the life of man.
In the atmosphere of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are ready to fulfil the month of Bhagani and we are ready to welcome the new Chaitan month.
Winter time added to these two months.
I thank my thanks to the nations of a thousand, to send me many counsels, and help me, when I will hear your counsels before the voice of the heart.
My thanks to all of you who participated in Narender Modi's secretary, in the duwire, in Pesbuk, through letters.
Shoba Jalain told the secretary of Narendra Modi that he did not know about the achievements of the ISRO to a number of public.
He further asks you to provide information about 104 artificial lectures and interruption missiles.
Shobazi, thank you for remembering the pride of India.
Our scientists have banned India from the world stage.
We all know that Israel has succeeded in pursuing many wonderful achievements over the past few years.
ISR has been delivering a new world record in the space sector a few days ago, after the victory of Malaysian as a plan to travel to Tuesday's planet.
In India, together, 104 satellites of many countries have been successfully applied.
This is a great historical record not only for Israel but for the whole of India.
Israel's low-cost space program is one of the surprises worldwide, admiring the success of Indian scientists all over the world.
Brothers, one of these 104 artificialities is very important - cartosad 2-D-This will be a defence of India's artificiality, its films, mineral resources to identify, construction, development assessment and plans for urban weight.
In particular, our new artificial cartosad 2D will be a defamation to my peasant brothers, to know all the things about how to use them and take care of them.
As soon as we have passed, our artificiality has sent some films.
It has started working.
It is a matter of great happiness that all these operations have been led by our young social scientists and our female scientists.
The most pride of Israel's victory is the role of young scientists and female scientists.
I'm telling all the scientists of Israel my favourite appreciations on the countrymen of your country.
For the public, your purpose, which has been working in the mind of the country's work, is to continue to continue as it is today, you are making many new achievements every day.
Whatever applauds our scientists and their all-party committee, it is declining all of them.
India has successfully tested a missile that prevents the denunciation of the defence sector.
This is the largest achievement in the defence sector.
You will be more happy that this technology is only with the world's fourteen countries.
Indian scientists have achieved this.
Though there is a missile influencing India from far and wide, our missile is very powerful to destruct it in this application.
When we see new technology, we see a new scientific achievement, our people are happy.
In Bruhamanda, man's mind has been trying to understand the rules of the invasion.
New science and new technology are born from this.
Each technology has created a new age as a new science.
While speaking about the hard work of science and scientists, I have often expressed the voice of mind that our younger generations should be attracted to science.
Many scientists need the country.
Today's scientists are now a factor of a stable change in the life of generations that emerge in the era.
No science has emerged from the heaven in full.
According to Gandhians, all the science achievements are lost in experience.
The great sinner told us that we should be praised by our neo-scientists' thirst, hatred and sacrifice.
The science must necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily make the principles accurate, what means to do, what kind of technology to do, when it can become an important part of the simple humanity.
In the past, Niti Ayo and India's foreign sector 14th foreign Indians had organized a very individual competition every day.
In Mumbai, in 2005, the massive rains took place, flooded, sea and sea sighted a lot of shocks.
If there is any natural place, it will first stop the doors of the poor house.
Both of them decided to find a solution, they had a long time to save such confusions, and improved a home to protect the householders from floods and prevent diseases of water.
I could see many such discoveries.
I say that many people are giving this kind of contribution to the country.
Our society is also becoming a society that is based on technology.
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
Digitan has been given greater importance in the past.
Gradually, the people are turning out to rock sympathy and moving forward towards digital inflation.
Digital inflation is growing rapidly in India.
In particular, younger communities are floating on their cell phones in digital forms.
I see this as a good sign.
In our country, Lakki rahag Johna has received a lot of welcome in the past, the most excellent consumption plan, design business plans and design business plans.
In the last two months, 15,000 people have received a thousand rupees per day.
Through these two programs, it is known that digitalisation in India is being transformed into a mass movement, and the entire country has brought it to darkness.
So far, according to the design plan, 10 lakh people have received a lot of money, more than 50,000 businessmen have received a lot of money, and more than a hundred crores of rupees have been provided to those who have been involved in the plans.
According to the plan, more than a hundred businessmen have received a million sum of money.
More than 4,000 businessmen have received a lot of Rs 50,000.
The peasants, businessmen, small technicians, industrialists, homeless people, students, have joined themselves with great enthusiasm and benefited from this.
When I saw this, it was found that not only young people, but also older people, who were 15 years old, and also older civilians of 65-70.
From Mysore, Santosh expressed his happiness in the secretary of Narendra Modi, saying he received 1000 rupees through the most excellent taxpayer's plan (Lucky Grahak Jojna).
But I want to share with you the most important thing he wrote.
Rejoice, they, your name and your work give joy to all of us.
You're telling the work of giving great enthusiasm.
Sabir, a 22-year-old car driver from Delhi, has begun to use digital surveillance in his business after the devaluation of money and has received a reward of one lakh rupees for the government's extraordinary taxpayer's plan.
Even though he is driving today, he has become a diplomat of the project.
He shares information about the digital money laundering with all the passengers traveling in his car.
He is encouraging others to sympatheticly reflect his affairs.
Pooja Nemade, a young friend from the state of Maharashtra, is a student who is studying the elderly, who shares his experiences with his friends about how he uses Rupee cards and e-walls.
Come to the leadership of this movement.
You must take this forward, in the war against corruption and black money, it has an important role.
All those who are involved in this work are new warriors against corruption in my eyes.
One way you're militia fighters.
On 14th April, there will be a lot of honours to be held.
More than 40-45 days left.
Can you do a job to recall Baba Saheb Ambedagar
A few days back, the 125th birthday of Baba Saheb Ambedkar passed away.
To sing his memories, you should learn to give at least 125 people to the BIM secretary.
And this time shall the day of the birth of Babasaheb Ambedgah be the work of the image, and the great significance.
I also want to mention that we should strengthen the base built by Baba Saheb.
You must ensure that you go home and join all of them and join the 125 crore people in the hands of the people of the country.
Due to the impact of the movement in the last two-three months, there has been an increase in many towns and villages in many cities.
People of Basami are peasants as part of our country's economic organisation.
The economic strength of the villages strengthens the economic growth of the country.
I want to share a happy approach today with you.
Our agricultural brothers are hard working and filling the storage.
This year, due to the labour of farmers in our country, there has been unprecedented consequences.
All indexs show that our agricultural brothers have snatched all the old achievements.
Seeing the masses, it appears every day as if we celebrate the festival of Pongalai and Paisaki.
This year, more than two and a half million tonnes have been received.
This is 8 percent more than the last achievement of our peasants.
As such, this is a wonderful achievement.
I specially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I also have another reason for thanking farmers - apart from their consequences of their traditional food, they have produced many kinds of pulses, because they have more proteins in pulses.
In the ears of foreign peasants, the creepers have fallen, they have produced many types of pulses in about two hundred and nine hundred hectares of land.
This is not just a product of pulses, but a massive service that farmers have committed to my country's poor.
I'm devoting my gratitude to the peasant brothers of the country, who have earned a lot of pulses in Mahsul, listening to a request from me.
People of love are traveling everybody through our country, through the government, through society, through organizations, through movements, towards cleanliness.
Everyone is acting as somehow aware of cleanliness.
The government is engaged in uninterrupted efforts.
In the past, under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State for Drinking Water and Health, the event for senior officials of 23 state governments took place in Telangana.
This conception does not take place within the closed rooms of the Telugu state, what the importance of the cleaning services at the bottom is to be implemented.
On February 17-18, the training was initiated in Hyderabad to depress toilets.
Officials have defiled the six-house toilet tubes, purified and removed the tubes of two tissues and how they could be used again.
How comfortable the umbrella to use this new table, they showed that there was no discord, no problem, no obstacle, no psychological obstacle, no barrier.
As usually we clean up, we can clean the toilet tubes as well.
To a family with 6 members, an average duplicate leaflet will be filled up for nearly 5 years.
After this, it can be easily removed from the toilets and turned back to the second hat.
How many things are published in it, so much is beneficial.
Even in the state, various sectors are often organising meetings of cleaning for two weeks of cleaning.
In the first meeting to be held in March, the Ministry of Women and Children of Membat and the Tribals have joined the Membatto Ministry to strengthen the cleaning system.
In the second meeting of March, the Ministry of Shipping Transport, Water Resources, Six Membrane and the Ministry of Reviving the river Ganges are to move forward the cleaning movement for the last two weeks of March.
Even if any citizen in our country is engaged in a better job, the entire country feels a new energy and inspires self-esteem.
In Rio Baralimbics, we gave great welcome to the witnesses of our opposite sportsmen.
In the last lap of the T-20 World Cup for those who have been organised this month, India defeated Pakistan and became a world eventually for the second time, proud of the country.
I once again express my appreciations to all the soldiers of the UN.
The achievements of our alternative friends in the country give us great importance.
I have always been contemplating that our brothers, who are very capable of replacement, are mentally retarded, regrettable.
Every moment we have to learn from them.
Though the matter is based on the field of sports, the space scientific, the women of our country are not crushing anyone.
They are moving forward as a sympathetic and are illuminating the country's reputation through their achievements.
In the last few days, the Asian Rakbi Sevens has won the silver silver summit of our women's homemakers.
My appreciations for all these surveillances.
On March 8, world women are celebrated daily.
In India, women must give importance to children, and should increase awareness and understanding in family and society.
Today it has not stopped merely as a state plan.
It has served as a social understanding and a movement called education for everyone.
In the last year, this program has added to public society, recalled this important thing on every corner of the country, which has changed the mindset of the people over the old habitations that have followed for decades.
When the ear falls, there is a lot of happiness in the minds of the woman's child.
In a way, the opposite view of women's children is due to social adjustment.
I have heard that Bala Vivaham has been stopped because of a special movement in Tamil Nadu district.
So far, more than 175 civilians have been prevented.
According to the district administration's wealth savings (Suganya Samruti) program, banks have begun in the name of more than 55-60 thousand women children.
According to the uniting model of Convergence Model, Jammu and Kashmir's Bandwa district, all the departments are involved in women's childhood, women's children's teaching programmes, together with village councils, and efforts are being made by the district administration to defy and ensure their education.
According to the plan to shut down every household door in Madhya Pradesh, a movement is being organized for the education of women's children in every household.
The movement is being carried out in the state of Rajasthan to resume our children, our school, our school, and the women who have stopped school education in less than half.
I'm saying that the movement to keep women's children safe and to keep women's children alive is facing different shapes.
This entire movement has also become a public movement.
It is mixed up with new imagination.
This is being changed according to regional needs.
I think this is a good sign.
While women celebrate every day on 8th March, we must be together with a consensus, 'the powerful women, our Indian women, they are not much in strength, they are not less, they are all equal to the synonym,' the people of the fond country, in the voice of mind, sometimes, you all have the chance to talk about something.
You've come together with it complicatedly.
I have a lot of things to learn from you.
All the feelings and feelings of the world's work, the condition of the villages and the heart of the poor are coming to me.
Man's voice, August 2019
Our ancestors have established the system of weather cycle, economic cycle and social life, in any situation, that there should never be a condition in society.
In the last few days, we celebrated many celebrations.
Even after thousands of years, every concentration is filling the new power with a new enthusiasm...
Sometimes he picked up the mountain, sometimes worked to remove the food leaf, i.e., we can feel a new one in every activity of his.
That's why when I speak to you today, my child goes away with two Mohns.
One is Mohen, who touches Sudarshan's wheel, and the other is Mohen.
And Mohn, who touched the side of the Sudarshan chamber, fled to the banks of the Yamuna, and went to the seashores of Gujarat, and dwelt in the city of Dwarkah: but Mohno, born on the coasts of the sea, came to the coasts of the Yamuna, and left his last breath in Delhi.
Mohn, who holds Sudarshan's chamber, used his intelligence, his obligations, his obligations, his own obligations, even thousands of years before, to avoid the war, and to live without conflict.
At the same time, Markan-backed Mohno gave a new form to the freedom struggle, which would have to gain the country's independence, to protect human sins and to enable the fundamentals of rule.
What is the significance of the unhealthy service, what is the significance of wisdom, what is the significance of moving forward in the midst of all the good things of life, that we can learn from the life of Lord Sri Christ.
Today, when we are speaking about the festivals, India is engaged in a big deal:
Not only India, but the whole world is speaking about it.
I am speaking about the 150th birthday of Gandhians, my loved countrymen.
On October 2, 1869, in the battlefield on the sea coast, today we have born a war, not an individual, in a small home called Kirti Mantra.
This is what gave a new turn to the entire human history and created a new achievement.
And there was always a thing connected with Gandhians, in one way it merged as a permanent part of his life, which was the obligation of service, service and service.
If we see all his life, he has engaged himself in the service of the people of the people who are suffering from diversity in South Africa, and that day it is not a small thing.
He served for the oppressed farmers in Champaran area.
If anybody is required to help, he will be helpful to serve anytime.
He not only strengthened the service, but also strengthened the supremacy associated with service.
But along with this, the experience of sensible joy and enjoyment of survival is also sufficient within the service.
We can clearly understand this through his life.
Gandhians, individuals, social and humans are all.
He has always been insistent on social unity, in a variety of characteristics in all areas, whether it is Africa's Finnics or Talsty's piece, or whether it is a Charmiti's assimilation or a vernacular.
I am very sure that I have gone to many important places related to him, and there I have received my sin offerings.
While it comes to social, there is a power to do so, in the event of Gandhi 150, everything must be social expression and service.
What the mind feels - it must be a good choice, a good aim, a good aim, a service with full devotional sense, aimed at enjoying uninterrupted happiness.
I went to Tandy in Gujarat a few months ago, my people of the country.
Tandi, the name of salt satigraha in the freedom struggle, was a very silky pillar.
I opened the most beautiful museum dedicated to the oil in Tandi.
I ask you all, that you shall go to any place related to the same Gandhians.
Several events, competitions and museums have been planned in the coming days.
But in this context, I want to share a very interesting thing with you.
This time, in the Venice Biennale, there are many interesting scenes filled with Gandhian memories in the Indian scene.
The area of Haripura is interesting.
During the Gujarat's Haripura Congress conference, you may remember that Subhas Chandra Bose was elected president in history.
There is a very beautiful past in these art areas.
Earlier in 1937-38, before the Haripura conference of the Congress, Nanandal Phos, the then chairman of Channiketan's Kala Bhavan, had called.
Gandhians want to be viewed through the lifestyle of the people living in India, and the artistic congress must be monitored.
The same Nandla Boss is enjoying the beauty of our constitutional law.
Nandlal Bose surrounded the villages of Haripura and painted a lot of rural life.
There were serious discussions in Venice about this priceless work.
Once again, I expect every Indian to take a certain commitment with the goodwill of Gandhians on 150th birthday.
For the country, for the society, something must be done for a good thing.
This is the best, genuine activity that we can do to the oils can be brilliant, humiliated.
All of you may remember that for the last few years, we have been conducting a clean service movement for two weeks before October 2.
This time it will start on September 11.
Encouraging this movement to all sections of society.
All my business brothers and sisters have touched an announcement in their markets, and the clients have written that they should come out of the house with a cloth.
This will result in money and mirror, and our contribution to the safety of the environment.
This time, on October 2, when we celebrate the 150th birthday of the oil, the occasion must be the basis for a new mass movement against neighbourhood, while dedicating to India, which is free from open defecation habitation.
I appeal to all sections of the community, every village, small and urban residents, and ask for a supplication, this year, we must celebrate Gandhi Jayanti's empathy in a way to liberate this Indian mother from the eastern epoch.
I would also appeal to private corporations, that you must come forward to get rid of these things, after all these poor things have been damaged.
They can be refunded.
They can produce fuel.
But there was a lot before.
Today I want to touch a more important thing than a cultural language.
Even today, how important is it, even though it is written many centuries ago
The pearls are called stones.
In our culture, food has been given great importance.
We also scientificized the information about food as much as possible.
We need a balanced and nutritious diet, especially for women and children, because they are the future hospitals of our society.
The nutrition movement, i.e., under the nutritional movement, has become a public movement to provide nutrition in modern methods throughout the country.
People are fighting against nutrition deficit in new and interesting ways.
Once a thing was brought to my attention.
There was a big movement called rice in Nasik.
Anganwadi brothers gather a handful of cereals from the people in the morning.
These grains are useful for hot food prepared for children and women.
This ritual is done for the first time when the child is starting to feed.
Not liquid diet, simple diet.
This is a very simple attempt to enable it to be implemented everywhere.
In many states, people are conducting a movement called Didi Poजन.
Whether it is a birthday in the family or a supreme day, or a day of memories, the family goes to Anganwadi, preparing nutritious food, and goes to school, where all the family members comfort themselves, feed the children.
They share their joy, and it will not be reduced when they are happy.
The feeling of enjoyment with service is mixed with a unique union.
Friends, we can pursue a strong war against nutritional deficit in our country through many such small things.
Today, due to lack of awareness, the poor and the poor, the sufficient, both of them are suffering from this.
We will celebrate the month of September as a nutritional movement throughout the country.
You must add it to you, get information, join new ideas in it.
If you bring one or two persons out of malnutrition deficit, we can bring our country out of malnutrition.
This time, when I was counting for the voice of the mind, I had a lot of confidence that questions would be asked about this matter.
And for the last few weeks, when I went anywhere, when I met the people, Man Vs Wild was spoken.
I didn't even think I could get such a chance to get a place in the minds of the world-class youth.
Last week I went to Bhutan.
As prime minister, whenever I have a chance to go, however the situation has become due to international sympathy, they start asking me about a 5-6-minute yoga, even if they go to anyone in the world.
Until now, I have been told that I am not the leader of the discretionary world, which has been my experience all over the world.
But now it is getting a new experience.
Whenever I meet, whenever there is a sufficient chance, they talk about things related to wild animals, they are engaged in environmental discussions.
About 165 countries have a program of broadcasting in their language.
But one more interesting thing, some people talk to me about something simply, Modiji, you speak in Hindi, how could you speak so fast when you don't know the Hindi language for Bear Grills
Is this subsequently subscribed
Look, there's no secret in it.
The reality is that negotiations with Bear Grills were fully used.
After this incident, a large number of people have started discussions with me about the Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also go to places connected with natural and wild animals.
I have already said, I repeat it now... in your life you must go to the northeastern states.
Your life is big.
Your thoughts are great.
I had the fate of publishing the number of wildlife in the last month.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
The number of LTTE in India is 2967.
A few years ago, half of this was their number.
The LTTE summit took place in Russia's St. Petersburgh city in 2010.
It was concerned about the declining number of LTTE in the world and was finally confirmed.
This is the determination that the LTTE's number in the world is to be wiped out by 2022.
But this is the new India, and we are simultaneously targeting targets, and we have cut off the LTTE's number in 2019.
India has increased not only the number of LTTE but also the number of protected areas and social defence.
When I published the figures of the LTTE, the recall of the lions in Gujarat's Keer jungles.
I have been responsible for the chief minister there, while the lions' habitations were decreasing in the jungles.
Their numbers were also declining.
We moved one after another in the Gir forests.
In 2007, we decided to take care of women's guards.
We have been building up to increase tourism.
We only talk about maintenance when we talk about natural and wild animals.
Hence, we need to create a proper environment to protect our forests, vegetations, wild animals and animals, especially on the day.
And who can forget their historical speech on September 11, 1893, the countrymen, Vietnander.
The youngest saint of the Indian country, raised from sleeping human society around the world, has left a vision of India in the world.
The slavery of India, which the world saw, changed the country's vision by listening to the words of Swami Vivekananandar on September 11, 1893.
Come on, Swami Vivekananandar, who saw the shape of India, Swami Vivekananandar, who saw the power of India, we will try to save it.
It is within us, everything is, we will proceed with self-esteem.
We are my loved countrymen, on August 29, we celebrate national sports day.
The most interesting movement will be for all children, elders, youths and women, which will be yours.
But I'm not going to say anything about their mild things today.
I want to make a sense of sex in your mind, for India, for our country, we will resolve some goals together.
I hope we will be able to get rid of the negative objects, enjoy ourselves out of homes, homes, and in every place, and in the social network, we will snatch it.
Thank you very much.
My people of the land, lend to all yourselves.
We celebrated our Republic on January 26, with joy and joy all over the country's shore.
The Constitution of India, in the form of an attempt to pursue the obligations, powers and publicity of the citizens, is a cultural festival, and now awaits the democratic responsibilities of the generations.
But in our country, however, the wide and deeper rhetoric of citizens' obligations and rights is still not going on.
On January 30, our drunkenness was lost.
On January 30, at 11 a.m., we all supplied a two-minute pledge and would give our memories to the survivors of the country.
In the form of a society, or as a country, it must be natural for us to pay a mute ring at 11 a.m. on January 30.
It is just two minutes, but there is sociality, compassion and expression of our concern over the sacrifices.
We have expressed natural respect for our country's military and security forces.
I am conveying my greetings to the soldiers and their relatives who have been covered with various tensions for those who have been supplied this Republican programme.
These tensions include Girthi Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva tension and Vishisht Seva tension.
I'm particularly asking young people, you can do a job as you are working on the social bases.
And this time, seek two good words on the website, and share them with your friends, concerning all the soldiers that are Gaured.
And when we know deeply the secrets of the soldiers, and the virtue, and the iniquity, we shall be astonished, and great and joyful.
While we have experienced great enthusiasm and enjoyment on January 26, on the other hand, some of our soldiers in our country's security in Kashmir have died because of snowfall.
I supplicate to all the soldiers who have lived in it to see my respected jewels.
My young friends, you all know that I am constantly shouting the voice of the mind.
In January, February, March and April, these four months have been for every family for weekend months.
Even if a child has a choice at home, the entire family is buried in the burden of the choices.
I always feel that it should come out of this situation, so I want to speak to my young friends in detail.
I want to ask you how to make such an environment happy.
"I know that this question is in your minds, though Christie has asked for this question.
The choices must be a happy occasion.
Most of them have a time of experimental pressure.
You must decide whether you consider it as a rejoicing time or whether you feel pressured time.
All of whom are considered to be a stressful time, they are regretting - please for preserve.
Therefore, I think the election time is a concentration, that you should take as a festival.
Whenever it comes to festivity and concentration, the characteristics within us are emerged.
The entire family must act as a group and encouraging its participation in winning this election.
There'll be changes when you're watching.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kach to Kamrupam, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, this is the only choice in 3-4 months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to suppress their traditions in their own ways and transform it into a three-four-month-old familiar environment.
If you said that you were happy, you would feel relieved if you were with the bright face, and in this case many years old things will also start to flourish in your memories.
A year ago, what the teacher said in the classroom is very sure to be sure of your mind.
Sindhna's power will cease, and it will start dreaming of a burden.
And I understand this, and say, If there is a sorrow, we forget things, and if we were faithful, we cannot even imagine how many things will come in the mind suddenly.
You don't have information and information, but you don't work hard.
But when pressure comes, your knowledge, your knowledge, and all your knowledge, shall be ruined, and the pressure shall ride on you.
That's why I would say that he is a fantastic mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet, that he would open for more values.
I have sometimes seen that we don't see the choices properly.
This is not a conversation for your life.
There is no choice for how you lived your life, how you live and how you think you live.
J.
Abdul Kalam is a big example of observation for us.
He went to the air force and failed.
The values have become more important.
Because of this, the potency has increased and the pressure on the students' minds has increased.
In this case, I want to know your views on the temporary course of education and its future.
And if you believe in these things, the princes shall be suppressed behind you, as the window.
Tonight, it is necessary to know where I have reached.
I took this pretext because it would immediately respond to the sports world.
Most of the successes take place in their lives because of players' rivalry.
You'll take their lives only by the shirt
For 20 years, he has been suppressing many achievements and has achieved a new achievement by discovering his previous achievements every time.
His life journey is very strange, because he has pursued a way to challenge himself by releasing his rivalry to others.
Friends, you must write a choice in every field of life, when you can read for two hours, can you read for three hours
How long you decided to get up early in the morning, it may have been late, but can you get up at the scheduled time
Therefore I ask you, saying, This is he that competes with others, and make you challenges.
It should be noted how my activity was earlier, how I am ahead and how to do better.
With this perspective, you can cure the change in you by approaching.
S.
Sundar, they're absolutely right to tell you.
Even today, if you see that those who ask questions to me, you may have noticed that there is more women's number in it.
It is known that when mothers are aware of the future of children in homes, they are simply making many things easier.
And you shall act as a guide, according to the power that is with you, and as many works as you do, spend time.
Once you accept, most of your problems will come to an end.
The expectations of parents and teachers are their concerns.
That is how to accept it is the way to solve the problems.
The expectations make the road even more difficult.
You'll enjoy weight.
One way we go to see the patient and create a fear of the disease.
I would like to tell parents that we are also sometimes making such a fear to our children.
Do you ever feel like creating a joyful environment in the election days
Make such a situation, you see that the environment is completely changed.
I got a surprise call.
He doesn't want to mention his name.
If you ask why he doesn't want to mention his name.
'Well, the prime minister, they don't want to mention my name because I have done something in my childhood.
Once there is a preservation habit, the thirst that learns in life will end.
A phone call came: 'He is the prime minister, my name Monica... if I read in the 12th class, I want to ask you two questions about my choices.
The general opinion is that if students pay attention to sports, there will be deficit in education.
This is the fundamental idea of the wrong and the problem.
If you say that there is a complete growth, there is also a life of singing singing, which is very large.
This is the right time to live and learn that life.
Well, if it's for five minutes, surely stay quiet.
You can feel that your job is not irritable.
I don't know if everyone likes it, but this is my experience.
When I speak in the clouds during the election, sometimes my voice will refuse to cooperate.
Once a national singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long you're sleeping.
Till now, he did not even think of my sleep, my speech and my voice, but he gave me basic treatment.
If we understand the significance of such fundamental matters, we will have many advantages.
Neither shall your family provoke me to anger, neither shall you provoke me.
On the day your girl's coming, if you don't see, I'll see her eyes.
Please don't do that.
It is very close to keeping mind, intelligence and body active.
Well, young guys, if you're engaged in organizing your choices, I'm speaking something... perhaps I hope to give you relief to what I said today.
But I ask you not to seriously consider what I said.
Please do it if possible, or not.
Remember the determination that you have done, and trust in you, and go to the election, and live for me to all you.
And before you face every challenge, turn it into a shadow.
Then there will be no challenge, challenge.
Adopt this mantra in mind, proceed.
Well, the countrymen, on February 1, 2017, the 40-year period of Indian Coast Guard personnel is over.
During this period, I seek thanks for the immemorial of the coast guards and soldiers for their country.
It is a matter of pride to us that our sea coast guard with 126 ships and 62 aircraft is 4 of the world's 4 largest coastal guards.
The magic of the coastal guard is Vya Raksham.
With their point of view, the beach guards are waking up at night in poor conditions in the country's coastal areas and seas.
Many don't know that not only men in our country's coast guards, women also stand together with their shoulders and successfully drive their obligations.
Our women officers of the coastal guard, who are a pilot or supervisor, are being directed by Howard Graph.
As the coastal detention is today's world's largest thing, I am telling the Indian coast guards that are engaged in India's coastal defence, their 40th year is closely blissful.
Panchami Saraswati, a resident of our country, is a big festival for worship.
This is regarded as an opportunity to enjoy education.
Not only that, it is a time to encourage the soldiers.
Mera Rang de Basandi Sola, make me fit for the spring. This is an idea of enlightenment.
I am telling my countrymen the best wishes to this sacred penance festival.
My favourite countrymen, in the voice of the mind, the sky and its creativity have always encompassed new colors in new verses.
For the last two months, they have finished my mind's voice in state languages.
This has received a lot of welcome.
I have the greatest chance to travel with you through the voice of mind.
Little life.
And the people of the land shall be drunk, and the days of Christ Jesus Christ shall be good for you all.
Today, we have decided to give importance to service, sacrifice and penance in our lives.
Many wealthy people came and gave one wealth.
In the end, a poor mother came and put two serpents of money.
We'll pay the sensitive rings to their birthday.
Two days ago, I had the goodwill of launching many development works in Malavia's grandfather Varanasi.
In Varanasi, at Banaras Hindu University, I placed the foundation for the supremacist religion Mohen Malavia cancer center.
This cancer center, established, will be a proliferation not only for eastern Uttar Pradesh, but also for people living in Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today, Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Mr. Pihari Vajpayee are also their birthday.
This country doesn't forget their contribution.
Under his leadership, we joined the country in the nuclear sector.
As a party leader and as a Member of Parliament, as a minister or prime minister, Adul has made him an example of his role.
Today's birthday, I tell him my poor dresses, and I assume God that he should give him special health.
As an employee, I have a great deal of working with them.
The memories of him are greener in front of my minds.
Today, the Christmas enjoyed the benefits of two plans for the nations.
If seen in one way, both of these could be the beginning of new plans.
We can see the zeal of knowing about how to do unprovoked business and how to buy unprovoked things throughout the country.
Everybody wants to learn the methods of this from others.
Similarly, the plan to encourage businessmen is the Digidan business plan, as Christmas sanctity on December 25, and 15,000 people will be purely prizes.
This plan is going to take place from today to 100 days.
Every day, 15,000 people will receive a range of thousand rupees per day.
Diggi's business plan is mainly for businessmen.
Businessmen's business will also have an unprecedented opportunity to sustain their resources.
This program was designed to focus all classes of society, especially poor and lower middle classes:
Those who buy goods from 50 rupees to 3000 rupees, they will get the result.
Those who buy more than 3000 rupees don't have this.
Even the shopping poor can buy goods using USSD, feature phones and simple phones, sell them, pay the amount, and all of them will be benefited from this program.
People in rural areas can sell or sell goods through AEPS and swallow the honours.
Today there are approximately 30 crore Rupay cards in India, with 20 crore cards of poor families and people's account holders.
This 30 crore people can immediately participate in this holy program.
I surely believe that the countrymen will take the country in this method, and will enjoy encouraging information from their neighbouring youth.
I am very happy to see awareness of my loved countrymen, how to use technology in the country, how to pay money electronically and how to pay the amount through the analysis.
For the past few days, unemployment business has increased from 200 to 300 percent.
The Indian government has taken a major decision to further advance this.
The traders are well aware of how big this decision is.
The businessmen who do the dealings in digital terms are paying income taxes to such businessmen instead of using rocks in their business.
I express my appreciation to all the states and the Union territories of the country.
Chandrababu Naidu, the first leader of Andhra Pradesh, formed a group headed by them, reviewing various plans.
At the same time, the governments are also initiating various plans in their own ways, and are undermining.
I have been told that Assam state government has declared that 10 percent of the tax payers will be paid in digital taxes for property taxes and commercial payments.
If the branches of rural banks take their 75 percent account holders from January to March, at least two digital regimes will be paid to 50,000 rupees from the state level.
In March 2017, the committee announced that 100 percent of digital wealth would be payable to the rural poor as the best famine for the Digi treasury.
Many organisations have been making successful operations to advance digital payments to rural poor farmers.
The interesting thing is that in comparison to GNFC sales this year, 27 percent of sales have increased.
At a place worth 100 rupees, 80 rupees and 50 rupees at a place worth 80 rupees, and they are drunk from the facilities of insurance and health.
But now the money is paid in a rocky way.
Our country is a majority country.
Technical is the art of our handing over.
A country like India must be in the forefront of all countries in this sector.
Our youth have seen considerable improvements through the startup.
This is a golden opportunity for the digital movement.
Our youth must add to the extent that this sector can be strengthened by bringing new ideas and buddhist techniques and modern methods.
At the same time, you must join the entire force with the movement that is free from black money and corruption.
And it is lawful for you, O people of my sins, to seek your counsels, and to show your opinions every month before the voice of the mind.
Accordingly, tens of thousands of letters MyGov and the narendramodeep have come into consultation, with 80-90 percent of these suggestions deal with corruption and black money disposal and currency withdrawal.
After seeing all this, I feel that it can be generally branded in three ways.
Some people have widely written about what is happening to the citizens because of the withdrawal of this currency.
In other ways, they have noted how the illusions of the new ways of setting up in many places and indispensable operations and indispensable activity are being carried out in such a pure task for such a particular job and country's welfare.
My landmasses, you have written to me all these letters, and have spoken of a prophet: for I have thanked it, and I have slain the people.
'This way that has been brought under the control of the money is appreciable.
Though it is true that citizens are suffering from all of us, we are all in the struggle against corruption, the cooperation that we give in this war gives us happiness.
We are fighting against corruption and black money, as soldiers are fighting for war.'
They are written by Gurumani Kewal, the sound of the people who revolve around every corner of the country.
These are the factors that make their true changes, agents of change.
I thank my favourite thanks to those who have been trying to put people in the wrong direction, not only on their own sufferings.
Against corruption and black money, efforts have been made in large quantity for the war, religious sympathy
Moreover, many used their works and buddenness in the field, and snatched the faces of the prophets, and revealed the truth.
When 125 crores of people in my country are connected to me, can there be something impossible
If there are fond of the foolish, is it not for Issan's blessing
I thank my people, and give them my vows, and the people are partakers with full enthusiasm in this greatness against corruption and black money.
I had expected a widespread discussion on the funds provided to political parties for the war against corruption and black money in parliament.
If there were discussions, it would have been a discussion.
It is absolutely wrong to say that all those who insist on the political parties have been removed from all ways.
They are spending their full care and time in looking for government cuts, all of whom cannot function openly for corruption and black money.
A question has also been raised why they are repeatedly changing the rules.
The government operates for the masses of the population.
The government is engaged in an attempt to keep listening to opinions from the public.
When they deal with new ideas, we also have to take new methods to break their evil intentions.
The war, which is being carried out in the form of Vidakh denounced Kodacondon, must be an end to corruption corporations and terrible practices and black money.
On the other hand, there are letters from many on what kind of terrible methods are being handled and how new methods are being used.
I have not seen the thanks of my heart to my loved nations this time.
To share such information, the government has primarily created an email address.
Apart from this, you can also send MYGov to the Internet.
The government has made a terrible confusion against all kinds of evils that you indicate.
When your cooperation is not over, it's very easy to fight.
The third type of letters are also in large numbers.
'Modi, don't wear, don't regret, don't make any serious efforts, take all that you want to do, but it's not so sad, but if you reverse your foot on the way to travel, there's no talk of repealing the hair at all.'
My loved countrymen, even though the voice of the mind last time, even among these places, our peasant comrades have tried hard and had the records of the past year's records of the seed.
This is a clear indication when we see from the point of view of agriculture.
The country's worker and peasant, the youngest, all of them's bitter efforts are reflecting the country.
A few days back, India has wrecked its name in a number of sectors in the world economy.
India has grown in the world class list through different indexs, as a result of the continued efforts of our capabilities.
India's standard has increased in the World Bank's report on unsaved business.
In the statement of the World Economic Organisation on global competitiveness, India has increased to 32 seats.
In the world-class activity index for 2016, we are leading 16 seats, 19 seats in the World Bank's Structure Services Acting Index for 2016.
Many other statements point to the same assessment, which India is growing rapidly.
My fascist countrymen, this time read the anger of the nations on the parliamentary meeting.
There is anger over parliamentary activity everywhere.
The Republican president and the Republican deputy chief publicly expressed their discontent.
But even in such circumstances, while some good things are going on, the mind is happy.
The country's attention has not returned to an excellent work in the midst of the parliament's arrows.
Brothers, the government's efforts have been drawn up in the minds of the point of replacement of the ability of the opponents, and I am happy and enormous to say that a bill related to it is now over.
I thank my members from the Lok Sabha and the States for fulfilling this, and I thank my thanks for the country's Kodanukodi transforming capabilities.
The government is in the interest of the opposite elites.
Individually, I also tried to enhance its speed to advance this objective.
My aim was to gain their rights and dignity for the opponents.
By winning 4 tensions in the Parlimpics, brothers who have been able to replace our efforts and trusts have strengthened.
They have not only given the honor of the nation through their successes, but have also made the people surprising in the sea through their ability.
Our viable brothers and sisters, like other citizens of the country, are our priceless assets and priceless energy.
After the law was upheld in the interest of the opponents of the opposite, it has increased employment for the replacement capabilities.
The allocation definition of state jobs has been increased by 4 percent.
Through this law, special arrangements have been made for changing capabilities, education, facilities and complaints.
In the last two years, 4350 camps have been carried out for replacement capabilities, and you can realise how much the government has been intelligent with the replacement capabilities since the equipment was provided to 5,80,000 transparent brothers at a cost of 352 crores.
A new law has been laid down by the United Nations sentiment.
In the first place, the alternative captains were branded at 7 positions, but now through the enforcement of the law, it is 21, with 14 new conditions adding to it.
They have got justice for the first time, with the addition of some types of alternative capabilities.
For example, Thalassemia, Parkinson's, we are connecting those who are affected and those who have a thick shape in the presence.
The Indian cricket team has switched a victory vote for 4 in the test match against the UK.
Some of these young men's laps are pleasant.
Our country's boy, Karun Nair, hit 3 percent.
KL Rahul took 199 runs.
Not only did Text Captain Virat Kohli speak well, he also gave a good leadership.
The Indian clicket export offspinner is a punchower R.
Aswin's name was declared the Cricketer of Year for the ICC 2016 and Best Test Cricketer.
My pleasures are sacrificed to all of them, many of my good wishes.
In the Hockey sector, after 15 years, there has been a very fine and special news.
Junior Hawki's team won the world's supremacy.
This achievement is a clear indication of the future of the Indian Hockey.
Our women's houses have been specially working last month.
If India's women win the Hockey Organisation Asian Cemetery, a few days back, India's female Hawky occupation won brave tension for 18-year-old people.
Like every year, during Diwali, I once again went to the Chinese border areas to celebrate Deepawali with the soldiers.
I celebrated Deepawali in the peaks of India with ITBP, Indian Tibetan border soldiers and soldiers.
I'm going every time, but the experience of this blessing is impossible.
Not only did the people send information, but they joined the mind:
One describes poems, others made films, others produced cartoons and others produced streets.
That is, every house is like soldiers' shelters.
When I saw letters, I said how much imagination is in the minds of the people, how many feelings are there:
And a soldier of the army wrote to me, and said unto me, The chief captains, all our soldiers, and all the plains, such as Deepavali, and Holi, shall be in the borders.
We spend every moment in the opinions of the country's security.
Yes, however, there is a feeling of home in the festival days.
But if you want to tell the truth, this time there is no such idea.
There is nothing to think that we're not at home in the day of this festival.
We realized that we are celebrating Deepawali together with 125 crore Indians.
In the day of this Deepawali festival, shall the spirit of the soldiers in the minds of the soldiers disappear from this time, and from some moments
I appeal to all of you to create this feeling as a society, as a country, to be our natural, to join our sentiments.
While the whole country stands with the arms, the strength and strength of the force will increase to 125 crores.
Some time back, all the leaders from the villages of Jammu and Kashmir had come to meet me.
They belong to the Panchayatu congress of Jammu and Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 leaders from various villages in the Kashmere Valley.
I have a chance to speak to them for a long time.
They had come to talk about the development of their villages, some had come with some demands, but when the speech began, it was natural that the situation in the valley, the law and order situation, the future of the children, had a place.
The heart of these leaders of the village, with an open heart and open mind, was to touch the heart.
In a speech, when we heard about the burnt schools in Kashmir, I felt as far as our countrymen had suffered from this, as well as the leaders of this village.
And they believed that the schools were not burned, but the days of the children were unclean.
And it came to pass, when you returned to your cities, that I sought to pay your attention to the future of these children.
I am very glad that all these leaders who came from the Kashmir Valley had performed the most excellent promise to me.
They went to the villages and awakened those who were far away.
A few days back, 95 percent of Kashmere's children participated in this election.
It is indicative of us that such a large number of students take part in the Marriage examinations, our children of Jammu and Kashmir, for a prosperous future, are seeking to raise new peaks of growth through education.
While I express my blessings to those students for their incentives, I fulfil my heart's full greetings to their parents, relatives, their teachers and all rural leaders.
Many brothers of love, this time when I asked for advice from the people for the voice of the mind, everyone's advice came about one thing.
Everyone asked me to speak extensively about 500, 1000 rupees of patients.
In my speech to the people of the country at 8 pm on November 8, I spoke of the start of a change in the country's devastation.
When I made this decision, I put it before you, I generally said that this decision was not normal, but suffering.
But how important the decision is, how important it is to be implemented.
I know that a variety of renewable difficulties will be faced in our average life.
Even then, the decision was very big, and I said it would be 50 days for us to recover from its impact, and then it could suppress us towards nature.
For 70 years, it is not so easy to try to get rid of all the diseases we are suffering.
I can understand all the problems you face.
500 and 1000 rupees of sickness, such a large country, such a number of diseases, millions of crores of diseases, such a decision - the entire world, and every economic expert is very embarrassed and estimated.
India has a great faith in 125 crore people of India and 125 crore people are determined to fulfill their mentality.
All sections of the central government, state and regional establishments across the country, one lakh 30,000 bank branches, millions of bank workers, more than hundreds of thousands of post offices, and more than one hundred and a half million bankers, were working day and night, with dedication.
Between various pressures, all of them were very quiet, and the idea that this country's work was a variety of attempts to make a massive change.
As a result, India is obviously successful in this work.
I see that even among these problems, everyone works in banks and post offices.
When the matter of humanity comes, they are just a little more traveling and acting.
One told me that there was a danger to an old man at Khandwa's place.
Suddenly money was needed.
I am glad to know that when the banking worker was taken into account, he went to the elderly home and collected money and saw no interruption of treatment.
Many of these unsuccessful events are available every day in TV, media, newspapers and addresses.
I express my heartfelt thanks to all the comrades who are labourers and participants in this great volcano.
But the extent to which the evil is spread, even today, the evil practices from some have become a habitat.
Even now, these corruption money, this black money, which is not counted, can be found to live by looking for some way.
They are trying to save their money from the poor, fainting or fainting the words of desire, drew money in their accounts, buying something from them.
It is one of those whom I want to say today - if we die, if we do not die, if we do not believe in the law, if we don't walk, you're not working, and you'll see what you're gonna do.
But please don't play with the lives of poor people.
Don't use poor names in the records, then don't do anything in the problem because of my favourite misery during the guilt.
There is a drastic law on Pinamic assets, which is coming to light and will have a lot of problems.
The government prefers that there should be no problem for our people.
I live in Trali village of Taluka in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
You have made a better singing for those who have a black money through 500 and 1000 rupees of patients and corrupt people.
If this action is not taken, then every citizen of India will never have a good time.
That's why I want to tell you my personal thanks.
Some of the matters are encouraged by the media to work when people get from government levels.
There is unprecedented happiness and greatness when we know what is a wonderful ability to the material public of my country.
Even if you have an old disease, don't worry about the money, don't go back from here alone, go out of the food, whenever you have to travel on this route, surely pay the money.
People go there, eat food and return money when they return to that route after 2-4-6 days.
This is the power of my country, in which service individuality and sensitivity.
During the election, I began to speak at the time of tea, and this idea spread all over the world.
Many of the world's people have begun to say that tea is being spoken.
But I didn't know that the weddings would also take place when this tea was spoken.
On November 17, a wedding in the warmth took place with tea.
In Gujarat's heat, a woman drank tea alone for her home-marriage, and didn't work in any other conventions, there was nothing to produce, because money laundering was due to monetary breakdown.
The prosecutors also considered this as a glory.
Surat's Bharat Maru and Taksha Parmar - who have wiped out their part in the massive war against black money against corruption through their marriage - are very supposed to be observing.
While enjoying sacrifices to Navaparnith Bharath and Dakshah, I have also made marriage as a great humble, and have given you whispering blessings to make it a new mouth.
When such confrontations occur, the people are making the solutions of it very special.
Some have been benefited immediately through this movement.
For the country shall be benefited in the days of ever more, but profit shall be given to some.
When I asked about what happened, I got some information from small towns.
But this time, due to the decision on 8th, all of them came to pay their old diseases.
About 3,000-3500 crores of rupees were collected in 47 urban units last year.
Where's 3000-3500 crores, where's 13,000 crores
Now these municipalities have 4 times the money, whether the water supply organisations will be built for the poor, or will the organisations of the Anganwadi centres be established
There are many such examples of direct consequences.
Brothers, our villages, our peasants, are strong pillars of our country's economy.
On the one hand, due to this new change of economy, among the left, every immigrant is improving himself.
But I want to tell the farmers of my country specially today.
Now I've been asking about the points of this season.
As far as wheat and pulses and oil crops, I have a calculation till November 20, the sowing has increased in comparison to this period last year.
Among the problems, farmers have found a way.
The government has also made several important resolutions, including the importance of farmers and villages.
The attempts were made to lend to them according to the Mutra program.
Hundreds of crores of rupees were provided to the simple, because hundreds of millions of people are engaged in small jobs, while thousands of thousands of thousands of rupees are fasting for business.
Today, when I want to tell my little business brothers, you can use it as an opportunity to enter the digital world.
You and your mobile phone pay the ap of the banks.
Your contribution to the creation of a society without rose money can be very large, you can use all the banking operations through Mobilefone to increase your business, and today we can deal with business in many ways without sickness.
Technical methods are safe, quick.
I only want you to gain this movement, but I hope you can give such leadership, not only that you have to lead the change.
I hope you can help the entire village business also.
I want to say to the labourer brothers and sisters, that you have suffered more injustice.
And one of the wages of the book is another, than the sum of your hands.
You need to get your wages complete, nobody has to give a share.
You shouldn't be tortured.
If money comes out of your bank accounts, you can also buy material in a small mobile phone, through which you can pay the money, and there is no Smart Bourne, and now you go to your mobile and serve your pursuit as an e-wallet.
Therefore, my labour brothers, I want your contribution to this program, because I have made such a big decision for the poor of the country, for the peasants, for the workers, for the disbelievers, for the victims and for their benefits.
Today I want to talk to young people.
We suppose that 65 percent of India's population is 35 years old.
I am also aware that you are making a lot of contribution to this instrumental ways.
You companions, you are my real soldiers, you are my true companions.
It is a wonderful opportunity for all of us to serve Mother India, which is a golden opportunity to bring the country to economic peaks.
My young social friends, can you help me
App, you would like to know what the secretary is, you know what's online beanging, that's what the banking is through census, and you know, through censorship, travel registration.
These things are very simple to you, and you use them.
But today, the enormous work that wants to be done is a society that is not our sufficient rivalry.
It is true that society is not possible without a hundred percent rock sympathy.
But why shouldn't we start making India a less routine social.
Once you start this low-productive social, the goal of society is not far from a rational sympathy.
I hope you will never disappoint me because we are all in mind the desire to change the life of the poor of Hindustan.
You know how many opportunities have occurred today to create a society, introduce a digital bank service or introduce a mobile bank service without a rating.
Each bank provides an online facility.
Walt's direct meant e-purse.
Several types of cards are found.
According to his plan, India's millions of poor families have a rope cut, a very lowly used rupee card, and after 8th, a lot of use has started, and has seen a growth of 300 percent.
Like the prepaid card on mobile phone, the banks also receive a prepaid card to spend money.
The UPI, a precious base for business, through which you can buy things, send money and receive money.
This work is as easy as you send information on the WattsApp.
Even those who don't know how to send information on the Watts App, and how to forward.
Not only this, the big smartphone for this job is very easy to technologically unnecessary.
Funds can also be exchanged through a simple-sufficient phone.
Nobody can use the circular worker, vegetable seller, milk seller, newspaper seller, tea seller, bulky.
I have pressurized efforts to make this method more comfortable.
All banks are engaged in it.
We have now pursued additional payments for Aunline business, and have come to the conclusion of all such taxes on the lease, which you may have seen in the newspapers in the last two-four days.
My young friends, even after all this, it is indefinite to complete a generation.
I'm glad you're all involved in this massive work.
I've noticed everything that you've given instrumental information in WhatsApp, poems, poems, pieces, cartoons, new imaginations, laughter
I see what happens to me when we see the creativity of our younger communities in the midst of challenges, as it is the specific feature of this Indian soil that ever emerged in the battlefields.
But I'm my favorite young comrades, I'm once again telling you, I need your help in this work.
Yeah, yeah, I'm saying once again, I need your help, you're confident that millions of young people in this country will do this work.
Today's first confirmed features that you would be part of the society without a rational sympathy.
Give all the techniques for online costs in your mobile phone.
You must be led by the unprovoked social and sick manoeuvres, the movement to free the country from corruption, the movement that frees from black money and the movement that frees the people from the problems of the left.
Once you learn how to use the Rupay card to the people, the poor will give you asylum.
Within a month, we can stand as a new Hindu place, and you can do this work through your mobile phone
Go to ten houses every day, and join 10 houses every day.
I call you, come, come not only to your support, but we shall turn this transformation into fountains, and shall provoke change.
We will proceed to this war that will liberate the country from black money and corruption.
This country has created a great revolution.
My nervous youths, I'm once again asking you once again, you go ahead with this movement.
I appeal to all of you in this work that every school, college, university, national student force and state welfare program are socially, individually involved.
We'll go ahead with this work.
We all have a chance to serve the best of the country, and we must not leave this goodbye, the golden opportunity.
My younger brothers, a great poet of the country, Harivanshrai Pachan, is on his birthday. Today, his birthday, Amitabh Bachchan has given a call for their cleaning.
Amithap, the greatest artist of this century, maybe you careful that they are moving forward to the cleaning movement.
They identified themselves through this tax.
I don't see Harivanshrai's dresses with my respect.
I have dedicated my thanks to them in this way to join the voice of the mind, and to guide the pure work.
My foolish nations, now your thoughts, your sentiments, and your letters, and my gov, and my narendramodipp, keep me with you, through the voice of the mind.
Now at 11 o'clock, Mann Ki Baath (Manadin's voice) is a sound, but in state languages, it will start soon.
Thanks to all of you.
Deepavali is celebrated all over India with enthusiasm and joy.
For 365 days, at any corner of the country, a country that is going to be held in a festival is our Indian country.
But all of these are linked to an original mantra that we can see clearly, this entire journey of Indian festivals, their spread, their deepness and persuasion among the people - to go towards individual society.
The festivals are responsible for all the trees, trees, rivers, animals, mountains and birds.
All this we celebrate the holiday on Sunday, but you shall see that they are of the former generations, and of the working class, and of the slaves, and of the slain: and you shall take care of the days of their slaughter, and of the days of their abomination.
Powernami and Amavasai have proved to be a scientific effect on the kind of change in sea water day and nature.
It also affects human mind.
That is, the tradition of celebrating holidays in our country is also based on destination and science.
Today, as we celebrate the Deepawali festival, as I said before, our every pundit is to teach, and to give knowledge.
It gives us the news of this brilliant pandemic and that Damaso Maa should go to light from darkness.
This is not the only darkness that is not light:
The darkness of shutdown, the darkness of education, the darkness of poverty and the blindness of social evil.
And if we are able to liberate from the darkness of individuals, the bitterness of the society, and the deficiency of individuals, then it may be the purpose of the lightning of the lamp of the lamp.
One thing we all know is that you can go to any corner of India, see whether it is a great wealthy house, or a dwelling of poor poverty, when the Deepavali festival, the pure movement is mixed in every family.
Every corner of the house looks clean.
He shall also keep his soil's mirror clean, saying, There shall be dust from the earth, but the devil shall come.
Canada's Prime Minister Deepavaliyyayouthy is participating in his film as a dubber.
The UK Prime Minister inaugurated a program of welcome in London to combine Deepawali and combine all the communities, including himself:
It may also be said that there is no UK city of Deepavali, which does not celebrate Diwali with great fanfare.
In Singapore's Prime Minister Instagram, he shared a film with world heritage with great fanfare.
Well, what do you know about that film
The film is a film that is being produced by 16 female members of the Singapore parliament, wearing a Indian furnace and standing at the door of the parliament.
All this has been done before Deepavali.
The point I want is that Deepawali is a illuminating drama, a big day to encourage all the world people from dark to light.
During the days of Diwali, news about dangers, islands and incurable deaths is concerned.
Another problem is that when the doctors are going to celebrate Deepawali with their families in large numbers, there is a lot of fun and a shouting.
The urgent appeal to the parents and the defendants is that children should be elders with them when they succumb to their slaughter. Keep in mind that there should be no misunderstanding, and not incredible.
The Deepavali festival is celebrated for a long time in our country.
This is not a day's thing
This can be said to be the poetry of Kovartha, Pai Dhuj and Lap Panchami, which is a long time for Karthik Purnami's charming festival.
Together, we are happy to celebrate the festival of Deepavali, and we are preparing for the Sad Puja in the Mussoorie.
The Sath-Puja festival in the eastern part of India is a big festival.
On one hand, it is the largest festival, celebrated for 4 days, but there is a significance for this - which provides a very deep message to society.
The Sun God gives us all things, and from him we all come. It is difficult to see what the Sun God gives us.
This sacrifice of soldiers and defence forces has been emotionally distracted in my mind.
I want to share a thing from the world of these sentiments - this island will be dedicated to the security forces.
I called on the countrymen to participate in a movement called Sandesh2Soldiers, that is, the soldiers.
I want to swear by the head that there is no great love for the country's soldiers, no immigrant on the force and no pride of the security forces.
The media has also turned this island into a day of thanks to the soldiers.
When we are in our mood, at that time we think of them, even those memories create a new power.
There is also a message that gives double power, and the country also has to do it.
Some of them have painted, kissed, produced cartoons.
I can imagine how much this will give to my country's soldiers.
All these things have been identified in Hashtag, Sandesh2soldiers.
I want to read the poems sent by Mr. Ashwini Kumar Sauhan.
Ashwini writes, "I am celebrating the festival, I am happy, I am cheerful, I am celebrating the festival, I am happy, I am cheerful, I am sorry, I am sorry, all this is because of you, I say today.
I also live for you, and for your livelihood, the country's dweller.
'A sister Shiwani has sent a message to me by phone, in case the countrymen are full of soldiers and soldiers at the birthplace and the soldiers are full of soldiers in the house.
Let's hear what the soldiers of the family want to say.
"He is the prime minister, I speak Shiwani Mohn.
With military officers and soldiers, their families and their wives perform many sacrifices.
In a way, the entire military society has also received a very good message.
'My loved countrymen are seen not only on the border of the military virgin but on every stage of life.
You may have heard that Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the habit of external dysentery.
There is a village called Vikas Pharaoh - a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
We went to our village to the soldiers of the Indian Tibetan Border Force.
In the village, he went there and there were discussions about the construction of toilets in the village panchayat.
It was found that some families could not build toilets due to inflation.
He immediately took his book of paper, told the head of the treasury to pay a loan of Rs.57,000 to the treasury head, if there are no toilets at any 57 households, give a thousand rupees to any family from my level, build 57 toilets, and leave the village of Bathana out of the habit of leaving the toilet.
Vikas Pharaoh has shown that he has given a 1000 rupees to 57 families and has encouraged a new power to the cleaning system.
This is how the Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the habit of external defecation.
Similarly, in Kerala, I want to express my thanks to the youth.
At the same time, the national student's categories came to an end to build toilets, including state health workers and engineering students.
All these students, such as bricks and symmeands, went to their shoulders throughout the day and went to the forest.
They built toilets in the village through their work, and these youths were freed from the habit of dysentery outside the small village in a remote forest.
That is why Kerala has become an unprotected state openly.
In all municipalities and municipalities, the Gujarat state has declared that more than 150 have been freed from external toilet habits.
Ten districts have been released from this habit.
But generally these things are not paid attention.
The old plan and new plans are being implemented and the next plan will be expected.
The houses in our country where there is a gas supply, where there is electricity, they don't need soil oil.
But who is concerned about the state, is provided with kerosene and burning, electricity is also available, in this case the intermediaries are getting the opportunity to pay.
Look, however, a major change will prevent rough market sales, benefit the environment, and our foreign salary will be reduced, and people's convenience will also increase.
Yes, there is no doubt that there will be trouble for intermediaries and non-monetary people.
My sinful countrymen, Gandhians are always guiding us.
In every case, his claim determines the status of the country where to go and how to travel.
We must pay attention to the aspirations of the poor of the country.
They must be freed from the left, so we must take action one after another.
Whatever our old impression, society must be freed from the others of men and women.
Now there are toilets for women's children and children in schoolhouses.
This is a good idea that our women's children are unrest.
Though vaccination is being done in government terms, many lakhs of children are forced to get rid of the vaccination, targeting diseases.
The vaccination of Mission Indones, which is being carried out for children who are freed from vaccination, gives children the power to get rid of dangerous diseases.
We are in the 21st century, but the situation that the darkness is surrounded in the village cannot continue, and a larger movement to bring electricity into the village is successfully progressing.
After all the years of the country's release, how will her health be when poor mother cooked in silver and smoking 400 cigarettes of smoke in her body
Efforts are being made to free 5 crore families from smoke, and we are traveling on a successful route.
Small businessmen, small workers, vegetable sellers, milk salesmen and finishing shopkeepers, are hijacking money from the elite.
The Mutra program, the Stand Up Program, the public's plan, is the successful movements that are being launched to get rid of the debtor of interest.
To directly pay money to the banks through the source, the owners and the users receive direct money.
It is a good opportunity to get rid of the stakeholders in their lives.
We fulfil our breasts with remembrances of parents, and do so.
But a telephone call from Punjab touched my heart and pain - 'Perhaps they, sir, I speak from Punjab.
Sir, on October 31, Sardar Patel was his birthday.
They have served to unite the country throughout their lives, and have achieved success in this goal, and have united everyone.
Tirthan Indira Gandhi was murdered the same day as she didn't know what the country's traitor was or what else.
We are well aware of the events that followed in the country.
I want to know your views about how to prevent such unfortunate events.'
This pain is not only of a man, but also of my country, more than my organism.
After Sanakanya, a Sardar and Sardar Babbai filmed the patriotic work to unite the country.
And Sardar Phil tried for their unity, because of his principal purpose, he was ruled by many anger, but he was not absent from the point of view of unity.
But on the day of the same day, thousands of surathas, thousands of surathas, families of thousands of surathas, died after the assassination of Tirthan Indira Gandhi.
On the day of the birth of the Mamanites, who spent all his life for oneness, the evil that was built on the parents, is painful to us, on one side of history.
But even in the midst of these discords, we must proceed with the liberal mantra of unity.
Individual unity is the country's largest strength.
Though many languages, many castes, many clothing and many food habits are different, the unity is the strength of India, the speciality of India.
Every generation has a obligation, and every government is responsible for looking for an opportunity to unite on every side of our country and proceeding unity.
We have also withdrawn from separatist ideas and variations, and will save the country.
They have given us a united India, and are responsible for us to make it a better India.
The mantra of unity is the strongest instrument of the best India.
Their journey to Sardar began in the peasantry struggle.
He's a farmer's partner.
Today we are questioning the name of 'Amul'.
Everything of AMUL is well known in India and abroad.
But many people are expected to know that the production of the Bal Producers Cooperation Trade Union was due to their television.
In 1942, the district of Cata was called Kerra in those days, he embraced the opinion, which appeared today as an example of how Sardar lived for the welfare of the peasants and the peasants.
I'm telling the surdars with my respect.
On October 31, whenever we are, we will remember them, and we will be determined to unite.
It is celebrated as a brilliant celebration of autocratic purnami in this dramatic process.
Guru Nanak Dev is a whole human society of their charity, which is not only spoken to India but also a whole human society, which is still guiding.
Service, possibilities, surpassion, surpassion, i.e., good for everyone. These are their news of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and goodness are the main mantras.
The aim of liberating society from individuality, impatience and evil habits was that of the Guru Nanak God.
Your dreams, your commitments, all kinds of success.
Over the past, we have lost 18 soldiers of our country, with an extremist attack in the Uri area of Jammu and Kashmir.
I'm seeing all the survivors of the survivors and dressed soldiers.
This cowardly event has also poured over the entire country.
And the voice of the people of the land increases jealousy, and the wrath grieves.
This loss is not only for the families of the soldiers who lost their children, lost their brothers, and lost their husbands.
The loss is being experienced throughout the country.
Therefore, the people of the country, I say that I have said before you this day: the culprits shall be punished, and they shall not escape from the punishment.
O my loved nations, we have a great faith on our army.
They will snatch every climate with their indifference, and 125 crore people of the country will express their high-level virtue in relaxing and peaceful living standards.
We're taking greater interest in our military.
I want to talk to the citizens of Kashmir, especially today.
The citizens of Kashmir are beginning to understand the opponent powers of the country.
While they are beginning to understand the truth, they have begun to move away from them and pass through the peace.
Every father's wish is that schools and colleges should start functioning faster.
For the past few days, business has also started doing well.
We know that peace, unity and harmony can be solved by our problems, our progress can be the path of development.
In order to our future generations, we must hold new peaks of growth.
I am sure we can provide for the best way to Kashmir's future generations if we have pursued the way for a peaceful solution to every problem.
The responsibility of the security administration of the Kashmiri citizens.
The administration has to take some action to build the law order.
We have the powers, powers, laws and regulations to use all the law and orders, which have to ensure the calm life of the common people of Kashmir, and I also ask the country's security forces to follow them well.
At some points, those who have differentiated from our opinions put forward new ideas.
Sharshvardhan, who is studying 11th class, has put a different view of my attention.
'After your extremist attacks, my mind was overwhelmed, but I didn't have any way to do anything.
In this environment of happiness, Harshvardhan, at such a young age, you are comfortably imagined, this gives joy to my mind.
But Harshvardhan has the greatest value of the anger in the minds of the people of the country.
This is the expression of the feelings of the people of the country.
Yes, you have advanced an aggressive approach.
But you know that during the war in 1965, Lal Bahadur Shastri was the chief of their country, the same sentiment in the whole country was obsessive and patriotic dream.
Every citizen had the determination to do something in his mind.
At that time, Lal Bahadur Sastry attempted to give the country the best of these sentiments.
He gave the words of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and encouraged how to work for the country's civilian public service.
And one attempt must be made to reveal the patriotism in the midst of the bombings, and every dwelling place, which they offered by Lal Bahadur Shastri.
While Gandhians were guiding the freedom struggle, he was successful in encouraging social duties when the movement needed another base while the freedom struggle was seriously overwhelming.
We and our army will defend our obligations, and those responsible for the administration will take their obligations, and every citizen of our country and every citizen will surely take a positive part in this patriotic sentiment, and then the country will surely catch new peaks.
Our sportsmen who went to participate in the Para Olympics sports activity, Karthik told them the success of human inspiring.
Varun Viswanathan has registered them as Narender Modi's secretary and asks you to tell it in your mind.
Not only for your two, but for every citizen of the country, players who participated in Para Olympic have had a sense of complete involvement.
The Para Olympic competition and the achievements of our players have completely changed the vision of humanitarian perspective and transformation capabilities.
Our sister Deepa Malik, a successor, won the tension and I would not forget my words in my lifetime.
This time 19 sportsmen, including 3 women in our country, participated in Para Olympics.
In comparison to other sports, there is a great deal of mind and determination - when alternative capabilities play, their ability to play and their capability in the game.
Mariyapan has won gold tensions in the contest of their elevation.
Mariyapin lost his right leg just at the age of five.
Nevertheless, he could not stop his mind.
He is not a resident of a big city, neither a central family nor a wealthy family.
At the age of 21, he did not enjoy physical problems, but only helped stress and put tension on it.
While they have raised our sentiments, they have changed the vision that we see the alternative capabilities.
Can anyone imagine that the replacement of the client Olympic rivals can be destructed
This time it happened.
Abdel Latti's side of Algeria is one of the alternative capabilities race than the replacement of gold in the Olympics for the 1500-meter race.
I once again tell our sportsmen my fascinating appreciations, and I suggest that India will now travel in the direction of creating a fair plan for the development of Para Olympics.
My countrymen, I had a very different experience in Gujarat's Navsari last week.
It mixed me as a very sensitive moment.
The Indian government organised a Mega camp for replacement capabilities, including many world records.
There I met a little girl without a sight, a little child from the longest forest area of the Nang district, a little girl from the Kauri Sherdul's name.
And she told me some parts thereof, and the people were astonished when I had spoken to them before the congregation.
The Indian state carried out a world record in the neo-country, which I consider as one of the greatest.
It was carried out within an hour of the process with equipment that cannot be heard by 600 counterparts.
This is Kinnas' world record book.
It is a matter of great concern for our countrymen that the creation of 3 world achievements by transforming capabilities on one day.
We started the movement called pure India on the birthday of Gandhians on October 2, two years before the people of the country.
On the day I reminded that cleanliness should be transformed into our nature, that every citizen should be obliged to be obliged to be seen as a dirty occupation.
I assert that the country's 125 crore people have been aware of cleanliness.
Likewise, everybody has attempted to take a step in order to say that we will take a step towards cleaning.
That is, 125 crores of feet of the country are moving towards cleaning.
If the direction to go is correct, it is proved that the strength and strength will be good.
All of the poor, peasants and women of the village have been able to contribute to the purification of the poor, peasants and women, from the hospital to the school or college, not just as a common immigrant, as a ruler, as well as state offices, as a road, bus or railway station.
Media friends have also served a constructive job.
Without this advance, we have to see further improvement.
This is very important:
So far, 2 crore 48 lakhs, i.e., approximately 2 12 crore toilets, have been built in the coming years, and there is a determination to build more than 12 crore toilets.
In the states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala, the livelihood of excreting excreta will be finished soon.
When I went to Warbandar, the birthplace of Gandhians in Gujarat, officials told me that it was on October 2 to end the habit of external secrecy.
Come on, people, we'll see the progress of garlic in a week.
In particular, my younger brothers are fully using the technology today, before them I want to put forward a plan.
The Indian government has arranged for a telephone number of 1969 to know how the status of the clean India movement is in your city.
You fully use it, especially young generations.
The Indian government appeals to the Corporate World that you will also take part in your part.
Give support to the working class of young industrial workers who want to work for cleansing.
We can use them as clean India partners and swachhharat fellows.
If this clean India movement stops with the states, it cannot be improved, the cleaning is natural and not satisfied.
Wealth is also important.
Therefore, along with the cleaning movement, we must travel from Gaya to Uram.
Refugees have been asked to buy the Campost height from the toilet.
The peasants who want to be involved in natural farming must see the way they get this fertility.
Those who seek to improve their wealth of the land, care for the health of the land, who have suffered a lot of chemical fertilizers, must be provided to them even if they need this fertilizer.
As a business ambassador, Amitabh Bachchan is playing his role in the work.
All the ministers, chief ministers, municipal mayors and commissioners from all over the country have been involved in deep connections with cleanliness.
What can be achieved by technology
What can be the type of finance
There are discussions on all those things.
I am constantly watching the new news about cleanliness.
I read the same day in the newspaper that students from the Gujarat Technical University went to 107 villages to work with awareness about the construction of the toilets.
The Indian government has prepared a corresponding correspondence throughout the year in its ministries.
Each sector must look forward to cleaning for 15 days.
In the coming October, from 1 to 15, the supply of drinking water and the three sectors of the health sector, the Panchaya Pradesh State Department and the country's development sector are combined to implement cleaning programs in their regimes.
In the last two weeks of October, three more ministries from October 16 to 31, such as agriculture and farmers' health, food-saving industries and consumer affairs, will implement the cleaning movement in their sector-related regimes.
If your work is to be associated with these sectors, I request citizens to join it.
Now you may have noticed that the purifying inspection movement is taking place.
It was first tested how cleaning was in 73 cities, which was placed before the people of the country.
There are more than 500 cities with more than one lakh population, now their system, in every city, has a hope that we remain behind and progress next time.
There has been a competitive environment of cleanliness.
We must give as much as citizens can participate to this movement.
On October 2, Gandhians and Lal Bahadur Shastri's birthday.
It has been 2 years since the clean India movement.
I have been asking Gandhi Jayanti to take some money from Deepavali and take some of the doors.
I ask another time, that every family buy a door: and when it burns in the houses of the poor, the light of the fire on the day.
On Sunday 2 this October, as a citizen, can't we engage in any act related to cleanliness
I'm asking you to add you to the purifying service for 2 hours, 4 hours, and share a photo with me in the Narendra Modi activity.
If there is a video, share that video.
With his efforts, this movement will once again strengthen the entire country and create a new pace.
Remembering Gandhians and Lal Bahadur Sastry, we will be supposed to do something for the country.
The retaliations given by the countrymen to my request to break gas subsidies in the past are one of the most incentives of the country's livelihood.
This is the movement to gather people who need food and clothing.
When I was in Gujarat, all our servants landed on the streets and obtained old sports materials in the family, and brought them to Anganwadi in the poor-saving area.
The political ideas that have been driven out of millions of workers like me, they are supposed to explain the political ideas of Din Dayal Upathya:
The political thinking associated with the roots of India, the impression of the Indian culture, the comprehensive idea of the colossal political doctrine and human natural doctrine, is the beginning of their centuries today.
Everyone's health and happiness are his contribution, including Survajan Hittai, Survajan Sukai.
Gandhians also spoke about the interests of the people in the market.
How to bring the fruits of growth to the poor in the market
Dintayal has put forward the entire economic program in a single phrase that the work of every hand and water in every field.
The country must celebrate the centuries of his birth as poor interest.
Everybody's attention to society and state must be conscious of how to bring the fruits of growth to the poor.
I recall them with great respect, Pundit Dean Dayal Upadia, a foolish man, whom we have supposed to be of our thoughts, and not of our thoughts.
This country's supremacy is giving me some kind of encouragement.
What are the desires of the goods of this country - the abilities
It is the record of the material recorded in my mind and mind that has come out in the voice of the mind.
I am expressing my mental gratitude to the aeroplane to make my views sound and to make all the efforts to bring it into all languages.
They summed up letters after the voice of their minds, suggested and punished the doors of the government, revealing the deficiencies of the government, prepared such letters by the aeroplane, bringing representatives from the state level and setting up a base to solve the problems.
The voice of mind does not stop with any 15-20-minute speech, which is a new opportunity for social change.
What else can be the more joyful thing:
That's why I do not see my gratitude to all those who have participated in this victory, and I pay them my liabilities.
My people of love are coming to Navaratri, Durga Pooja and Vijaya Dasamy next week, and the arrangements for Deepavali will start, and a different environment will take place all over the country.
This is the unity of society, the power of the country.
It will reflect as a navrataria and a foolish pooja, to make this power suprema as a means of social unity.
To bring the country to new peaks, we will pursue pure days of peace, unity and goodwill, navaratri and Durga Puja.
We will celebrate Vijay Dasamy's victory.
This day national sports is being celebrated every day throughout the country.
He has served as an important task of obtaining golden tension to India when Olympics took place in 1928 and 1932.
At that time, it was only 10 minutes to get the end.
Thyan doubts put 3 rounds in those ten minutes, and I put a sword in response to the wound.
People of the country, whenever there is a time for the voice of the mind, there are many suggestions in the magov web or narendramodip.
They are different.
But this time there are more demands that I must convince Rio Olympics.
It seems to me that it is very impossible to see how much interest in the public minds and so much awareness about the Rio Olympics and some pressure on the prime minister of the country.
Despite the clicket, the Indian people have so much interest in other sports, so aware of this.
Sachin has written, This time you have a request, talk about the voice of the mind, and the voice of Sachshi, and the lamp of the lamp.
One of these women belongs to North India, one from South India, one from East India, the other from India's other.
India's daughters are accepting responsibility for ensuring pride in the country.
On the MyGov Internet, Shikar Daggur wrote that we could be more important in the Olympics.
He added, 'My greetings to you for two tensions we have received in Rio,' he said.
It is necessary to take a long journey in the sports competition.
Our parents pay attention to studies today.
Even now in society, the games are seen as a climate.
We must change this idea.
There is a need to encourage society.
Who can give this work better than you
Likewise, Mr. Sathyaprakash Mehra also wrote in the narendramodip - insisted on the need for extra-curricular executives in the voice programme of mind.
In one way, the same sentiment reflected in thousands of writings.
It is true that we are not able to act according to our opposition.
We have only two tensions in the turbulence.
But if there is no tension, it is slightly interesting that in many cases, India's sportsmen have shown sufficient ability for the first time.
Our Abinav Pindra won the fourth position in the shooting division and lost his tension in a very small difference.
Likewise, the Dennis combined with Sania Mirza-Rohan Popanna.
We are particularly working in the Athletics section.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar has been able to get the last contest for the Track Field.
For the first time in the last 36 years, the drummer has succeeded in lifting the knock out position in the Hockey contest.
In Baxing, Vikas Krushna Yadhav's foot came to the final stage, but he could not get the brazen tension.
Many soldiers, for example, Atiti Ashok, Tattoo Poknel and his Das, were specially functioning.
But there is more we have to do with the people of the country.
But if we continue to act, perhaps we may have to be disappointed again.
I am reporting an announcement on the formation of a group.
The Indian government will deepen it and review what kind of operations are there in the world.
The program will be implemented in what field we can do well.
We must make plans with a television vision of 2020, 2025 and 2028.
I'm appealing to all those interested Indian citizens to send their advice to me in the narendramodiap.
The state governments will send their suggestions after discussions.
And the people of the country are teachers on September 5th day.
I could learn a lot with these little boys.
According to me, on September 5, not only the teachers day, but also the day of education.
But this time I had to go to the G20 summit, it appeared that I would not express my feeling in the voice of the mind today.
The more important place for the mother in life, the more important is the teacher's place.
We have seen teachers who are more concerned about us than us.
They sacrificed their lives only for their readers, and for their students.
I see Kofisand today as an excellent teacher.
On the day of the teacher, Bullela Gopichand told her that she would enjoy the victory of the Pilots.
The contribution of teachers in our lives is always felt.
On September 5, the former Republican leader of India, Dr.
On the day of the birth of Sarvepalli, the birthplace of Radhakrishna.
Though he has put any position in his life, he has always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only this, he shall never die, neither shall he be a student among good teachers.
In that month, there will be comments on the books read and quotes from them.
It will be said that the whole month I did not correct in his sight.
Even today, he is afraid of me in his classroom.
Even today, he is giving me a kind of far-reaching education.
And when I see his significance in his 90th year, I am astonished, how can he write all these pearls in this old age
Because my signature is so bad, but if someone writes beautifully, then my mind will increase much respect.
Your experience may also be like my experience.
Whatever good you have received by your teachers in your life, if you tell it worldly, there shall be a change in the vision of the teachers, and a glory.
It is our responsibility to increase the honour of teachers in society.
If a movie is taking place with your teachers, if there is any incident with your editor, you must share in the narendramodeep if it is a matter of conception with your editor.
It is a matter of value to see students' participation in the country's teachers.
But when we speak about democracies, it is natural to return our memories to the Logamanya Bal Gangadhar Tilkar.
The tradition of democracies being celebrated socially is the killing of Logamanya Thilagar.
He changed the time procedure through democracies as a day of awareness of the country, which has become the day of social culture.
Democratic square is also discussing all the questions that touch social life, which led to a new upheaval in society and a new development.
Not only that, he gave a mantra - the kingdom of Swedom must be the center of our bourgeoisie and the power of freedom struggle.
Not only in Maharashtra, it is not socially celebrated throughout the democracies.
They are discussing public matters, conducting columns, competing to goals.
The scenes in this place would have artistically illuminated the things that touch society.
In one way, the movement that can create awareness for everyone is carried out by socially democracies.
The LORD has given the kingdom of the kingdom of Egypt our natives.
But we are now in independent India.
Come on, I'm calling you.
The tactics are the fact that the powers of society.
They provide a new life to the individual and society.
It is not possible to live without concentration, but it has to be changed according to the needs of time.
This way, I can see that many have written about democracies and Durga Pooja.
They are concerned about the environment.
Mr. Shankara Narayana, Prishand, Mothi, urges you to explain through the voice of the mind that they should not use the idols made by the plaster of Paris.
The statues made by the Plaster of Paris are not suitable for the environment, but many others have expressed their concerns.
I urge all of you to use the idols of the children made of dust, or the idols of furnace, to redeem our ancient heritage.
Ganesh is the one who removes discords.
In such a situation, we should not create a goddess statue that produces fury.
I don't know how you will take what I say, but I don't mean, many say.
An architect of Pune, Mr. Abhijit Thotpale, Kirgavasa RA Raja of Mumbai, Nisark Mithra, Vikyan Prabodini, Nisark Kata of Virupa, Gyan Prabodini of Pune.
Many of these organizations and individuals take more troubles to create smooth descent images, and propagate them.
A democracies that do not harm the environment are also a social service service.
The Durga Pooja has a little more time.
And thou shalt make the idols of the traditional idols, and thou shalt work with the idols of soil.
We take the decision to protect our ponds and rivers from the soil that they will be made.
It is natural for all the people of the country to pay a degree of piousness to Mother Teresa, who served for the poor of India.
We have received blessings from the saints, and from the Rishis, and from the men of great men, every moment.
We have received from them something, and we learn, and understand good works.
When the people of the country are a movement of advanced thirst, how big a change will it make
People's energy is seen as Macheson's power.
In the past, the Indian state was engaged in a successful attempt to create a clean Ganga in collaboration with the five state governments, cleaning the Ganges and joining the people.
We called the leaders of villages living on the banks of the Ganges to a meeting in Allahabad on 20th this month.
And there were men, and women.
I am empowering all the ministries and ministers of the Indian state that have performed this enormous task.
I express my lucky thanks to the first of the five state governments, which helped to join the people's power and take the most important foot of the Ganges.
The people of poverty, some things, sometimes touch my mind, and sometimes there is a special respect in my mind on those who create a chance.
On July 15, one of the more than 1700 schools in Kabirtham district of Chhattisgarh.
More than 25 lakh students wrote socially to their parents.
Some men in English, some in Hindi and some in the language of Satisgarh told their parents to have a toilet in their homes.
And they had demanded to build the toilet, and some of the children had written this year, even as you have not celebrated this day my birthday, but surely to build the toilet.
Children from seven to 17 years of age worked.
She is a 16-year-old Mallamma in Kopal district of Karnataka, who has been subjected to her family.
And he did not eat any of these things, or dressing good garments, or eating sweets:
Male child Mallamma's fictitiousness is for us to have a toilet in our house.
Look at the significance of village leader Mohammad Shafi, who arranged for 18,000 rupees and built the toilet within a week.
But everybody is associated with it in some way and everybody is enjoying a golden role.
I am also calling for television channels to arrange for competitors to produce films like this.
There is no need for a big studio to produce a film, no big camera is needed.
In today's time, you can produce films using cameras in your mobile phone.
Our respected Republican President Pranab Mukherjee launched a new program called Akashwani Maitrey Senel in Golkata.
Many people may have the question of starting a radio session with the country's Republican leader.
Bangladesh is our neighbor country.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are enriched with the same cultural heritage.
Here Akashwani Mithri and Bangladesh Bethar radio and borders will be happy to hear the aeroplane of the Bengali speaking people on both sides, who sympathetic to each other.
To connect people with the population, Akashwani's largest contribution.
The Republican leader has started this.
I express my thanks to the Bangladesh country associated with us to fulfill this work.
I also express my appreciations to the friends of the aeroplane for their participation in foreign policy.
O people of the country, you may all have made me the prime minister of the country, but I too am a man like you
That's why sometimes my mind also embraces some sensational events.
Such sentiments provide renewed power and new ideologies to the people of the country and encourage them to achieve something.
A letter that came to me a few days ago snatched my mind.
This was written by a mother about 84-year-old
If the retired teacher had not asked him not to mention his name, I would surely have mentioned his name.
I also fled the substance, and I forgot about it, as you asked you to break the substance for gas.
For me, I think the letter written by the Prime Minister of India is equal to the Padmasri award.
And it shall come to pass, that you shall know that all the people of the land have broken up the flesh of the air, and they shall write a letter out of my parable: and you shall know that any of my delegates shall go and give it to the flocks.
I'm trying to write a letter to more than a crore people.
We were dreaded because of their dryness last year, people of the country, but in August this month, we have expressed the sorrow of floods.
Some parts of the country have again flooded.
State governments, central governments, local organizations, social welfare organizations and civilians have attempted to sustain themselves.
But it is reminded of some actions that have taken place between these tragic floods.
We'll recall what the power to live together, how the impact would be on the shoulders of all.
In August 2016, the political parties, which resisted in August 2016 and 90 parties in the country, together with all the political parties in the parliament, have enacted the law on the Sarko service tax.
The appreciations for the completion of this will serve all political parties.
This is an excellent example of the benefits of all political parties to travel together in a single direction.
Likewise, they joined all the political parties of the country in connection with the situation in Kashmir and discussed the Kashmir issue in one voice.
Through this, the message was published to the world, and the separatist powers and their understanding was expressed to the people of Kashmir.
After discussions with all the political parties about Kashmir, one thing was well known, if I told them to suppress it in two words, they were unity and harmony.
These two words were mixed with their own magic.
Whatever death occurs in Kashmir, it may be a young man's life or the lives of the security forces, the loss is ours, ourselves, the faith of all of us, the faith of the people of 125 crore from the country's leader to the Prime Minister of the country.
Those who pursue little bourgeoisie to create unrest in Kashmir, or one day, should be replaced by the children of the stories.
I am confident of 125 crore people in the country.
I have the opportunity to spend some moments with the youth of Delhi this morning, and in the coming days, I hope that the enthusiasm of sports will increase every man's enthusiasm and humility throughout the country.
We all know that the world sports is going to be the largest crowd.
The word 'Rio' is constantly recurring in our ears.
Yesterday, the Indian state of Run for Rio, playing and living in Delhi, had made a very good arrangement to play and develop.
In the days to come, we will enjoy something to encourage our sportsmen in any area.
I'm ready to do this work from your side.
The country's prime minister is prepared to bring your greetings to our sportsmen.
Come, let us do all these things, every sporting brave thing in the days of our coming, and every sporting braveness, that we may encourage their efforts.
Today I am speaking about Rio Olympics, I read a poem sent by Suraj Prakash, a student who wants a poem from the Punjab Central University.
Like him, many other poets may have written more poems in this regard, some may have made them soft and songs in every language, but today I want to share with you the poems they wrote to me.
And the gold shall be silver brass, and the silver shall be brass.
Suraj, I offer your sentiments to all these sportsmen, and I say to you abundant goodwill, from my standard, and from the land of 125 crores, and from our flag in Rio.
Mr.
But whenever Abdul Kalam's name is taken, then a future picture of India, which is capable of science, technology and missile, stands in our eyes.
In that way, Abdul Kalam asked what your government is trying to convince their dreams
At the same time, if we want to compose our system, we must do research and renewal, which is the life of technology.
If researches and renewals are not produced, the way the humidity starts to swell in the stretched water, the technology will also be a burden to us.
If we do not do research and renewal, we are dependent on the old technology, we shall be reproached in the changing times
Hence, our young people must sow milk attractions of science, technology and research and many efforts are being made by the government.
That's why I say we will aim to innovate and innovate the new ones.
This means the Atal Innovation Mission when I call AIM.
If we want to create renewed soldiers for the next generation, we must join our young men with this program
That is why the Indian government has sought the Atal Tinkering Labs.
All where such moisture centres are being set up at schoolhouses, there will be Rs.10 lakhs and Rs.10 lakhs for the maintenance of 5 years.
Similarly, the renewed incubation center is directly connected.
If we have a powerful and enormous incubation center, we have a necessary organisation to introduce new recruits, check ups for startups and modify them.
While it is necessary to establish a new centre, it is also important to strengthen the old centres.
Our daily life has problems with our eyes.
Now we need to find technical solutions.
As we are Atal Grand Challenges, we are calling for the younger generations of the country to take researches, develop the technological subsidiaries to address all of us as problems in your eyes.
The Indian government wants to encourage us to give a special award to the technology that has been found to solve our problems.
While we spoke about the Tinkering Lab, we have applied more than 13,000 schools, and we have told the centre that more than 4,000 organizations without education and education have come forward to create such centers.
I assume that Abdul Kal's genuine jealousy can be paid to them by research, renewal, technological search for solutions to our problems in our daily life, and ease to get rid of our destinations.
The extent to which our younger generations pay attention to them, their share of the native India of the 21st century will be greater, which will be the real chauvinist who can give us their memories.
And it came to pass, O people of the country, that some time ago in our minds there was concerning the famine, and now the rain is enjoying, while the news of the floods is coming.
The state governments and the central government are engaged in a full-fledged effort to help the victims of flood.
Though there were some obstacles due to the rains, all of them are supposed to be supposed to grow in every human mind, because all our economic activity is at the centre of rainfall, agriculture.
Sometimes diseases that can cause us to suffer all lifetime.
But if we are waking up, then the ways and ways out of them are simple.
We'll take the dengue fever.
We can prevent us from dengue fever.
Even if all the government, hospitals and doctors do their jobs, we should not allow dengue to our families in our homes, our families, nor should we be aware of any disease that can be caused by water, that is why I apply to all of you.
And I want to turn away your attention, O people of the land, concerning a thing.
The extent to which life is urgent and fast, sometimes it is too late to think of us.
If you want for a few moments then you can get relief but doctors should stop the habit of taking antibiotics without recommendation .
And there has been a confusion - if the doctor has advised to take 15 antibiotic pills in 5 days , please fulfil that recommendation in the days of the doctor ' s advice .
Since the health has become healthy, if we don't need anymore, they become helpful to micro-virus, and become stronger.
It is called antibiotic resistance in medical dimensions, so as much as antibiotic and how to be used, it is important to follow the methods of taking them.
The government is committed to preventing antibiotic resistance:
You may have noticed that the antibiotic buffaloes sold all this should be drawn upon the garment of a red colored buffalo, that it may make you aware, and pay attention to it.
When we talk about health, I want to add another thing to it.
Pregnant mothers in our country are very concerned about health sometimes.
About 3 crore women in our country conceive every year, but some mothers die during childbirth, some children die during childbirth.
Sometimes both mother and child die.
Though it is true that maternal maternal mortality has fallen in the last decades, even today, it is still unable to save us more lives of pregnant mothers.
It is unknowing that in the pregnancy, afterwards, blood deficiency, reproductive disease infections, high blood pressure, such a place that can lead to their lives.
In view of all this, the Indian government has been implementing a new movement for the past few months - Prime Minister Sureshit Madrutva Abiyan, i.e. the prime minister's safe motherhood program.
My medical brothers cannot dedicate themselves to this work for 12 days in a year
Many have written to me in the past.
I believe you must join you in this.
People of poverty today are concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
There are discussions between people in the country and around the world.
India has been strengthening this opinion for centuries.
And it came to pass in the singing, that the Lord Krishna said, Servantrukshanaam, that I am a royal tree in trees.
It says there is no vegetation of symptoms of symptoms, i.e., physiotherapy.
The example of a woman from Pune has attracted my attention, which gave my mind a year.
In the sympathy of Mahabharata, the trees are also supposed to serve Macedselva's obligations in the heavens, soonal has accepted the challenge of not only his father's will but also the desires of the entire society.
Junner of Pune in Maharashtra, the farmer of Narayanpur village, Khandu Maruti Mahadre
Many of these attempts are being carried out.
During the first time of Gujarat, during the month of Bathra, I have seen a great number of pilgrims coming in the Amba Devi temple there.
Once a social service organisation gave a wooden wooden snake to the supremacists of the temple, and said that Mother Amba would continue to give you his asylums if he was dressing in your village.
Hundreds of thousands of people who came and gave hundreds of thousands of trees this year.
The temples can also start the tradition of planting trees in the rainy season rather than the procession.
This could lead to a public movement of trees.
I ask my peasant brothers again, why shouldn't we grow honey tree instead of planting trees of trees in the borders of our suburbs
Today we have to import a single tree from foreign countries to build houses and chairs in India.
The state has created a public movement and Rajasthan is a desert area.
At the same time, a large number of forest mahotsavs have been celebrated and a resolution of 25 lakh trees has been taken.
It is not a small deal between 25 lakh trees in Rajasthan.
He knows those who know about the earth of Rajasthan how great it is.
In Andhra Pradesh, it has been decided to increase the greenery by 50 percent by 2029.
Even in Gujarat, Van Mahotsav is a very popular tradition.
In Gujarat this year, plans have been implemented in many ways such as maar forest, Ekada forest and Sheeth forest, in which work was carried out through several crores of trees.
According to foreign travel, the diplomatic diplomacy is an integral part, trade discussions and security related addresses in many sectors.
But for me, South Africa's journey is a part of a tour.
It is natural to reflect the memories of Gandhians and Nelson Mandela when they think about South Africa.
When the words of Ahims, love and forgiveness in the world come into the ears, the faces of Gandhians and Mandela will appear before us.
I had to go to the Phoenix settlement, part of my South African trip, called the place where Gandhians resided.
I had a sweetness to travel to the Peter Moridsburgh railway station, which the Gandhians had sown the sowing of Mohndas as Gandhians.
This time I have the chance to meet many great men who sacrificed their age for equality and harmony.
Ansan fought with the shoulders with the shoulders, and spent 20-25 years with him in prisons.
And they sacrificed their whole life in one way: and I found great sight to see the great men of Amazon Mandela, which were near to them, and of Lalu, and of Sibah, and George Pezos, and of their glory, and of the great men of Ronnie Casters.
While I was speaking to them, when they were asking for their prison experiences, no tragicness was seen in their minds, no disappointment was seen.
All of us, equally, are the means of feeling that they are ourselves to our immense future.
Come on, even in South Africa, we will grow up by thinking of these Indians who have survived the verses of our lives.
Recently, I read in a press conference that a woman suffering from fraudulent and uninterrupted lightning web lost 11 lakh rupees and killed herself.
I am so sorry about a woman and her family's position.
I want to know what your opinions are about such deteriorating lightnings.
A new strategy to use technology is spread all over the world.
The way technology is making the largest focus on the economy, its fault is also increasing.
It was stated that if you want to get relief and take care of the daughters, a one-day bond of a home-building person who lived on his own had received a huge amount of money from abroad, put two lakh rupees in bank accounts for the tunnel solution.
Nobody can create a fake Letter interview and send it through, receives your debt wage number, debit card number, and purify your bank account through technology.
This is a new kind of fraud, it's a digital fraud.
I think we need to defend us from this conflict, I want to be awake, if such letters come, they should immediately share with our knowers, friends and help them to wake up.
I am supposed to have a chance to meet many people of the country when the people of the country are going to be held in Parliament.
I had a comfortable experience at such a meeting.
Some students from Alikar met me.
And the joy of the student was running on the edge, and they brought a great album, and drew joy on their faces.
They brought the films that beautify the Aligarh railway station.
They built a layer garden built by plastic bottles at the railway station and created a new shape for the station.
If you are likely to go to Aligarh, then you must go to the railway station.
Such information on many railway stations in India has come to me now, and people from those circles are decorating their local arts on the walls of the railway stations.
One can feel a new feeling.
This is an example of how people can change through participants.
My best wishes to all those involved in such works in the country, especially Aligarh's comrades.
The people of the country, according to the rainy season, starts the climate of many festivals in our country.
And you shall dwell in your houses, and in your publications.
The Raksha Bandhan festival is very important.
Like last year, in the period of Rakshabandan, can you be able to give the country's mothers and daughters a prime minister's life insurance program or life-saving life insurance program
Listen, brothers, let your sister really feel secure in life.
Why, we may have put a woman in our homes, cooking or doing homework, or as a poor mother.
During the Raksha Bandhan festival, can they also be given the prime minister's life-saving program or life-saving insurance plan
Many of us shall be born after the release of the land, O people of the land.
We can create such an environment.
Freedom day is not the event of governments, but it must be of the people of the country.
Like Deepavali, we must celebrate this day as our festival.
I want to do something positive with the idea of patriotism.
You may want to tell the people of the country, and I call you to make it clear from the bricks base.
I don't want to be the prime minister's opinions from the bricks base.
The bricks are reported from the base, with 125 crores of sentiments.
Many of the programs are planned in holidays.
Awakening is spread in many villages:
A few days ago, someone told me that the village population and village people in the Hivere Bajar village of Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra had sentimentally approached water problems.
There may be a number of villages that want to save water, but after they spoke to farmers, they changed the entire cropping Pattern and the plantation system.
The crop that uses excessive water could be black or marble, they decided not to produce such crops.
Nothing is easy to hear, but it is not so easy.
But look at my peasant brothers, they left immediately after the rubble did not walk because they needed too much water.
They cannot fully plant fruits and vegetables, i.e., only produced the minimum amount of water required.
They have succeeded in their own effort to overcome the problem of water today through various obsessions that open, drop water, rain water supply, water recharging, that is, rain water recharge.
Well, I've talked about a small village, Hivere Bazar, but there may be many villages like this.
I am offering blessings to such villagers, for the special works that you have achieved.
Someone told me about Gorva GORVA village panchayat in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh.
I think it's a message to the world when Indian state trains bring water to Ladur.
If you experience any confusion, a good news comes from somewhere, it is humanitarian to feel that the entire confusion is lost.
This time, since I heard the possibility of the rains from 106 percent to 110 percent, I feel a very happy news.
Despite the rainy season, the news of good rains has also been refreshed.
But it enables the people of the country to enjoy the good rains and makes the opportunity and the challenge.
We can't even start the movement to save the village water
Farmers need soil, which helps them in the fields.
Why should we not put the soil of the lakes of the villages in the fields
When the soil of the fields grows, then the water supply of the waters increases
If you fill the stone and the soil in the empty symmetric shoes, and the brass, and the brass, and put it on the way out
I always say a thing, when we ever go to the battlefields, where we can see different places, one of them is worth seeing:
It is also necessary to know how the waters were built under the house 200 years ago, how clean it was.
His concern is very natural because the work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Many governments have come, many plans have been made, accumulated money, due to which it is natural to raise such questions in the minds of millions of people in the country as brothers Kumar Krishna.
Those who believe in time regard the Ganga as a gift to the house.
The Ganges gives us work, and the Ganges gives us the power to live all.
The way the Ganga's illusion is raised, the country's economic activity is also a pace.
A swimmer brought us to the Ganges, but hundreds of thousands of devotees are required to wait for it.
People cannot gain jobs without partition, so we must become a change agent for cleaning and changing operations.
Repeat this thing, remember.
Many attempts have been made in government terms.
Attempts are being made to fully collaborate with the states that have all the states on the banks of the Ganges.
Attempts are being made to unite social and clean institutions.
Several operations have been carried out to prevent Surface cleaning, cleaning of the surface and preventing industrial masses.
Each day, steep toilets are mixed in large quantities through the canals.
In the days to come, plans will be carried out by the apparatus to remove this cluster in many places, and the benefits of the people who live on the banks of the Ganges and the Yamuna will be experienced immediately.
I think there will be good consequences.
Some officials told me that the zero liquid discharge has been successful for the past few days, i.e., the expulsions from the northern states of Uttar Pradesh.
The expulsion of black liquid from paper plants is almost complete.
It shows us that we are traveling in the right direction and a awareness has increased.
And if any of the beds of the Ganges, not only on the banks of the Ganges, but on the sides of the desolate shadow, they ask, Yes, the Ganges is not clean.
The belief of the masses will certainly gain success in cleaning the Ganges.
People are giving themselves to clean the Ganges.
The organisation is being implemented in a very simple way.
And the people of the country, on 24th April today.
We celebrated the 125th birthday of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April, and today in April 24, we celebrate the Panchayath Raj Day.
This is a good thing that has been going on, since the day of his birth, the largest combined villages of the Constitution Act, which gave us the Indian Constitution Act, served as a collaboration with the states of India, from April 14 to April 24 to 10 days of rural programme to India's Udaya.
Today, in April 24, I am celebrating the Panchayat Raj Day in Jharkhand, our majority tribal brothers, which has created a great deal of awareness.
How to strengthen democratic organisations in rural areas on all sides of India
How to make villages self-employed
How do the villages themselves plan for their development
In many villages of India, a number of events may take place in ten days, which may be less.
In the most fundamental ways, I express my good greetings to all the state governments and rural leaders who use it as a chance for the development of villages, for the benefit of the villages.
There has been awakening in villages, which is an instruction for Indian Udayat.
The source of India's rise is in village Udaya:
That's why we are paying attention to the village's rise, and will reach the desired benefits.
Over the past several years, there has been a need for measurement in the education sector.
Today, if there is one of the most important dreams of parents in every family, it is necessary to give children a higher education.
It's only after thinking about home, vehicle, etc.
In the minds of the people of the country like India, this feeling is the greatest strength.
That's why I'm supposed to be incurring to all parents and to discuss the practices of schools with children in a broad way.
If something rises in mind, then go to school and ask the teachers.
This awareness must be a part of the people that will lead to a reduction in our educational defects.
All governments in our country are paying greater attention to education and every government has made their own efforts.
It is true that educational institutions must be established, educational institutions should be expanded, schools and colleges should be established, teachers must be included and more and more children must go to school.
In a way, an attempt to spread education was found to be primarily obtained, it is also necessary.
But the more important significance on the expansion is to be on the management of our education.
We have done the largest task of expansion.
Now we have to focus on standard education.
We must be the primary aim of providing good education to all through the educational movement.
What is true is that we have to travel a long way.
But if we decide 125 crore people, a long journey will also be possible.
It is very necessary for Sharmila to make fundamental changes according to her.
India's universities can become world-wide competitor universities.
The extent to which education has importance, the same importance is also important, the same as the role of technology in education is increasing.
I hope that it will easily facilitate our education, and in some cases its consequences will start to appear in the eye.
They are the prime ministers. I speak from Piznor to Mona Karna.
In today's era, sports is more important than education for young people.
Of these, the team spirit must be sensitive, the best president, the nature, which will lead to their full growth.
This is what I say through my experience, because I am in the Indian Organisation, which has a good impact on my life.
It required a higher coordination.
Their widespreadness gave me a lot of heart and they had more enthusiasm, something to do.
I have been in the national student force at one time, and I know that there is a national vision that a new vision is born through such organizations.
I have experienced goods in my childhood, and I need to fill up a new force in these organisations and give new encouragement.
This time I keep some things in front of them.
During this season, I asked why our youth and all the organisers should not be involved in the enormous task of saving water.
How many circles, how many districts we can prevent external excretion.
I have to talk about the obligation of all of us today, people of the country.
I see this astonishing thing too.
You will be grateful that what party would give gas cylinders was the discussion of the last several elections, as the political situation in our country.
On the other hand, economic experts have pressurized the reduction of subsidies, due to which many groups have been formed and they have given suggestions and conclusions of subsidies.
These groups cost a lot of crores of rupees.
But today my breasts are supposed to be on the people of my country.
But in view of the account, more than 80 percent of these crore people went to the distributors, standing in line, writing and drove their subsidies.
That's not a small thing, people of the country.
If the government slightly disintegrates a tax bill, it will rain for the state in television and newspapers throughout the week.
Because they are forced to consider political leaders in a new perspective.
Even today, the country's economic experts are forced to think in a new perspective.
Even the world's economic experts, which possessed many possibilities, is a pretext for their views.
It must be addressed at some point.
It is a strange matter, however, however, that a million families have to leave the subsidies, and a million poor families have a replacement of gas cylinders, and a million families have been slightly slightly finished because of the breakdown of the subsidies, even though it appears simple to look at it, how much they can be achieved when they believe in the people.
I insist on all the political leaders that we are going everywhere, and that we must believe in the people and say something.
Even if you think you can't see the fruits of you.
We need to travel in this direction.
For example, the third position, some of my minds suggested why the 4th position workers should be chosen and why we should not trust their choices.
My mind is also supposed to know that there will be no ticket checkers at some railway points.
This is how many tests can be seen.
Once we believe in the people of the country, there will be serious consequences.
No political leaders have created this environment, and a million families of the country have formed.
A man named Ravi wrote to me: Good News everyday, a good job every day. Tell your officials to tell you about a good thing every day.
The worst news in every newspaper and media is that of breaking news.
Doesn't there be any good thing in our country with 125 crore people
A newspaper had also sent a letter to me a few days ago, saying we would not even publish a bad news on Monday, and we would only publish a decisive message.
It is true that there has been an environment of unnatural news.
Everyone feels good news and real news must be available to everyone.
Whatever a well-known person gives special attention, however beautifully it is explained, more benefits are available through good news.
The good news is sufficient for good actions.
It is true that the extent to which we strengthen the benefit, the extent to which the place of evil is reduced.
And if we obey the evil, the darkness shall go away, and surely shall go away.
You can also participate in it.
Rabi, you have given good advice, but please do not regret me.
We will join us in the form of a constructive effort, we will take part in the attempts to bring out the opportunistic things.
Kumbh Mela is the specialty of our country.
Kumbh Mela can be a tourist attraction center.
Many of the world's people have no knowledge of the fact that millions of people have come to the river bank for many days.
The festival is full of peaceful mind and peaceful environment.
These events, in a systematic manner, have achieved greater standards as part of the masses in the programme point of view.
I have been paying attention to many films related to the Simhastha Kumbh Mela for the last two days.
I want the Indian government's tourism sector and state government tourism sectors to take a photography rivalry.
We can ask people that you should distract the most important photographs.
It must be done.
In the midst, when the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh met me, he told me that special attention was paid to cleanliness.
Purifying is not only during this function, but from there it is aimed at purifying the idea of cleanliness in their minds.
At the time of the Kumbh Mela, I accept that there is a festival of spirituality, while I think it can be a social opportunity.
We can use the Kumbh Mela, how to increase our love on water, how we can sing the water and the news of water collection.
Man's voice, July 2019
And it shall come to pass, that you shall speak to me: but I seek to offer your words, and your words, and your words, and the voice of the mind, and to offer it to you.
Last time, I told you that Framchand had spoken of a book with their stories, and who would read it, I would have asked you to share their views as the Narendramodi secretary.
A large number of people have put their views on the books written about science, technology, renewal, history, culture, business and lifestyle.
Some others are asking me to talk about many other books.
Of course I'll talk about some other books.
But all this should be acknowledged that I don't have enough time to read more books.
But I think we have to go ahead with the experience that has been received in the last one month.
Friends, I have touched the voice of the mind about the safety of water, but even before this, it seems to me that a thing that touches your hearts is the most interesting thing for the ordinary man.
For a few days, it is a matter of mixing the entire country, which is water.
Several serious efforts have been being made to influencing water security across the country.
People are interpreting information about traditional methods.
The media has also pursued many small movements of water safety.
I am glad to know that the most beautiful state of the north-east, Megalia, is a water policy for itself, which has created a policy of water.
I am telling my blessings to its state government.
In Haryana, farmers are being encouraged to sustain crops that are not affected by low water supply and farmers.
Why shouldn't we use these festivals to protect water
Friends, some things in life are filled with enthusiasm in us:
It also gives us enthusiasm and new energy, especially children's achievements and their success.
And the things that I say now shall make you great and joyful, one thing.
We all know how much circumstantial the world is a word called cancer.
While the death is standing in the doors, these ten children have pursued the name of the country not only because of their miraculous activity, but also in their struggle for life-saving.
This month only in Moscow - World Children's Winners Games, world child gainers contested.
The incident was organised for competitions such as shooting, square, swimming, swimming, football, and table tennis.
These ten victors of our country won tensions and some of them won more than one tension.
I am very confident that, my loved countrymen, Chandrayan 2-Where the victory of India in the space will give you brightness and greatness.
Sanjay Haripura from Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga of Golkatha, B of Teluguna.
Many like Arvind Rao, from various parts of the country, Narendramodi secretary and MyGov are asking to talk about Chandrayan 2.
In terms of space, India must say 2019 as the best year.
Our scientists applied A-Sat in March, and then Chandrayan 2.
We have not been able to speak much more about the very important issue of A-Sat in the electoral process.
But the A-Sat missile is 300 kilometres above the ground in just 3 minutes.
On July 22, Thonga Chandrayaan smiled on a larger scale in the country on 2 applications.
Chandrayaan 2 - This goal is important in various angles.
Chandrayaan 2 will further strengthen our minds about the moon.
Even in our life we shall have to face temporary resurrections:
Today, through the voice of mind, I am proposing information about the most interesting competition for the country's student wealth and young people, and I appeal to our youth to join the competition.
Knowledge of space, India's space program and science technology will be part of the rivalry.
For example, what has to be done in rocket payments, how the artificial equipment stands on the surroundings, how we get information from the artificial cell, and what's A-Sat, many such things will take place in this competition.
In the MyGov Internet, information about this competition will take place on August 1.
I'm calling for my young friends, students...
I appeal to all schools, parents and enthusiastic teachers to work to win your school.
I encourage all student wealth to join them.
The most surprising thing is that the Indian government will take the highest number of students in every state to Sriharikota at its cost.
Moreover, in September, they will have a chance to see the sight of the Chandrayan land on the surface of the land.
The voice of our mind has been fastened to the clean movement in many times.
Likewise, efforts to purify are also inspiring the voice of the mind.
The journey, which began five years ago, today has established a new measure of cleanliness with the help of everyone's contribution.
I didn't say we had to bear the blessings of cleanliness, but the success of the pure movement till the public, beginning of the habitation of the opening, is the power of the commitment of 130 crore nations.
But we won't stop with this.
This movement is now traveling from unhealthy position to beauty.
Just a few days back, I had to know from the media about Yogesh Siini and his group.
Yogesh Sainey is a engineer who has broken the job he has seen in the United States and returned to serve the Indian mother.
A few years ago, he not only cleansed Delhi but also made a beautiful and transforming challenge.
He joined his team and started his work from the pipelines in Lodhi Corton.
You may remember how all the streets of Priyagaraj city have been painted on the Kumbh Mela.
I also knew that Johnesh Sainey and his group had shown their handfuls there.
We feel it experienced in the beauty of the clean movement.
The principle of wealth from the past must be strengthened in our society, which must be our cultural.
My countrymen, I had to read an interesting idea in MyGov in the past.
They have registered this, Mahmad Aslam, a resident of Shobian area of Jammu and Kashmir state.
I like the voice program of mind.
I am very glad to note that I have given an effective contribution to the village to unite society in my state, Jammu and Kashmir.
The program was arranged in June.
Muhammad said I think it would be the first activity that people should straighten with the government.
Many more things are involved in making this plan more interesting.
According to India's plans, sports competitions were held for children.
They were given sports equipment, Mahatma Gandhi's jobs, listed and tribal literacy.
In a way, this organisation is a big festival of public participation and a good festival of public awareness.
A large number of people participated in this development festivity in Kashmir.
While it was a matter of joy that the situation was done in the villages where we would return to the village, the government officials, who went to such remote villages, climbed up the hard mountainous roads and walked for a couple of days.
These officers also went to the border villages that have been shooting from across the border in Sadasarwamy and the border, not only with any fear, they travelled to the most horrific areas of Shobian, Bulwama, Kulkanow and Anantnak districts.
They have spent more than two days in these villages because of the impact of the welcoming of many officers.
In these areas, it is interesting to organise rural council meetings, confirming a large number of people's participation, and making plans for themselves.
New determination, new enthusiasm, wonderful consequences.
It also clarifies that all those who seek to sow barriers and humiliation at the evolution journey have ever succeeded in their atrocities.
Do you know how they have written about the time of Mari in their poems, Tattatreya Ramchandra Penter, who received the Gyan Peeth award
People from different cultures and languages all over India are happy to celebrate the mortality day.
In this season, if we look around us, the earth will be seen as if it had fought a Green war against him.
On all four sides, there is a new power encouraging.
In this sacred month, many devotees take care of, and take up the feast of abyss, and many are fasting, and have waited for festivals like Janmashtami and Naga Panchami.
During this time, Raksha Bandhan Pandika is also coming out of the love of brothers and sisters.
While we speak about the Mary period, this time, you will be happy to note that more than 4 years of devotees are participating in the Amarnath Yatra.
Since July 1, more than 3 lakh devotees have sighted in the sacred Amarnath cave.
The number of people who participated in this 60-day pilgrimage in 2015, more than this time, the number has been reduced in just 28 days.
I want to show my specific appreciations to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their circumambulation after the success of the Amarnath pilgrimage.
All those who have returned to the end of the journey are attracted by the people of the state and the feelings of ruins.
All this will be very useful for tourism in the future.
Even in Uttarakhand this year, Saratham has started a pious journey and more than 8 lakh devotees have come to Kedarnath alone in a month and a half.
For the first time since the terrible natural disaster that took place in 2013, people have purely traveled in the number of such achievements.
I'm asking you that there are some places of beauty in the season, wherever they go and play in the country.
Nobody else can be the greatest admonition than our country's people's feelings, feelings, tourism and pure tourism to see these beautiful places.
This beautiful, life-saving month of Mary will provide new energy, new hope and new aspirations among all of you.
Likewise, in August, Whiteen is facing the memories of the exit movement.
On the other hand, the country's people are now suffering from floods.
When we see the rains on television, we can see only one eye - wherever we see, flood, flooded water, transport stagnation.
I will return after a month's wait.
Today, people from all over the world will be celebrating Egypt on Monday.
Today, when India is enjoying Australia, I am telling my good wishes to the two marchers.
India won gold tension in the 1951 and 1962 Asian camps, India ranked 4th in the 1956 Olympics.
But fortunately, in the last few decades, we have been subjected to the lowest position in the layer.
The extent to which our position has fallen in the FIFA layer is also embarrassed to leave the mouth.
Though not only the EPL, but also the Spanish League, I see that Indian youth are growing interest in the football today.
The youngsters of India are watching TVs to know more about call phones.
At the same time, we can use this opportunity to try to take foot foot to every village and every street.
This is likely to be the FIFA Under-17 World Cup, in this year, we must try to drive out a new enthusiasm for the refreshment of football between the youth and all around.
I think this is a chance to brand India globally.
You'll be planning to go to tourism in the holidays, if you want to go to my poor student.
At least people go to foreign countries, most of whom go to tourism for 5 days and 7 days in every state.
Some go to other states except their states.
There is doubt that there will be a district that I do not go to India.
There is a greater power for tourism to create our lives, and now Indian youth are very interested in touring, their enthusiasm is increasing.
They don't travel on the path that everyone has passed, or built, they want to do something new, see something new.
I think it's a good sign.
There is also a common practice in our part that if the landlords are blackening their hands, others will flee themselves.
But it is joyous to create a tourism environment by keeping the same landmass.
This is the only beginning, so far more than ten thousand people have experienced musical land mining tourism in the environment located near Savener village near Nagpur.
This creates a new opportunity to see.
Can you give your contribution to cleanliness when you go to other places in this holiday
This could not be done very scientifically, but what is true.
Can you also act as a tourist in a strong combination with the point of view of cleanliness in the tourism center
Tourism in India is far behind in comparison to the world.
But if 125 crore people decide together to strengthen our tourism sector, we can embrace the world.
Come on, let's try to travel in this direction.
I don't like my young friends, someday of the holidays.
You also think of this.
Will you leave your holidays, the great years of life, and their significance go to the house
I'm putting a view to your child.
Can you develop a power in your holidays, can you add a new thing to glorify your rule
If you don't know swimming, you can decide if you don't know if I learn swimming in the holidays, if you don't know the cycle is running, I'll learn the cycle.
Even today, if I take two fingers in the calculation, don't I take a signature
How many types of capabilities do we have to develop our rule, huh
Why can't we learn them
Why shouldn't we remove our shortcomings
Why shouldn't we develop our energy
Now think, there is no need for big taste for this, no trainee is required, no more money is required, no big expenditure.
Similarly, other friends will also be interviewed.
I believe you must do this. Tell me what you're learning new.
My name is Abi Chaurvedi.
You are the prime minister of poverty, when you have been in the summer holiday, the summer heat of birds and birds, so we must put water for them in a balcony or in a utensil on the floor of the house, so that you may find them.
I was very glad when I did this work, through which my friendship was flown with many birds.
This time I ask you to repeat this in the voice of your mind.
He's reminded me of a good activity in connection with the phone.
I was asking you to fill yourselves in the soil utensils outside your house in the heat.
Abhi told me that he was doing this work throughout the year, so that many birds would love him.
Mahadevi Varma, one of the world's great poets of Hindi literature, had a lot of affection on their birds.
And in his poems I will not let you go away, neither will I fill the famine with cereals, nor will I fulfil the cold wine anywhere.
Kooke, a resident of Mysore, has put forward a very tactical view.
Have we ever given them water
Shilpa, thanks to you my heart, you've put forward a very emotional idea very naturally.
You must have heard more about digital India.
Some people may have this digital India as a matter of youth in some city.
If you pay App for these peasants' facilities on your mobile phone, you will get all information on agriculture and volume in your hand.
What is the situation in the markets, what is the situation in the markets, how good harvesting is, how many information can be obtained from what kind of pesticides are supposed to be.
And if you ask them any questions, they recompense it or make you understand.
I want my peasant brothers to pay App to these farmers' facilities on their mobile phones.
We have attempted to produce assets for water supply through Manreka.
There may be a number of such awakening villages in the country, a number of predecessor farmers, and a number of aware citizens.
I welcome it.
There were about 612 crore diabetes patients in India in 2014.
Statistics show that 3 percent of the deadly deaths are due to diabetes.
Diabetes will be of two types, one type 1 other type 2.
Type 1 is genetic, hereditary, because of parents and children.
Type 2 is due to habits, due to age, due to obesity.
Since diabetes has caused concern throughout the world, it has been formed as the center of the world health day on 7th day.
Our lifestyle is a major reason for this.
Physical work is decreasing.
Can we take a pregnancy on 7th April in our life as a result of the failure of diabetes in our lives
If every citizen of my country is healthy, my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we don't get a medical check-up.
It is only after the situation has worsened that there has been a diabetes disease for a long time.
There is a reduction in our country in comparison to the number of compound patients in other countries.
By proper treatment this disease can be accomplished .
India must be freed from these diseases.
But without your cooperation, it cannot be eliminated only by governments, doctors and medicines.
Therefore, I ask the people of the country to suppress diabetes and destroy tuberculosis.
Many important events will take place in the country's people, especially in April 14, on the birthday of Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His 125th birthday was celebrated throughout the year.
On April 14 this year, I have received the favour that Baba Saheb Ambadger would go to their birthplace Mhow.
And they gave us all that they need to be an excellent dweller, and all that they need.
We can see him as a good dwelling place by traveling through the way he saw.
Vikram will start in a few more days.
New Year is celebrated in different forms in different states.
My new year is good for everyone.
I told you that you can hear my heart's voice anytime, you know it... in about 20 languages.
Let's ask you when you're nice.
Let's hear it on your mobile phone.
I'm glad to join you.
Blessed be upon you, O people of the land, my countenance.
I tell everyone good news for the Egyptian Festival.
My young friends, you're all looking forward to the election on one side.
There's a very good enthusiasm.
You may have known that India FIFA Under-17 is going to be held in our country next year in 2017.
What I say is insisting that there is a growing interest in the football, but if such a big opportunity is to stop India's doors, can we only be able to save our obligations from being a proprietor
I kept asking you for the last time that you're going where you're going.
Crores of foreign countries have lived in the country's work that cannot be done by the tourism sector, which is not done by our cultural sector, which cannot be done by the state governments and the Indian government.
When they see all the photographs they have done, it is really enjoyable.
We must take this task forward, as well as do this time, but join another thing this time.
Not just sending photos, but also revealing your instruments, and visiting new places, many things can be known.
India is an individual country.
If you start traveling once you want to see, you will be traveling all the time and you will be enjoying it.
We generally consider it to be away from the landmines.
When we see films about those who are there, we will know what's going on there.
My young friends are sure to help me in this work.
We will be working together to become politics, organisations, social, civilians, and all of us.
Your ruling shall be identified by it, and your self-confidence shall increase abundantly.
They come to our homes to sell milk, sell the newspapers, come to the posters, sometimes the vessel sellers and clothing sellers.
Have we ever asked if you want to pay their thirst when the heat stops
Only then can one drop of rain water be used without liquid.
The initial period of farmers' farming is very important.
But we must also think of the people of the country what is happening if there is no water.
This time you may have noticed the attempt to create 5 lakh lakes and waterfalls.
It is still in my memory that people are scared when I hear the name of TB at my young age.
If you want to get rid of tuberculosis then proper treatment is important , complete treatment is important .
If you leave half-hearted treatment in the middle, the disease will return.
Give me Missed foot, whenever you want time, you can hear the voices of the old mind, ask in your own language.
And it shall come to pass, that the people of the land shall be my favour to all you.
This is one of the voices of my great mind in 2015.
The next voice program will be held in 2016.
If one goes to see, it can be said that every festival will leave the hope of the next festival.
Sometimes it may also be said that India is the economy that is suppressed by the festive festivities.
These are the reasons for the economic activity of the people under the society.
In this context, I'm telling all the people of the country of goodwill for the Christmas festival, and I'm telling goodwill for the coming 2016.
In 2016, new enthusiasm, new policy and new commitment will bring all of you to new peaks.
Until the radicality, the world is hot, the natural betrayals, and the discord created by man.
From all these things, human society must live a peaceful life - what can be more joyous than this
Chawley Savarcher is their season for tourism, a large number of domestic and foreign tourists, people go to many places for Christmas celebrations.
I welcome Ganesh's views as much as our tourist destinations are clean as India's ideas and images are found in others' minds.
I'm taking Ganesh's comments among the people.
When we come to the tradition of immense demonstration, that is, if the residents come to our houses, do we feel that we should wash the house immediately, clean it
Similarly, we must keep our country's tourist spots, centres and tourist spots clean and clean, in which we need to have special strengthening.
I am happy that there are reports coming from Natang about cleanliness.
Even before the beginning day, I have been reflecting my appreciations to media friends about this matter.
Because they are looking for small and good things, they take a look at the people.
I want to share with you that I have now read the news that he has built hundreds of toilets only by his work in Bhojpura village as the most sacred task.
The country has seen a rapid improvement because of the uninterrupted efforts of many.
The country's 125 crore people are walking on a progressive road with their shoulders and prospering the country.
Excellent education, high-profile capabilities, increasing job opportunities:
Life insurance programs for civilians, banking facilities, global trade, construction of new jobs, etc. are being carried out on one side.
All of the simple families who cannot even go to the banks can now be easily credited through the Mutra program.
Indians have begun to understand that the milk of yoga art has started all over the world.
When the whole world celebrated the International Yoga Day, how much of our country's pride has come to us, isn't it
This feeling will happen to us when our thoughts and thoughts are in large quantity.
And when the eyes of a ghee, and his mother opened the mouth of Jesus, who can forget that she saw the oxen there
Likewise, the Indians felt the importance of India every day.
Now talks about cleanliness are reflecting at every house.
This is also a big deal of concern for the government officials engaged in the task of bringing electricity to those villages, feeling that they are responsible for a peasant, poor, poor, young, mother-in-law, who have been reproaching their lives.
Can't I alone do everything
But when I tell you about this, don't I give my contribution
A simple immigrant can also join me with an app called Narendra Modi on his mobile phone.
I'm discussing simple things in this.
It is a matter of joy to me that people also share many things with me.
Come, let us assemble us in the matters of the interests of the people of the people, and bring them to the good thing, and give them observation to receive their good things.
Well, young friends, on August 15, I forwarded a fundamental idea of Stand up India from the Red Fort.
After that, the attention of the government was laid out in all sectors.
Can India become the start up capital
Start Up Indian, Stand up India has brought a great opportunity to the younger community.
They are young friends, the Indian government starts in full swelling on January 16 for the startup of India and Stand up India.
We have a sustained opinion about the startup that the digital world is the only people in the information technology sector.
Understanding India's needs, we must make changes.
The intellectuality of our younger generations is widespread throughout the country.
This startup should not be left out of some towns in India, but it should spread unlikely to overthrow India's fingers.
Therefore, I appeal to all state governments that we must take this program forward.
I'm surely going to share this with you on January 16.
I'm looking forward to your above opinions.
I am young companions, on January 12, Swami Vivekanandar's birthday.
There are millions of people in this country, like me.
From 1995 to January 12, we celebrate Swami Vivekanandar Jayanti as national youth.
This year, from January 12 to January 16, the events are sustained in Chhattisgarh's Raipur.
I'm asking my young comrades, particularly that you should send your comments directly to me through my Narendra Modi App.
I want to understand, understand what is in your mind.
Tilip Chauhan, a resident of Ahmadabad in Gujarat, is a transparent capabilist, who followed the Accessible India day in his school.
Thank you, Teleph.
Sometimes, when we meet humans like him in our lives, there will be unanimous thoughts in our minds.
The vision of humans like this will be based on our thoughts.
There is no doubt that there is a significance for words.
This year, when the Indian government launched an interesting India program, I was organized to participate in it.
But in some districts of Tamilnadu, especially in Chennai, I had to go there because of the horrific floods, I could not participate in the incident.
Despite not being able to participate in this event, my mind was supposed to have thoughts about it.
News needed, technology, organisations need, understanding, to ease all forms of schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, easily accessible vehicles stations, lifts, language writings in the form.
They should not be cut off in the curtains.
Is not the plans made even for goods and poor
Efforts were made a few days ago about how the user was simplely taking advantage of the plan.
The amount of subsidies for gas cylinders in our country is being paid.
Crores of rupees are spent for this, but no case has been filed for this.
The government has made a small change in granting regulations to know whether it is real users or not, whether it is at the right time.
Nearly 15 crore people are pilots of the Bahl gas program in November's monthly vote.
The bank accounts of these 15 crore users are straight into subsidies.
This is happening without intermediaries, iPariso and any possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, the movement for a source identity card, on the other hand, the public opens its bank account, and on the other hand, the central state governments are preparing a list of users, and the task of linking it to the base identity card and bank account.
There were colours of accusations on the project.
In many places, money is being directly placed in the bank accounts of workers working.
So far, approximately 35, 40 plans have been straight into the bank accounts of users up to Rs 40,000 crore.
A golden moment for the Indian Republic on January 26, the people of the country.
Baba Saheb Ambadkar is a great combination of his 125th birthday.
We have to move it forward.
Only during the elections, much publicity is expressed as 'the pure obligation' and the walls will be placed on layers.
We will speak more about all the debts in the election season, but why shouldn't we talk about the same obligation in everyday life
This year, when we celebrate the 125th year of Baba Saheb Ambedkar as a festival, can we organise a poetry competitor, poetry competitorship, poetry competitorship, negotiating competition in schools, colleges, our villages and towns, in different communities, in the unions
Look at the extent to which a huge culmination will be built, when 125 crore people are supposed to be slaughtered one after another with suppression
On January 26, when we celebrate Republican Tirthankara, cannot we clean and decorate the idols of the leaders of the country in our city, through civilians, through school and school students
I predict that it would not be done as citizens.
And afterwards we reveal the foolishness of the idols in which we are full of emotions to keep the idols of the leaders.
Can we continue to purify a society and a country
On January 26, we will join us in this effort.
The people of the country, once again lived a new year for 2016.
Thank you very much.
On the other hand, the Christmas festival will start.
There is a separate place for the festivals in social life.
Sometimes the festivals are beneficial for wounds, sometimes they give new encouragement.
But sometimes when the day of the festival comes, they are very sorry.
From every corner of the world, information about natural sites has continued.
So far, there are reports of a disaster events.
We are now feeling how fast the impact of wine changes is spreading.
State governments are engaged in repayment and left relief operations in the entire swelling.
The central government is always working with the shoulders.
I firmly believe Tamilnadu will accelerate the fast-growing route and will give its contribution to the country's progress.
But there is a feeling that there is a change when we face such a shameful environment all around.
Until about 15 years ago, the natural betrayal had been associated with the agriculture sector, because when all natural betrayers were only with dryness and famine.
States, public society, civilians and small and big institutions have to function in the field of science.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I had to speak to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
I suggested that the South Asian countries should join us and have a combined operation to be prepared to confront the dealers.
I am happy to have a commentary on this and a conception of the best methods to confront the betrayal.
This is the best beginning.
I speak Lakwinder Singh from the Punjab state of Jalandhar.
We are engaged in a natural way farming here, and leads many to agriculture.
One of the reasons for this is that you are making natural way of agriculture:
It is more joyful that you understand the problems of farmers, not only do it.
Your concern is justified, but it is not only in any Punjab and Haryana states:
This is usually the whole of India, and traditionally we burn the agricultural outbreaks after the consequences.
We didn't know about the evil of burning like this before, all do, so I do.
Because of this, it has continued and increased, which is now associated with weather changes.
After the impact of the clutches began to accelerate the cities, the protests of the people began to shout.
That's the real concern you reveal.
For the first time, our agricultural friends must be trained and explained the truth.
This may result in the delay in burning of other humid humid humid humidations, reducing the trauma and reaching the land ready for the next trend.
But this is not the right regulation.
Other velane spendings are also very priceless.
They are natural routes sweeping.
We're sweating them.
Not only this, if we make them small pieces, they shall be for the feet.
Secondly, if we burn them, the layer on the ground will come out.
Think about a moment, brothers of peasants, see, our bones are stable, our heart works well, our kidney works quickly, everything is fine, but if the skin on the body is burned, can we live
As the skin of our body is burnt, we cannot survive our life, as if we burn the skin of the earth's mother is burnt, and the layer is burned upon our land.
Therefore, we must take action in this direction.
I have a chance to speak to the peasants who are engaged in the black money.
They shared their fine experiences with me.
They had to spend a hectare of Rs 50,000, 15,000 to eliminate their lives after they had hired to live before.
There was no work until they came to the tractors to take them back.
Last time I spoke about body organ donation in the voice of mind.
I told you about the NOTO free phone number.
Many of the film actress Raveena Dandan added to it.
Physiotherapy can save many lives.
What can be bigger than that
Registration centre was launched on November 27, involving details of patients who seek organs and physical organs.
I am confident that awareness will be widespread in this sector, and I believe that those who need certainly will get help at the right time.
This help is not available in any way, because there is no one to donate.
I had already said that on December 3, we had to sympathize with the opposite powers every day.
Physically and physically transforming capabilities are unprecedented and unparalleled.
Sometimes when they are seen as cylific substances, there is pain in the mind.
Sometimes they appear to be contemplated and expressed.
But if we change our vision, they will also be a vision for us, and the achievements will be a dry power for us.
Their mental commitment, their confrontation of life, their ability to convert the complications into chariots, thirst and great appreciation.
I want to talk about the 40-42-year-old Javeth Ahmad.
In 1996, the extremists shot at Jawat Ahmed in Kachmir.
But Javeth Ahmed did not accept defeat.
The wounds of radicalism did not make him angry.
There was no part of his indignation. And a man who did not make any crime had such a punishment, his young age was lost, but there was no anger and anger in his mind.
Despite not collaborating with the body, he has been dedicated to children's education for the last 20 years.
As a social servant, as an aware immigrant, he is doing a peace revolution today as the sovereign sovereign of the opposite.
Will Javeth be sufficient for all Indians to observe their life
I want Javeth to recall his life, his sympathy and his dedication sentiment on December 3.
Even though I have been able to speak to them today because of the deficit of time, Javeth is snatching India's embroidery, such conceptive islands are snatching, encouraging to live and breaking the way.
In that way, on December 3, we have to be encouraged by them.
In many cases, we are required to act on governments.
The central-level populations, slightly below the middle class, are constantly associated with the sections of the state and state, who are the victims, the victims, the victims, the oppressed.
As an ordinary citizen, they may have a bad experience with government employees in some way.
These couples spend their wealth in their resting life in poor people's membrane.
The total number of people belonging to the tribal community is the smallest village in the Balasore district of Orissa.
The poor village is suffering from malaria.
Jamuna Mani Singh, an Asian soldier from this village, decided that I would ensure that anyone from this Thantaka would not die of malaria.
He suppressed the struggle against Malaria and prepared to face the entire village.
Any such number of Jumna hours may be in the country.
Recommend not only reading but also others.
The opposite power is the largest power.
Participate good events about this, share these books, take part in it.
The people of the country are deeply concerned about climate change all over the world.
On December 14, national energy saving day.
Several programs are being implemented in government terms.
The LED tube movement is moving forward.
On the night of Poornami, I told you to tied the street lights and wet one hour in the full moonlight, and sort it out.
My friend sent a combination to me, and I had a chance to see it.
I felt that it should be shared with you.
He is seeking to utilize the sun force, fighting with darkness, working according to his name, he has formed a group of women.
Landar, which operates by the sun, has begun a sword that can give light to the lightlight.
He is giving these launder details at a fee of 100 rupees per month.
People buy these lights in the evening and give them light in the morning.
I know about 500 households are giving such lightning launders until I ask.
The Nurjahan work is being done throughout the day for the lighting of these launders.
But a better start has been raised.
In a very short period, 66 lakh people received 42,000 crores through Prime Minister Mutra's plan.
I am happy that 24 lakhs of these 66 lakh users are women.
I had already said that clean India would create such professionalists.
They have proved it in Salesh Phonce.
I know that he is doing this by buying a tanker, and at least paying a loan of 2 lakh rupees to the bank.
This is our goal of the Mutra programme.
Mumta Sharma, a resident of Bhopal city, also said the same thing about her.
He also received 40,000 rupees from the bank under Prime Minister Mutra's plan.
He is working on handling.
Due to non-payment of interest, it is almost 1000 rupees per month.
His family also had a good job.
But I want to expand this program more popularly.
All our banks must approach it with greater interests and come forward to help small businessmen in large numbers.
In fact, they act as economic directors of the country.
These are the economic powers of the country.
We want to encourage them.
It's good, but it must be more and more special.
Rashtrayam Jakrayam's farm, the internal wigilance is the price of freedom, that is, it means that it is the price we give for freedom to be constantly aware.
The country's unity must continue to shout.
But I'm looking forward to more advice.
I'm confident that your above advices will certainly be in a humiliation.
My brothers and sisters, the winter is starting.
My good wishes, Jai Hind, once more than the people of the country
I have a chance to speak to all of you again through the voice of mind.
Today, cricket competition is being played in Mumbai for the fifth day between India and South Africa.
This 5-day cricket competition has been called Gandhi Mandela.
Hence, the interest on the final rivalry has increased.
My good wishes to all the players.
Today I am telling my appreciations to the tear station friends of Al India Radio.
That's why I am telling all the comrades of the eye radio station and my heart is full of happiness and greetings.
I once again want to mention Kerala.
Students from Duya Mari Upper Primary school from Chittoor area of Kerala have sent a letter to me.
The letter was specialized in many ways.
One, these students registered their fingerprints and drew the Indian mother's turmoil into a huge cloth.
The Indian mother has sent me the image of India.
I am surprised to know why they have brought their fingerprints to the film.
But after reading their letter, I did what they had sent to me index.
They are engaged in the movement of awareness about organ donations.
About 80-year-old Vasant Rao Suduke, Maharashtra, has been conducting a movement for a long time.
He says he wants to celebrate body part donation as a function.
All this is happening to me through phone and many news and information.
Devesh from Delhi has also sent a message to me.
I speak to Devesh from Delhi - I am very happy that the government's efforts to take part in body donations and the policy plans about it.
It is very important for me to appreciate that the goal of a body body donation of ten lakhs of state-owned countries is very important.
More than 12 lakh kidneys , heart and liver organ donation is needed annually in the country .
But in a country with 125 crore people, we can only implement only 5,000 organ transformations.
It is necessary to give light to one lakh eyes every year.
But we can only give eye to just 25,000 people.
If 4 people need eyes, we can only give it to one person.
Efforts have been made to provide guidance to state governments.
Some states have made a good improvement in the efforts to simplify the management system.
I am telling you that Tamilnadu has an important role in body organ donation.
A 24-hour-long Helpline serves as a number of 1800 11 4770.
Our ancestors are not even a honey thrilling fungi
That is, they have said that the joy of doing sacrifice is through the words of honey Thyakdeen Bunjeetha.
In the past, Delhi's G.
This surgery was successful, and a life was saved.
After a few days, we are also celebrating the Deepavali festival.
We also celebrated Eid and Democratic Chaturthi festivals.
The Indian African Conference will be held in India's capital New Delhi from October 26 to 29.
This is the first time that such a big conference will take place on Indian soil.
54 African countries and Union leaders have been invited to participate in the conference.
Counting the population of our two countries is one third of the world.
Many millions of years ago, India and Africa were the only geopolitical and later they were two parts of the Indian Ocean.
There are large numbers of unity among us.
India's wild animals and Africa's wildlife can be seen with many comparisons.
Natural resources also have great wealth.
About 27 lakh Indians have been living in Africa for years.
There are links between India and Africa to economic, cultural and political.
But most of all, India is playing a major role in training the younger generations of African countries.
More than 25,000 African students have been educated in India in the development of human resources.
This time, the Indian government, especially the Human Resource Development Ministry, has organised a most important programme.
Competitions have been organized to write poetry amongst the students of all schools connected with the CBSE and increase their contributions.
Thousands of school students wrote information about Indian African relations.
Many millions of school students saw this museum, and the villagers saw what was the role of Annal Gandhians in connection with the relations between Africa and India, and the people knew how his impact was on the minds of the two landed people.
There were many important roles in this competition.
A poem is my mind, which is loved by me, so I want to read it to you.
I am conveying my best wishes to all students, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resources, who have participated in this box.
On August 15, 2014, I stated that Sansad Adarsh village Jojna was a member of the parliamentarian village program.
After that, many members of friends have completed the work.
They are in full swing.
Last month, a commentator was organised in Bhopal.
In this case, leaders from villages, district rulers, some parliamentarians and officers from the Central State States, together with the village plans, were deeply involved.
Through this, a number of new comments have emerged, in which they are motivated.
I surely want to take care of some things.
Jharkhand is one of the most tribal residents.
Unfortunately, it was recalled when we spoke about Jharkhand, including Mao extremists, bomb cultures and massacres.
Many sections have been destroyed by the impact of the left-wing extremists.
But our senior parliamentary member Kariya Munda, who is a deputy general secretary of the parliament, from that part, has sacrificed his life to the tribal people.
He began to go there, cautioned confidence in the minds of the people, attempted to give life to state organizations and encouraged the authorities to work there.
He established a country to bring growth to that area, which has been roaming in a long-term boycott.
Besides the infrastructure facilities in the village program, a successful effort to create awareness among the people took place in this Barsi village of Jharkhand state.
I am telling them my goodwill, a respected parliamentary member.
Other arrangements are being held, and he has made a special renewal about this.
He handed over a job to students studying in schools there.
He asked school students studying in the upper classes to keep their parents in this class.
The school was in that way to provide education to students and their parents in the morning and evening.
These children gave lessons to nearly 550 uneducated senior citizens.
Look, without any budget in society, without any interference, how big a change has been achieved only through psychological determination without any other special facility
This is the singing of Dwaraboodi village Panchayat.
This village is known for production of black pepper and black buffaloes.
They started the Karumbhu festival on March 11 in this village.
He has attracted our attention to the right thing.
I want to remind you of one thing, people of the country, after the Deepavali festival last year, the media has organized a movement in our country, especially in our country.
Your opinion, however much we try to clean up before the festivals, is the right thing to continue to implement it even after the festivals.
This is how our activity must be during every general event.
I today express my appreciations to all the media in India.
On October 2, when the movement of Gandhians' birthday and clean India was started and completed for a year, it was very good to participate in the program called Safai Gri, which was organised by the India Dude Group.
For the last one year, he has been encouraging cleaning works through ETV, and there are reports of this in his newspapers, but he only pays attention to the decisive tasks.
He has joined 51 lakh children from around 55 to 56,000 schools in Andhra and Telugu in the pure India movement.
Towards the public, the railway stations, the shrines, the hospitals, and the parks, are conducting a movement of cleanliness in many places.
These reports also strengthen the creation of clean India.
The ABP News channel has launched a program titled 'India my country.'
In order to predict how much awareness of cleanliness has occurred among the people, they have sown the idea of cleanliness in the people of the country.
The NDTV organised a movement that would create clean India.
We have many channels and many newspapers in our country, though I cannot tell everyone's names because of lack of time, everybody carried this movement.
Over the past several years, the village has been pursuing cleansing, and has been pursuing purifying every generation.
A few years ago, the governor wrote in the letter that the village was awarded the most clean village in Asia.
I am glad that a village in the Megalia state of our country's remote northeastern part has been engaged for years.
This has become the culture of the village.
Such events give us all hope that our country is surely clean.
I told the people of the country that when I spoke from the bricks base on August 15, the corrupt country was overturned.
My good wishes to all my young social friends.
In the last budget, we made an important announcement.
Accordingly, you can pay your gold to the bank, just as you receive interest in your investment amount, and you can get the golden interest that is deposited in the bank.
Now the gold will be in the bank, but the money will be paid to you through the bank's interest.
Now tell me, the people of the country, don't wear money
Does the gold that has been supplied unnecessarily change as a complete power of life
Don't keep the house loose.
Do not misunderstand the use of the two advantages of its defence and circulation.
We don't have to buy gold, we don't have to defend gold, and nobody will stole the paper.
I am surely dedicated to the people of the country this program that provides protection next week.
But we have so far used the other country's gold currency, or have been using foreign gold trunks.
Why shouldn't we have an independent index in our country
Therefore, before the sacred day of Danderus in the coming week, the Indian gold currency will be released by 5 grams and 10 grams of Ashoka cycle.
With this, 20 grams of gold can be provided to the people.
I am sure that this new program will create a new change in the economic growth path, and I hope your entire cooperation will be achieved.
On October 31, the people of the country, the iron man, Sardar Valpai Pahal, was born on their day.
When the only India is considered as the best India, the whole of India will reflect on their minds.
For India's unity, this massive man has won the largest contribution.
Not only these individuals, but the beauty that has given us greatness, it shall not be left to us.
Hence, only individuals are the mantra for unity.
Peace, goodness and unity are the roots of growth.
For the last several years, there has been an unanimous movement on October 31.
I have already got the goodbye to participate in it.
This time, I have been told that arrangements are being held in various areas and people are preparing for unity with enthusiasm.
The solidarity movement is actually a trend towards growth.
In other words, the insurgency for development is a solidarity trend.
Come on, sir, let's tell them our worker Angels.
We advance the unity mantra.
And you, brothers and sisters, all you shall be engaged in the preparation of the convocation of the day.
Step in the joy of the Deepavali festival, but I ask my parents to see the color of our children without any effect, and we must be clean.
And I will go to the land of Britain the next day of Deepawali, the people of the country.
This time my trip to Britain is very interesting.
There is a special reason for this.
When our children go to study in Britain, I firmly believe that this memoir of Baba Saheb Ambassador will be a tourist place for them and a place of conception.
As far as he is concerned, learn and live for the country. This is the news of Baba Saheb's ambatore.
Many years ago, the tasks of Lord Basavaswar to give power to democracy and women are one thing to know.
The dedication of Bhagwan Basaveswar's statue to the world in London is an excellent example of how many years ago the idea of the greats of India was observed.
When such an event occurs, the minds of all the people of the country are filled with jeopardy.
Your suggestions are the colors that came to me.
Then, with your letters, programs are being prepared in the Al India Radio, discussions are being carried out by government officials, some attempts are being made to make solutions to them when they write about their problems.
We need to learn many languages in a country like India.
It is true that even though I have tied up some languages, I can't get all these languages.
In your language, I'm sure I'll try at 8 o'clock in the night entering your mind.
Look how close our relationship is developed.
Last time the time was over a year:
Today we replace the leg in the new year.
I'm sorry to the people of the country once again.
This is the twelfth day of the voice of the heart, which is my pleasures to all you, of the people of the land.
There is great significance of popular power in public opinion.
There is an idea based on my life, because of which I have great faith in the power of this people.
But the voice of the mind has learned many things, they have embraced as experiences, all of us understand how great the power of the people is.
Our ancestors have made clear that the energy of the people is Macheson.
I can say that there is great power in the minds of our ancestors, in the minds of my experiences.
In this case, I have expressed my appreciations to Al India Radio, and they have not seen these suggestions as merely hours, and have seen them as the expectations of the masses.
According to the administration, information must be at the top and the guidance must be downward from May.
Who will think that the voice of the mind will be inspired by the information
But this has become the same.
On October 2, I said we are celebrating the birthday of Gandhians.
At one time, there were doors for the country, but shouldn't it be the doors for feeding
No more, I'm gonna buy something slowly.
I am happy to note that in the last one year, the retail sales are about two points.
It is difficult to expel subsidies to the middle-class populations and middle-class sections of the community.
Nevertheless they fled it.
Is this not a peace revolution
Is this not the expression of the people's power
Despite the official circle of state sectors, the governments must learn the singing of the powerful, powerful and determined.
Whatsoever I believed, after the voice of the mind, they all turned to me surely.
That's why today I want to repeat a number of crores of rupees to the power of the people through the voice of the mind.
The people also considered small things I have said, and they have made themselves for the welfare of the nation, and they have joined them.
What can be more joyful than that
This time I thought of dealing with a new approach in the voice of the mind.
I urge the people of the country to contact you through the telephone, register your questions and your advice.
The suggestions from all parts of India are supposed to be that there is no part of the invitation.
It's a pleasant experience.
All adults have suggested.
It was also comfortable to hear some suggestions, and my team members are paying attention to the other.
You may have spoken for a couple of minutes, but your suggestions and reports are very important for me.
The government must pay its full attention to your advice.
On all four sides, negativity is generally full of negative ideas.
But my experience is different.
Moreover, in particular, calls from the alternative elites, including more calls from those with eye defects.
They cannot see televisions and may be a major reason why they need to see radio.
Pawan Acharya, a part of the Alwar region of Rajasthan, is participating in a consultation with me.
I want Pawan Acharya to listen to their advice and follow it.
My name is Pavan Acharya and I belong to the Alwar part of Rajasthan.
During the Deepawali festival, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asks the people of the country to appeal to the people of the country to use more soiled lamps.
Moreover, while using soil streams, the environment is not polluted, it is asking for thousands of manipulation poor to be employed.
During the festive festive festivities, when we listen to their advice, I pray before the people of the country that the soil lights will be supplied to our houses, but its light will live in the poor family.
During the democracies, I had the chance to spend some time with the three.
While the 50 years of war with Pakistan ended in 1965, an exhibition of Anjali means to be a virtue near India Gate in Delhi has been organized.
We are questioning the prestigious moments of the war, the unprecedented pride of our soldiers and sacrifices, and there are no photographs or films in that period.
If you want to build history, you must understand the numerators of history as well.
History connects us to our roots.
Cleanliness must be our natural, and we must give it the means.
I didn't think it was wrong.
I am well aware that the country's parliament is also involved in discussions about cleanliness.
On the other hand, what else can be the matter of pride of the country than the two children of the country speak on the other side of the parliament
The movement of opinions has led to a climate against pollution, awakening on cleanliness.
Do you know what Gandhians said
Once he wants to choose one between freedom and cleaning, I would first like cleaning and then he would be free of the country.
The Gandhians were primarily important than the release.
Kulson Aroda from Delhi has registered a report on the MiGov Internet.
Tin Dayal has already wanted to know about their centuries.
Even last year, I had told him that many types of fashioned clothes, many types of clothes, but that they had to be dressed.
I'm just asking you to get something out of it.
Last time you've almost overwhelmed sales.
How many poor did this benefit
Whatever work the government cannot spend a lot of crores of rupees, you have been able to do with little help.
This is the popular power of myself, so I ask you again about this.
My heart is also glad to the people of the land, even to another thing.
I want to share this with you.
In May I went to Kolkata, the family members of Subhas Bose came to meet me.
His brother-in-law, son Chandra Bose, arranged for the meeting.
In the last week, Subhas Bose's more than 50 family members are coming to the prime minister's house.
Can you imagine how much joyful it gives me
Many of the family members of Subhas Babu live in other countries.
Everyone comes to this particularly because of this, do I know how much joyful it is
I'm waiting for them to welcome them.
We must take this as a habit.
I want the youth of the country to try to join themselves in the voters' list, and to take part in the vote.
I'm sure about one thing in the election season, first vote, then everything else.
Everyone must do this pure work.
Among them, I met a seventh class studyer Kshitiz Pande.
Banaras teaches seventh class in Cantharia Vidyalaya of Hindu University.
Similarly, there was a chance to meet a young woman named Sonam Patel.
The 9-year-old girl Sathavraj Patel, who lives in Sundarpur in Varanasi, is her daughter.
She is a very poor family woman.
The whole song is singing under the head, but the biggest thing is that when she asked about any source of singing, she responded to it and gave its English explanation and Hindi language.
When I asked her father about this, she said she was telling it from her 5th year old.
And he also surprised all of us in the family.
This had a great impact on me.
Some children have an interest in popularity, but children's son-in-law have no such intention.
I only felt that God gave her some special power.
A special thing I met these two children during my visit to Kasi.
I wanted to share this with you.
The voice of your mind once a month should be made once a week because of this we get more symptoms.
Well, they, don't you know what you want to do from me
Now it's better to have a month.
The voice of the mind is over a year.
Do you know how much Subhas Babu used the heaven
He started a broadcast in Germany, and for the people living in India, he spread his views through radio on free hunting.
The beginning of the Asad Hindu radio was carried out by an independent report.
He broadcast radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjab, Urdu and Pashtu.
Even me, my radio broadcasting has been completed for a year.
Your contribution is something I can't value.
Give me my good life again to all of you.
My beloved people, my beloved people, my love for all you.
Once again, my voice of my heart is a good thing to know you.
People in the southern part of the country are celebrating the festival and yesterday the Raksha Bandhan festival is celebrated all over the country.
The Indian government has sought social security and has embraced many new programs in public interest.
It gives me great pleasure that in a very short time, everyone has joined themselves in these programs.
On Raksha Bandan's day, I had asked our sisters to take advantage of these defence plans.
I have been informed that about 11 crore families have been associated with this program in a short span of time.
I am happy that half of the users are in the form of mothers and sisters.
I think this is a good sign.
I am telling all mothers and sisters that Raksha Bandhan is a sacred sportsman.
About a year ago, the people began to implement their plans in a larger way.
Several questions and doubts raised that a program that cannot be completed in 60 years could be implemented in such a short time.
But it is a matter of joy that all the sectors involved in implementing this program, all branches of banks, with full power and mind, have been successful.
Even though they were told to start possibilities, they have saved 22,000 crores of rupees.
The banking sector is one of the main incentives of the economy, which has gone to poor homes.
Today 1.
25 lakh bankers are working in the field.
Through this, youth have been given the opportunity to work.
Now tens of thousands of people have become powerful to take overdraft due to their plans.
The poor have hoped to get bank loans.
Once again, I'm telling all those associated with it my best wishes and applaudments, and I appeal to all the poor that you don't break any connection with the banks.
The banks don't leave you in any way.
We are bringing banks to the doors of your homes, do not leave it, take it seriously.
We must have money in all of our bank accounts.
I have no hope that you will certainly do this.
Last few days ago, the events and violence in Gujarat had calm down the entire country, which is a natural sentiment.
There is such a demand in the soil of Gandhi and Sardar, which causes deep distress and pain to all the people of the country.
Peace, unity, brotherhood - this is the right path:
On the progressive road, we must all travel by standing on the shoulders with the shoulders.
Progress can only be solved for all our problems.
India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru went to Buddhist Gaya.
I prefer to participate in the event of Buddhist religious witnesses throughout the world.
My favorite peasant brothers, once again I want to share my heart's voice with you.
I am ready to accept any advice on peasants' interests, and I have said many times.
My peasant brothers, don't be afraid of peasants.
I assure you that if anyone attempts to guide you in a wrong way, we will not take any action to stop it.
For us, there is a value of every citizen of the country, but there is a unique significance for the comments and voices of farmers.
We brought an emergency law.
The period of the emergency legislation ends on August 31.
This will ensure that farmers are not economically damaged.
For us, I assure my peasant brothers that the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan are not mere words, but this is a mantra.
The interests of the poor farmers living in the villages are in our minds.
Therefore, I stated in my Independence Day speech that the ministry should function as a field of agriculture and peasants' welfare, not just an agricultural sector.
We are proceeding fast.
I want to talk about another thing.
Two days ago, the war ended in 1965 and was over 50 years.
It is natural that Lal Bahadur Sastry would remember them when we spoke about the war in 1965.
Likewise, we will remember the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan.
Our scientists are actually making significant progress.
Many new information has been given to me.
This was sympathetic and educational for me.
Many young scientists shared with me very sorry things, and I saw many dreams in their eyes.
Even in the voice of the past, I claimed that we should lead our student wealth to science.
I had also spoken of my Independence Day speech about what is needed for a fair choice in subordinate work.
While calling for a direct choice, every poor family and widow mothers have to wave the issue of seizure letters, seeking the help of whom to work.
This is also a reason for corruption in the bottom.
I said that there should be no direct choice under a particular condition.
As I don't even say 15 days, the government is growing rapidly in this direction, suggestions are being made, it gives me great joy that the decision will be completed almost and that it will be depressed as a means of direct choice for low-lying jobs.
Nowadays, India has the colors of multinational figures.
The world's 24 countries coordinated and conducted a conference in India to reduce the maternal mortality rate.
This idea meeting was held for the first time outside the US in India.
Every year about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children in our country die after delivery.
As we are freed from polio, we are also freed from detention as a cause for simple deaths.
The world has accepted it.
But even today, we must save our mothers, and save our sweet children.
Brothers, nowadays, dengue fever is spreading.
It is true that the dengue fever is dangerous, but it is easy to avoid it.
My request for clean India is to be associated with it.
Even though we saw advertisements on television, our attention doesn't go on them.
While publicity is provided to newspapers, our child is not paid.
People are aware of the methods of safety of clean and clean water in small things in homes:
We are living in good houses, there are many facilities in it, but sometimes we don't know how to stop water around us.
I'm asking you not to expand the sword blanket so easy for death.
Life is a very worthy one.
This is not true, the calls that are being called for death, decreasing the lack of attention of water sin.
Around 514 dengue fever detective centers have been set up across the country, where free checks are arranged.
It is the time to check and get treatment to save lives.
Your more collaboration is very important in this matter.
From Raksha Bandhan to Deepawali, there will be celebrations and festivals in our country.
Why shouldn't we connect all our festivals with cleanliness
Would you like to get good registrations, huh
My people of my favorite land, I want to share a pleasant message with you.
Hitendra Mahajan, Dr.
In the minds of Mahendra Mahajan, the interests of our country's tribal people are very high.
Both of these brothers have glorified India.
This year, these two brothers have won the scene and have glorified India.
I have told these two brothers my good wishes and praises.
But they are engaged in the entire effort of the Tamil Indian and the Visiion for Tribals - the interests of the Tamil people.
Look how everybody is giving their own contribution to the country's progress
When asked about such events, the slightest glimpses.
Sometimes, we are suffering from terrible injustice to our younger communities because of our eyesight.
An idea that none of the new generation has been known to the old generations, I think this trend has been going on for centuries.
But my experience is different from young people.
Sometimes, while speaking to the youth, we can also learn many things.
I have met a number of young men who have decided to ride a bike on Sundays.
Some people are following it as a cycle day that I will travel on a bike a day a week.
They say that this gives me the joy of my body, health, environment, good and youth.
Now there are many cyclclclubs operating in many cities of our country, and incentives to a cycling trip.
This is an excellent effort for health and environmental health.
The country's youth's perspective is also worthwhile, as the achievements of two young people of India have made the country a glory.
In the Hindu Mills area of Mumbai, the motion of Baba Saheb Ambedar's memorial has long been dazzled.
While the Indians around the world go to London, the memorial of Baba Saheb Ambadger, which will be formed by the Maharashtra state, will observe.
I have also expressed my mindful charms and applaudments to the Maharashtra state government, which is trying to create these two memories that will enhance the population of Baba Saheb Ambedger.
Thank you for my very good life, terrible.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oil seeds in our country.
The poor require pulses and a little more oil to mix in porridges.
I am glad that this type of activity shows 50 percent increase in pulses, which shows approximately 33 percent increase in oil crops.
I am telling my peasant brothers about this.
My favourite countrymen, on July 26, have been published as successful day in the history of our country and in the Kargil war.
Not only on the borders of the war in Kargil, every village and town of India gave its own contribution.
On July 26, I consider it more important and important.
After our state was established in 2014, we started the Mygov Internet base on July 26 in a few months.
I am glad that nearly two crore people have gone to the Mygov Internet base, while the state has finished nearly a year and approximately 12 lakh people have expressed their views.
More than 50,000 people have given their suggestions in the PMO application and have spent their golden time for this, and have been more joyful for their child.
They have given very simple suggestions.
But the people of the state have not yet noticed this, but brothers Akhilesh Vajpayee reviewed their advice and asked the government to pursue it, and we are still on it today.
Today, any plan of the state is to create logo and tagline, plans are being implemented, policies are being created, and most dramatical advices are received on the Mygov Internet base.
I have also been consulting in Mygov's address to what I should speak on August 15.
They have given me a lot of suggestions from Susitra Prohibition from Chennai.
She is asking for women to keep children alive, to talk about clean Ganges and clean India.
This time, you cannot record your opinions on what I should talk about on August 15.
Let's send the Mygov to the face, write to the radio, send it to the prime minister's office.
It is a very interesting idea that I should get from the general public what I want in my speech on August 15.
I suppose you'll give me good ideas.
Two days ago, my child went on a danger in Delhi, after that, the person traveling in Scooter split his life for ten minutes.
He has no help.
People are asking me at a number of occasions that you should talk about road safety and awakening.
That's all your concern.
And if we hate the statistics, then the heart shall stand.
There is a danger every minute in our country.
I'm asking the parents to create an environment in the family, however, that the administration should do its obligations, but that the children's driving vehicle is a 2-score vehicle, a 4-drawn vehicle, and anyway, all the things related to security.
The government has also taken a lot of initiatives in this regard, with regard to the awakening of road safety, and illegal engineering of road construction, and urgent treatment for the wounded after the danger, and we are bringing 'liquid transport and defence bills'.
In the coming days, we are planning to take a number of important initiatives to implement the National Security Policy and Road Safety Procedure.
We are significant to the Kashles treatment on national highways like Kutgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, Mumbai and Ranchi.
Accordingly, we are contemplating how to get the most important life saving operations and how to get maintenance in the first 50 hours, keeping away the information about whom money is paid without money.
We must first see how the dangers are not happening, and indeed every living price is valued.
I have sometimes said workers should be pregnant.
In the past few days, I share with you some events that have touched my mind with this idea.
It is a good feeling when everyone sees how they can bring life even in their works.
Vijay Biswal has expressed how he can join his country, his art and his opening with his work.
I believe Vijay Piswal's picture can be a thing to talk about the coming days.
I am fond of a plan to work with a large group of state officials from the Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
Sometimes, some small things are very joyful, so I share them with you.
There is a village named Kashla in Rajnandka of Chhattisgarh state .
For the past few months, they have created a movement to create toilets.
None of the villages now need to spend natural resources outside.
Whatever this happens, when it was fulfilled, it was celebrated as a big festival in the entire village.
The best examples are to intimidate how the falls in social life are changing, how the people's eyes are changing and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
Pavesh Dae from Gauhati has written to me about the problems facing the northeastern states.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister of the country, a ministry called DONER was formed, that means the ministry for the advancement of the northeastern states.
Well, we cannot decide the interests of the northeastern states in Delhi, can we
Therefore, a group of Indian government officials went to north eastern areas including Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim.
This effort could have a good effect in the coming days.
This is an immense attempt to move from Delhi to far-reaching areas, which I call as the ACT EAST policy.
My favourite countrymen enjoy the victory of the civil liaison program.
About a few days ago, India has acquired 5 artificial lectures in the country of England through its PSLV C28.
This is the largest achievement, even though the news is not very attractive.
Sometimes when we raise the question of what we want to develop to the younger communities of the country, one of them replied that more than a hundred of them would be a scientist.
The lack of country in science is a matter of concern.
Under this, the Indian Human Resource Development Ministry has launched a national investigation movement.
You are very soft and proceeding, and you also spend one and a half hours a week to encourage students from your neighbouring school-color, share your experiences with them, and I'm asking the officials of the Indian regime that it would be helpful to them.
Our villages should get electricity for 24 hours, right
This work is difficult, but it must be completed.
In today's case, even if Mobile is to be served, another village has to go.
The advantages of the cities must be expanded to villages, and these facilities need to be obtained from shopping.
In view of this, we are launching "Thindin Tayal Upathai Village Jyoti" program.
Our country is the largest country, where teeth are thousands of villages, to ensure electricity supply to the remote areas
Your opinions will be against me.
Thank you.
When I said so, you don't expect to get such a substantial response.
Hundreds of thousands of people, Twitzers, Festivals and Instagrams had sent photos.
I'm also telling Retweet something that fascinates my opinion.
If some people did not register photographs of Andhra Pradesh's (B) Belam caves, it would not have been known that many people of the country had such caves.
This is the picture of Orchha in Madhya Pradesh.
We always know Rajasthan as a low state, but it is very amazing to send photographs of a man on Mayan waterfall.
That is, indeed, a strange thing has happened.
I can assure that yoga exercises are not hidden in the world, the sun.
Seeing the extent to which the world is spreading the red pool, is it not the honor and glory of any Indian in his mind
And I also drowned in the flood of joy: and the heart was broken.
While the Sin river and the Eiffe tower of the French people are very large, they also chose the place behind these marks for yoga.
The New York people knew the Times sympathy for Yoga.
When Australia's Sydney speaks, the scenes of Abera Houss are illuminated immediately.
Australian nationals have done yoga exercises before the Abera House chin.
Rajpath became Jogabad.
A new upheaval in all the crores of the world, a new sentiment, a new zeal, a new enthusiasm.
A few days ago, his family had dwindled a photo of a child from Vietnam, Yoga, which was very interesting, and it was known all over the world.
All joined women, men, aged, children, villagers, urbans, developing countries, and developing countries to take yoga training.
Yoga was actually a factor connecting the world.
I don't know how the intellectuals world will despair and criticize this thing.
But I realise one thing that the world is very interested in knowing India, it is a matter of pride for every Indian.
There has been a growing interest in India and the world is keen to know about India's phenomenon, tradition and culture.
But there is greatness and pride of our tradition, we can bring it to the world.
Sometimes we think 'what is new in this,' for example, we can tell our family solutions, we don't know the biggest thing about India's family solutions to the world's people.
I appeal to the youth of the country, especially the youth in the information technology sector, to address the plans of the Aunline Yoga programs as well as the youth.
Do you know that there is a science in the state
Nobody's attention will return to it.
There are reports about it 2, 4 times in 5 years, a small section on one side.
But during the yoga day, he led it.
The smallest sector has shown the world's largest job.
This is an example of how much smaller organisations can be pursued when the target is in front of us.
The world has wondered how our victims would be rescued in the country of Eman.
In a few hours, the world saw that Indians hurriedly stretched out their help.
If we start functioning in mind, the government will be quick and the state workers will act quickly, and the common man will be driven up and celebrated.
This is my own experience.
This is the real power that advances the country.
Last month, we announced 3 people's life insurance programs from Kolkata.
More than ten crore of these people are engaged in life insurance programs in some way, but we must move forward.
There's a thought in my mind, I want to put it before you.
In August, the Raksha Bandhan Festival is coming, we will all start a strong public movement before the Raksha Bandhan Festival, and we will not give the benefits of this people's life insurance to our mothers and sisters
Come on, let's all join me and try to fulfil this commitment.
And when I heard the voice of the heart, many people give me advice.
This time, many people have advised me to tell me something about the weather.
Thiruvananthapuram, Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harshvardhan of Mysore, Pravin Dinkarni and Divyanshu Gupta are asking you to talk about the weather.
They have given good counsels to their share.
You may also be enjoying the rainy season, with hot pakora, buzzi and salt tea.
Just as the sun's rays give us life, the rain also gives us strength.
Each drop of rain is valued.
In the form of a immigrant and society, we must continue to develop a sense of protecting every drop of water.
Water in the village should be in the village, as well as the city's water should be used for the use of the city.
We must defend every drop of water until the water supply becomes managing, small ponds and lakes.
If you want to go to the battlefield, the birthplace of Gandhians, you can see his home, you can see a bag in the water-sufficient land within his 200-year-old house, which has a direct access to rain water.
You must see it.
Even then, it has been taken care of.
We can't even do this
It must be embraced as a public movement.
The village should be followed this way.
Likewise, Greens take care of our eyes.
How charming is the green life
All of these like tree plantations, gardens, gardens turn life into greenery, isn't it
We all have to work through the social organisations of trees and movements in this rainy season through youth.
I'm giving a suggestion from my own experience, this village technology is a very successful one.
When you drown the tree, put an old mangrove near the tree, and fill it with water.
Due to moisture in the environment, sufficient virus grows in teeth and health is very important.
Cleanliness is very important.
It is necessary to drink clean water.
Most of the people suck water in this season.
It also has miracles.
As much as we pay attention, we get protection from diseases.
Water and rain are required, but it is also important to avoid diseases.
People of the country, we are now introducing three new programs, especially for urban people.
According to the Amrit program, we are creating a movement that will enable our cities to live.
In 2022, when India celebrates the 75th year of its independence, it must be built home for all Indians.
Understanding these three things, we are starting a big plan.
It took photographs with their daughters among all the fathers and gave an instruction to register on social websites.
In Haryana, the rate of women's children is very low compared to men's children.
In the country, there are 100 districts of this kind of troubled proportion.
This is very much in the state of Haryana.
'We're gonna save the child in some way, we're gonna turn the plan into a public movement.
Behold, you shall feel the glory of the children, the glory of the children, and the glory of the women, and the joy of the movement.
Remember the rainy season properly
Change our country as green
I'm officially saying this.
Go ahead with this.
I'm meeting you next time for the next heart's voice program.
Some people sometimes believe that I should explain the government's health programmes in my heart's voice programme:
This gives me joy.
Man's voice, June 2019
You can imagine how this intermediate period would have passed.
And it shall come to pass on Sunday, that on Sunday, the last Sunday of the month, when it was 11 in the morning, that, behold, the feeling that something was lost, and that it shall come to you
But I thought it should be on Sunday.
But I was waiting with the adviser when this Sunday was coming.
Many have asked me why I was traveling to Kedarnath amid the electoral bust.
But if I start traveling in that direction, you can turn away from the voice of the mind.
Hence, I swept away when the polling continued, the visions of election barrier and victory failure.
Many consider it to be political fuel.
As for me, I consider it as a chance to meet me.
I'm gonna see myself in a way.
I can't say when I will do, but I'm sure, because it is my duty to show your right to know.
Like the people's willingness to know about Cather, I am constantly recognising in your words that you've been trying to understand the complicated things.
The interferences in the letters to the heart are completely different from the arbitrary state illusions.
Sometimes there are your words to open the mud in the middle of my thoughts.
While writing about cleanliness, he expresses his desire toward cleanliness, he also collaborates with the efforts of cleaning.
If one discusses the environment, his pain reflects in it:
But at the same time, he also speaks of his efforts and describes the ideas of his mind.
That is, one of his words shows how to consolidate the entire social solution to the problems.
The voice of the mind is acting as a glass to the nation and the society.
It shows that there is no shortage of stability and ability in the deepening of the nations.
It is only necessary to coordinate those weaknesses and capabilities, to create opportunities for them and encouraging in adventurous efforts.
The voice of the mind shows us that 130 crore people in the country's progress and want to join strong and constructive.
One writes a letter to the country's prime minister, but you can imagine that he has not raised any application for himself...
How excellent the feelings of such millions of people in the country
When I examine all these things, I leave your imagination how joyful I get, how much enthusiasm I see.
You're directing me, you're acting fast to me, you can't imagine that you're kissing life within me every moment...
I was waiting for myself without this relationship.
Today my mind is filled with happiness.
Come on, let us move the voice of the mind in this sense, swinging, swinging
The struggle against it did not stop with political definitions and political leaders when there was a urgency in the country.
It has not been imprisoned in the middle of the prison chambers.
Every immigrant was angry with the mind.
There was a turbulence for the lost democracy.
If we don't eat food every day, we don't know what is hungry.
Likewise, whenever one knows about the joy of democratic rights in ordinary life, one breaks our democratic rights.
And it came to pass, when the observation was resurrected, that every dwelling place in the whole country was broken.
I can say a great extent that this tradition is India's residing society.
That is why the people of the country felt lack of democracy, and in emergency, we experienced this inefficiency.
That is why the country has offered a whole election not for itself, but for the protection of democracy.
When any thing or thing is far away from our faculty, we reduce its significance, we ignore their wonders.
In India, more than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 election.
This figure may seem to be very common to us, but if we see China from the world's perspective, more people than any country in the world voted for this election.
The number of voters who voted for the election of 2019 is more than the total population of the United States, which is far greater than the population of the entire Europe.
This marks the vastness and broadness of our public opinion.
In 2019, the election of the state has so far been the world's largest democratic election.
And you shall imagine how much things and humanity is needed to administer such a great election.
This is possible as a result of thousands of teachers, officials and workers working hard overnight.
This time, because of all of them's hard work, has been more voting platform than last time.
In order to vote, approximately 10 lakh vote certificates, more than 40 lakh voter machines and more than 17 lakh videopaid equipment across the country...
I leave your imagination of the greatness of the organisations.
All this was carried out to ensure that no voter should be denied the right to vote.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, only a vote was formed for a female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the election officers had taken two days to go there.
This is the real faith that will be given to democracy.
The ballot box in the world's highest place is located in India.
This vote is at a height of 15,000 feet in Lahore Spiti in Himachal Pradesh.
Moreover, there is one thing to glorify this election.
It may also be the first time in history that women and women have participated in the vote with enthusiasm for men.
The vote percentage of women and men was almost equal in this election.
Another encouraging thing about this is that the number of women members is 78 in today's recording.
You, my loved country, maybe you have asked me many times, saying, It's not a bouquet.
I've been asking you not to give books instead of flowers.
Since then, people have started giving books in many places.
Now someone has given me the book of their famous stories, which I like.
There has been no time for many days, but due to foreign travel, there has been a chance to read some of his stories again.
Bremchand describes the reality of the society in his stories, while reading, the scenes start dwelling in your mind painting.
Every thing he wrote is alive.
In my mind, my old days have been deteriorated...
The second story touched the deepness of my mind, its name is 'Ethgah'.
And a young man's favour, and a pure love to his shirt, is his foolish mind in such a small age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamith comes to her boss, she is actually touching a human sentiment summit.
Likewise, 'Poose Ki Rath' is the name of a short story that touches the chest.
In this story, a conflict found in the life of a poor farmer is portrayed alive.
Even though his consequences are destroyed, why is Haldu's farmer happy, because he does not need to sleep in his neck in the winter of bones.
But even though these stories were written just a century ago, we can realise that they are still suitable.
After studying these, I realized a radical experience.
While talking about reading, I was living in some media about the Akshara library in Kerala.
At one time, they have come to build books as lips and swing on their backs.
Today, the library is showing a new direction not only to tribal children but also to all.
The Gujarat movement is a successful attempt.
This movement to read books, all the agents participated in millions.
In today's digital world, I ask you to spend some time in the middle of your daily curriculum.
In fact, you're very interested in it, write the book you read and the Narendramodi secretary, so that the voiceners of the mind can know about it.
I am very glad to know, my hearts, O nations, that our nations think of things that have become challenges in the future, not ceasing from the present.
When I read the comments of Narandramodi secretary and Mygov, I was able to take care of how many people wrote about water.
Apart from Pawan Kaurai from Belgavi, Siddamsu Mohan Parita from Bhubaneswar, many others have written about many other challenges about water related to Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf.
Water has great significance in our culture.
It is said about water in the affirmation of Rikhveth: Abohista Myobova: It is the afraid that Shasta Kaurje, Dattatha, Maharanaya Sakshe, Yova: Siddhamoras: Dussehya Bhajaydehna: Sushatriva mortuary: 0, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000.
Water is the same to the mother, that is, mother's favour is good for her favourites... and ruin her conception over us.
Water detention has affected many parts of the country every year.
You marvellously know that only 8 percent of the rain water available throughout the year can be stored in our country.
Only 8 percent.
Hence, it's time to find a solution to the problem.
I am sure that if we open 130 crores of nations, with the help of participants, like other problems, will be able to find a solution to this union with peace.
Understanding the importance of water, the new Water Shakti ministry has been formed in the country.
This will lead to all the water related matters and rapid conclusions.
A few days ago, I had to make some things different.
I sent a letter to the country's fifteen leaders and village leaders.
And I had written to them, saying, They shall gather the waters, and take care of every drop of the rain water, and they shall gather the council of the villages, and shall be gathered together with the people of the villages.
They enjoyed me in this work, and on 22nd this month, thousands of fifteen hundreds of people joined.
And the people throughout the village did not ensure that every drop of water was destroyed, and they made their sympathy.
Today, I want to talk to you about the leader of the interpretation.
The people there have once again agreed to pursue their intellectual contribution to water supply.
My sacrifice is good for all the fifteen leaders and all the village leaders, which have done the sufficient work from my level.
There are many leaders of the country's transportation of water supply.
In a way, it is a chance for the entire village.
I have a feeling that the villagers are now in the race to raise some water in their village.
As I said, social efforts have a corresponding consequence.
There is no single way to confront the water confrontation throughout the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country, in different ways.
But everyone's goal is to save water and maintain water.
The water slopes of Punjab are deteriorating.
This effort will liberate the problem of obstacles.
There has been a change in the lives of rural residents due to the accumulation of water streams in Telugu's Timmaiyabali.
There has been a major change in Kabirtham in Rajasthan due to small tanks in the fields.
While I was studying about a social effort in Tamil Nadu velocity, I knew that 20,000 women were mobilized in the work of reviving the Naga river.
At the same time, I read about the women of the Garhwal region, who have worked with each other in a very good way to collect rain water.
Water will be supplied when people open one.
Today, through the voice of mind, I propose three appeals to the people of the country.
My first appeal - just as the nations turned cleansing into a public movement, let's take care of the beginning of the destruction of water and turning it into a public movement.
We're all together, and we're gonna swear every drop of water and you're goddamn it, I hope it's a wonderful shit.
It was said that the rosemary was iron gold.
But even water is such a rasamani that produces new virus from the sports of water.
We need to create a awareness movement that destroys every drop of water.
Look at my second application to the nations, many traditional methods of water conservation in our country have been used for centuries.
I ask all of you that share these traditional methods with you all.
If any of you had the chance to go to the battlefield, a silver silver land, there is a 200-year-old water ship in a house beyond the house.
Come on, let us create a lot of lists associated with the water supply and encourage people to join the water supply.
All of you, Janshakti4Jalshakti - use it to divide your opinions.
My loved countrymen, I want to see my thanks for another thing, and for you and for the world.
Many of the world's Republican leaders, prime ministers, popular and civilians, have shown me through Diuter that how yoke is being organized in all the countries.
On the day, the world appeared as a happy family.
We know that people who need to establish a healthy society, a healthy and understandable persons, it confirms yoga.
Therefore, the spread of yoga is a massive task of social service.
Does not such a service have to be honored with recognition
In the year 2019, the Prime Minister gave me an unprecedented pattern of awards to give an excellent contribution to the propaganda and membrane of Yoga.
This award is given to organizations giving important contributions to the spread of yoga art worldwide.
Japan's John Nikhedan performs there many corporations and training studies.
Similarly, Ms. from Italy.
He is not supposed to be supposed to be an example.
When you come to know about Yoga, tell the rest of India
Both of them have special significance of Yoga for the day to be celebrated widely, and to be honored to bring all the homes of the enjoyment news.
Many of our minds, our journey has started today, new sentiments, new experiences, new determinations, new openings...
Yeah, wait for your consultations, as always.
We'll meet us again and we'll enjoy talking.
I'm listening to your sentiments, I'm careful, understanding.
Sometimes I try to live according to those sentiments.
Let your fondness continue.
You are my visions, you give me strength.
Come, let us together, and we shall experience the voice of the mind, and we shall perform our obligations in life on Tuesday.
Once again, we met again in the voice of the mind next month.
Thank you for your sacrifice.
Man's voice, February 2019
My heart is straitened today, when the voice of the mind begins.
Ten days ago, the Indian mother has lost her wealthy mantras.
These militarists have lost themselves to defend us with 125 crore countrymen.
And these brave men of our swords devoured themselves, that they might slept peaceably, and that they might not sleep.
In Bulwama's extremist attack, the minds of the people of the country are wounded and blamed in anger after the sacrifice of our soldiers.
There is a lot of stirring news from all four sides about the sacrifices and their families.
I bow my head to the slaves of the land, to keep the mother of India, and to offer their lives.
We must forget all the differences of opinions, such as racism, religious and regionalism, that is why our opponents and decisions against radicalism will be determined and determined.
Our armies have always revealed the pride and iniquity of none.
While on the one hand they express their immense efficiency to restrain the peace, they have also worked to retaliate in the same language as the attackers.
You can see how the operations were carried out within 100 hours of the attack.
The militarists have committed their commitment to the extremists and their subsidiaries and hunters.
Following the lives of the virgin soldiers, the words and comments of the media's expression of their relatives have been widely strengthened and strengthened all over the country.
In Orissa, Mina, wife of Tigayi Prasanna Sahu, a resident of Jagatsinghpur, is celebrating her immense princely state over the country.
He acknowledged that I would join his only son in the Central Border Security Force.
When Vijay Shoren, who was hit by the three-wheeler, reached Gumla in Jharkhand, Sulai said his nephew son and I would join the army.
The glory of this pinch is today flowing into the body of every child in India, in the body of a surviving sense of life.
It is the daughter of Vijay Maurya, the daughter of Deoria, the daughter-in-law of Tilakraj of Kangra, or the six-year-old daughter-in-law of Thyagai Hemraj from Koda, the story of every family of the biographers, which is inspiring the glory.
I appeal to young people to know and understand what these families have expressed.
We don't need to observe the past layers of history to know what the patriotism is, what the god is.
My life is more than my countrymen...
For so long as freedom is achieved, the responsibilities of the war that we all wait for for memories.
It is natural for the countrymen to have greed and enthusiasm over this.
Sri Ongar Shetty, a supplier of Karnataka state at Narandramodiapp, expressed his happiness over the creation of a national war memorial.
There has been no national war memorial in our country so far, astonishing and disgusting.
I want it to be a memorial decorated with the provocations of the soldiers who dedicated their lives to protect the country.
I assure that such a memorial must be created in the country.
The second wheel, the symbol of courage, reveals the pride and evil of the soldiers.
The walls of the scene will be wrecked by the valiant acts of the soldiers.
Then shall the throne be, and the throne shall be:
This cycle points to the sacrifice of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the soldiers who gave publicity to the country will be wrapped in gold.
After this, the Rakshak Chakra marks the safety.
This chamber has a queue of thick trees.
It is impossible for our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces to play a sufficient role in the country's progress.
I received a great deal offering the National Police Memorial to the country in October last year.
This memorabilia was also made evidently by the feeling that we should be grateful to men and women belonging to our police guarded all the time.
I surely believe you will go to the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
And whenever you go to those places, surely divide the photographs which you have taken on the social network, so that others may see them, and be glad to go to these holy places.
O people of the country, your thousands of letters and comments come to me in various ways for the voice of the mind.
This time, when I was studying your opinions, Adish Mukobathya attracted my attention to their interesting views.
His age is only 25 when the British arrested Birsa Munda on March 3, 1900.
Similarly, on March 3, Jamsetzee Data wrote that her birthday was also an accident.
Moreover, these two men belong to the entirely divided family backgrounds, but both of them have enriched the tradition and history of Jharkhand.
In the voice of mind, it is equal to celebrating the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand in a manner that gives chariots to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata.
These two great men have illuminated not only the name of Jharkhand but also the name of the whole country.
The whole country is thankful for their contribution.
If a person with enthusiasm is needed today for the guidance of our youth, he is Lord Birsa Munda.
The British seized him when he was sleeping with anxiety and nervousness.
Do you know why they have kept such an evil thing
That is because the British founded such a great empire as they saw him.
Bhagwan Birza Munda, in his traditional vessel, drew the British regime using gunfire.
Indeed, if the people get a predictable leadership, social tension is greater than the arms force.
He took the drunken and wicked men to the sun brightened out of dark life.
Lord Birsa Munda was sacrificed at the end of his 25 years of life.
Like Pirzah, the sons of Mother of India have appeared in all parts of the land.
Such great men were filled everywhere, as they could not find anywhere in India as part of the notion of a centuries-long free war.
But fortunately, their stories of sacrifice, honour and sacrifice do not go to the new generations.
If people like Lord Birsa Munda have felt our existence, people like Jamshedji Tata have given a great deal of companies to the country.
If you want to correctly say, Jamsetzee Data is a remote prophet who has not only seen India's future, but also established a strong base.
He felt very well that it would be necessary for the future to make India an apologist of science, technology and industry.
Due to his telephone, the Tata Institute of Science was established, now known as the Indian Institute of Science.
Not only this, he established a number of institutions and jobs, such as Data Steel.
The Indian Science League was born as a result of this conversation.
My loved countrymen, our country's former Prime Minister Morarji Pai Desai on February 29, their birthday.
You all know that this day only one quarters will come.
Thus, Morarzi Pai, a peaceful man, is one of the most organised leaders of the country.
The Morarzi-boy country, which has dedicated the most budgetary statement in the Freedom India parliament, will serve them.
During that period, the country's publicity system was very intimidated when the Morarzibai patriot was very difficult to dominate India.
The Morarzi-boy country dedicated themselves to the urgency to defend democracy.
For this, he had to pay a huge price in his biodiversity.
The government then arrested him and imprisoned him.
But when the BJP won in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his regime, the 44th constitutional law was passed.
If this was very important, the 42th political revision was brought to resurrection of emergency, in addition to decreasing the powers of the Supreme Court, some of the other hostilities in it have broken down our democratic phenomenon, so they were withdrawn.
That is, by the 44th constitutional law, the activity of parliament and legislative laws was strengthened with the power to print the newspapers.
Only the recommendation of the ministry was made for the first time that the Republican president could declare urgency, and the level of emergency could not increase in one way over 6 months.
In 1975, how democracy was assassinated by declaration of urgency, they confirmed by Morarzi to prevent it from resuming it.
His contribution to defend the privilege of Indian democracy is enormous and more generations will remember it.
I have once again seen my chariots for a great head.
They have a comprehensive change in the life of others in different ways, with the help of their work.
As such, they are the real conservatives, who serve the people and social community, above all, unhealthy to serve the country.
When film awards are announced, you may have seen who they are awarded.
In one case, I think it is a great success, because they don't appear on television and pages, which are far away from the world of honour.
But they are, however, who are not concerned that you should be named and are confident of working on the floor.
And John said, These are they that smote the sword of Karmasu Kaushalam.
I want to share with you about such a few.
You must have known about Orissa's Taithari Nayak, which is no reason to call him Odisha of Canal Man, and Taithari Nayak has constructed a rockway for three kilometres by cutting his own hands in his village.
I reminded the former US Republican leader Barak Obama of the Tree of Life painting built by Abdul Kafur.
Among the Padma awardees, Shabir Saiyat from Maradwada is known as the servant of Green.
How he dedicated his entire life to the service of Greens is very uncomfortable and amazing.
The small children from Madurai first attempted to participate in the powers of the oppressed and the Tamil Nadu Fertilizer movement, and started socially intermediate structures.
Even though he has been a hundred years old, he has suppressed the yogi art of people all over the world, so far 1500 people have become yogi survivors.
The famous woman named Lady Tarzan of Jharkhand, Jamuna Tudu, has served a sympathetic task against the wooden robbers and naxals, preventing the destruction of 50 hectares and integrating ten thousand women to protect trees and wild animals.
Because of their unprecedented labour, the village residents are present at the time of their birth of every child, 18 trees and 10 trees at every woman's wedding.
The story of Rajkumari Devi, a farmer from Bihar's Musharrafpura, is very contemplating.
I am now trying to meet some of the beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Programme, i.e. Prime Minister Jane Health Programme.
Over the last five months, nearly 12 lakh poor families have benefited from this program.
I can see how big a change has occurred in poor life.
This program is owned by all such poor people.
My countrymen, who are in my mind, are the choices in schools.
Various academics across the country will start barrier examinations for ten or twelve classes in the next few weeks.
I am telling all the students, their parents and all the elders of the editorials of the choice.
A few days ago, a major event called Pariksha Bae Church in Delhi was held at Doon Hall.
One of the special features of the discussions on the selections is that there will be discussions without obstacles on various issues related to the selection.
For thousands of years, our traditional culture is with us.
After a few days, Mahasivaratri is coming to the holy day, this time a special significance is that when Sivaratri is coming on Monday, there is a glimpse in our hearts.
I went to Kasi a few days ago, where I had the chance to spend some time with the brothers of the opposite brothers.
We could talk to them about many things, their self-esteem was actually inspiring and inspiring.
While speaking, an unprecedented turnover young man said he was a superior.
He said I would speak as prime minister.
And it came to pass, when I was just a little, that I was a wonderful thing waiting for me, and he spoke likewise, as I spoke in the voice of the mind, and made the voice of the heart by Michri.
I was glad to know not only that people hear the voice of mind, but also remember it in many occasions.
Indeed, I was very nervous to see the strength of the youth of this transformation, and they had a great impact on me.
My foolish nations, it has given me an excellent experience to join you all through the voice of the mind.
Through radio, I am coming together with millions of families every month.
While speaking to you many times, while reading your letters, when you hear your phone calls, I think you consider me as your family member.
This sentiment breaks a pleasant experience in my mind, gladness fades .
The elections are the greatest concepts of democracy.
The next two months, we must have been drowned in the electoral fray.
I am also a candidate for this election.
In order to respect the healthy democratic tradition, the voice of the next mind will take place last Sunday in May.
That is, on March-April, with the strength of all these three months of my feelings, with a new faith after the elections, with the strength of your sages, I will once again start our speech through the voice of the mind, and I will join your heart's voice for years.
I've once again seen a lot of thanks.
Man's voice, January 2019
Shiva Kumar Swamiji has sacrificed his entire life and social service.
And Sivakumar Swami shall smite this thing.
In his 111-year-old life, he served thousands of people for social, education and economic imposition.
The extent to which his populism was widespread, he had a very supremacist in English, cultural and Kannada.
He is a social reformist.
He spent his entire life in people's dieting, sheltering, education and self-esteeming.
Swamiji was the primary objective of his life to provide all kinds of benefits to the farmers.
Chithanganga monastery is organising a densely green and peasant festival.
I have many times suffered from the foolish swamiji's acids.
During the centenary celebrations of Sri Sri Sri Sivakumar Swamiji in 2007, our former Republican Dr. A.
During this occasion, Kalam Aiya read a poem written for Vanakatriya Swamiji.
This poem of Dr. Kalam doubt explains in a beautiful way about Sri Sri Sri Sivakumar Swamiji's life and the goal of Chitraganga monastery.
There is an important organisation in our country:
This is the combination of our democracy and more than our democracy - I speak of India's election commission.
On January 25, the agency day of the election commission, we celebrate it every day as a national voter.
When India sees the extent to which elections are held, the world is surprisingly putting a finger on the nose.
Voting centres are established in areas of Himachal Pradesh at a height of 15,000 feet, and also institutions for voting in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
You may have heard the matter of Gujarat:
In the Kir Wildlife, at a far-reaching place, only one voter has been created.
Make imagination and see your friends...
This is the beauty of our democracy that the entire group of election commissioners go to far-reaching areas to recognise a voter and get the opportunity to use a voter's vote.
I appreciate the election order that has been attempting to strengthen the pro-popular system.
I applaud all the state's election commissions, all security personnel, free of election works and other workers who are not partisan.
In our country this year, elections will be held.
This time young people born in the 21st century have been voting for the first time in the election.
And they shall have the chance to bear the responsibility of the land in their shoulders.
Now they are becoming part of the country's resolutions.
The dreams of their dreams have been heard when they are associated with the dreams of the country.
I ask younger social friends that if you are able to vote, you must register your name on a voter list.
We must feel that if we cannot vote in life, because of some reason, it will be annoying us.
We must be sluggish if we say there was some wrong in the country.
We must change this process naturally.
I'm asking the people of the country that we should run a movement and make a sense of awareness, until we all replace the voters and vote on the day.
I am sure the younger generation voters will record their names in large numbers, they will take their part in our democracy and strengthen it.
My favourite countrymen, many times there are great glorys on this great land of India, such great men have done some wonderful and unforgettable things for human society.
On January 23, he celebrated his birthday in a new way.
On the day of Netaji's birthday, I had a great deal to open the museum already dedicated to the Nalkian soldiers who participated in the country's freedom struggle.
Within the Red Fort, many such rooms and memories have been closed since independence.
The closing Red Fort rooms have been converted into very fine museums, the museum called Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and Jaat-e-Jalian dedicated to the Indian National Army.
The museum, built in memory of India's first independence war, is dedicated to this entire complex as the revolutionary temple.
Every brick in these museums smells the smell of our honourable history.
At the same place, the British government's trial was carried out against Bharat Mata's Veteran brothers, Colonel Frame Cycle, Colonel Kurbaksh Singh Tillon and Major General Shahnawas Khan.
When I noticed memories associated with Netaji in the Red Fort's Revolutionary Temple, one of the family members of Netaji gave me a very important hat.
In fact, there is a need to repeat our patriotism and patriotism to our new generations, in different angles.
About a month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Nedaji Subhas Chandra Bose, 75 years ago, had given me the possibility of flying the thunderstorm at the same place.
In this context, the announcement of the Asad Hindu state was staged 75 years ago.
Supash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and efficient executive.
Such a virgin army has played an important part in the freedom struggle.
Nethaji's hearts are filled with jealousy and jealousy, such as you give me respite, and I give you freedom.
For many years, there was a demand for the publication of secret questions about him.
I am very happy that we are reporting this work.
I don't think that all the family members of Netaji came to my house one day.
We spoke together about many things related to Netaji, and we made Netaji Phos a career for our characteristics.
Attempts have been made to improve many places related to India's great heroes.
It will be 26, Alipore Road and Sardar Patel's museum associated with Baba Saheb Ambeth.
If you come to Delhi then go and see these places.
I want to share with you a thing related to Netaji's life, even in the voice of the mind, when we are discussing Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose today, my countrymen, which are in my heart.
I have always been contemplating radio as an important media that makes an alliance with the people:
The radio station has told me that the news was published once a week, which was broadcast in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathy, Punjab, Pashto and Urdu.
In this radio station administration, M lived in Gujarat.
R.
Their contribution to Vyas is very significant.
The process of broadcasting on the Azad Hind radio was very popular among the ordinary people, whose programmes gave a lot of strength to our freedom fighters.
There is a art museum built in this revolutionary temple.
An attempt has been made to explain Indian art and culture in a more attractive way.
There are 4 historical museums in the museum, with more than 450 art works of 3 centuries old.
In the museum, great artists like Amruta Sherkil, Raja Ravivarma, Avindranath Tayur, Kakanendranath Tayur, Nannandal Boss, Jamini Rai and Celos Mugharji are very closely displayed.
I ask you all, especially all, that you should go there and see their works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tayur.
That's what you are talking about art, but you can seek to go here and talk about the special works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You all knew Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I want to say that Gurudev is a painting too.
The special thing is that Gurudev Tayur has not given any name to his majority work.
And he that sees the picture must understand it, and sees the message given by that picture in his own sight.
His paintings are shown in European countries, Russia and all in the US.
I am confident that you will go to the Grand Mantra and see his paintings.
O people of my sin, the land of India, and the holy land.
Our pious people have reported goodwill, equality and social bureaucracy through their comments and actions.
This is a sacred one, Chand Ravitas.
On February 19, Ravidas was his birthday.
Indeed, if God swells in all mankind, it is not appropriate to see him divide into caste, religion and sections.
Guru Ravitas was born on the holy ground of Varanasi.
Pilgrim Ravidas, through his messages, has been attempting to expose labour and labour mastery in his entire life.
It is not surprising if he told the world that he had brought the truth of the importance of labour.
I once again give them the pious Ravidas in my memory.
My favourite countrymen, Kiran Siddar in My Gov, is asking them to speak in the hearts of the Indian space and its future reconciliations.
Vikram Sarabai has made a great contribution to India's space programme.
Our space program consists of the involvement of innumerable Indian scientists in the country.
Our heart is shocking that the artificial satellites and soundingrockets developed by our students are sticking to the space.
On the same January 24, the Kalamsad application designed by our students was held.
The soundingrockets made by university students in Orissa are also reputed.
All the space machines carried out from the country's independence to 2014 have been carried out in the last four and a half years.
We have achieved 104 artificial satellites in the same space.
We are soon registering India's position in Chandranan through Chandrayan-2 movement.
Our country is using space technology in a very special way to protect livestock.
Shuttle technology is sufficiently assisting in the fire, rail and road safety.
NAVIC equipment has been distributed among our fishermen, protecting them and helping the economic imposition.
We are using space technology to provide government service and responsibility.
According to the programme of housing for all, about 40 lakh households in 23 states have been given iotack.
At the same time, Mahatma Gandhi has made almost three and a half crores of wealth and jeo decks in the field of employment.
Our artificial appeals are signs of the growing power of the country today.
Its contribution is because we have made significant connections with many countries in the world.
There is an extraordinary attempt to make South Asian artificial appeals, which gives a great deal of development to our neighbouring allies.
Through its special rival services, India has applied not only to developing countries, but also to the artificial appeals of developing countries.
The heavens and the states have always been a matter of attraction for children.
We have to think bigger, and we have seen nothing impossible so far, and our space program provides opportunities and opportunities for the advancement of the borders.
Our children are attracted to the institutions and inspired to find new stars and show a television.
I always say that those people who play my beloved nations, they grow and grow. This time, the so-called sportsmen in India have shone.
In January, nearly 6,000 sportsmen participated in 18 sports for the Indian youth in Pune.
If the local sportsman acted well, he could make the most important activity worldwide.
This time, the sportsmen from all the states of India expressed their ability.
He lives in a car with his family.
Likewise, the 21-year-old women live in Sadra, Captain Sonali Helvi of the Gabriel Committee of Maharashtra.
He has lost his father at the youngest, and his brother and his mother have encouraged him to believe in Sonali.
We have seen in many cases that women are not too encouraged in soccer games.
But all this was chosen by Sonali and acted well.
Abinav Shah, a 10-year-old from Asansol, has glorified that Gello won gold tension at the youngest age in Indian youth.
Akshata Vaswani, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, has won gold tensions in the Kamti and Baloodhu.
His father is a farmer from Belgaum.
But was it not heard about the rivalry to brighten the toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets have been participating in this strange race for nearly a month.
The name of this unique competition is a clean beautiful toilet.
In addition to purifying their utensils, people used a few paintings to beautify it, with a number of photographs from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Garch to Kamrub on the social websites of pure beauty utensils.
I ask all the treasures, and the heads of the villages, that you should accept the commandment of such a movement in your treasure.
Definitely share the picture of your pure beauty utensil with MyIzzatGhar on the social network.
Friends, with the aim of cleaning the country and liberating the livelihood in the opening, we went together to remember the journey on October 2, 2014.
Due to the collaboration of the Indian people, today, on October 2, 2019, we are rushing to the direction of freezing out of external secrecy habitation, due to which we can offer him the 150th birthday of the oil.
In this memorable journey of pure India, the role of the sound lovers of the mind is enormous, for this reason, when I am happy to share this with you, they have announced that more than five and a half million villages and 600 districts have been freed from their open toilet habits.
My little friends are close to the choice days.
Anshul Sharma MyGov, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has asked me to speak about the choices and the Exam Warriors.
Anshuel, these are my thanks to you, that they may preach this thing.
Yes, the first part of the year is the time for many families.
Students, their parents, and all the teachers have been involved in the activities related to the choice.
Moreover, students from many foreign countries are also participating in this program.
I am talking about all aspects of the choices in this Pariksha Bay Church, particularly with our young friends, about unconscious choices.
I am asking many to send homes and comments.
I am glad that a large number of people are participating in their opinions in MyGov.
I will initiate some of these opinions and advices, of course, during the Down Hall program.
You must take part in this event...
You can see its direct broadcast through social media and our secretary.
The journey of the year 2019 will be successful.
Man's voice, December 2018
That is why we have the advantages of experiences and the self-esteem that we have to do a new one.
We must think of what we do not only to change our lives, but also to divide the country and society.
This will be a gift to us all.
In 2018, the world's largest health insurance program was launched by Ausman India.
Electricity has been added to every village in the country.

In Varanasi, India started the first waterway.
This has led to a new revolution in the waterways sector.
The longest rail-riding bridge in the country was offered to the public service, the first of the Sikkim state and the country's 100th airport to Bagong.
For the 19-year-old people, the cricket voted for a world world world world world world worldwide for clicking and unprecedented alternative capabilities.
This time, India has won substantial tensions in Asian sports.
In Para Asian sports, India has done the finest activity.
If I speak only about every Indian's efforts and our social efforts, the voice of our mind will rise to the longest and 2019.
All of these are obsessed with the uninterrupted efforts of 130 crore people.
Jayachandran joined Goddess.
People say he was trying to treat the patient at any time.
Likewise, Sulakiti Nirsamma from Karnataka also joined the Lord on December 25.
Having been helpful in delivery to pregnant mothers.
He has served thousands of mothers in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
Before this year, he was awarded the Padmasri award.
While we speak about health care, I want to talk about the social efforts of doctors in Pijnor in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
Some of our party members told me last few days ago that some young doctors camped in the city and provided free treatment to the poor.
Many poor patients are benefiting from this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these medical friends, who are serving with unhealthy feelings, is really appreciable.
I want to tell here today that the pure India movement has become a successful movement because of social efforts.
A few days ago, some told me that more than 3 lakh people were working together in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
In this glory of cleanliness, all the people of municipality, autonomous organisations, students of schools and colleges and civilians of Jabalpur participated with great enthusiasm.
Incom, success stories of youth and industrialists have been genuinely described.
Well, can we do a job
Shall we share information about such bases
We're gonna detach ourselves.
Through this, the big people will know about our heroes that make changes in society.
There is a special significance for sports in all social and social.
While playing, there is power in the minds of those who see it.
We feel many things like the name, identity of the sportsmen and respect for them.
But sometimes there are a lot of things in their backgrounds and bigger things than the sports world.
I want to tell you about Hanya Nissar, a young woman from Kashmir, who won gold tension in the Garatee contest in Korea.
Hanya is a 12-year-old girl from Anantnak area of Kashmir.
Hanya's hard work and drive, Garade has been trained, and has simultaneously concluded, insisted on a record.
I'm greeting all the people of the country that his future should be bright.
Many goods and good wishes to Hananiah.
Like him, a 16-year-old girl has received a lot of news about Rajini and the media, and you must read.
Rajini has won gold tensions in the younger section in the competition for women.
After winning the tension, Rajini immediately went to a nearby milk market and drank a cup of milk.
After this, Rajini surrounded his tension in a cloth and put it in his bag.
Yeah, you all think Rajini had a cup of milk, didn't you
He did this in order to respect his father Jasmer Singh, who is selling Lucy in a shop in Banif.
Rajni later said that he had done a lot of sacrifice to his father overtaking this situation and suffered many problems.
He won a tension even in Cerbia.
This year, a 20-year-old young hunter from Pune, Kulkarni, became the first Asian woman to have the fastest right to the world in the cyclone.
He traveled 159 days daily at a road of about 300 kilometres.
His indiscriminate interest on cycling is really appreciable.
Such achievements, don't we seem to be contemplating when we ask about such successes
The names of all these festivals may be different, but it is a sense of celebration, which in some way combines the tactics with tearing and drunkenness, mixed with villages and combines with crops.
And it comes to pass, that the time of the sun shall come to pass in the royal queen.
After this, the gradually starts increasing day-to-day, and starts harvesting cold crops.
My best wishes to our peasant brothers and sisters.
Individual unity - the joy of the feeling of one India's best India, spreads the soil through our festivals.
We can see how close our festivals and ethics are with nature.
Many of our festivals have also been developed in the sense of rivers and water.
The sun is worshipped in the rivers, and in the waters.
Hundreds of thousands of people take a pure bath in the rivers.
During these festivals, share your photographs with everyone, so that everyone can enjoy the brilliance of India and the beauty of its culture.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela is very compassionate and the more devotional is filled with gesture.
People from all over the world come together with Kumbhmala.
In Kumbhmala, people come to the sea with faith and patience.
At the same time, there are millions of people from the country's foreign countries.
The tradition of Kumbh Mela is enjoying our enormous culture trees and silver.
This time, from January 15, the world famous Kumbh festival to be organized in Prayagraj is looking forward to all of you.
Saints and pilgrimages have started coming to Kumbhmala.
We can calculate its significance last year by joining the Gumbales in the history of the UNESCO organisation, that is, the closest cultural heritage of human world.
A few days ago, the ambassadors of many countries went to see the preparations for the Kumbh festival.
At the same time, the flags of many countries were blown out.
There is a possibility of people coming from more than 150 countries to participate in this Kumbhmala organized by Prayagraj.
The glory of India shall enjoy his glory in the world stage with the divinity of Kumbhmala.
One of the largest instruments for themselves, Kumbhmela, has different experiences for every human coming here, understanding the world's things.
In particular, it gives young people the opportunity to make a greater learning experience.
I went to Prayagraj a few days ago, where I could see the arrangements for the Kumbh festival being very critical.
The people of Prayagraj are seen with great enthusiasm for Kumbhmala.
There I sacrificed the integrated command and control center to the people.
It will also be cleared in the organisations as well as purifying the remote areas.
This time, after the sacred bath in the devotees' union, Akshayavat's pure sight can also be done.
The small axis of the faith of the people had been shut down in the fort for thousands of years, so that it could not be seen even if the devotees wanted.
Now the doors of Akshayav have been opened for everyone.
This holy dome shall be the glory of the Indian philosophy.
This pillar of faith will be the glory of the nation.
The pillar of the devotees will be the glory of the world's tourists.
There was an uninterrupted connection to the bridegroom with South Africa.
In this South Africa, Mohen and Mahathma became the one.
In South Africa, Gandhians started their first chapter and voiced a resolution against colorlessness.
He established Phoenix and Dolsty waterfalls, from where the voices of peace and justice began to flutter around the world.
He has been found from a humiliated man who has spent a number of years in prison.
Do you know what they said about their brotherhood 'Continentals have been a part of our history that he has done his first test with his fate here.
This is where he expressed his determination in the sense of justice:
It is here that he embraced the methods of his chapters and struggle.'
He built his brother in front of him.
Their goals, and Mandela and the world, have been a source of joy, and their goals will in any time provoke us to create a love and contemporary society.
A conference of police chief directors took place in Caudia, the Narmada coast of Gujarat a few days ago, and there were material discussions with the country's elites.

Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He was already involved in building India's unity.
Sardar Patel said that it was only the power of India to see unity individually.
We can give him our penny through this award as a result of their senses.
My neighbours, Guru Govind Singh on 13th January, his holy birthday.
Guru Govind Singh was born in Patna.
His activity was entirely northern India for a large part of his life, and he joined assemblies in the Ninth of Maharashtra.
At the birthplace, Patna and Agenda North India and the last moments of life are in Nanthette.
In a way, it may be said that the whole of India has received his sages.
Guru Gobind Singh received the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh gurus.
But whenever there was an attempt to crush the voices of poor and weak, there was discrepancy against them, Guru Gobind Singh gave voice to the poor and weak, steadfastly fighting with the shoulders, he said: 'Sawa Laksaye Ek Laddawn, Stein Man Baj, ugly Kobind Singh Namazam.
'He said, 'By fighting with the weak, they cannot reveal their power.
Sri Guru Gobind Singh thought it was the biggest service to wipe out the sorrows of human society.
And he was a meat offerings, of virginity, of honour, and of sacrifice, and of jealousy.
In addition, Gurumukhi, Prajbasha, Samskruth, Persian, Hindi and Urdu were also experts in many languages.
I am telling Sri Guru Gobind Singh about my request again.
My heart, many nations, many things are going on in the country, and there is no more discussion:
This is a different attempt by FSSAI.
The events are being organized all over the country before the 150th birthday of Gandhians.
Healthy-India tours are being carried out through the movement of eating Righat India and taking proper diet.
Whenever India is clean and healthy, it is of itself.
The most important requirement for good health is nutritious food.
The knowledge of the importance of food is essential since childhood.
That's the great event of the year 2018, our countrymen, we will reconnect in the year 2019, and we will repeat and talk to our minds.
Individual life, the life of the country, or the life of society, is the source of growth.
Come on, let's go ahead with new enthusiasm, new enthusiasm, new psychic, new successes, new peaks - we're going to win, we're also going to change, we're gonna make changes in the country.
Man's voice, November 2018
On October 3, 2014, Vijaya Dasameet Thiruvananthapuram, we all traveled together through the voice of the mind.
This time most of the letters and phone calls from you have come from this 50th part.
In MyGov, ANSU Kumar from Delhi, Vikas Yadav from Amar Kumar and Patna, Monica Jain from Narendramodi App, Delhi, and Prasenjit Church of the West Bengal, and Sangeeta Sastry from Nakpoor.
Your interest is natural.
In today's era, why is Modi connecting through radio
I want to tell you about a thing.
This was done in 1998.
I was working in the Indian Janatha Party in Himachal Pradesh.
I was going to a place in May.
Take a ladder kept in a silver vessel with him, and eat the laddies first before the tea is made.
I'm surprised, why, what's the matter, what happened to someone at home like marriage.
No, you don't know
I'm just a good idea.
Behold, I will hear the first radio.
He was talking about it in the radio.
In this wilderness, a common man is asking for a radio throughout the day, selling tea in his own place, beyond the snowy hills.
Therefore, there is no surprise in my attention to the milk of the most powerful media radio when I am prime minister.
From the remote villages of the country to the cities, the peasants began to take to the young industrialists, insisting on the voice of the mind.
Hundreds of letters were read every month, phone calls were heard, comments were made in the secretary and MyGov:
We are in touch with us the journey of this 50th part, which has been surprisingly mixed together with all this.
At present, Indian radio and analysis on the voice of the mind have also been done.
Some of the backgrounds are very interesting.
70 percent of those who have been examined are constantly asking the voice of the mind.
The enormous feelings of the society are regarded as a major part of the mind.
A large number of public movements have been encouraged by the voice of mind.
There are widespread discussions about idopositive.
All of these underscore the intellectual sensitivity and harmony of our nations.
People have shared their feelings that the voice of the mind has increased self-esteem.
It is a great change in the minds of the people to think of social service.
But people are not connected only through this program.
The television, FMM, Mobil, Internet, Basebook direct broadcasting, Beriscope, and other than the Narendramodi secretary, are pursuing their participation.
I express my favourite thanks to all the family members of the mind's voice to believe in the voice of the mind and turn into its part.
Your doubt is right.
At the conclusion of their research, it was a decision that this program was not politically pro-political.
When the voice of the mind began, I had demonstrated that it should not be political or political, that it should be put to the state's back, and that it should not be seen anywhere.
Letters, Internet comments and phone calls before every heart's voice are clearly known to be the opponents of the lovers.
Moti shall come, and go, but this land shall not be destroyed for ever and ever by our cultural time.
Small stories of 130 crore countrymen will never be hidden.
I swear to the letter, and if this urge comes out in another letter, I'll also summon it.
I join my experience and share with you.
The movement of Massachelfi, which spread from a small village in Ariya to the country and abroad, cannot have any power to widespread and await.
When every section of society and the population are connected, it is said to be a new dimension of social change, it understands the generation of today's emergence, the unawareness of the eye.
India's indignation is about social justice and social power.
There are thousands of angles of social life, one of which is political.
If everything is done in politics, it is not a good system of health.
The extent to which political relations and politicians dominate sometimes, the other capabilities and other efforts of the society are suffocated.
Thanks for calling your phone.
In a way, you've been asked because of your inclination.
If I have to replied directly to the question you asked, I don't have any preparation in the Musistins.
In fact, the voice of the mind is the most simple job for me.
People's letters are coming before every heart's voice.
And the letter is not just a few weeks for me:
In fact, for nearly 40-45 years, I have lived a monk's life, I have been going to most of the country, and have spent a sufficient time in remote districts of the country.
If you want to tell the truth, the voice of the mind is mine, but the examples, feelings and feelings are all of my countrymen.
I have not been able to tell thousands of such immigrants in the voice of the mind till date, but all these are not disappointed, but their letters and their comments.
I have full sympathy that all your opinions will come to me more than ever before, and that the heart be more interesting, and that it will be a part of your opinions to make it more terrible.
Efforts are being made to define the letters, comments and information that are not in the voice of the mind.
I want to thank my friends with Al India Radio, FM Radio, Dordarshan, other televisions and social institutions.
In that way, they are making Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I'm telling them all the capabilities, talents and thanks.
I'm supposed to leave you all, that you must listen to this event in your state languages.
Any politicalist and media will always have no happiness, much more career, and it is also negative.
But the media has made many things raised in the voice of the mind.
The media has carried out a variety of things like pure, road safety and drugless India and a shepherd with her, in a new way, as a movement.
And if your collaboration be not, then this journey of the voice of the heart shall not be sure.
Thank you for your phone call, they're financial.
I have no secret if you want to tell the truth.
It is easier to understand anybody until the consciousness in our lives are interpreted.
In many cases, we talk about the gap between the elders in families and those in the enrichment season.
In fact, it is declining to speak to most of the prosperous climate.
I've always been trying to continue with the youth through various programs or social networks.
I've always been trying to get out of what they do or what they think.
Through the voice of the mind, I come before I give greater importance to the efforts of the youth.
But I think there's no time for young people to sweat. This is what helps today's younger generations to invade greater renewals, because they think they're working faster.
Today's youth think of more efficient and big things.
Well, they will surround big dreams and possess big successes.
Some say younger generations are doing many things at the same time.
I hear, what's wrong with this
At the same time, the ladies are doing so.
If we pay our sight around us, it is a social populist, a start implication, a sports and other sectors - a youth who makes a great deal of social transformation.
These youths are seeking questions and have the power to see dreams.
If we stabilize the minds of the young people on the earth, we can create an independent environment to shape them, they are doing so.
My beloved countrymen, I request you to speak in the voice of My Gov, in the voice of my mind, on the day of the constitutional law which is coming on November 26.
What is important is this day, he has recorded as we replace our legs in 70 years that we have accepted our constitution.
Behold, they are compassionate thanks for your advice.
Yes, tomorrow's emergency law day.
This is the day we think of human beings who can give us constitutional law.
Our constitution law was adopted on November 26, 1949.
It took two years, 11 months and 17 days to the Council of Constituents to accomplish the official work of the Constitution.
Under 3 years of imagination, these mammals have broken up such a broad and profound reserve law.
The provocation of their constitution law is still an example of direct management and productivity.
We also guess to fulfil our responsibilities in achieving achievement.
The significance of our constitution law is to be explained in detail about rights and obligations.
It is a memorable event to refrain from awakening the constitutional law among the youth and linking them to the various features of the Constitution.
In 2020, as a Republican country, we are supposed to finish our 70 years and we will finish 75 years of independence in 2022.
Come on, let us all pursue the deficiencies of our constitutional law and ensure Peace, Progress, Prosperity - peace, development and prosperity in our country.
And it shall not be forgotten, my favourite nations, when they speak about the constitutional council, that the prince's prince, which is in the center of the constitutional council.
That gentleman is a penny doctor.
Baba Saheb Ambethkar.
On December 6, he was the day of his great anniversary.
I have seen my bows to Babasaheb against all the people of the country, and has given him the right to live with the eyes of millions of Indians.
Popularity is a mixed with the nature of Baba Saheb, and he said that the democracies of India were not imported from outside.
Democracy is not a new thing for the country of India.
My servant Angels for Baba Saheb, who is supposed to have a second time.
My neighbours, on November 23, two days ago, the day of their birth, the day of Kurunanadeva, was celebrated next year, in 2019, we will celebrate his 550th birthday.
The God of Gurunatha always thought about the welfare of man.
He has always pushed the way for social liberty, work, service, intelligence and brotherhood.
All state states and Union territories have been asked to make this program very special.
Likewise, the 550th birthday celebration of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
And the God of Christ shall be set with them on a corner of the path of the sacred places of the city.
At present, when I attended a meeting related to it, I had a discussion about Lakbad Saheb Gurudwara.
When there was a crisis in Gujarat in 2001, the blind country suffered a major impact.
But with those circles, the state government has rebuilt it even today is an example.
My neighbours, after the 50th part of the sound of the mind, we will again meet in the voice of the next mind, the possibility of exposing the sentiments of the heart to you for the first time, because of the questions you raised, but this journey will continue.
As much as I join you, our journey will be deeper and enjoying everyone.
The question of what I got from the voice of mind can be weeped in some of the minds.
I want to tell today what is one thing that touches my heart through the voice of the mind. When all the family members sit together and listen to the voice of the mind, the leader of our family sits in the middle of us and shares with us about our things.
Take care of me, your comforts.
Your expectations, my expectations.
Your desire is the anointed, and my desire is the anointed.
Come on, let's move this journey further.
Thank you.
Man's voice, October 2018
On October 31, our beloved is the birth day of the Sadarbai Baptiste.
This year young people from the country are ready to participate in the 'Equality Changes' program.
Now the weather is sweet.
I am therefore asking for a large number of people to participate in the solidarity trend.
Approximately six months before the country's independence, the world famous international press 'Deem' released on January 27, 1947 with the surdar ghetto telephone on its first side.
In the editorial of the newspaper, India's map was also published:
But it's not like that map is now.
In that map, India appeared to be swift.
It had more than 550 territories.
While they emerged from the country, India was supposed to have a variety of troops.
The Times reported that India faced various dangers such as separation, violence, food deficit, price rise and power politics.
In addition, the newspaper noted that it would be possible to coordinate the country and cure the wounds in the minds of the people.
The article was to reproduce the history of India's iron man.
During the flood in Ahmedabad in the 1920 vote, the article took place as he carried out redressal measures and carried out the Pertoli tribunal.
His honesty and determination were as much as the peasants, workers and industrialists had to fully rely on him.
As the simultaneous threat of simultaneous simultaneous simultaneously resolved the war, the surdar pattern to coordinate the country is a solution.
He confirmed that all the constituents of the country were united with India.
Whether Junagadh, Hyderabad and Thirungur are the territories of Rajasthan, if we now see the coordinated India, it is the main reason for Sardar Patel's sympathy and television.
The statue built on the Narmada border of Gujarat is twice high like the statue of the United States' freedom goddess.
This is the world's highest idol.
Seeing the world's highest statue being built in India, every Indian will grow.
And the true field of our soil shall Sardar utterly decorate our air.
I believe that this statue, which has suppressed Indian mother, will bring every Indian to a great extent.
Because it is natural for each Indian to see the image of unity.
I am sure that this statue will be a place where people from all over the country want to see.
We all celebrated yesterday "Galadda Day" yesterday, brothers and sisters.
I'm heading for everyone who is part of India's security forces.
I also serve the family members of our soldiers.
You must know why we celebrate the holiday day.
Indian troops took a step in Kashmir this time and defended the valley from being caught by the occupation.
This incident is also directly related to Sardar Shabai Patel.
I read an old interview with Sham Maneksha, our eminent military officer.
In this, Feeld Marshal Sham Maneksha recalled the time he was born.
At that time, military operations began in Kashmir.
In a recent meeting, Failed Marshall Manekshaw pointed out how Sardar Battley was cut off for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir.
In spite of this, if our forces fled to Kashmir, we can know how our military was successful.
The memory of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi comes on October 31 every day.
We will pay for Indira Gandhi our respectable request.
And they are the people of the country, who do not want to play.
If our country's youth have these capabilities, our country will not only develop in economic and scientific technologies but also explore pride in the field of sports.
I am very happy to have two recent meetings.
I hailed them, and the minds of the people of our country would be encouraged by them to overcome the barriers and win.
Likewise, I got a chance to meet the successful in the summer Olympics in the year 2018 in Argentina.
You know that the activities of our youth in the summer Olympics of 2018 youth were not so important.
We got 13 tensions in this competition and three tensions in the complex duality.
You must observe the most important activity of Indian soldiers in recent Asian sports campaign.
You must note that I've repeatedly pointed out the word 'financial or unconditional achievement'.
This is a reality to reflect the progress of India's sports sector every day.
India is making new records not only in the field of sports but in innumerable sectors.
For example, I would like to point out to you the opposite sportsmen of the Asian sports contest for 2018 counterparts, Vijay Narayan Pharaoh.
He is the other alternative captain.
When he was eight, he lost his father.
After that, he lived at home eight years of support.
He then left the house and cleaned the buses of the Delhi Traffic Corporation and lived in roadside dining.
The same Narayana has won a tension on behalf of India in the international contest.
Notwithstanding, it should also be taken care of how fast the Indian sports sector is getting special.
Moreover, India has not yet won any tension in the Junior or Chinese section in the Judo contest.
But Indian Tappi Devi has won silver tension in the Indian Olympics and has achieved historical achievement.
Tappi Devi is 16 years old and is from a village in Manipur.
His father is a common worker, mother is doing fish business.
It's a period of no money to buy food.
In such a poor situation, his interest and dedication did not deteriorate.
He has won tensions for the country and has historical history.
The entire world applauded that this competition was very successful.
FIFA has achieved a record in the number of people who have seen directly in the field, competing for the 17-year-old.
More than 12 lakh sports enthusiasts saw football competitions in the playgrounds in different parts of the country and encouraged young soldiers.
This year, we have got the chance to hold hockey competitions in Buveneswar, which sweeps the 2018 World Cup.
The Hockey competitions will take place on November 28 and December 16.
Every Indian, whether he plays or is interested in any game, must be interested in the Hockey contest.
In the Hockey game, India has achieved the wreckage of gold writings.
India has won shelters in various contests and has once won the world's championship.
India has created a number of best hockey soldiers.
Whenever he cited the Hockey game, it cannot be finished without mentioning our recorders.
The name of Major Tyansand, considered as the father-in-law of Hawki, is famous all over the world.
Moreover, from Balbir Singh Chinar, Leslie Cladias faced by Shahid, Uttamsingh and his royal family, India has a long history of Hockey.
Even now, the Indian soldiers in the Indian swamps are focusing on their hard work and goals as incentives to younger generations.
This is a good opportunity for sports enthusiasts who want to see the best rivals.
Go to Bhubaneswar and encourage Indian marines and every volunteer playing there.
Orissa state is not only the most historical background, but also the cultural traditional state.
All the people of that state are very bad.
This is a unique opportunity to see players Orissa.
You can enjoy sports competitions with world famous pilgrimages like Konark Sun Temple , Puri Jehannathar temple and Chilka lake .
I assure the Indian maids who participate in this competition to show my goodwill and to ensure that they have the support of 125 crore Indians.
I'm conveying my greetings to all the marines who participate in this competition from different countries of the world.
The psychologies of the people of the country and the people of the world are indeed to encourage and encourage all the people of the country.
But in the present new era, new generations are buddy and encouraging with new methods.
I attended the inaugural function of a new Internet document called 'I for peace.' My state programme and the country's information technology and electronic industry have begun to provide them with the opportunity to work in this field to encourage workers to work in social operations.
Their dedication and virtue will enhance each Indian.
I don't - we have a change that has created a new environment of social work from individuals to information technology.
Some of them sing to the elderly:
Some dedicate themselves to the cleaning work, while others help farmers.
But, following the actions of anybody, they have no internal organisation, with their commitment to dry power.
But one who is sitting in a cycle and learning to play can also help the opposite sportsmen who are wearing a cycle chair to participate.
This sentiment and dedication are a working process.
This will enhance every Indian.
'Not me, we'll certainly attract all of us.
Mr. Manish Magbhadra from Puducherry was very encouraging when you suggested that he was brothers and sisters, today's voice programme.
'Our government has been told by the Secretary of State to take a lead in the voice program of mind how tribal people, their traditions and rituals, as examples of natural environment.
He pointed out how to pursue the tradition of tribals in our lives and what can be known from such traditions.
Manish, I applaud you to raise this issue among the lovers of the voice program.
This will encourage us to know the past and neighbouring traditions when the entire world is discussing environmental protection and examining new ways to pursue balanced lifestyle.
Our country is facing the same problem.
But if we want to solve it, we recall our previous time, it is necessary to know our traditional wealth, especially the living standards of our tribal people.
Music with close cooperation with nature is an integral part of the lives of our tribal people.
Our tribal brothers, brothers, trees, vegetation and flowers are worshipped as God.
The 'Bil' tribal people living in central India, especially in Central and Central and Southeast, are supposed to worship the trees of Pipal and Arjun.
Pishnoi classes living in the desert areas of Rajasthan guide us to how to protect the environment.
In particular, they are ready to give their lives, rather than being affected by a tree.
The mishmi tribal people in Arunachal Pradesh are very close to the LTTE.
They consider the LTTE as their brothers.
Even in Nagaland, the LTTE is deepening as forest guards.
The Varli people of Maharashtra regard the LTTE as their residents, who regard the LTTE as their own and reflect their resources.
The Gol tribe of Central India seem to have a direct connection with the LTTE with their lives and feel that the entire village will be subject to Patni if the LTTE does not receive food.
In the evolution of fish, the people of Central India also stop fishing in the Kaithan river.
They think that this area is a fish sanctuary, which is largely sufficient because of their confidence.
At the same time, tribals are building their habitations with the natural materials of strong and environment.
The Thodar racial people living in some individual areas of the Nilgiri mountain range in southern India are setting up their homes only with goods available in the region.
These are the evidence that their brothers and tribes are dependent on the very peaceful and comfortable living, and it also feels that if anyone seeks to harm or hurt their natural resources, they will not be able to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that many of our freedom fighters were leading soldiers, belonging to tribal society.
Nobody will forget Lord Birza Munda, who fought hard to oppose British imperialism to defend their territory.
Besides I still mentioned, we can list a number of tribal society that we have incorporated with nature, and we are very obliged to our tribal people to continue to be the forest areas in the country.
Everyone must express our gratitude to them.
In the event of 'Manadin's voice,' the people of the country, we have said about the individuals and organizations who have played a brilliant role in society.
But all these tasks are not possible, but they have provoked deeper feelings in our minds to show a new way to seize for society.
A few days back, I read about the farmer brothers of Kurbachan Singh from Panchabai.
The son of the farmer brother Kurbachan Singh, who is hard working, will be married.
Kurbachan Singh has specifically told Grandma's parents that this marriage should be held very easily.
He said that there is no need to spend a large amount of money for marriage, or for any other matter.
He suddenly imposed a condition, saying it must be considered as a very simple variety.
He has been forced to ensure that women's householder, their outcome in the fields and we will not burn the velocities.
You should consider the social strength of this idea very well.
But it brings out how high his welfare is, how many families in our society can realise how to solve their personal problems as a whole of society.
The family members of Thiruvanantha Kurbachan Singh have shown us such examples.
I also read about the village of Kalarmajra near Naba in Punjab.
Rather than burning the garment, the village of Kalarmajra has come out of the peasants following the new technique of swimming them with soil.
My pleasures to Kurbachan Singh
My pleasures to the people of the village of Kalarmajra and all those who are particularly careless of the destruction of their environment.
You are all working as a real way to advance Indian tradition with a healthy lifestyle.
Just as the sea is formed, it is necessary to create a better environment for every constructive activity.
And it shall come to pass, that the people of the country, and our priests, say, Behold, there shall be peace upon us in all the works of three worlds, water, wind, land, lightning, breath, medicine, plantations, gardens, deepening.
Every soul, every heart, and this penetration within me, you must be calm anywhere.
Om Shanti . Shanti .
Wherever there is talk of world peace, India's name and partition will be wrecked by gold writings.
For India, this year is important on November 11 because the first World War ended on November 11 a hundred years ago.
As the war is over a hundred years, we feel that catastrophe and human casualties are over a hundred years.
For India, the first world war is very important.
In fact, we don't have direct connections with that war.
Our soldiers, however, fought with dresses in the war and committed the best sacrifices.
Indian soldiers have also carried out that nobody was killed by Indians when they came to war.
Our soldiers have expressed their clothing and courage in difficult areas and in bad weather.
The only purpose was to make peace.
This world knows that there have been massive losses and materials during the first world war.
About one crore military personnel and the same number of innocent people are dead.
This is what the whole world felt the importance of peace.
The meaning of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
Today's peace requires global cooperation and coordination to resolve not only war but also terrorism, weather changes, social change and economic growth.
The growth of the poor will be a real example of peace.
Our north-eastern states are the people of the country, which have an important personality.
There is no link to the natural beauty of the north-eastern states - the people of the region are very efficient.
The North-Eastern states are now famous by their special activity.
The North-Eastern region has seen a great improvement in natural agriculture.
In order to encourage the sustainable food system, the Sikkim state has gained a few days ago for a valuable future policy of 2018.
Not only this, Chikim has won this award, but withdrawal of recommendations from 25 countries.
For this, I appreciate the people of Sikkim.
I believe such festivals will be a chance to accept new promises.
Your progress is very important for the country's progress.
If you grow, this country will grow.
Live me good to all of you.
