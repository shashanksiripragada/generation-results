Man Ki Baat, October 2001
My great countrymen , today is the mountain of Deepavali .
Now wish everyone a lot of happiness .
It has been said in this sloka - light comes with happiness , health and prosperity in life , which shows the consciousness by destroying the opposite intelligence .
To remember such a decree my penance may be better than that , whether we spread light , spread negativeness and pray to destroy the feeling of enmity .
Nowadays in many countries of the world is being engraved .
The special thing is that it does not only include the Indian community , but now the governments of many countries , the citizens of the country , the festival of the social organization there also celebrates with full enthusiasm .
In a way India grows there .
Friends , Festival Tourism in the world is also one of its own attractions .
In the festivals which our country is the country of festivals there is also abundant potential of festival tourism .
We should try that Holi should be , dumb , naming , pongal , behaviour , propagate such festivals and include other states , people of other countries in the happiness of festivals .
We have many different festivals of parents of every state there that people of other countries have a lot of interest in them .
That is why the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in increasing festivals in India .
In what fate we had determined in my great countrymen, Gyi Mann that this lady would distinguish something.
I had said - let us come to this lady enjoy the male power and achievements of India i . . respect the Laxmi of India .
And in Jotzota after that innumerable motivational stories of Soshill Midia began to appear .
The Kodipaka of Barangal will run on Namo App that my mother is my strength .
Since my father had died in 10, since then my mother had taken responsibility for our five-year-old daughter.
Today we are in good business five brothers .
My mother is God for me.
That is the world for me and that is the Lakshmi of India in the true sense .
Rameshji, your mother is my guarantee.
Deepika Swami living united on the Twitter says , for them Major happiness is Laxmi of India which is the daughter of the conductor .
For poetry , Laxmi of India is his daughter .
They have the honor that their daughters do beautiful paintings .
They have received very good cream in the test of CLAT .
Then Medha Jainji has also written that for two years aged woman gives water to the travellers at the Gwalior railway station for free .
Medhaji has been very inspired by the humility and humility of this Laxmi of India .
If you come, many stories have been shared.
If you must read , get inspiration and even yourself have any inspiring story around you then show it .
All these Lakshmis of India are also honorably devoted to me .
It seems as if its foot was put in the 11th century itself .
How beautiful words , how good imagination and how good ideas are in this poem of Kannada language .
Peninda Permegondu Himavantu , Paninindanda Bhrigu Perchidunupaninda Jankaryanu Jaswadendanu Arthath , Himvant i . . because of his daughter Parvati , Bhrigu sage achieved fame because of his daughter Lakshmi and king Janaka because of his daughter - in - law .
Our fathers are our glory and because of the greatness of these mothers there is a strong identity of our society and its glittering future .
My great countrymen , 12th November , 2001 is the day on which 350th light festival of Shri Gurunank Devji will be celebrated worldwide .
The effect of Gurunakji is not only in India but also in the whole world .
In some countries of the world our Sikh brothers are settled outside which are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devi .
I can never forget my journey of the gurudwaras done in Vancouver and Tairon .
There is such a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Devji which I can tell you , but for this there should be many strips of mind .
Shri Guru Nanakdevji sent his message to a far off world .
They were one of the most travellers in their time .
We went to many places and wherever we went , we took our hearts easily , humility and simplicity .
Taking a message of goodwill and equality they went north or south , east or west , everywhere , people got saints and sages .
It is believed that the famous saint Shankardev of Assam was also inspired by him .
He travelled the holy land of Haridwar .
There is a sacred place in Kashi Gurubagh .
It is said, Shri Guru Nanak Devji was there.
They also went to religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism .
In the south Guru Nanakdevji had traveled till Sri Lanka .
During the journey of Bidar in Karnataka Guru Nanak Devji himself had brought the problem of water there .
Gurunnak is a famous place of era Saheb ' in Bidar which also reminds us of goddess .
One sadness Gurunnak Devji had also traveled to Kashmir and its surrounding areas in the north .
That is why such a deep relationship has been established between Sikh followers and Kashmir .
Guru Nanak Devji also went to Tibet where people considered him a guru .
Wherever he had traveled he is also worshipped in Uzbekistan .
He got a place in the heart of lakhs of people who followed their supremacy with full faith and are doing it even today .
Just a few days before the kingdoms of about 85 countries had gone to Amritsar from Delhi .
At the same time he visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and all this became the representation of the 250th light festival of Goddess .
After that many princes had put its carvings on Soshill Midia , along with great pride they also described their good experiences .
My elder brothers and sisters , I am confident that on 31 October you will definitely remember everyone .
This day the iron man of India is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel , who was the great actor who served the country in the field of unity .
In Sardar Patel where there was a unique ability to connect people together , on the other hand those who have a medical distinction also used to synthesis with them .
They were in the true sense maan of details.
Together with this he was also sufficient in combination .
They were involved in preparing plans and in the environment .
Whenever they read about the functioning style of Sardar Saheb , we hear it then it is known how important their plan was .
To participate in the convention of Congress in Ahmedabad in 111 AD thousands of talents from all over the country had to reach .
The responsibility of the entire arrangement of the administration was on the Sardar Patal , this technique was also used to improve the network of water supply in the city .
And it was decided that nobody has the problem of water .
Not only this he had also taken care of the fact that no resistance material or footprints should be stolen at the convention place and you will feel very nice to know what he has done in mind .
He contacted the peasants and instructed them to make khadi bags .
On the other hand there was also a good increase in the sale of khadi .
In order to play a role in the Closing House our country will always be the gratitude of the Sardar Patel .
The partners , we all know that in the form of the first home minister of India to unite the holidays , have done a very big secret and historical work .
It was also a speciality of Sardar Vallabhbhai whose eyes were on every incident .
On one side their attention was focused on Hyderabad , Junagarh and other states .
On the other hand their attention was on Dursudur Lakshadweep .
When we talk about the efforts of Sardar Patel then in the unity of the country their role in some special provinces is also discussed .
Immediately after the division of India in 14th the eyes of our natives were on Lakshadweep and he had sent a ship with his flag .
Like Sardar Patel it was known that immediately he started working hard without delaying time .
After their instruction the Tricolor was embraced immediately and destroyed everyone 's mindset to capture Lakshadweep .
After this incident he told the elder brothers that they personally ensure that necessary help is obtained for the development of symptoms .
Today Lakshadweep is contributing its importance in the progress of India .
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I hope that all of these beautiful islands and sea shores will meet now .
My great countrymen , on 31 October , 22018 the day that was dedicated to the Statue of University country and the world built in memory of Sardar Saheb .
This is the highest statue of the world .
The Statue of Liberty situated in America is also situated at a height .
The highest statue of the world fills every Indian with pride .
The head of every Hindustani becomes very high .
You will be happy to know that in a year more than 26 lakh tourists had reached to see the Statue of University .
This means that everyday at least eight and a half thousand people visited the grandeur of the Statue of University .
For partners , country , for all the states tourism industry this statu of unity can become a subject of study .
We all are witnesses of this , how within a year a place develops as world famous tourist spot .
People from the country and abroad come there .
Transport , stay , guide , environmental peaceful arrangements , one after the other is developing a lot of good arrangements .
Very big economic system is increasing and people are enhancing facilities there according to the needs of tourists .
The government is also playing its role .
Satellites , such a thing would be of Hindustani which does not have the pride of this thing , in the past , Tim Megazie has also given the status of 100 important tourist places of the world to the Statue of University .
I hope that all of you will go to see the Statue of University after taking out some time from their priceless time .
That's just my intention.
The partners , you know that every year from 2014 national unity day is celebrated on 31 October .
Today gives us the message of protection against the unity , integrity and safety of our country .
Like every time on 31 October the unity race for unity is also being organised .
It will include people from every class of society , every class .
Even today if you see , people are getting to see a hobby and genus for Merathon .
Run for unity has also been a unique exhibition .
Walking is beneficial for all that mind , brain and body .
On running here the feelings of fit India are fulfilled .
And at the same time we also join with a India - best India , not aim .
And this is why not only body , mind and culture are connected to bringing India to new heights for unity of India .
And this is why in whatever city you live , you can join you with respect about Run for unity around you .
I hope all of us will run on 31 October , for unity of India and for your fitness also .
My great countrymen tied the country with the help of unity .
This mantra of unity has become like a culture in our life and in a country full of varieties like India we should keep strengthening this mantra of unity at every point at every point at every point of view .
Our society has always been very active and alert to strengthen our countrymen , unity of the country and mutual harmony .
If we see only around us then many such examples will be found which have been working continuously to increase the harmony among themselves .
But many times it also happens that the effort of the society becomes very fast from the memory of its contribution .
Friends , I remember , as soon as in September 2001 Allahabad High Court had heard his mistakes about the Ramjanmabhoomi .
Just remember those days , then how was the weather .
While keeping in mind the parents however groups were playing games to take advantage of this situation in their own way .
How many types of languages were being spoken to produce heat in the environment .
In different voices , attempts were also being made to fill the light .
Attempts have been made to reduce tiredness from the environment .
This thing should always be kept in mind that gives us a lot of strength .
That day, that minute is a duty for all of us.
How big strength can the voice of unity give to the country is its example .
Today I also offer tribute to them .
But it is also a pleasant and interesting experience .
I've heard those things so I think I've heard of you too.
You can imagine that the highest battlefield of the world or the temperature of the world goes to zero to 50 - 60 degrees minus .
Oxygen in the air is also named only .
It is also not less than any paralysis to stay in such a situation in such a opposite process .
In such a victorious conservation the chest of our going to Bahadur keeps on protecting the borders of the country but even there clean Siachen campaigns are being run .
I am admiring them from the countrymen for this unique interpretation of Indian Army .
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that it is also difficult to cry .
In such a situation it is a very important task to separate the garbage and manage it .
We all know that Siachen is such a snow laden area which is the source of rivers and clean water .
Therefore the meaning of running a cleanliness campaign there is to ensure pure water for people living in the definite areas . These people also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shyok along with it .
My great countrymen , festivals are the festival of a new consciousness in the life of all of us .
And especially in Deepavali to buy something new , to bring something out of the market , it has to be made in small quantities in every family .
I once said, we wish to buy only local things.
If we get the object of our necessity from our village then there is no need to go to Taluka .
If you meet in Taluka then there is no need to go till Gilla .
We'll try to buy more local things.
Gandhi half century will become a great opportunity in itself .
And I am insisting that we should buy something or the other done by the workers of our treasure made by the hands of our younger brothers and sisters .
This lady also had bought a lot of money before the lady .
But many people will also be like that who would think that if I go after Diwali then perhaps a little cheaper would also be found .
So many people will be the ones whose shops are still left.
So along with the good wishes of Diwali I will inspire you , let us become the leader of buying local things .
You see how important we can also play in fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi .
Once again I read a lot of wishes on the sacred occasion of this lady .
In Deepavali we burst various kinds of flames .
But sometimes there is an inconvenience .
Sometimes wound also occurs .
My father is the leader of everyone , he will also take care of himself , and the festival will also be celebrated with great fanfare .
Manki Baat, September 2018
Fortunately there will be any Indian who is not proud of going to our army on our armed camps.
Every Indian , whether he is any field , caste , religion , religion or language - is always ready to express his happiness towards our soldiers and show support .
The nearest railway station from Thiruvananthapuram International Airport is at a distance of 2 K . .
We reminded the surgical strike that happened in 1916 when our soldiers gave a chance to the destructors of the proxy war under the guise of treason on our nation .
Our armed teams have organized exhibitions at different places in the country so that most of the citizens of the country , especially young people , can know what our strength is , how capable we are and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by keeping their lives in danger .
Like the traditional festival the day reminds the youth of the glorious heritage of our armies .
And inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country .
I also took part in a program in Jodhpur of Veers Rajasthan , now it has been decided that our soldiers will give all those accusations which will try to destroy the environment of peace and prosperity in our country .
We believe in peace and are compelled to excite it , but by understanding it with respect and that too at the price of the sovereignty of the nation , not at all .
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace .
In the 20th century more than one lac soldiers sacrificed their best towards peace in two world wars and that was when we had no relation with that war .
Our eyes were never on any other earth.
That was our resistance to peace.
Just a few days back on September 23 we remembered our virgin soldiers of Mysore , Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lansers on the completion of a hundred years of the war of Haifa in the preserved who had liberated Haifa from the attacks .
That too was an expedition made by our soldiers in the direction of peace .
Even today India is one of the most soldiers sending countries in different peace saving groups of connected nations .
For decades our armed soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world wearing blue halmat .
During the festival of Ganesha day people who are waiting with great enthusiasm for the heritage of Parade , one of them is Fly Past in which our air force exhibits its strength with unusual cars .
On 8th October we celebrate the day of the Air Force.
In 132 along with 6 pilots and 1 air troops our air force has joined the most adventurous and powerful air force of the 21st century today .
I congratulate all the air warriors and their families giving their services to the country in detail .
In 14th century when Pakistan attackers started an unprecedented attack then at that time there was only the air force which ensured that the Indian soldiers and equipments reach the battlefields of the war .
In 165 also the air force had given a jeopardy to the enemies .
Who does not know the war of independence of Bangladesh in 11th
In 1 air service has also been playing an important role in freeing Kargil from the handicrafts .
In Tiger Hill at the places of Dussehra the air force kissed them by making a bomb every night .
Whether there is relief and rescue work or risk management , the country is committed to them for the pleasant work of our air warriors .
To face natural threats from the storm , window , flood to the fire of the jungle and to help the people of the country their minds are becoming unique .
In order to ensure the equality of gender equity i . . male and female in the country the air force has established examples and the doors of every department have opened for the girls of the country .
Now along with the Short Service Commission the air force women are also giving alternative to the permanent commission which I had announced from the Red Fort on 15th August this year .
India can tell pride that in the armed forces of India not only the human power but also the same contribution of women 's power is being made .
The woman is strong , but now she is also becoming a school .
My beloved countrymen, past days, one of our officers of the Navy, Ablash Tommy, was fighting for his life and death.
The whole country was worried how to save Tommy .
You know that Abhilash Tommy is a very adventurous officer .
They were the first Indians to visit the world taking a small boat without any modern technology alone .
For the last 80 days, they were moving forward with their speed in the sea to participate in the Golden Globe race in the South Indian Ocean, but made the horrific ocean tower confuse them, but these verses of the nine armies of India were living in the midst of the sea for many days.
I had already met tommy .
Even after coming out of such a fabric he had a strong mood of faith , and once again the imagination that he told me to do something like this is inspiration for the youth generation of the country .
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tommy and his courage , his imagination , his imagination , strength to live and to live will definitely inspire the youth of our country .
My loved countrymen , what is the importance of 2 October for our nation , they also know every child .
This year is a special importance of 2 October .
From today for two years we have to do many different programs worldwide for the 150th Jayanthi of Mahatma Gandhi .
Martin Luther King junior or great things like Nelson Mandela , everyone got strength from Gandhiji ' s thoughts and they could fight for a long struggle to give their people equality and respect .
In today 's ' Ki Baat ' I want to discuss with you another important work of worshipping father , which more and more countrymen should know .
In 141, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas in the form of Constructive Programme.
Then in 145 when the freedom struggle took place , he prepared a reconciliation of those thoughts .
Pujaya Bapu has kept his thoughts in front of the countrymen on many subjects like cattle , villages , protecting the officers of the workers , cleanliness , spread of education .
This is also called Gandhi Charter .
Pujaya Babu was a folk comrade.
To join people and join them was the speciality of the father who was in their nature .
Everyone has experienced this as the most unique speciality of their personality .
He made every person feel that it is most important and permanent for the country .
His biggest contribution in the freedom struggle was that he made him a massive mass movement .
In the movement of freedom struggle on the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi every field of society , people of every class dedicated themselves .
Baba gave us all an inspirational mantra which is often known by the name of Gandhiji 's penance .
In this Gandhiji had said , I give you a gentleman , whenever you doubt that your ego starts swimming on you , then try this curiosity , recall the face of the poorest and weakest person you have seen and ask your heart what steps you are thinking will be useful for the person .
Does it have any benefit from it
Can he keep something on his own life and luck from it
That is , can those crores of people get self-reliance from it who are hungry stomach and the soul is untouched
Then you will see that your doubts are cured and eh is ending .
Even today a gem of my loved countrymen , Gandhiji is equally important .
Today the increasing middle class of the country , its growing economic power , increasing economic power , if we go to buy anything then can we remind the worshipper for a moment
Can you remember that intestine of the worshipper Bapu
What shall be lucky which will benefit from your shopping directly or straight .
And if the poor get benefited then my happiness will be greater than that .
Whenever we buy anything in the coming days after remembering this intent of Gandhiji , whenever we accept Gandhiji ' s 150th anniversary then we must think that whatever countrymen want from every shopping and even those who have sweated in it have put their money , who have dedicated their patience , all of them should have some benefit .
This is Gandhi 's birthplace , this is Gandhi 's message and I am confident that the poorest and weakest person can bring a small step of your life very big result .
When my loved countrymen , when Gandhiji had said that if you clean then you will get freedom then they probably do not know how it will happen but what happened , India got freedom .
Similarly , even today we can feel that even with this small task my country ' s economic progress , in economic efficiency , in order to fight against poverty my big advantage can happen and I believe that this is the true patriotism of today ' s era , this is the work of worshipping father .
Like if you think about buying fertilizers and handloom products at special occasions then you will get help from this .
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastriji used to keep the old or broken clothes of Khadi as well because somebody 's labor is hidden in it .
They used to say that all these khadi clothings are made of very hard work - one of its techniques should be brought into use .
This feeling of love with the country and love towards the people of the country was settled in the queue of Mahamanav .
Two days later along with worshipped Bapu we will also celebrate the sacrifice of Shastriji .
On the coming of the name of Shastriji we feel the feeling of unlimited faith in the minds of Indians .
His beauty personality always fills every countrymen with pride .
The speciality of Lal Bahadur Shastriji was that he was seen very humility from outside but he was strong like a mountain from inside .
Their list of Jawan Jay Kisan is the identity of their unique personality .
The result of their unsaved penance towards the nation was that in the short period of one and a half years they had given the mantras to go to the country and to bring the peasants to the peak of success .
My dear countrymen , today when we are reminding of the worshippers then it is very natural that you can not stay without talking about cleanliness .
From 15th September an expedition named ' Sarvatta Seva ' started .
Crores of people joined this campaign and I also got the privilege that I supplied with children in the Ambedkar school of Delhi .
I went to that school whose foot was kept by the worshipper Baba Saheb .
People of every class in the country joined this 15th century with this hardship .
Institutions also gave their contribution in it .
School students, college students, NCC (NCC), NSS (NSS), youth organizations, Media Groups and Corporate Gate, all of them paid large scale cleaning work.
I am very happy to all these hygiene loved countrymen for this .
Let's hear a phone call-namaskar
You have said a lot of big thing . cleanliness has its own importance in everyone 's life and under the ' Clean India campaign ' you have made a toilet in your house and now you are getting comfortable with it what else can be for us all
And perhaps the people associated with this campaign do not even estimate that you can not see because of being a pragmatcher but if you do not have to go to the toilet then you will have to lose life with how many problems and after making the toilet it became a big boon for you
Perhaps even if you did not have a phone to talk about joining this pass then perhaps this sensitive pass would not come in the attention of people associated with this campaign of cleanliness .
I specially thank you for your phone .
My loved countrymen , all India Mission ' has become a successful story not only in the country but also in the whole world about which all are talking .
This time India is organizing the world 's largest clean combination in history .
Mahatma Gandhi International Sensitivity Convention ' i . . Mahatma Gandhi International Sensitive Convention ' and specialists from all over the world are telling their experiments and experiences related to cleanliness together .
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sensation Convention (Mahatma Gandhi International Constitution Convention) will end with the beginning of the 150th Jayanthi celebration of Bapu on October 2, 1918.
It is especially important for the independentness , peace and justice of the aggrieved , infected and worries .
Dr.
In the contract given by Babasaheb Ambedkar many qualifications have been given for the protection of the root officers of the poor .
Inspired by their own Visiion, on October 12, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed.
After some days NHRC has to finish 25 years .
NHRC has not only protected human officers but also worked to increase human dignity .
The former prime minister of our country Shriman Atalbihari Vajpayee had clearly said that human authority is not a transformation for us .
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Complex the ideal information of the Vedic period is recorded .
NHRC has created widespread awareness for human officers , along with it has also played a happy role in stopping its misuse .
In this 25 year journey he has created an atmosphere of hope , faith among the people of the country .
For a healthy society , for the best democratic values I understand that this is a very big accident .
Today along with the work of human rights at the national level 26 state human rights program has also been constructed .
In the form of a society we need to understand the importance of human officers and bring them into conduct - that is the basis of the development of everyone .
My dear countrymen , may be the birth anniversary of Jayprakash Narayan , the birth anniversary of Rajmata Vijayaraj is the beginning of the centuries of Sindhiaji . All these great men have been inspiring us all , we have been blessings and on 31 October the responsibility of Sardar Saheb , I will talk to the area in the Agami Ki Baat , but today I demand to mention that for some years at the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb 31 October Runfort is organized in every city of India .
This year also we try to organize 'Run for unity' in our village, city, city, in the city.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Sahib because he worked for unity of the country throughout his life .
I resist you all that on 31 October through ' Run for unity ' we make our efforts to bind each class of the society in the field of unity and that will be good faith for them .
Man Ki Baat, August 2018
My great countrymen , Namadas , today the festival of the entire country is being celebrated .
For centuries this festival has also been a big example of social harmony .
There are many such stories in the history of the country in which one sheep had joined two different kingdoms or people associated with religion with faith .
Just a few days later the festival of Janmashtami is also coming .
The entire atmosphere will rise from elephants , horses , palanquins . Jai Kanaiah Lal kee , Govinda Govinda .
The natural joy of swimming in the color of Lord Krishna is something different .
Rescue all the countrymen and the horrific wishes of Janmashtami .
For the sake of Sanskrit dreams all the people of the country want my heart .
I am very happy with the girl Chinmayi who has taken this matter .
Besides the partners , demonstrators , the Sanskrit day is also celebrated on the day of the ritual ritual .
Those who are looking forward to protecting , suppliing and bringing this great heritage to such people , I give thanks to all those people .
Every language has its own greatness .
India is proud of this fact that your language is the world 's oldest language .
And we also pride all Indians in this matter that from Vedic times till now the culture language has also played a very big role in the propagation of knowledge .
The store of knowledge associated with every field of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature .
It will be happy to know now that the residents of Matur village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka state still use Sanskrit language for talks .
You will be surprised to know one thing that Sanskrit is such a language in which the construction of innumerable words is possible .
It is possible to create 000 metals, 20 per capita i.e. Sufix, 22 upsage i.e. profix, and innumerable words through samas.
And therefore in any efficient emotion or subject can be expressed absolutely sure .
That is , if a guru also gives knowledge of a character to his body , then there is no such thing or wealth in the whole earth so that the person can remove that season of his guru .
The learning day that is coming we all get out of this feeling . knowledge and guru are incomparable , invaluable , invaluable .
I read all the teachers of the country the wishes of this village teacher day .
I give thanks to the dedicated feelings towards social science , education and students .
My great countrymen , hard workers , this brings new hopes for our casualties throughout the month .
The trees - plants and dry reservoirs dried in the bright sun give a monthly relief .
But sometimes it also brings abundant growth and adverse effects .
Such a situation of nature has arisen that at some places there has been more rain than other places .
Now we have seen all the people in Kerala very bad effects have been on lifetime .
Today in this difficult conjunction the whole country is gathering with Kerala .
Our harmony is with those families .
I am sufficiently convinced that on the basis of the patience and adventurous courage of the people of the kingdom the Kerala will be restored very soon .
But during the risks we also get to see humanity .
Wherever there is an offence , whether it is Kerala or any other jill of India or region . For this life can become normal again , from Kachh to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari everything is doing in place of every patriot .
People associated with all age groups and every workplace are giving their contribution .
We all know that going to the armed army is drying up of the protective activity running in Kerala .
He did not leave any stone unturned to save the people trapped in the flood .
Then whether it is airplane , boating , landmass or BSF , CAISF , RFF , everyone has played a very important role in rescue and relief campaign .
I also want to make special mention of the hard work of going to Bahadur of NDRF .
Among these the subjects which people have written most from all over the country are the favorite Sri Atal Bihari Vajpayee of all of us .
Kirti from Ghaziabad , Vats from Sonipet , Pravin from Kerala , Dr . from West Bengal .
Happiness Banerji , Akhil Pande from Katihar of Bihar , who knows that many innumerable people have warned me to talk about different aspects of the life of Atalji by writing on Narendra Modi Mobile app and May Goa .
On the 16th August the country and the world listened to the news of the funding of Atalji , Harkoi became horror in doubt .
Such a nation who had left the prime minister 14 years ago .
One way, for the last 10 years, they had been far away from the active royalty.
The kind of snakes , devotion and fondness that have emerged in the entire country for Atalji show their large personality .
For the last several days the best passes of Atalji have come in front of the country .
India will always be the season of Atalji for the first reform authority of 2003 .
Due to this change two important changes came in the state of India .
First that in the kingdom the size of the ministry was limited to 15 percent of the meetings of the multi-purpose department .
Secondly , the limits determined under the anti-Pakshpalta Act were increased from one third to two thirds .
A clear direction has also been determined to disqualify its partners .
For many years the political culture of making big ministers in India had made houses , these big ministers were made not for the partition of work but for the happiness of the politicians .
Atalji changed this culture.
The money and resources were saved from their feet .
There has also been an increase in its synthetic activity .
Atalji was such a deep vision which changed the situation and in our political culture the healthy tradition came into being .
Atalji was a true patriot.
In the year 2001 Atalji changed the time of presenting geometry from five o'clock in the evening to 11 o'clock in the morning .
In this way he brought our life-loving triangles near such people .
I will surely say that for healthy populists, for better populists, better traditions are developed, continuous efforts are made to strengthen democracy, that too will be considered to be a better patronage to the universal minds.
Just a few days back the monthly seventh year of the Parliament has been completed .
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 percent and the royalty was 4 percent .
And the result of this is that folk songs 21 scholars and princes spent 14 widows in this sequence .
This procession of the Parliament will always be remembered as a witness to social trust and welfare of the youth .
Many important scholars who benefited youth and purchasing classes have been passed in this area .
Now everyone knows that like the species - tribes according to the decades , like the tribe - tribes the demand for making OBC Panch was being made .
To ensure the officers of the past class this time the country finished the imagination of making OBC Panch .
For the protection of the officers of the suitable species and the following tribes the work of passing the reformists has also been done in this sequence .
This law will protect the interests of the suitable species and the suitable species community better .
Satosath will stop the oppressors from doing atrocities on the people of this class and will synthesis of faith in the groups .
No member can support any kind of injustice against the women 's power of the country .
Therefore on crossing this much of the earliest improvement widow has taken care of such guys with hard decorations and the culprits of bad sin will be decorated at least 10 years old .
As soon as children below the age of 12 years the blasphemers will get scared of blisters .
It would have been read in the prints a few days ago that in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh a hospital has completed the sleeping in just two months and has finished two horsemen of Kukkum on one side .
Before this in the Katni of Madhya Pradesh only a hospital had decorated the slaughter of the slaughterers after five days of sleeping .
Even in Rajasthan the adults there have given such a fast speed .
This law will play an effective role in stopping the cases of misconception against women and children .
Without social change the economic progress is incomplete .
This time everyone has presented an ideal together in the fourth seventh century .
Today I consider all the companions of the country to be the honor of the heart .
My great countrymen , at present the attention of hundreds of countrymen is felt on Asian sports playing in Jakarta .
Waking up every morning people first look at the prints , TV , newspapers , social media and see that some Indian player has won the moonlight .
Asian games are still going on .
I want to give thanks to all the players who win the stars for the country .
Those whose competitions are still left , they also have a lot of wish to players .
The players of India are especially watching excellent in memories and dogs but our players are also bringing the moonlight in such games in which our next look is not so good as plays like music and boating .
This is not only the moonlight , but also the primarily of Indian sports and players ' s skyscrapers and dreams .
Our ladies are included in the increasing number of winners for the country which is a very positive signal .
Similarly among the youth players of the age group of 15-16 years is also our growing youth .
This is also a very good signal that most of the players who have won the moon are living in small towns and villages and these players have recommended this success through hard work .
For this reason I read all the fondnesses and along with this I also offer my tribute to the great player of Hockey Shri Dhanchandji .
I resist all the citizens of the country that they must play and take care of their fitness because , healthy India will create a rich and prosperous India .
If India is healthy then only the bright future of India will be formed .
Namasta Bhavnaji, I respect your feelings.
We all have seen building houses and memorials with intestines , but can you imagine that a huge mountain which was a whole rock about 120 years ago was given the form of an excellent large and wonderful temple . Perhaps it is difficult to imagine but it was made .
And that temple is - Kailasnath temple situated in Ellora of Maharashtra . If anyone tells you that a pillar of 60 metres long Granite has been made about thousand years ago and a pillar of about 80 tons of granite was kept on its peak .
But Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur of Tamilnadu is such a place where this uninterrupted meeting of architecture and engineering can be seen .
On seeing the queen of the 11th century in Patan of Gujarat , Harkoi remains surprised .
Bhumi Engineering has been the laboratory of India .
There were many such engineers in India who made Alpineya synonymous and presented examples of miracles in the world of engineering .
We also got such a nightmare in our heritage of great engineers whose works are still being impossible to the people .
M.
They are worshipped in that part of the country but the rest of the country also reminds them with great respect and spirituality .
In their memory only on 15th September engineers are considered as days .
On walking on their footsteps engineers of our country have made their own identity in the whole world .
When I talk of miracles in the world of engineering then in 2001 I remember a incident of the terrible earthquake that had occurred in Kachh in Gujarat .
So I got a chance to go to a village and there I got a chance to get a maji of more than 100 years of age .
They were enjoying us looking at me and saying this is my house.
It is called bunglow in Kachh .
Then spoken this house has seen 3 . earthquakes .
But you will not see any harm .
This house was built according to the natural condition of our ancestors here according to the environment here .
And he was saying this thing so pridefully that I came to this idea that even centuries ago the engineers of that time had created such a situation according to the local situation that because of which ordinary people were safe .
Now as we celebrate engineers day , we should also think for future .
Works should be done at different places .
In changing age will we have to learn some new things
You have to learn
Will you have to join
What should the students be taught
How does ero West become our priority
Many such things when we celebrate engineers day then we must think .
My great countrymen , the atmosphere of festivals .
And along with this preparations of Diwali also start .
Likewise with an emotion everyone wishes a lot .
Dhananism, I'll get it again.
Man Ki Baat, July 2018
So in some places people are still waiting for rain .
The comprehensiveness and diversity of India sometimes shows rains also the form of popular dislike .
But what do we give to rain
It is believed that who chose the path of struggle with nature and its consequence is that sometimes nature suppresses us .
Generally it takes some hours to go to the cave and get out of it .
But on that day something else was enjoying the misconception .
When they went deep inside the cave then suddenly due to heavy rains such water got accumulated near the entrance of the cave .
The way to get out of them stopped .
Because of no way they all stopped on a small hill inside the cave .
And that too isn't one two days.
On one side they were facing confusion.
On the other hand humanity in the entire world was exhibiting human qualities saved by God .
People from all over the world were praying to bring these children out peacefully .
The feeling of responsibility at every level was marvellous .
Whether it is a government , whether it is the parents of these children , their family members , whether it is the medium of expansion , the citizens of the country , everyone has told it by making a unique decoration of peace and patience .
Everyone was connecting with their campaign by becoming a team.
I believe that the consolidated behavior of everyone is like a learning subject , understanding .
It is not that parents are not sorry , it is not that they have not been able to get rid of the eyes of mothers , but the peaceful mindful behavior of the whole society is such a thing that they themselves learn for us .
It shows that when humanity becomes a snake then wonderful things are formed .
A few days back , the famous poet of our country Neerajji had screwed up from among us .
Every thing of neurology can give us a lot of strength to Hindustanis also .
The board of our school had told us about the stress and catastrophe of our examination . Now there is a message of your world for students like me .
Otherwise for two months of excavation and excavation , it is very important for all young people .
Because this is the time when the college has a very busy time .
Lacs of youths like Satyam enter the college after coming out of school .
If you go to February and March tests , Peppero and North then along with enjoying holidays in the months of April and May , the results are spent in determining the path ahead in life , selecting work , etc .
The attention of the students is limited to the umbrella by cutting from the house .
Students come under the umbrella of professors from the umbrella of parents .
I am sufficiently confident that my young friends will be very happy and happy about the beginning of life .
For the first time coming out of the house , leaving the village , getting out of a protective environment you have to make your partner .
All such youths leave their homes for the first time and take their life out in a new dimension .
Now I will tell everyone that , stay calm , listen to life , take full pleasure of intuition in life .
Learn something new , like new languages , learn new languages .
He has already achieved success in the examination of the MBBS of Jodhpur AIIMS .
His father fulfils his family by weeping garbage .
I congratulate them for their success .
There are many such students who come from the poor families and despite the opposite responsibilities have done something from their hard work and imagination which inspires us all .
Then that is the principal of Delhi , or whose father is a bus driver in DTC , or the Abhay Gupta of Kolkata who studied himself by sitting under the street street on footpath . Ahmedabad ' s daughter Afrien Shaikh or whose father operates autorickshaw .
Or , Divyaang girl Anushka Panda of Gurgaon is suffering from a hereditary disease named spinal cord disease , spine muscular atrophy from birth itself .
All of these have achieved such success in seeing the whole world by breaking all the obstacles from their strong imagination and hypocrisy .
If we see around us then we will also get some such examples .
Any good incident made in any corner of the country gives energy to my mind .
And as soon as I am telling you the story of these young people then along with that I remember the words of poet Nirajji and this is the purpose of life .
The incident was something like this , once I was discussing with two Indian youths in San Jos city of America known as technology hub .
I had given them how they can use their talents for India , they think and take out time and do something .
I had introduced them to convert brain drine into brain gene .
Both of them of Rae Bareli tried an innovative attempt by the IT professional Yogesh Sahuji and Rajnish Bajpayeeji by sneaking my challenge .
Yogeshji and Rajneeshji have prepared a smart gaav app mixing with using their professional skills .
This app is not just connecting the people of the village with the whole world but now they can get any information or information on their mobile .
The Sarpanch , District Magistrate , Telugu Development Officer of this resident village of Taudakpur village of Rae Bareli made people aware of the use of this app .
The development works being done in the village to keep an eye on it by this app now it has become easy to keep an eye on its progress .
In this app the phones of the village are Derektory , Information Department , Recognition of the affairs , Health Centre and Recognition Centre .
Approximately half a gram of fisherman , fat ratt between the kids , works like a market for their products in a way .
If you see this incident very finely then one thing will come to mind that whose life has been lost in America amidst living , conducting there . Those youths who have left India many years ago also know the fineness of their village , understand the neighbourhood and are associated with the village .
This is the reason that perhaps they could make the village properly and they could make something better according to it .
The emotions of showing something to their villages , their roots and interests are naturally fallen inside every Hindusthan .
But due to sometimes due to sometimes due to intervals , sometimes because of some situations a thin dust gets accumulated on it , but if some such chicken pox also touches them then good things come again .
Pandharpur Bari is actually a unique journey in itself .
The partners of Ashwadi Ekadshi who had lost 23 this time is considered to be the magnificent referendum of Pandharpur Bari .
Pandharpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15 - 20 days before the Ashwadi Ekadshi Varkari i . . pilgrims come out on foot for the journey of Pundarpur with Polkhi .
This journey which is called Bari is included in lacs of barkers .
Keeping the footsteps of great saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram in the palanquin .
Tirthankaras Bhagwan Vithal or who are also called Vithoba or Pandurang .
Lord Vithal protects the devils of poor , wounded , victims .
Whatever is Maharashtra , Karnataka , Goa , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana , people have inadequate faith .
There is a different experience of viewing Vithoba temple in Pandharpur and its month , its beauty , spiritual joy .
I am the leader of the mind that if you get the opportunity then you must feel the time of Pundarpur .
Gyaneshwar , Namdev , Eknath , Ramdas , Tukaram such innumerable saints are still teaching people of Adana in Maharashtra .
They are giving strength to fight against blindness .
Then whether it is their burden or impossible , we get the message of harmony , love and patience from them .
In front of blindness the mantra of the society can fight .
These were those people who stopped the society from time to time , also showed tokyo and raisins and made it clear that the old princes would become impoverished from our society and the culture of compassion , equality and compassion among the people , this land of India is very boundless .
We quit 23 on the Jayanthi of Tilkaji and on the first light we remind them of their completion .
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and self-confidence .
The power and intelligence of British rulers to show their mistakes were among them .
The British had been so scared of democratic Tilak that he had asked him to put a treasure on him thrice in the last 20 years and this is not a little thing.
Today I want to keep in front of the people of the country a charming event associated with their idol in Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad .
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 16 , then at that time more than 40 thousand people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad .
And during this journey Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had got the opportunity to talk to him .
And Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was so impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when the first August , the death of Lokmanya Tilak ji took place on 10th day he decided that he would make a memorial of Tilak ji in Ahmedabad .
Finally the statue was made and Sardar Sahib did not come in the hands of another but on 28 February 12th day the Khud Mahatma Gandhi inaugurated it .
And I am listening to this time of the British .
Due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji the tradition of the Sarvajanik Ganesh festival started .
The public Ganesh festival along with traditional faith and excitement has become an effective medium of moving forward the feeling of social awareness , socialism , equality among the people .
If you see that time was such a time when the country became a snake for fighting against the British , these festivals broke the wagons of the species and sect and worked as a snake to everyone .
With time the popularity of these events has increased .
From this itself it is known . Whatever this is crazy in our youthfulness towards our ancient heritage and our virgin leaders of history .
Today in many cities it is such that you can see the mandap of Ganesh in almost every street .
My descendants , even during my past and when I am reminding of Lokmanya Tilakji today then once again I will inspire you that even this time we celebrate Ganesh festival , celebrate Ganesh festival with full strength , but keep an intent to celebrate Eco Friendly Ganesh festival .
And I will say that even on May Goa and on the Narendra Modi Ape the activities of Eco Friendly Ganesh festival are kept for extensive propagation .
I'll bring you to the right people.
Lokmanya Tilke raised self-confidence among the countrymen and gave him the information , Swaraj is our birthdate officer , and we shall jump on taking it , even today it is time to say .
Or , Swaraj is our congenital emperor and we shall join it .
The reach of every Indian should be up to good results of good governance and development .
Who sacrificed his life so that the countrymen could breathe in the air of freedom .
Chandrashekhar inspired many youths for freedom movement and freedom .
Azad put his life on the boat but he never sneaked in front of the foreign rule .
I am sure I also got the opportunity to go to Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh .
Once again I bow down to these two great dreams of Bharat Mata , Lokmanya Tilakji and Chandrashekhar Azadji .
Just a few days back in the program of 400 metres in the Junior Andr-20 World Athletics Championship organised in Finland , India 's Bahadur kid and Kisanputri Hima Dassed Golden Centre created history .
In the reply of my letter to the fear of a woman unity of the country I have e-mailed me from Indonesia that she is still preparing the Asian games there .
The name of the country given is Roshan .
In Tunisia the unity of the world Para Athletics Grand Pre 22018 has won gold and bronze moonlight .
This proverb is special because he has also made his administrator through his work .
Due to the sudden passage of the way in 2003 the half of the lower part of the body of the girl unity Bhayan has become unsuccessful , but this girl has not been able to lose her confidence and has convinced her to make herself strong .
More than one Divyang Yogesh Kathuniaji has also established golden chain in Para Athletics Grand Prey Discos Tree -LRB- Cirfencing -RRB- in Berlin and along with them beautiful Singh Gurjer has also won gold chain in Bhalafenk .
My great countrymen , many events of the history of the month of August , remain filled with the fear of festivals , but due to mosquitoes sometimes the disease also enters the house .
I am reading very good wishes for this August month , and for many festivals going on for centuries to celebrate the inspiration of patriotism for the better health of everyone .
Once again I'll get what you want to do.
Very thankful.
Just a few days back a historic cricket match Jozi in Bangalore .
You must have understood a little that I am talking about the test match of India and Afghanistan .
That was the first international match of Afghanistan and it is a matter of pride for Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India .
In this match both teams had performed a lot of exhibitions to him and other speaker Rashid Khan of Afghanistan had also performed a lot in the IPAL this year and I remember that President of Afghanistan Shriman Ashraf Ghani had written me on his own Twitter , the people of Afghanistan have a lot of pride on his hero Rashid Khan .
I am the adviser of our Indian friends who have finished a platform for our players to show their skills .
The best Rashid in Afghanistan resists it .
That is the world 's asset of cricket and along with that he also wrote it in a little funny way whether we give it to anyone .
This match will be a memorable match for all of us.
This was the first match therefore it is very natural to remember but I will remember that match for some special reason .
Indian team did something like this which is an example for the whole world .
What can we do while taking the Indian team trophy , he did it .
While taking the Indian team trophy the team of Afghanistan which was playing the international match for the first time invited the team of Afghanistan and photographed both the teams .
What happens to the SPORTSMAN SPIRIT, Spoartsmanship - we can feel this from an incident.
To unite the sports society and to find out what is the challenge among our youth is a very good way .
Both India and Afghanistan have my good wishes .
I hope that in the same way we will play with each other , with the entire Spottsman spirit as well as the blisters .
My loved countrymen had a different view on the fourth yoga day on 21st June .
The whole world looks together.
In Brussels, there is Europian Parliament, the headquarter of the United Nations in New York, the Japanese nau-senna fighter ship, everywhere, people looked to yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia there was a historical program of yoga and I was told that many asanas were demonstrated by women .
On the high barfila peaks of Laddakh the soldiers of India and China have done yoga together .
Yoga works to break , connect all the borders .
Thousands of enthusiastic people of hundreds of countries have made this opportunity a big festival on going above every kind of distinction , religion , region , color or linga .
If people from all over the world were taking part in the programs of yoga day after being so excited then why would not its enthusiasm be multiplied in India
The country is proud , while hundreds of hundreds of millions of people see that to go to the security force of our country have studied yoga in three places of nine-senna , landscape and air services .
Some virgin soldiers have done yoga somewhere in Sabarina , while some soldiers have done yoga on the mountains of snow in Siachen .
Our warriors of the air force finished everyone by doing yogasana at a height of 15 thousand feet from the sky .
The observation was that he did not sit in the air but swimming yoga in the air .
Whether there is school , college , office , park , high building or playground , yoga practice has happened everywhere .
A scene of Ahmedabad was touching the heart .
There approximately 50 Divyang Bhai - Baheno established the world record by making yoga together at one place .
I'm supposed to be working today as a singleness, revolution.
I hope that the movement that wellness is going on from yoga will move forward .
Most of the people will make it the symptoms of their life .
On My Govt and Narendra Modi Ape many people wrote to me that I talk about the Doctrine Day coming on 1 July this time .
We remind the doctor in the time of trouble but this is such a day when the country raises the achievements of our doctors and gives them a lot of harmony for their service and dedication towards the society .
We are those people who worship mother in the form of god , believe in God properly because mother gives us life .
Mother gives birth to us , then sometimes the doctor gives us birth again .
The role of the doctor is not limited to treating diseases only .
Today the doctors have medicinal experiments along with this they will have general life style trands , what effect do they have on our health , they have a lot of experience .
Indian doctors have made their identity worldwide with their capacity and skill .
In Medical Profession, Maharath is also known for the evacuation of our doctor complex medical problems along with hardwarking.
Without the point of view of mind I wish all our doctoral partners on behalf of every country 's headache of the doctrine day coming on July 1 .
My loved countrymen , we are such lucky people whose birth has occurred in India .
India is a rich test , when there is no such month , there is no such day in which no historical incident has occurred .
If you see then every place in India has its own time .
There is a saint associated with it , there is a great man , there is a famous person , everyone has the contribution of his parents , his own is great .
A lot of thanks for your phone cell.
It is true that I am coming to Magahar in 28th century and as well as when I was in Gujarat , the graveyard of Gujarat will be known now .
When I used to work there , then I had done a very big national conference of people associated with the tradition of a saint Kabir .
You people know why Kabirdasji had come to Magahar
At that time there was a belief that those who die in Magahar do not go to heaven .
The body which excludes in the opposite Kashi goes to heaven .
Mugahar was considered unclean but saint Kabirdas did not believe it .
He did the work of breaking such evils and blindness of his time and hence he went to Magahar and there he got administered .
Saint Kabirdasji gave a burden on social equality , peace and brotherhood through their witnesses and talents .
He was their ideal.
In their constructions we get to see this ideal and even in today 's age it is so inspiration .
One of them is . Kabir Soy Peer Hai , if you do not know the pyramids on the pyramids , I am the true pyramid i . . the true pyramid who knows and understands the pain of the other , who does not know the pain of the other , he is fit .
Kabirdasji gave special emphasis on social harmony .
They thought much ahead of their time.
That time when the time of falling and struggle was going on in the world , he gave a message of peace and harmony and worked to remove the differences by uniting the minds .
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is only the service of God .
Wherever they went , they made many initiatives for the good of the society .
The arrangement of free kitchen from social distinction where every species , pants , religion or sect can come and eat food . Guru Nanak Dev had started this anchoring arrangement .
In 2001 the 550 light festival of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated .
I want all of us to join it with enthusiasm and enthusiasm .
I am also inclined to think about what new imaginations , what new imaginations , whatsoever imaginations , prepare , prepared and with great respect , make it all motivate this light festival in the entire society and in the world .
The struggle of India 's independence is very long , very wide , very high , is full of innumerable martyrs .
There is a history associated with Punjab .
In 2001 the fearful incident of the Jalianwala Bagh is also ending 000 years which had kept humanity in shame .
Who can forget that black day of 13th April , 11 when on crossing all limits of cruelty using the power the pills were run on innocent , handicapped and innocent people .
Jitt is always of peace and affliction , is of sacrifice and sacrifice .
Sriman Raman Kumar of Rohini of Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile app that on 6 July the next day is Dr .
Shyamaprasad is the birthday of Mukherjee and he wants Dr . in this program .
Talking to the countrymen about Shyama Prasad Mukherjee .
Ranji is the first to be very compassionate.
It seemed very good to see your cotton in the history of India .
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with many areas, but the areas that were closest to them were education, administratories and partliamentary officers.
Very little people would know that the lowest age of Kolkata University was vice-chenselor .
On the invitation of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee Shri Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore had contacted Convocation in the Kolkata University in Bengali language .
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first industrial minister of India and if seen in one meaning he had made a strong basket of India and industrial development , prepared a strong baske , prepared a strong platform .
The first industrial policy of independent India established in 148 came with the print of their Idea and Vision .
The dream of Mukherjee was , India is industrially self-reliant , efficient and prosperous in every area .
They wanted India to develop big industries and also pay complete attention to MSME , handloom , clothes and cottage industry .
For good development of cottin and small industries they got financing and organisation step , for which all India handicrafts board, all IndiaHandlom Board had been established by Khadi Village Industries Board.
Shyam Prasad had a very big contribution to Mukherjee .
They were very dedicated to the development of West Bengal .
The result of their understanding , wisdom and activity is that a Hindu of Bengal can be saved and that is today the Hindus of India .
Dr.
Remember the message of unity of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee , with the feeling of harmony and brotherhood , stay associated with the progress of India .
In the last few weeks of my loved countrymen I got an opportunity to contact the beneficiaries of various youths of the government through video cool .
They got the opportunity to know directly about the changes in the life of people going forward from the files .
People told their imagination , their happiness and sorrow , their achievements .
In remote villages the workers are providing services from the pension of the elders of the village to the construction of passports through the medium of the Common Service Center .
While gathering some sister of Chhattisgarh stafale is doing business by making its ice cream .
Like the insecticide light in Jharkhand lakhs of youths of the country are providing cheap medicines going to nearby villages along with running the genital medicine center .
I do not know how many things were there . There is no corner of the country where people do not have to say about their success .
In such an environment when ordinary humans come with the point of view of new hope , new emergence and incidents happening in their life then they do not have the credit of the government .
The incident of small children of a small village far and wide also becomes inspiration for hundred crore countrymen .
With the help of technology for me , a moment of spending time with beneficiaries is very happy , very inspiring and there is a joy of doing more work .
To give life to the poor one gets a new joy , a new enthusiasm , a lot of new inspiration .
I am very interested in the countrymen .
40-40,50-50 lakh people joined this video bridge program and you did the job of giving me new power .
I once again ask you to express the glory of all of you.
I always feel , if we see around us then somewhere or the other something is good .
There are people who do good .
We can also feel the aroma of goodness .
One thing came in my mind in the past and that's a unique combination.
On one side where there are professionals and engineers , on the other hand we are friends and sisters connected with fields .
Now you will think that this is a totally different business - what is its relation .
But it is that Copperate Professionals in Bangalore came with IT Engineers, they together formed a simple prosperity trouser and they have activated this trouser for the arrival of the peasants.
Together with the peasants and made warriors and continued to make successful efforts to increase the income of the peasants .
Even yields would not be good and neither would they be too much . Today they are not only growing vegetables but also getting good feelings by making marketing of their vegetables through the medium of trost .
The producers of cereals are also associated with it .
On one side from the production of sins to marketing there is a main role of the peasants in the entire Chennai and on the other hand the partnership of the peasants in Nafa is trying to ensure their hack .
I give these youth a lot of treachery to use this innovative and I am happy that these young men associated with the world of professionals,technocrats, Engineering have adopted the way to join the village, join the fields outside their border.
Once again , I know some of these innovative experiments of my country , some of them may have known , some people will know nothing , some will not know , but hundreds of people are doing something good continuously , they all have a lot of good wishes from me .
GST has to complete one year.
One Natioun, One Tax was dreaming of the people of the country, he's turned into reality today.
One Natioun, One Tax Reforum, for this, if I have to creditate anybody, I'm giving credit to states.
GST is a very good example of Cooperative federalism, where all the states together decided in the country and then such a huge tax reform was established in the country.
Till now two meetings of the GST Council have been done and we can pride all that people of different political thoughts sit there , people of different states sit there , there are different propriety folded states , but in addition to this all these decisions have been taken in the GST Council as much as possible .
Before GST there were 1 different types of taxes in the country but now in this arrangement only one tax has been implemented in the entire country .
GST is the victory of honor and there is also a festival of honor .
In the first country many times complaints of insector state used to come in Texas .
Due to the coming of GST check post has stopped and the arrival of goods and goods has become fast because of which not only the time is being saved but also it is getting a lot of benefit in the Logistics Nakshatra .
GST may be the world's largest tax reforce.
In India such a big tax reform could be successful because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST could be ensured through the energy itself .
Normally it is believed that such a big resort , such a big country , such a large number takes 5 to 5 years to year to complete it , but the enthusiasm of the respected people of the country , the result of the participation of the nation ' s faithfulness is that within a year this new tax system has made its place , has achieved stability and according to the requirements it also improves through its inbuilt system .
He has offered a huge success in himself by hundreds of millions of countrymen .
Once again fulfil the mind , now what is the mind waiting for , to meet you , talk to you .
Man Ki Baat, May 2018
Campaign
Through the medium of ' Ki Baat ' you have got a chance to stay before you once again .
You will remember the people properly that a team of six women commanders of the nine army had been on a sea journey for many months .
Navika Sagar Parikrama . Yes , I want to talk about it .
These six daughters of India , their teams traveled all over the world through the medium of the sea for more than four days , 21 May returned to India and welcomed them very hotly throughout the country .
He spent a distance of about twenty thousand nautical miles while traveling in different oceans and many seas .
This was the first incident of this kind in the world .
Last Wednesday I got the opportunity to see all these girls , listen to their experiences .
If we see the development journey of human species then progress has arisen from somebody 's adventurous coach .
In the past you must have seen that some new things have been kept in mind about those who roam on Mount Everest and for centuries Everest has been challenging human species and people have also been accepting those challenges .
On 16th May , five tribal children - Manisha Dhurve , Pramesh Ale , Umakanth Madvi , Kavidas Kamtode , Vikas Soyam - this group of our tribal children rode on the highest peak of the world .
I am giving great pleasure to the school people of Chandrapur , my little partners , heart .
Recently 16 year old Shivangi reader became the youngest Indian woman to serve Everest from Nepal .
Betty is very pleased to Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Diya Everest became the joint of the first Indian father and son .
It is not that only young people are fighting for aversity .
Sangeeta Baheley has played the Everest and the age of Sangeeta Bahl is more than 50 .
There are also some striking people who have seen that they have not only skill but also they are sensitive .
For years people have been fighting for Everest and there are many people who have successfully completed it .
I am giving great pleasure to all these adventurous people , especially the girls , from the heart .
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, just two months ago when I talked about Fit India, I didn't think it would have a good effect on him.
In such a large number people of every region will come forward in its capacity .
When I talk about Fit India then I believe that as much as we want to play the country .
On social media people are sharing the video of fitness challenge , by tagging each other in them they are chalning them .
Everybody is joining this campaign of Fit India today .
Whether it is people associated with the film , people associated with the world or the common people of the country , the soldiers of the country , the school teacher , the same humor is heard all around - home fit is Indian fit .
The interesting thing for me is that I have also given the capture of the Indian cricket team Virat Kohli Challenge and I have accepted that challenge .
I believe that this is a very good thing and this kind of challenge will encourage us to stay fit and others also to stay fit .
Sixth Yadavji, you're very proud of your phone call.
This thing is true that the games which used to live in the life of every child sometimes , are getting humiliated today .
These sports especially used to have special interest in summer vaccination .
There are two types of games in traditional games .
There is also outside the house and is also inside the house .
The unity hidden behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games .
One game is known in different places , different names .
I am of Gujarat .
I know that there is a game in Gujarat .
They are played with the second or passage of coats or ambulance and with the square board of 88 .
This game used to be played in almost every state .
We were also playing this game .
Which of us would have been such that in childhood did not buy chicken pox -LRB- last pox -RRB- .
Moi Dandiya -LRB- Gilli Danda -RRB- is a playing game from villages to cities .
In different parts of the country it is known by different names .
In Andhra Pradesh it is known by the name of Gotibila or Karrabila .
In Udisha it is called Gulibadi then in Maharashtra it is called Vitidalu .
Some games used to stay in their own season .
Like chewing kite is also a season .
When all the beetles are blown up then we can express the unique qualities of which we play .
You must have seen that many children are of shameful nature but they become very strange while playing .
It expresses itself , the elders who are seen to be serious , the one of them who is hiding while playing comes out .
Our traditional games are made in such a way that along with physical capacity our focus , concentration , awareness , swiftness also increases .
From children to grandfather , small , when all are playing then what is called Paya , which is called generation gap , it gets stuck somewhere .
Many games also make us aware of society , environment etc .
Today it is necessary that school , sheris , youth group etc . come forward and encourage these games .
Through Croud sourcing we can create a huge collection of our traditional games.
My dear countrymen, on the last five years our country will become the honor of the anniversary of the world's environment day.
This is an important achievement for India and in order to reduce climate change in India the increasing leadership of India is also being accepted in the world - this is its fulfillment .
This time theme is - Beet plastic pollution should not be destroyed by plastic pollution .
My father has been able to understand the feeling of this theme , understanding its importance , we all ensure that we do not use polythene , loograde plastic and try to reduce the negative effect of plastic pollution on our nature , on our wild life and on our health .
Go to the website wed-India of World Environment Day 2018 and many information has been given there very interestingly - see that , know and try to bring them down in your daily life .
When there is acute heat , the flood comes , does not take the name of stopping the rain , unbearable cold occurs then every person speaks of globe warming , climate change by becoming an expert but what is the work done by talking
In the past few weeks we all saw that in different areas of the country there was also dusty breeze , heavy wind sufficient rains which are very expensive .
Janhani also happened, Malhani too.
All these things are basically the result of the changes in the environment .
Our culture , our tradition did not teach us to struggle with nature .
We have to stay with nature with goodwill , stay connected with nature .
Mahatma Gandhi had spoken this thing in the footsteps of the whole life .
When India played an important role in the Copp 21 and Paris understanding, when we interacted with the international solar Alliance, it was an idea of fulfilling this dream of Mahatma Gandhi in the roots of all that.
On this environment day we all think about whether we can do something to keep our planet clean and green .
How can you move forward in this direction
Can you become innovative
Monsoon is about to come , this time we can keep a goal of terrible trees and not only to plant trees but to make arrangements for its maintenance till its rise .
My dear countrymen, especially my new partners
Now you remember the 21st June , not only you but also the whole world remembers 21st June .
21 June is considered as an international yoga day for the entire world and all this has been accepted and people start preparing for months before .
Nowadays there are reports that in order to celebrate 21 June as an international yoga day in the whole world strong preparations are going on .
Young for unity and hermonious society have a message that the world has experienced frequently in the past few years.
By doing yoga adventurousness occurs which always protects us like father .
The feeling of forgiveness arises as if the mother has her own sensitivity and mental peace becomes our permanent friend .
Bharatuhari has said that by doing regular yoga the truth becomes our child , our brother , our brother , our own brother , our bed and knowledge become our hunger killer .
When all these qualities become partners of someone then Yogi achieves victory over all kinds of dangers .
Once again I resist the people of the country that they make our discipline more and a healthy , happy and prosperous nation .
Today there are 2 May . Jawaharlal Nehruji 's first major president of India .
I pray to Panditji .
This memory of the month of May is also associated with another thing and that is Veer Savarkar .
This was the month of Mano in 185 when Indians had shown their strength to the British .
In many industries of the country our going and the peasants were committed to the opposite of injustice by showing their own goodwill .
The sad thing is that for a long time we kept calling the events of 185 only rebellion or sepoy rebellion .
In reality this incident was seen in the form of ignorance but it was also an attempt to harm our self-esteem .
That Veer Savarkar was the only one who had written indiscriminately that whatever happened in 185 was not a rebellion but it was the first battle of freedom .
The Veers of Indian House of London along with Savarkar celebrated it with the humidity of its 50th year .
This is also an amazing union that in the same month Veer Savarkarji was also born in the month the first independence struggle started .
The personality of Savarkarji was full of specialities .
They were suppliers of both science and science .
Generally Veer Savarkar is known for his struggle against his terrible and British rule but apart from all that he was also an Ozzvi poet and social reformer who always kept a load of understanding and unity .
One wonderful description about Savarkar ji has been done by our favorite visiting Atal Bihari Vajpayee .
How comfortable the picture was done by Atalji .
Savarkar walked with both poems and revolutions .
He was also adventurous revolutionary along with being a sensitive poet .
Our girls who were ever compelled to ask at home by taking garbage - today they are swimming clothes to cover the burden of the poor by learning the work of seal .
I read these ladies full of hope and faith for the good wishes of their bright future .
He has shown that if there is a desire to show something and for that if you have a murder then success can also be achieved in the middle of all the difficulties .
And that is not just the thing of Sikar , in every corner of India you will get to see all this .
If we look at you , then it will be kept in mind how people fix problems .
You must have experienced that whenever we go to a tea shop , we enjoy the tea there then some people present there also have discussion and discussion .
This discussion is also of royalty , social also happens , films are also there , games and players are also there , problems of the country are also there - or such problems are there - they should be solved in such a way - but most of these things remain confined to the discussion only but some people are such that go ahead in the direction of bringing changes from their work , their work and work , gives them the form of harmony .
Mr. D.
In the last five decades light rava has been teaking in the city .
Those who sell a nutritious tea , today you will be surprised to know that in the life of more than 0 children the chances of education are fulfilling .
He opened a school named ' Aashashvasana ' for children living in huts , on which this poor tea seller spends 50 percent of his income .
They make complete arrangements of education , health and food to all the children coming to school .
I'm D.
I am very pleased to give a new direction to the life of the poor children of light .
He has destroyed the darkness of his life .
Who does not know this volunteer ' Ma Jyotirgamayam ' but has seen it alive .
Get light.
His life is a motivation for all ourselves , society and all the nations .
You will also have the series of inspirational events around you .
There will be innumerable incidents.
Come let us go ahead with positiveness .
In the month of June it is so hot that people wait for rain and in this hope they look towards the clouds in the sky .
After some days people will also wait for the moon .
The meaning of looking at the moon is that it can be considered .
After a month 's fast during Ramzan the festival of Eid is a symbol of the beginning .
I believe that all people will celebrate this with full enthusiasm and on this occasion especially children will get good benefits .
I hope that these festivals will give more strength to the binding of goodwill in our society .
Man Ki Baat, April 2018
Now from 4 April to 15 April 21th Commonwealth Games was organised in Australia .
The world along with India has participated in it .
When there is such a big event , thousands of players from all over the world are participating in it , you can imagine how will it be .
Excitement , zeal , enthusiasm , hopes , imagination to show something - when there is such a situation then someone can keep it away from himself .
Our players also performed a lot of exhibition after getting down at the hope of the countrymen and lost one medal after another .
Then he's Shooting, wrestling, wiegtlifting, table tennis or badminton, India has performed a record.
26 gold, 20 race and 20 races - India spent about 66 medals.
This success gives pride to every Indian .
Walking on foot is a matter of pride and happiness for players .
For the entire country , it is a festival of great pride for all the countrymen .
Perhaps I'd have less words to express this feeling.
But what I heard from these players, I want to hear you.
Especially that is, this time there were many things, which happened for the first time.
Do you know that all the warts that were from India in the Commonwealth Games this time have come to pass .
As much as Manika Batra participated in the event , he won medals in all .
She is the first Indian woman who has won India a golden drink in the Individual table tennis .
India has been found in the most medals shooting .
In the cheap Chaudhri Commonwealth Games , the only Indian who wins the medal is Para Pover - Lifter .
The games of this time were also special because most of the footprints were female athletes .
Squash, boxing, waiting, shooting... woman players told me.
In Badminton the final match is two players of India , Saina Nehwal and P .
V.
Sindhu had happened in the middle .
Athletes participating in Games had come from different parts of the country , from small towns .
There is also the contribution of their friends who have kept their curse in every situation .
I am enjoying everyone with those players very much , I give them good wishes .
During the last month I had advocated with the countrymen , especially with our youth and I invited everyone to join such a fit India , ask for fit India .
A gentleman Sriman Shashikant Bhonsle has written in Swimming Pool shouting a photo of himself - My weepon is my boddy, my element is water, my Lord is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written, - I feel myself helpless and healthy from Morning walk.
And he further says that-- for me--fitness comes with a little and we should little, when we are helpy.
Devnathji has no doubt that hatpines are only fitnesses.
Cine artist Akshay Kumar has put a video on the Twitter .
Many other youths have also shared their experiences by joining Fit India officers .
I understand that this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us , for the whole country .
The Mahatma of 21 June International Yoga Day has now taken swimming in the whole world .
Prepare even now .
And you must have seen that a Animated video, in which I've been told, is just being very popular.
My young friends, now we'll be in trouble with the holidays coming out of the circumambulation of exam, exam, exam.
How to celebrate holidays , where to go .
Outside the four walls there is a chance of living a new life , feeling away from the computer .
My young friends, I'm warning you today for a special internship.
There are three ministerial spots of the Government of India , HRD , Drinking Water , together with the three-four ministry of the government , a Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018 has done this launch .
The students and scientists of college , the youths of NSS , the youths of NSS , the youth who ask for something to do , ask for the country and something to do , in the changes of society who want to join themselves , want to become free , for all this is the opportunity for them and for this there is a chance to purification from them and when we will get the benefit of Mahatma Gandhi ' s 150th birth anniversary from October 2 , we will also get the benefit of doing something before that and I will also tell you that whatever good works will be done in the world , in the world , in the world , in the world , in the world , in the world , in the world , in the world , in the world , in such a way pursuit will be done .
Every intern that successfully fulfils this internship will be given a certificate by clean India Mission .
Not only that , the internet will fulfil it very well , the UGC will also give them two credit points .
I request students , students , youths once again for internship , take advantage of this .
You can register for the Swachharat Sumer Internship by going to the MyGov app.
I hope our youth will move forward this movement of cleanliness .
I also want to know about your efforts .
You must send your guests , stories , photos , videos .
Come , let us make the opportunity to learn these holidays for a new experience .
I have seen in the past that such youths of Delhi were telling who are feeling unconscious for the education of poor children .
This campaign started with 15 children in huts near Geeta Colon of Delhi today has joined 12 thousand children at 12 places of the capital .
The youths , teachers associated with this campaign are involved in this different attempt of social change taking out two hours free time from their busy daily .
Brothers and sisters , in the same way some of the tribals of the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have become the source of inspiration for the sports of the country .
With their consolidated efforts not only changed their fate but also their area .
In Bageshwar of Uttarakhand primarily rice of Ragi , Rajgra , Makai or Java is found .
Because of being a mountainous area the peasants could not get its proper value .
But instead of wandering this rice straight in the market the cattle talukas adopted the path of price increase , they adopted the path of volue additiion .
What he did - started making biscuits from this favourite product and started selling biscuits .
These peasants have made a cooperative institution in Munnar village and have also started the factory of making biscuits there .
Seeing the motivation of the peasants the system has also associated it with the national lifetime machine .
This biscuit is now being sent not only to the approximately fifty anganwadi centers of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani .
With the hard work of the peasants the organization has reached the annual turnover from 10 to 15 lakh rupees but along with getting the opportunity of employment to more than 000 families the people coming out of the district have also started stopping .
My dear countrymen . when we hear that in future war is going to take water in the world .
Everyone speaks this thing but whether we have any responsibility or not .
Does not we think water conservation should be that social responsibility
Our ancestors have shown it alive for centuries .
He has given priority to the importance of one drop of water .
He has discovered such new methods how to save one drop of water .
Perhaps those among you who have got the opportunity to go to Tamilnadu there are some temples in Tamil Nadu where irrigation system , water conservation system , duration management , its large inscriptions have been written in the temple .
Manarkovil , Chiran Mahadevi , Kovilpatty or Pudukotty , everywhere big inscriptions will be seen .
If you go to Rajasthan then definitely go to Jodhpur .
It is one of the biggest and beautiful boats of India and the point of view is that it is in that area where there is lack of water .
April , May , June , July this time is such that there is an excellent opportunity to collect rain water and if we make preparations in Advanced then we get the benefit .
The budget of Manrega is also useful for this water conservation .
During the last three years in the direction of water conservation and water conservation everybody has tried in the form of self - sufficient .
Every year about 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation and water management separate from MNREGA budget .
Talking about 201-18 I have spent 55 percent of the total expenditure of 64 thousand crore rupees i . . about 35 thousand crore rupees on water conservation .
During the last three years about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted in large quantity through the medium of water conservation and water management methods .
The budget which is available by the Government of India for water conservation and water management , some people have taken a very good advantage of this .
In Kerala the people working for thousands of people working on that river Kuttumperur revived the river by doing hard work for 0 days .
There are rivers full of water of Ganga and Yamuna but there are also some areas in Uttar Pradesh , like two small rivers named Sasur Khadri of Fatehpur district have dried up .
The district transport system speeded up the work of soil and water conservation in large numbers under Manrega .
With the help of people of about 40-45 villages this true Khadri river which had dried up has revived it .
Whether it is animals , birds , cattle , agriculture , village , how big is this success .
I will say that once again April , May , June , July are in front of us , we also take some responsibility for water conservation , water conservation , we also make some plans , show us something as well .
When there is any problem then messenger comes from all four sides , paper comes , phone comes .
The Iyenkumar Benjee of Devitola village of North 24 Parganas of West Bengal has written in MyGov , we celebrate Ravindra Jayanthi every year but many people do not know the philosophy of living with Nabel priest Ravindranath Tagore ' s precise family , beautyfully and integrity .
In the ' Ki Baat ' program discuss this matter so that people can know about it .
I am giving thanks to Ayyanji that the attention of all the partners of the ' Ki Baat ' given it has attracted attention towards it .
Gurudev Tagore was full of knowledge and knowledge , whose writing has left his impossible mark on every people .
Rabindranath was a reflective personality , there was a lot of personality , but one of his inner teachers could feel every moment .
He wrote in Gitanjali, who did he know he was the rasponsible to impart it to those students.
I do not know the language of Bengali but when it was small , I had a habit of getting up very soon - from childhood and radio of eastern India starts soon .
If the delay starts in western India then my estimate is in the morning , by that time approximately 5 . 30 o'clock Rabindra music started , on radio and I had its habit .
I did not know the language , I had a habit of listening to Ravindra music on the radio waking up early in the morning and when Anandloke and Aguner , Poroshmoney - when the opportunity was to hear those poems , the mind got a sense .
Even today Ravindra Music must have influenced his poems .
I am honorfully impressing Ravindranath Thakur .
The month of Ramadan is celebrated with full faith and respect throughout the world .
The social aspect of daily is that when man is hungry then he also feels the hunger of others .
When he is thirsty himself then he feels the thirst of the other .
This is the opportunity to remember the teachings and messages of Paigambar Muhammad Sahib .
It becomes our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood from their life .
Once a person asked Paigambar Sahib , what work is the best in Islam
Paigambar Saheb said . Enjoying any poor and needy person and meeting with everyone honestly , even if you do not know him .
Paigambar Sahib used to believe in knowledge and cruelty .
They did not have any ego of anything .
They used to say that ego only defeats knowledge .
Paigambar Muhammad Saheb believed that if you are more than required anything then give it to any needy person , therefore donation is also very important in Ramzan .
People donate to the needy people in this sacred month .
Paigambar Muhammad Sahib believed that no person is purified from his soul , not from wealth and property .
We must be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha , who shows the strength of Karuna , service and sacrifice , who has guided lakhs of people worldwide .
This Buddha Purnima reminds of Lord Buddha , attempting to walk on his path , conception and reminds of the responsibility of all of us .
Lord Buddha is the inspiration of equality , peace , harmony and brotherhood .
This is such human valuation which is the most needed in today 's world .
Baba Saheb used to say by giving weight that in his social philosophy there remains a great inspiration of Lord Buddha .
Baba Saheb has been involved , suffering , administered , irregular , made hundreds of people buried in Hansia strong .
It can not be a big example of bitterness .
This cruelty for the pain of the people was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha .
It is said that Buddhist monks used to travel to various countries and they used to take the rich thoughts of Lord Buddha along with them and they have been happening in every period .
We have got the education of Lord Buddha in all Asia .
They are connecting us to many Asian countries like China , Japan , Korea , Thailand , Cambodia , Myanmar many countries where this tradition of Buddha is connected to the roots of teaching of Buddha and this is the reason that we are developing everything for Buddhist tourism , which connects important places of South - East Asia with special Buddhist places , India .
I am also very happy that the Indian government has participated in the resurrection works of many Buddhist temples , in which in Myanmar centuries old grand joy temples are also included .
Today everywhere in the world there is a strange and human pain . God shows the way to remove the education of Buddha , humility from Daya .
I believe in the principles of worshipping Lord Buddha spread all over the world - I wish all the good wishes of Buddha Purnima .
I ask from Lord Buddha for blessings for the whole world so that we can enable ourselves to build a peaceful and bitter world based on their teaching .
Today when we recall Lord Buddha , you must have heard about the statues of Lafing Buddha , about which it is said that Lafing Buddha brings good luck but very few people know that Smiling Buddha is also associated with an important incident of India 's defense history .
Do you think what is the relation between Smiling Buddha and India's military power
You will remember , from today on the evening of 21st May , 18th century the temporary chief of India Shri Atalbihari Vajpayee had told the nation and his words had filled the whole country with the moment of glory , magnificence and happiness .
That day was Buddha full moon .
On 11th May , 18th , on the western side of India , paramount tests were done in the pokharan of Rajasthan .
The test of India was successful and in one way India had displayed its strength in the field of science and technology .
We can say that day , in the history of India , it has been marked as an exhibition of its military power .
Lord Buddha has told the world , it is necessary for the strength of inner energy , the strength of consciousness , peace .
Similarly when you are strong in the form of a country then you can also stay peaceful with everyone .
The month of May , 18 is not only important for the country that parental test has been done in this month but in the same way it is important .
He showed the whole world that the land of India is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership India can gain defeating challenges and heights .
Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave the mantra, - Jay-jean Jay-kisan jay-wise.
We can also achieve a new joy , new joy of proceeding the journey which was started in view of sight .
My loved countrymen, I'll talk more when I meet again in Ki Baat.
It's very terrible.
Man Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the sacred festival of Ramnavami .
On this sacred festival of Ramnavami my very good wishes to the countrymen .
In the life of worshipper Bapu how much the power of the name ' Ram ' was that we have seen in their life every moment .
In the past, on 26th January when ASEAN (ASEAN) was here with all the great impressions of the nations, the Cultural Troop had come with them and it is a matter of great pride that most of these countries were presenting Ramayana to us.
That is , Ram and Ramayana , not only in India but in this land of the world ASEAN countries , are still creating such inspiration and effects .
Once again I give the best wishes of Ramnavami to you .
Like my loved countrymen , this time also I have received all your supplementary papers , e-mails , phone calls and comments in large numbers .
I read what Kamal Tuckerji wrote about starting the online course of Sanskrit on MyGov.
It seemed very good to see the love of yourself towards the cultural heritage of IT business .
I have asked the concerned department to bring information about the efforts being made on this part to you .
I will also resist those who work in the context of Sanskrit or think of what can be done in relation to the information of Kamalji .
Sriman Dhanshyamkumarji, village Barakar, district Nalanda, Bihar. You read the comments written on NarendramodiApp.
The anxiety that you have expressed on the decreasing water level in the ground is very important .
Shriman Shastriji, Karnataka.
You have also resisted everyone to keep water for animals in summers .
Shakalji , I have brought your emotions to all the enemies .
Shriman Yogesh Bhadreshji , he says that I talk to the youth about their health this time .
They feel that if compared to Asian countries our youth is physically weak .
Yogeshji , I have thought that this time talking with everyone in detail about health - talking about Fit India .
And you can also run all the newborns together with Fit India's move.
In the past , on the journey of the main Kashi of France . Shriman Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the scenes of this journey , touching minds , creating effects .
And he had resisted that they should be propagated on all the videos of social media.
Prashantji , the Indian government had put that on the same day on social media and Narendramodiap .
Now you make them lick and retweet , bring your friends .
From Chennai, Andha, Jaisesh and many children have sent me only by writing the ideas they came in their hearts about the Gratitude cards they have given behind the Exam Warrior book.
Blind , jealousy , I want to tell you all the children that my daily fatigue gets lost with these letters .
All such papers , all such phone calls , comments , as much as I could read from them , whatever could be heard and many of these things have touched my mind - even if I talk about them then for months I have to go continuously telling something .
This time most of the papers are children who have written about examination .
He has told his plan about holidays .
In summers the animals have worried about water for birds .
On the activities of Kisan fairs and farming which are going on all over the country , letters of affordable brother-in-law have come .
Some active citizens have sent information regarding water conservation .
During festivals talk about our festivals , our culture , our traditions .
That is , things of our mind also change with weather and maybe it is also true that things of our mind change the weather of somebody 's life somewhere .
And why not
In these things , in your experiences , in these examples , so much inspiration , so much energy , so much spirituality , there is a desire to do something for the country .
They are capable of changing the weather of the entire country .
When I get to read in your letters how Ahmad Ali , a resident of Karimganj of Assam , has made new schools for the poor children on the basis of his will power , then this country has a unique desire to see .
In this mission Saedu had spent household households , collected money through donation .
Many tourists traveling in their cab gave donations with fervor .
A engineer girl gave her first step
Thus gathering money , after 12 years , the color which Saidul Laskar tried to bring that color and due to his hard work today , due to his own imagination , near Kolkata in Puri village about 30 bed capacity hospitals are ready to be built .
This is the power of New India.
Today the point of view towards India has changed all over the world .
Today in the entire country in the youth , women , in the wives , in the poor , in the middle class , every class has awakened that yes
We can move forward , our country can move forward .
There is a positive environment of self-confidence filled with hope and hope .
This self-esteem, this negativity will fulfill our simplicity of New India, prove to be dreaming.
My loved countrymen , for some months to come , are very important for the giant brothers and sisters .
Due to this reason many letters have come in relation to agriculture .
This time I have also seen the discussion that happens with the peasants on the DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan and I feel that every peasant should contact this DD Kisan channel of disappearance , it should be seen and that experiment should be used in his field .
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastriji , Lohiaji , Chaudhri Charan Singhji , Chaudhri Devilaji , everyone considered the economy of the country and the economy of the country and an important part of normal life .
Similarly , Lal Bahadur Shastriji used to put a lot of burden on the necessity of plants , trees and vegetation and external Krishna Dhancha .
Ram Manohar Lohia had spoken of folk dance on a large scale for our crew , to ensure and to increase food and milk products .
In his speech in 1 , Chaudhari Charan Singhji resisted the use of new technology to the peasants , to make new innovations , put a burden on their needs .
I had gone to the Krishna Upanti fair organised in Delhi in the past .
There knowing , understanding , understanding many experiences associated with my conversation with the rich brothers and scientists , knowledge about the innovation related to agriculture - all this was a pleasant experience for me but what I had influenced most was the work of Meghalaya and the workers there .
This state with less area has shown a lot of work .
Our merchants of Meghalaya have produced irregular products in comparison to the last five years during the year 2015-16 .
He has shown that when the goal is determined , determined and if there is complication in the mind then it can be proved by doing it .
Today the hard work of the peasants is getting the support of technology , due to which the farmer is getting a lot of energy .
In the letters that have come to me I was watching that many of the peasants had written about the feelings of the tax and they wanted me to talk to them with the area .
Brothers and sisters , this year in budget , a big decision has been made to give the right price of the money to the peasants .
It has been decided that the feelings of taxation for unsuccessful gains , their expenses will be declared at least one and a half times .
The local markets of the villages are joining Wolesle Market and then Global Market - its efforts are being made.
The peasants do not have to go far away to sell their produce - for this, the country's 22 thousand rural huts will be connected with the APMC and e-NAM platform by upgrading the necessary infrastructure.
That is , along with fields any direct connectivity of any market of the country - such arrangements are being made .
My loved countrymen , this year Mahatma Gandhiji ' s 150th year festival will start .
How will the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is our imagination , apart from this how can the residents of hundreds of thousands of countries take care of Gandhiji
For this how can new activities be present
You all have my resistance, you divide that person with all your thoughts through My Gov.
How is the Lago of Gandhi 150
You should inquire about the slogan or mantra or what is the word of anger .
We all have to give a memorable tribute to the father together and after remembering the Bapu we have to bring our country to new heights by taking inspiration from among them .
Dhananism . Dhanyawad , you have said right and I believe that both clean India and healthy India are sufficient for each other .
Today in the field of health the country has gone ahead of traditional progress .
Every work related to health in the country was the responsibility of the Ministry of Health only , just as now all the departments and ministries , whether it is the Ministry of Cleanliness , whether the Ministry of Chemicals and fertilizers , whether the Ministry of Home Affairs or the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments together are working for healthy India , and with the Preventive Health the burden is being put upon the Fordable Health .
Preventive Health Care is also the cheapest and the most easy.
And as much as we'll be aware of people, Private Health Care, the same person, family and society will also benefit.
For life being healthy first is important . cleanliness .
We have all developed bed in the form of a country and the result of this came that in the last 4 years Sanitation Coverage has become almost 80 percent twice .
Besides this work is being done extensively in the direction of making health welfare centers across the country .
This is the result of the resistance of all of us that yoga has become a social movement today , has reached home and home .
This time international yoga day - 21 June - for less than 100 days have been left .
On the last three international yoga days people participated with great enthusiasm everywhere in the country and the world .
This time also we have to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family , friends , all of us for yoga .
Yoga has to be popular in children , youths , elderly - all age groups , men or women , every one .
Although the country 's TV and electronic media do different programs regarding yoga during the year , but can you create awareness towards yoga as an expedition from today to yoga day
My dear countrymen, I'm not a yoga teacher.
Yes , I need yoga professional , but some people have made me a yoga teacher through their creativity and have made Thridi animated video doing my yoga .
I will divide that video with all of you so that along with us we can practice asana , pranayama .
If the health care is within the reach and the nutritious is also there , the population is cheap and easy for the normal - for this also efforts are being made at a wider level .
For heart patients the rate of heart statistics has been reduced to 85 percent .
In the present 4 medical colleges of the country the number of MBBS seats has been increased to about 68 thousand .
New AIMS -LRB- AIIMS -RRB- is being included in various states for people from all over the country to get better medical and health facilities .
A new medical college will be opened between every three districts.
To get rid of B . . we will all see to make a social effort .
Years ago.
Babasaheb Ambedkar had talked about Indian industrialization .
For them the industry was such an effective medium in which the maximum poor person can be provided employment .
Today when the campaign of Make in India is going on successfully in the country then Dr .
The same vision of Ambedkar Ji had seen the dream of India in the form of industrial Mahasatta is inspiration for us today .
Today India is blooming in the form of a glacier point in the global economy and today the most foreign direct mood attack - FDI is coming in India .
The entire world is watching India as a center for immune , innovation and development .
The same idea that the development of industries would be possible in the cities because of which Dr . .
Babasaheb Ambedkar trusted the urbanization of India on Urbanisation .
They do not want that any person always lives his life in poverty .
He also believed that by distributing only something in the poor his poverty can not be removed .
Today mudra plan , start up India , Stand up Indian Initiatives are giving birth to our youth innovators , youth industry adventurous .
In the decade of 130 and 140 when there was talk of only roads and railways in India then Babasaheb Ambadkar had talked about the ports and waterways .
That's Dr.
Babasaheb was the only one who saw the water power in the form of national power .
For the development of the country the emphasis was on the use of water . various activities related to water , various activities related to water - all this was the observation of Babasaheb Ambedkar .
Today historical efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country .
New ports are being built on various sea shores of India and intestines are being strengthened on old ports .
In the period of the 40th century most of the discussions were held on the second world war , the cold war and division , at that time Dr . .
Ambedakar had put the sports of team India in a way .
He spoke on the importance of Federalism , combined management and put emphasis on working together with the central and state for the production of the country .
Today we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism , co-operative federalism and cooperative federalism in every aspect of the government , and the most important thing is that Dr .
Babasaheb Ambadkar is a motivation for hundreds of people associated with the past class .
He has told us that for proceeding forward it is not necessary that any elder or any member is born in the family , but people born in the poor families of India can also see their dreams , they can try to fulfil their dreams and also get success .
Yes , it has also been made that many people have doctor .
He tried to push them back and the daughters of poor and backward families could not move forward , could not become anything , did every possible attempt to achieve anything in life .
But New India's tendency is completely different.
One such India which is of Ambedkar , is of the poor , is of the readers .
Under this there will be various programs on rural development , poor welfare and social welfare in the entire India .
My father is against himself that he will take a fervor part in this campaign .
My dear countrymen , these days many festivals are coming . Lord Mahavir Jayanti , Hanuman Jayanti , Ester , Vaisakhi .
The day of the sacrifice of Lord Mahavir is the day of recalling his sacrifice and penance .
The life view of the messenger of Ahimsa Lord Mahavir Ji will inspire us all .
The good wishes of Mahavir Jayantti to all the countrymen .
When the discussion of Egypt comes out then the inspirational message of Lord Jesus Christ reminds of those who have always given the message of peace , harmony , justice , patience and compassion to humanity .
In April Punjab and Western India the festival of Vaisakhi will be celebrated , then these days in Bihar Judasital and Satwin , Bihu in Assam and the horse and glacier of Poila Vaishakh in West Bengal will be covered .
All these festivals are connected to our farming and food items in some form . Through these festivals we celebrate nature for the priceless gifts found in the form of produce .
Once again there is a lot of good wishes for all the festivals coming to you .
Monsieur February 2018
My loved countrymen , Namaskara today starts Ki Baat from a phone cell .
Many questions about science have been asked by my young friends , they keep writing something about it .
We have seen that the color of the sea looks blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no color of water .
Have we ever thought that river or sea , why water becomes colorful
This question was felt in the mind of a young man in the decade of 120 .
This question has given birth to a great scientist of modern India .
The name of Raman comes before us .
They were attempted to do the best work on light scattering i . . light radiation .
One of their research is famous with the name of ' Rumon Effect ' .
We celebrate the ' National Science Day ' on 28 February every year because it is said that on this day the loss of light skating has been discovered for which they were given noble-purskara .
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science .
On one side great scholars have been the tradition of Bodhyan , Bhaskar , Brahmaputra and Aryabhatta while on the other hand in the field of medicine we have the glory of truth and charak .
Scientists like Sar Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana have the honor of India .
On the name of Satyendranath Bose the famous particle ' Boson ' has also been named .
Recently I got an opportunity to stay present in a program of Mumbai - for the inauguration of the Institution for Artificial Intelligence .
It was very interesting to know about the miracles that are happening in the field of science .
This technique can be used to maintain the lives of poor , woollen or poor .
In this program of artificial intelligence I had warned the scientific community that to make the life of Divyaang brothers and sisters easy , how can it get help from artificial intelligence .
Can artificial intelleges be helpful in making health services easy and treating diseases modernly .
A few days back with the chief minister of the Ischer I got the opportunity to go to the inauguration of ' Ai Criet ' in Gujarat , Ahmedabad .
There a young man has developed such a digital institute that if someone is not able to speak then he along with writing his word through the medium of the institute and he can communicate in the same way as a person who can speak .
I understand that we can use artificial intelleges in many ways .
Science and technology are valuable .
From the point of view of value it is not good or bad on its own .
Any machine will do the same thing as we want .
But it depends on us what we ask to take from the machine .
Human objectivity becomes important here .
Use of science for human welfare , use for gaining the highest heights of human life .
Thomas Alva administering light bulb has failed many times in its use .
Unfortunately , today I am in Aurobindo 's Karmabhoomi ' Aurobil ' .
As a revolutionary he had defeated the British rule , fought against them , raised questions on their rule .
This way he has asked questions about every aspect of life as a great sage .
We found out the soldiers and waited for human species .
To know the truth again and again the imagination of asking questions is important .
The true inspiration behind scientific research is also this .
On the occasion of national science day I read all the people associated with our scientists , science .
Our youth becomes inspired to investigate poverty , truth and knowledge , becomes inspired to serve society with the help of science , for this there are many good wishes .
At the time of colleagues , at the time of attachment , today many times I get all the messages about these things , people keep writing something or the other .
From Pune Shriman Ravindra Singh has spoken about the occupational safety in his comment on the Narendra Modi Mobile app .
He has written that the standards of safety on factories and condition sites in our country are not so good .
This village is the national holiday day of India on 4th March , then the Prime Minister will talk about peace in his ' Ki Baat ' program so that awareness increases by taking peace among the people .
When we talk about genitals then two things are very important - one proactiveness and other preparedness .
Salmati is of two kinds - one who is always important at present , Safety during disposer and other that which needs daily life , safety in allergy life .
If we are not aware by taking salutation in daily life , we can not achieve it then it becomes difficult to achieve it during these days .
We read all the times the board written on the roads . It says - awareness humiliation , loss of accident , loss of forgetting , do not leave the world soon after snatching , do not do any fun , fun , fun , fun , fun , fun , fun , fun , fun , fun , fun , fun , fun , fun , fun .
If we stay alert , follow the necessary rules then we can protect our lives , but even with great immemorials we can get rid of the society .
Sometimes we have seen that many sources are written by taking salutation at work place but when they see it then it does not seem to be following somewhere .
I am sure that the municipalities , municipalities or those near who have a fire brigade should go to different schools once in a week or once in a month and send them to school children .
There will be two benefits from this - Fire brigade will also have the habit of being alert and the new generation also gets its training and there is no different expenditure for this - one way the same class of teaching remains and I always keep in mind this thing .
Today National Disaster Management Authority i . . NDM has been doing leadership in the country 's administration .
Full , in cases of danger of cyclone the name of ' Apada Mitra ' has also been done for the training of self-sacrifice .
Teaching and awareness have a very big role .
Two - three years before this thousands of people lose their lives every year from Lu - Heatwave .
After that for the prevention of NDM heat wave workshop was organised , campaigned to bring awareness among the people .
There was a good result from everyone 's participation .
The number of deaths occurring from Lu in 2001 has come down astonishingly to about 220.
It can be known from this that if we give priority to safety then we can get protection .
There are innumerable people working in the society , social organizations , awareness citizens . I want to examine everybody who is at home , takes relief and rescue work within minutes .
And the number of such anonymous heroes is nothing less.
-LRB- BIMSTEC -RRB- - Bangladesh , India , Myanmar , Sri Lanka , Thailand , Bhutan and Nepal have also been done a joint disastrous management exercise of these countries , this was one of its first and big human experiments .
We have to make a risk condition society .
In our culture we always talk about the safety of values , safety of veluses , but we also have to understand the values of velley of safety , peace .
We have to make it a part of our life .
This meant that there was an arrangement to give information .
Because we are not aware of nature and for this we listen after sitting in our ears , airways but what information is for me , it does not seem like any of us .
The same experience is in every area of our life .
We should not think that safety is for any other , if we become aware of our peace then the feeling of peace of society is also included in it .
The purpose of this Gobardhan plan is to clean the villages and convert the dense garbage of animals and fields into compossant andbiogas and create money and energy from it .
Some European countries and China , animal hunters and other organic poisons use it for the production of energy but its full potential is not being used in India .
Under the entire India Mission rural ' we are now moving forward in this direction .
The goal of making use of all these biogas based energy has been determined to make cookers , kitchens coming out of the grass , kitchens coming out of the kitchen .
Under the ' Gobar Dhan Yojana ' the giants , arms , brothers will be encouraged in rural India that they see Gobar and garbage not just as Waste but as a source of income .
The rural areas will get many benefits from ' Gobar Dhan Yojana ' .
To keep the villages clean , animal health will be better and productivity will increase .
Cooking food from biogas and self-reliance will increase in the mall of energy for light .
The casualties and animals will get help in increasing the need .
Waste Collection, Transpourtation, sale of biogas, etc. will get the chance of new nookers.
An Online trading platform will also be built for the smooth management of the Gobar Dhan Yojana, which will connect the buyers so that the peasants can get the proper value of Gobar and Agriculture Waste.
I guide our arms living in rural India especially that you come forward by making helpful groups make this opportunity a full advantage .
I invite you to become participants of this movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs.
My dear countrymen, so far we have heard about music festivals, food festivals, film festivals.
But a unique attempt was made in Raipur of Chhattisgarh in which the first ' Kuchara Mahotsav ' was organised in the state .
The purpose behind this festival organised by Raipur Municipal Corporation was that of awareness about cleanliness . Creating the creative of the city and creating awareness about various ways of reuse of the garbage .
During this festival there were many kinds of activities in which from students to elderly people , all were included .
Different kinds of artworks have been made using garbage .
Workshops were organised to teach people on all aspects of the West management.
There was a music performance on the theme of hygiene.
Inspired by Raipur various kinds of garbage festivals have also been held in other districts .
Everyone told innovative ideas , discussing , reading poems beforehand on behalf of their parents .
In the context of cleanliness the weather like a festival has been prepared .
Especially the way school children participated enthusiastically , it was marvellous .
I am very enjoying the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation , the whole of Chhattisgarh and its government and administration for the innovatively exhibited importance of West management and cleanliness in this festival .
Every year on 8th March the International Women 's Day is celebrated .
There are many programs in the country and the world .
On this day such women are also suppressed from the ' Shakti Purskar ' which has been done in different areas in the past .
On this occasion I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda .
Today it is the duty of our partner to ensure equal partnership of women in every area of social , economic life , that is the responsibility of all of us .
We are the victims of that tradition where men were identified by women . Yashodhandan , Kaushalyanandan , Gandhariputra , this was the identity of a son .
Today our female power has introduced self-confidence and self-confidence with its work .
He has also advanced himself , along with this he has also worked to move the country and the society forward and take it to a new chatti .
That is why the dream of our New India is the same where the woman is strong , strong , is equal partner in the entire development of the country .
In the past I had a very beautiful information done by some mahoshaya .
He had suggested that on 8th March there are several programs to celebrate the ' monthly day ' . Can the program of honor of mothers and daughters be organised in every village and sister who have completed 100 years
And you can talk about a long life in it  I feel better , I am bringing it to you .
Under Swachh Bharat campaign approximately 15 lac women - and this figure is not small , 15 lac women have started a month 's cleaning campaign .
Starting from 26 January , 218 these women have established a new example by making 1 lakh 0 thousand toilets in just 20 days under this campaign .
Can you imagine how big this is happening
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power , clean India is such a power of campaign , which will be effectively converting the culture of cleanliness into the common man ' s nature .
Brothers and sisters , just two days back I was watching in News that electricity has reached in three villages of Eliphanta Island after 0 years of independence and due to this how much harm and enthusiasm among the people there is .
You all know well that Elephanta island is ten kilometres away from Mumbai .
I am surprised to know that despite being near Mumbai and being such a big center of tourism , electricity has not reached Elephant for all these years of independence .
For 0 years the three villages of Eliphanta Island Rajbandar , Morbandar and Sethbandar , the darkness that was covered in the life of the people there , is now dark and their life has become light .
I enjoy the administration and people there .
I am happy that now the caves of Elephantana village and Elephanta will be lighted with electricity .
This is not just electricity but also a new beginning of the corner of development .
The life of the countrymen is illuminated , happiness comes in their life , what else can be the moment of satisfaction and happiness more than that .
My dear brothers and sisters , we have recently celebrated the festival of Shivaratri .
Now the splendor of the golden pomegranate of the fields enjoying the fruits of the month of March , and the splendor of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of this month is the speciality of this month .
But for the festival of Holi this month also we all are extremely dear .
On 2 March the whole country will celebrate the festival of Holi with Harshollas .
The importance of the colors in the holi is the same importance as Holika Dahan because this day is the day of destroying the evils by mixing them in fire .
Holi is a good opportunity to forget all heartache together , to become partner in happiness and joy of each other and gives message of love unity and brotherhood .
Approximately the best wishes of the colorful festival of Holi , colorful good wishes to the co-operatives .
This festival is full of colorful happiness in the life of our countrymen .
Manki Baat January 2018
This is the first ' Ki Baat ' of 2018 and two days back we celebrated the festival of Ganesha with great enthusiasm and for the first time in history it was formed that the natives of 10 countries were present in this festival .
My dear countrymen, Shriman Prakash Tripathy has written a long letter on NarendramodiApp and has warned me very much that I touched the subjects written in his letter .
He has written that on 1 February the imagination going in the interior is the death anniversary of Chawla .
In Columbia Interior Yan accident they left us but inspired millions of youths from all over the world .
I am aware of Bhai Prakashji that he has started his long press with the intention of imagining Chawla .
For everyone it is a matter of sadness that we have lost imagination at such a young age but he has given this message to thousands of young women of India especially in the whole world that there is no limit for women 's power .
If there is desire and strong conception , if there is a strong desire to do something then nothing is impossible .
It is very happy to see that in India women are moving fast in every area and are increasing the pride of the country .
Since ancient times the honor of women in our country , place in their society and their contribution , has been impossible to the whole world .
There has been a long tradition of Indian demonstrators .
The contribution of many discriminators of India has been done in the form of vedas .
Lopalamudra , Gargi , Maitreyi , many names are there .
Today we talk about ' Betty Bachao Bati Padhas ' but centuries ago it has been said in our scriptures , Skandapuran : Dasapupuptra Samakanya , Dasapuptraan Progressional . This fruit is luxurious , luxurious .
The more you get from ten dollars the same qualities you get from a daughter .
This shows the importance of women in our society .
And then only in our society the status of male has been given the status of strength .
This female power binds the entire country , the entire society , the family in the list of unity .
Sriman Prakash Tripathy has given many examples ahead .
He has written that our adventurous conservation chief , builder , sitar , is inspired by flying in Ladakh airplane 30 .
He has also mentioned that in the leadership of Vartika Joshi the women of Indian Navy crew members are practicing the whole world on INSV swimming .
Three armoured women are made of emotional knot , mohana lion and even fourth fitter pilot and are taking training in Sukhoi-30 .
Under the leadership of Shakti Vajpayi Ol Vemen Crue flying from Delhi to San Francisco and Parat Delhi in Air India Boating Jette - and all the ladies back .
In the past, the recognised Presidentji made a new start.
Presidentji met a group of those extraordinary women who first showed something in the field of their own .
This Vegetables of the country , first woman Merchant Navy Captain , first woman train driver of passenger train , first woman file fighter , first woman bus driver , first woman reaching Antarctica , first woman reaching Everest , thus the first woman to reach Everest .
Our women 's powers have fascinated unusual achievements by breaking the traditionalism of the society , establishing a record .
He told that a new way can be prepared by crossing all the widows and instructions on the strength of hard work , hard work and strong imagination .
A way that will inspire not only its contemporary people but also many generations coming .
It will fill them with a new enthusiasm and enthusiasm .
This book has also been prepared on Viewer , First Ladies so that the whole country can know about these women 's powers , inspiration from their lives and their works .
He is also obtained as e-book on the Narendramodi website.
Today in positive changes happening in the country and society there is an important role of women 's power .
Today when we are discussing women 's energy then I want to mention a railway station .
A railway station and women education , would you think what is the relation between these two
Matunga station of Mumbai is the first station of India where all women are employees .
In all the departments there are vimmen staff-che-commercial departments , railway police , ticket checker , productive , point person , the staff of more than 40 workers is of women .
This time many people wrote on Twitter and other social media after watching the day parade that one important thing of parade was BSF biker continent in which all women were participating .
We were using full of adventure and this scene was also astonishing the guests coming from abroad .
Efficiency is the only form of self-reliance .
Today our maternal power is doing leadership .
When the matter comes to tribal women then a certain spectacle comes up in everyone 's mind , in which there is a jungle , footprints , on which the arms of the sticks are lifted up on the head and walking women .
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh , our women ' s strength has made a new splendor in front of the country .
The Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh which is the Maoist-affected area , Hindu Attachment , Bombay , Binduk , Pistol - Maoists have created a horrible environment of it .
In such dangerous areas tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running E-Rikshaw .
In a very little while many women have joined her .
And three benefits are being made from this , on one side where self-employed people have worked to make them powerful , on the other hand the pattern of the mouth affected area is changing .
And along with all this the work of environment conservation is also getting strength from it .
Continuous efforts have been made on personal and social level in our country for centuries against social misconceptions and misconceptions .
Just a few days back Bihar made a interesting initiative .
In order to expel social evils from the root of the state the world 's longest human range of more than 13 thousand kilometres was built Humon Chein .
Through this campaign people were made aware of evils like burning and daily rituals .
The entire state had enjoyed fighting with evils like daily and child marriage .
Filled with children , elderly enthusiasm and enthusiasm , mothers , sisters , everyone had included themselves in this jungle .
Starting from the historical Gandhi Maidan of Patna the human ranges moved to the borders of the state unbrokenly .
All the people of the society get the benefit of development in the right sense therefore it is important that our society is free from these commitments .
Come , let us all together take the oath of finishing these commitments from the society and create a new India , a powerful and capable India .
I am admiring the people of Bihar , the chief president of the state , every person involved in the administration and human ranges who made such a special and extensive initiative towards social welfare .
My favorite patriots , Mysore , Sriman Darshan of Karnataka have written on My Gov - on the treatment of their father the cost of medicines was 6 thousand rupees in a month .
They did n't know about the first prime minister Jan Akshay Kshetra .
But now when they got information about the genital medicine center and they bought medicines from there then their cost of medicines decreased to 5 percent .
He has expressed his desire that I talk about it in the ' Ki Baat ' program so that he reaches its information to the maximum number of people and he can take advantage of it .
Since last few days many people used to keep telling me about this .
I have also seen on the video , social media of many people who have taken advantage of this plan .
And when I get this kind of information then it feels very happy .
One gets deep satisfaction.
And I liked this too much that in the mind of Shriman Darshanji this thought came to me that what he got to him was also found to others .
The objective behind this plan is to make health care off-dable and encourage Ease of Living.
The medicines available at the genital medicine centres are about 50 to 0  of the branded medicines available in the market .
With this genitals generally , especially the elderly citizens who take medicines daily get a lot of financial help , there is a lot of saving .
Generic medicines sold in them are according to the secretion of the World Health Organisation .
This is the reason that medicines of good quality are available in cheap sense .
Today more than three thousand reproductive medicine centres have been established in the country .
By this not only medicines are available cheap but also new opportunities of employment are being produced for Individual Intrapreneurs .
The cheap medicines are available at the primary Indian genital medicine centres and the unmarried stores of the hospitals .
The only purpose behind all these is to make the country's poorest person ualiti and affordable health service so that a healthy and prosperous India can be formed.
My dear countrymen , Mr . Mangesh from Maharashtra have fielded a photo on Narendra Modi Mobile app .
That photo was such that my attention was drawn towards the photo .
That photo was such in which a grandson was participating in the cleaning campaign of ' Clin Morana river ' along with his grandfather .
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised cleanliness campaign to clean the Morana river under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan .
The river of Morana used to flow in the first twelve months but now it has become seasonal .
Another painful thing is that the river was completely filled with wild streams , water strips .
On the banks of the river and its shore some garbage was being put .
An excavation plan was prepared and one day from Makar Sankranti on 13 January , under the first phase of Mission Clin Morana , at fourteen kilometres in the area of fourteen places on both sides of the bank of the Morana river .
In this direct function of Mission Clin Moore more than six thousand citizens of Akola , more than 100 ANGs , college students , children , elders , mothers and sisters , everybody participated in this .
This cleaning program was continued in the same way on 20 January , 22018 and I was told that till the river of Morana becomes completely clean this campaign will run every Saturday morning .
It shows that if a person decides to do something then there is nothing impossible .
Big changes can be brought through genitals .
I am giving the people of Akola , the administration of the district and municipal corporation , changing their efforts to every citizen engaged in making this work public - education and this effort will also inspire other people of the country .
My dear countrymen , these days many discussions will be heard about the Padma Purskaras .
In the newspapers also this matter also attracts attention to this part on TV .
But if you look smoothly then you will be proud of it .
Every year there has been a tradition of giving Padma Purskar but in the last three years its entire process has changed .
Now any citizen can nominate anyone .
On the completion of the entire process transparentness has come .
In one way the choice process of these priests has become completely transformed .
Now there is no identity of the person to give publication but the importance of his work is increasing .
It would have been heard that Shriman Aravind Gupta would be happy to know about himself , Aravindji , a student of IIT Kanpur , has dedicated his entire life to make kids .
They are making ramparts from the garbage for four decades so that the gesture towards science can increase in children .
Their efforts are that children become inspired towards scientific experiments from useless things for which they are going to three thousand schools across the country and inspiring children by showing films made in 18 languages .
How wonderful life , how unique dedication .
One such thing is of Sitawa Joddhi of Karnataka .
They did not even say the goddess of women 's power .
In the last three decades he has given great contribution in changing the life of innumerable women .
He had dedicated himself to goddess only at the age of seven years but then he spent his entire life for the welfare of goddesses .
Not only this , he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of married women .
The name given must have been heard about the Bhajjhu Shyam of Madhya Pradesh . Shriman Bhajjhu Shyam was born in a very poor family , tribal family .
They used to do common jobs for lifestyle but they were very happy to make traditional tribal pictures .
Today because of this very hobby they are respected not only in India but also in the whole world .
In many countries like Netherlands , Germany , England , Italy their pictures have been displayed .
The statue of Bhajjhu Shyamji , who illuminated the name of India in foreign countries , was recognized and he was honored with Padmashree .
You will be surprised to hear the word of tribal women Laxmikutti of Kerala .
Lakshmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of card leaves in the tribal area amidst dense forests .
He has made five hundred herbal medicines based on his memory .
He has got Maharath in making medicines used after snake cutting .
Lakshmiji herbal medicines are constantly serving the society with their knowledge .
Recognizing this anonymous person , he was honored with Padmashree for his contribution in the society .
Subhasini Egypt is such a woman who spent utensils in other houses to make the hospital .
When he was 23 years old his wife died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired her to make her a hospital for the poor .
Today thousands of poor people are being treated freely in the hospital made of their hard work .
I have complete faith that there are many such men and women in our multitude , many are women and bloods who do not know or know anybody .
The society also suffers from not identifying such individuals . Padma Purskar is a medium but I will also tell the people of the country that there will be dedication to the living , living for society around us , there are lakhs of people working with some speciality . Sometimes they should bring them in the middle of the society .
They do not work for honor but because of their work we get inspiration .
Sometimes in schools , colleges , such people should listen to their experiences by calling them .
Besides Purskar , some efforts should also be made in the society .
My loved countrymen , every year on 9th January we celebrate migratory Indian day .
This is the 9th January when the legendary Mahatma Gandhi had travelled from South Africa to India .
On that day we celebrate the festival of breaking down between Indians living in India and around the world .
This year on the migratory Indian day we had organised a program in which each of the Indian roots living in the world had invited them and mayors .
You will be happy to know that in this program from Malaysia , New ealand , Switzerland , Portugal , Moreless , Fiji , Tanzania , Kenya , Canada , Britain , Surinam , South Africa and America and some other countries where our original Indian mirror is there , everybody participated .
I am happy that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are doing the services of those countries along with that they have also made their strong connections with India . This time European Union has sent me a calendar in which they have shown their contribution to different countries by Indians living in different countries of Europe very well .
Our original Indian people who live in different countries of Europe , are working in some cyber security , then someone is dedicated to Ayurveda , someone embraces the mind of the society with their music then someone from their poems .
I would like to give thanks to this referendum of the European Union, to the people of Indian origin to recognise the people around the world through them.
On 30 January is the worshipper of Pujaya Bapu , who has shown us all a new way .
Even at present we want every step how true the words of Bapu were .
If we imagine that walk on the way to Bapu , as much as you can walk - then what can be the greatest faith than this
My loved countrymen , along with giving the wishes of 2018 to everyone , I am giving a break to my wife .
Man Ki Baat December 2001
This is the last program of this year ' Ki Baat ' and see the convention that this year is also the last day of 201 .
We and you shared a lot of things this year.
For ' Ki Baat ' many of your letters , coments , this exchange of thoughts , always brings me a new energy .
The year will change after some hours but this order of our things will continue even further .
In the coming year we will talk more new things , we shall shake new experiences .
All of you wish for many good wishes of the year 20018 .
Recently on 25th December the festival of Natal was celebrated with great fanfare throughout the world .
In India also people celebrated this festival with great enthusiasm .
On this occasion of Christmas we all recall the great teaching of Jesus Christ and the thing that Isaac had put on the most emphasis on was - Sevabhava .
My loved countrymen , this year Guru Govind Singhji 's 350th light was also the year of festival .
The adventure and extraordinary life of Guru Govind Singh Ji is inspiration for all of us .
Guru Govind Singhji gave the preaching of great life qualities and on the basis of this life race he also lived his life .
A guru , poet , philosophical , great warrior such a Guru Govind Singh Ji has worked to inspire people in all these roles .
He fought against injustice and injustice .
We advised people to break the bonds of caste and religion .
In these attempts he had to lose a lot personally .
But he never gave place to the feeling of grief .
In every moment of life the message of love , sacrifice and peace - he had the personality filled with so great specialities .
Come , let us take all the complications and take inspiration from the great teachings and their inspirational life of Guru Govind Singhji and try to descend life accordingly .
Those who are born in the year 2000 or after that they will become eligible tenants from January 20018 .
Indian democracy welcomes the new Indian voters of the 21st century .
I enjoy these youngsters and inspire everyone that you should register as your parents .
The whole of India is eager to welcome you as a tenant of the 21st century .
You will also feel glorious as a merit of the 21st century .
Your opinion will be based on New India.
The power of opinion is the biggest power in the democratic system .
The most effective means of bringing positive changes in the life of millions of people .
You can also become the builder of 21st century India and its beginning is happening specially from one January .
And today I want to talk to our young men full of energy and imagination from 18 to 25 years in this minute.
I am convinced that the dream of our new India will be fulfilled with the capability of these powerful youths and their strength .
When we talk about new India then the new India which is free from the poison of communalism , communalism , terrorism , corruption .
Free from dirt and poverty .
New India ' - where there is equal opportunity for everyone , where the hopes and expectations of everyone are fulfilled .
New India where there is our inspirational force of peace , unity and harmony .
My new India Youth will come forward and finish how to create new India.
They also decide a way for themselves , with which they are connected to them also and this convoy continues moving forward .
You also go ahead, the country also goes ahead.
Now when I am talking to you , then I have a thought that can we organise a mock parlor in every district of India
Where these 18-25-year-old youth sit together and mantle on New India, search the way, formulate plans.
How can we prove our complications to be 2022 before
How can we build a India whose dream was seen by our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi had made the movement of freedom a mass movement .
My young friends , the demand of time is that we also stand a mass movement for the magnificent - divine India of the 21st century .
How can it be achieved from imagination
Today many new opportunities have been served for youth .
From Skill Development to Innovation and Interpretationship our youths are coming forward and are getting successful .
I would like to know about all these opportunities in this new India youth in one place and in this part some arrangement should be made so that as soon as the age of 18 years , they can get information about all these things easily and they can also get the necessary benefits .
I talked to you about the importance of prosperity in my loved countrymen, past Ki Baat.
I remember a sloka of Sanskrit , it means that a person filled with enthusiasm is extremely strong because nothing can be ahead of enthusiasm .
Nothing is impossible for the person with positiveness and enthusiasm .
Even in English, people say - Pessimism leaders to backnes, optimism to power.
I had appealed to the countrymen in ' Ki Baat ' that tell your positive moments of the year 2001 and welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment .
I am very happy that a large number of people gave a very positive effect on social media platform , MyGov and Narendramodi app , told their experiences .
There were lakhs of tweets with the positive India Heshtage which reached more than one and a half crore people .
In one way the communication of positiveness that happened in India spread all over the world .
The tweets and reflections that came were really inspiring .
It was a pleasant experience.
Some countrymen have divided those events of this year , which had a special impact on their mind , had a positive effect .
Some people also mentioned their personal achievements .
My name is Minu Bhatia .
I am living in Mayur Vihar , Pocket Forest , Fase Forest , Delhi .
My daughter, Mm.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade .
I talk to the bodle .
Our visa was in which the premium of one rupee was paid every month .
He had done my husband and he got a bondage in a sudden .
At that time we know what happened to us .
With this help of the government we got a lot of benefit and with this I could sit down a little .
My name is Santosh Jadhav .
From our village , from Bhintar village the National Highway has passed since 2001 .
Because of this our roads became very good and trade would also increase .
My name is Deepashu Ahuja , region Sadatganj , district Saharanpur , resident of Uttar Pradesh .
My name is Satis Baina .
There was a problem of water in our area . For the last 40 years we had to depend on the arminy pipeline .
Now this pipline has become different - free .
So all these big achievements are in our 201.
There are many such people who are doing such work at the level of their parents because of which positive changes are coming in the life of many people .
In fact, this is the New India which we are building together.
Come on, let us enter the new year with this little happiness, start the new year and take a firm look towards the progressive India from the positive India.
When we talk about positiveness then I also want to make one thing improved .
Recently I got to know the inspirational point of Topper Anjum Bashir Khan Khatk of administrative services in Kashmir .
He has achieved the first sequence in the examination of Kashmir Administrative Service after coming out of the scene of terrorism and hatred .
You will be surprised to know that in 10 the terrorists had burnt their ancestral houses .
There terrorism and violence were so much that their family had to leave their ancestral land and come out .
For a small child the environment of all such violence around him was sufficient to create blindness and bitterness in the heart , but Ajum did not let it happen .
He never left hope.
He chose a different way for himself - the path of service of the people .
He descended from the opposite situation and wrote his own story of success .
Today they have become inspiration not only for the youth of Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country .
Ajum has proved that how bad the situation is , the clouds of depression can also be dispersed through positive works .
Just last weekend I got a chance to meet some girls of Jammu and Kashmir .
The glory among them was that enthusiasm which was dreams, and when I was listening to them, they ask for progress in what area of life.
The time I spent with those girls , I also got inspiration and this is the strength of the country , this is my youth , this is the future of my country .
My loved countrymen , not only of our country , whenever there is talk of famous religious places of the world then it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala .
In this world famous temple , devotees come here in numbers of crores every year to take the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami .
Where such a large number of devotees come , where there is such a great importance in the place , how big is it necessary to maintain cleanliness
And especially that place which is situated between the mountains and the forests .
But how can this problem be changed in culture , how can the way to come out of the problem also be discovered , and how much strength is there in public participation , the Sabarimala temple itself is an example .
P.
A police officer named Vijayan started a program ' Puneam Punkvanam ' and under that program started a voluntary campaign of awareness for cleanliness .
And made such a tradition that whatever travellers come their journey is not completed till they do not do any physical work in the program of cleanliness .
In this campaign there are neither big nor small .
Every traveller , after understanding one part of the worship of God gives some time for cleansing , works , works for the removal of dirt .
Everyday in the morning the view of cleanliness is very amazing and all the pilgrimages take place in it .
Why not many big CLEBRITY , how rich person is , how big office is , every person becomes part of this purnayam recurrence program like a normal traveller , goes ahead only after cleaning it .
We have many such examples for the countrymen .
In Sabarimala so much advanced cleaning campaign and Puranam Purnavaanam in it becomes a source of the journey of every traveller .
There the hard complication of cleanliness along with hard work also goes along .
My loved countrymen , on October 2 , 20014 on the birth anniversary of worshipper Babapu we all have concluded that the incomplete work of worshipped Bapu i . . clean India , free India from dirt .
The ancestors kept joking for this work throughout the life , also tried .
And we all decided that when there is a 150th birth anniversary of Bapu then we should do something in the direction of giving them their dreams India , clean India .
In the direction of cleanliness efforts are being made widely throughout the country .
In rural and urban areas changes are also seen from massive population participation .
To check the achievements of the quality of cleanliness in urban areas the world 's biggest survey - 2018 ' will be done between 4 January to 10 March 018 .
This survey will be done in more than four thousand cities in about 40 crore population .
In this survey, the facts that will be curtailed, free from open defecation, collection of garbage, transportation arrangements, scientifically attempts to carry out garbage processing, capacity building and purification attempts made innovative efforts and participants for this work.
During this survey going separately will inspire the cities .
They will take their reaction by talking to the citizens .
The use of cleaning app and the improvement of various kinds of services - places will be done online .
It will also be seen in them whether such arrangements have been made by the cities so that the cleanliness of the city becomes the nature of the people , the nature of the city .
Cleanliness should not be such by the government only .
Every urban and urban organizations also have a very big responsibility .
And it is important for every citizen of mine that they participate in the cleanliness that is going to be done in the coming days .
And your city does not remain behind , do not remain behind your cheeks and throats .
I have full faith that the use of green and blue cheese by dissolving dry raisins and wet raisins from home , now it has become a habit of yourself .
From 4th January to 10th March, 22018, in the hygiene survey during this period, don't stay anywhere behind in this healthy complex of cleanliness - it must be a subject of a public discussion in every city.
And your dream should be of Sahu, our city- our effort, our progress- the progress of the country.
Come with this imagination , let us cross the Purushartha once again after remembering the worshipped Bapu , concepting clean India .
My loved countrymen , some things are such that it looks very small to see , but in the form of a society it is going to have a far-flung effect on our identity .
Today through the medium of this program of mind , I ask you to share such a thing with you .
One thing came in our information that if a Muslim woman asks for a ride then she can not go without ' mahram ' or ' male guardian ' .
When I heard about it for the first time then I thought how could this happen .
Who made such rules
Why are these differentiations
And when I went deep into it then I got upset - even after 0 years of independence those who used to put such restaurants were ourselves .
For decades Muslim women were getting injustice but there was no discussion of this .
Even in many Islamic countries this rule is not there .
But in India Muslim women did not get this award .
And I am happy that our government gave attention to it .
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs also took those necessary steps and we destroyed this restriction by blocking this 0-year-old tradition.
Today Muslim women can go to Hajj without pride and I am happy that this time around 130 Muslim women have done aaply to go without pride and from different parts of the country - from Kerala to North women have expressed their desire to travel fast .
I am saying with complete faith and that strong belief is that the development journey of India , on the strength of our women ' s power , their responsibilities have progressed and will continue moving ahead .
We should always try that our women also get equal quantity of men , get equal opportunity so that they can move forward together on the path of progress .
My loved countrymen, 26 January is a historic festival for us.
This time there will be no one but ten main guests on the countenance day .
This has never happened before in the history of India .
201 has been special for both Asian countries and India .
Asin completed his 50 years in that 2001 and in 2001 only 25 years of participation of India has been completed with Asin .
On 26 January it is a matter of pride for our Indians to be present together with these great leaders of 10 countries of the world .
Dear countrymen , these festivals are sysons , although our country is a country of festivals in a way .
Perhaps it would be such a day in whose name no festival has been written .
Now we all have accepted Christmas and there is a new year coming forward .
The coming new year brings a lot of happiness , happiness , prosperity to everyone .
We all go ahead with new zeal , new enthusiasm , new imagination and new imagination , move the country also .
In the month of January the sun is the time of being Northern and in the same month Makar Sankranti is considered .
In Punjab and north India Lohri is enjoyed , then in UP-Bihar there is a preservation of khichdi and sesame culture .
Proclaim Sankrant in Rajasthan , Magha - Bihu in Assam or Pongal in Tamil Nadu , this festival is special in itself and they have their own importance .
This festival is celebrated during 13 to 1 January .
The names of these festivals are different but its basic elements are the same - connecting with nature and agriculture .
Every countrymen want a lot of happiness of these festivals .
Once again enjoy your new year 2018 very much .
A lot of treacherous countrymen.
Now I'll talk again in 2018.
Dhananism.
That conversation was the same who talks with a very bitch, little brother, with his big sister.
Listen how in this phase of age Lata is also excited for all things related to the country and the satisfaction of life is also in the progress of India , changing India is touching new heights .
Modi ji, Lata kidi, Pramanam.
I am calling Narendra Modi .
LATA DIDI: Pranam.
Modiji : I did the phone because this time on your birthday . .
When will you go to the layer
Modiji : I will return late at 28th and at 2th in the morning and then it would have been your birthday .
Lataji : In the adult there are many , many people but getting the blessings of those who are bigger than their work is a big thing .
Modiji . Daughter , you are very big in age and you are also big in work and give it which has achieved this proven , that is achieved by doing meditation and penance .
Lataji : Yes , I think that my parents are blessed and the blessings of the enemies are there .
I'm nothing.
Modiji : Yes , today is your humor , that is for all of our new generations , that is very big education .
There is a lot of inspiration for us that even after cleaning all this in life given , he has always given priority to the culture of his parents and humility .
- Yeah.
Modiji . And I am happy that when you say pride that your mother was Gujarati .
Modiji . And whenever I came to my father . G . Modiji gave me something or the other Gujarati .
I know that due to your coming the picture of India is changing and that , I am very happy with it .
No . I do not want to give you much trouble because I look , I know how busy you are and how much work you do .
What has to be considered .
When we went and came in contact with your mother ' s feet , we saw that I had also sent somebody to them and took their blessings .
Yes, yes.
My father was very happy, because of his love.
Modiji . But the time was so busy that I could not come .
MODY: But I'll come soon.
That would be my luck.
Modhiji: Pranam Dhidi.
Well, it's very nice.
MODY: Pranam ji.
With my loved countrymen , with Navaratri , from today the atmosphere of festivals will once again be filled with new emergence , new energy , new enthusiasm , new imagination .
The pleasure of festivals is to me .
For many weeks this village will be the charm of festivals throughout the country .
The house will be filled with happiness .
Perhaps this saying is not just words, for all of us, there is an idea, a vision, an inspiration.
In some houses sweets get spoilt , while in some houses children smile for sweets .
This is the darkness in the bottom of Diu .
The real joy of these festivals is when this darkness decreases and light spreads .
We also divide happiness there where there is lack and that also becomes our nature .
If there is delivery in our houses of sweets , clothes , gifts , then think to give one minute to another .
At least those things in our houses which we do not take in any work , divide such things into others .
In many cities , such work is done by the start up of the youth partners of many ANGs .
They collect clothes , sweets , foods , everything from the houses of people and find out the needy and reach them and do this activity .
Can this time , with complete awareness and imagination in this festivals , be able to remove the darkness under this dilapidated fashion
You will double your happiness on sweet , festivals based on the face of many poor families , your face will get shiny .
Your lamp will become more illuminated and your heart will become more light .
My dear brothers and sisters , in Deepavali , in the form of good luck and prosperity Laxmiji comes home .
In traditional way Lakshmiji is welcomed .
Can this time we keep programs of honor of workers in our society , villages , cities , ladies
Can you keep public programs
There will be many such ladies among us who would have been roaming the name of the family , society , country with their hard work and imagination .
Can we program the honor of this Laxmi of India on this Diwali
Several girls around us, many wheels would be the one who would have been doing extraordinary work.
Some poor kids must have been working to learn , if they must have been engaged in spreading awareness about some cleanliness and health , then they would have been doing the service of society by becoming a doctor , an engineer .
Being a lawyer, it must have been trying to justify someone.
Our society recognizes , respects and takes pride on them .
The programs of their honor will be held all over the country .
The encouragement of Laxmi of India means to process the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen .
My dear countrymen , I had earlier also said that one big advantage of ' Mon Ki Baat ' is that I get the privilege of making direct discussions with many well known people .
I am from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when the result of my examination came then some people asked me that he read the exam warriors book .
I didn't read this book.
But on returning I read this book and read it two - three times .
My experience was very good about it .
I felt that if I had read this book before testing , then I would have had a lot of benefit .
My little student friend, you're grateful to write this letter first.
Exam Warriors thanks to read 2-3 times.
What you have said that if I can take time for new release then in this I will definitely try to write something for parents , teachers .
I guess to all the students of the country , teachers , parents that you tell me your experience regarding the aspects related to stress free tests .
So I'll wait for your thoughts.
Our little friends of Arunachal , student Alina Tayang once again expresses glory .
My dear countrymen , you also know about the busy programs of the Prime Minister of the country through TV through the medium of newspapers , also discuss busyness .
But you know that I also consider it as a common man like you .
I am a common citizen and therefore the same effect that affects in a normal life is also on my mind because I am also coming from among you .
Just a while before this default he had come to the final from Rafael Nadal as the story of Grand Slam winner and Tanis .
The visitors present there welcomed their words warmly .
Even after losing in difficult situations he gave the privilege of Kheldli alive by enjoying his rival drain a lot .
Although on the other side winners also praised Daniel 's game very much .
The zeal of losers and the humility of the winners in the same match were both worth seeing .
If you haven't heard the statement of Daniel Medev, then I'll tell you all, especially the youth that you must see this video of him.
The thinking of our ancestors is really pleasant .
We have been told in the sciences there . i . . when a person gets absorbed with properity and humility then whose heart can not go .
Actually this youth player has taken the heart of the people around the world .
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, I'm doing what I'm going to do now for your good.
Worshipping will continue , bird watching will continue , but if some things are stopped before increasing then there is a lot of benefit .
The things which increase very much , it becomes very difficult to stop them later .
But if we stay awake in the beginning itself then a lot of things can be saved .
My mind says that with this feeling , today especially young friends must talk something .
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes too difficult to leave its addiction .
The danger of diseases like cancer , diabetes , blood pressure increases very much for people who eat tobacco .
Everybody says this .
The intoxication of tobacco is because of nicoton present in it .
By its consumption in young age the growth of brain also gets affected .
But today, I want to talk to you on a new subject.
You will know that recently there has been a ban on e - cigarettes in India .
Other than normal cigarette e - cigarette is a kind of electronic equipment .
In e - cigarette a kind of chemical smoke is formed by heating nicotine rich substances through which nicotein is consumed .
We understand the danger of ordinary cigarettes very well but a wrong idea has been created about e - cigarette .
Such frustration has been spread that there is no danger from e - cigarette .
Like the rest of the cigarette the odour does not spread from it so that aromatic chemical substances are found in it .
We have seen around us that even if there is a chicken smoker in the house then he stops smoking the rest of the people of the house and wants that his children do not have the habit of cigarette - B . .
They have such an attempt that no member of the family should smoke , do not smoke .
They know that from smoking , tobacco causes heavy harm to the body .
Drinks also know and seers also know .
But the price of e-cigarette is very different .
There is no such awareness among people about e-cigarettes .
They are also completely unaware of its danger and because of this sometimes e - cigarettes enter the house quietly and sometimes they are showing magic and even children keep showing each other .
Look, I'm making a smoke out of my mouth. Look, don't fire, don't scream, see, I'm making a smoke.
Once the youth and the youth of the house get stuck in their clutches then gradually they become victims of this intoxication .
In reality many harmful chemicals are found in e - cigarettes , which have adverse effect on health .
You know that when someone smokes around us then we know this from the smell .
Even if there is a packet of cigarette in its clutches then it is known by the smell .
But there is no such thing with e-cigarettes . In such a situation many young and young people know - unknown and sometimes in the form of fashion statement along with many prides , in their own offices , sometimes they are seen moving in their hands and sometimes they become victims of it .
The youth is the future of the country .
Compensation has been done on e-cigarette so that this new method of intoxication does not make our young country free .
Do not let the dreams of every family , the life of children does not become bad .
This disease does not accumulate roots in this habit society .
I urge you to leave the intoxication of tobacco and do not keep any misery in relation to e-cigarette .
Come let us all together create a healthy India .
It is also necessary to escape from all these for fit India .
My dear brothers and sisters , for us all this is a matter of good fortune that our Indian year has been the birthplace and birthplace of such unusual people who have dedicated their entire life for their own sake but for the good of others .
This is our mother - in - law , this is our country very rich .
Many human deaths come out of this earth .
India has been the birthplace of such unusual people .
And these are those people who have dedicated themselves not for themselves but for others .
Similarly , a great miracle is being honored in Vetican City on 13 October .
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pop Francis will be destroying the cream therapy on 13 October coming .
Sister Murium Throsis has done the work done for the betterment of humanity in his young age of 50 years , that is an example for the whole world .
Sister Treasia finished whatever work he did with respect and dedication .
Which is still moving forward their lifestyle and mission .
I once again dedicate to Sister Murium Thressia and especially to our Christian brothers and sisters of India I give a lot of enjoyment to this achievement .
My loved countrymen , not only India , but today for the whole world it is a matter of pride that when we are celebrating Gandhi 150 today , along with this 130 crore countrymen have enjoined to free from the Single Use plastic .
In the direction of environment conservation , seeing the kind of leadership India has done in the whole world today the eyes of all the countries are focused on India .
I am sufficiently convinced that all of you will become the victims of the campaign to get rid of the single youth plastic on October 2 .
People are giving their contribution in this campaign as their own .
But one young man of our own country has run a very unique campaign .
When I noticed this work then I tried to know about this new experiment by talking to them on the phone .
This thing can be done to other people of the country as well .
Shriman Ripudan Balviji is making a good attempt .
When I heard the word plogging for the first time, it was new for me too.
Perhaps that word has been used in some quantity in foreign countries .
But in India , Ripudan Belvis has published it a lot .
I am giving them a lot of enjoyment and the playing ministry is also going to organise Fit India Pogging Run on the occasion of Pujaya Bapuji Jayantti .
How to do this program , what happens in the program , we have heard from the experience of Repudamanji .
I am convinced that if 130 crore countrymen will take a step in this direction then in order to get rid of the single youth plastic our India will move 130 crore steps ahead .
Repudaman ji, once again, is very terrible.
Let us move forward to convert our life into national interest .
One thing is desired to remember quickly .
Although I will definitely do it from the area in Agami ki Baat but today I am telling you so that you get an opportunity to prepare .
You remember that on 31 October Sirdar Vallabhbhai Patel is the prisoner .
We have to run for the unity of the country on that day in thousands of villages of India , children , elders , all people , school , colleges .
My dear countrymen , you will remember that on 15th August I told the Red Fort that till 2022 you go to 15 places of India .
If at least 15 places and that also becomes then make a program to stay for one night , two nights .
You see India , understand , feel .
How many varieties do we have , and when the days of holidays come in this Diwali festival , people definitely go and therefore I will again inspire you to go to any 15 such places of India .
And how much this improvement is, where am I to you
You must have enjoyed this day our order is 34 and five years ago our order was 65th so in one way we have made a lot of big jumps .
If we try more then till 5 years of independence we will make our place in the main places of the world in tourism .
Yes , it is also important to see that in the days of Diwali there is no harm to any person anywhere due to blisters , etc .
Whatever caution should be taken for this you must keep it .
Happiness should also be there , happiness should also be there , enthusiasm should also be there and our festival also brings the aroma of socialism , also brings the culture of socialism .
Communal life gives only a new potential , this is the festival of the means of new potential .
Come , together with joy , with enthusiasm , with new dreams , we also celebrate festivals .
Once again, very good jobs.
My mind is in November 2001.
My great countrymen, Namazam.
Some time back I got the opportunity to speak untouchables with the children of Karnataka .
The victory of Times group , Karnataka , first initiated Baldi to the children , write a letter to the chief minister of the country .
And then he printed some of these selected papers .
I read those letters, I felt very good.
These small children also know how much about the problems of the country , the discussions going on in the country .
On many subjects these children have written , Northern Kannada Kirti Hegde has suggested by describing the digital India and Smart City plan that we need to bring about change in our educational system . They have also said that today children do not want to read in classroom .
And if we wish to give children about nature then perhaps we can come to work by going forward in the protection of environment .
Rida Nandafe has written from Lakshmaneshwar that she is the daughter of a soldier 's son .
And he has said that because of school being removed I can not spend time with my friends also . He has suggested that there should be any school nearby .
It was a good experience for me too.
My great countrymen, today is 26 November.
It's our shutdown day on 26th November.
On this day itself in 14th century the Bandharan Sabha had accepted the bandage of India .
The detention of India is the soul of our democracy .
Today is the day of reminding those members of the Closing House .
He worked for about three years to stop India .
And whatever he reads the discussion we are proud of what is the idea of life dedicated to the nation .
Can you imagine how hard they have done to finish the bandh of our country with diversity
It would have been done to see understanding and misfortune and that too when the country was getting free from the synonyms of glasses .
Keeping in mind this shutdown , it is the duty of all of us to create a new India keeping in mind the thoughts of the great men .
Our detention is very wide .
Perhaps there is no such area of life , there is no such thing of nature which he has not touched .
The sensitivity towards equality and sensitivity towards everyone is the identity of our detention .
He protects the basic officers of all citizens , poor or poor , survivors or worrisome , tribal , women .
And keeps their demons safe.
We guarantee that we suppress the bondage unforeseen.
Be urban or administrator move forward according to the feeling of deterioration .
In this closed house seventy different committees were formed on important subjects .
Among the most important committees there was a meeting and Dr . .
Babasaheb Ambadkar was the head of this Muslim community .
They were playing a very important role.
Today in the construction of which we feel the glory of India , there is a unique print of the skilled leadership of Babasaheb Ambedkar .
He had decided that every class of the society would be described .
On the sixth December on the day of their inauguration we worship them by remembering them like Kayam .
The contribution of Babasaheb to make the country rich and powerful is unforgettable .
On 15th December Sardar Vallabhbhai is with the title of Patal .
From the cattle utensils the iron man made of the country had done extraordinary work of binding the country with a furnace .
Sardar Sahib was also a member of the Bandaran Sabha .
He was also the chief of the consultant committee prepared for basic officers , young women and tribals .
26-11 is our bondage day but on 26-11 years ago the terrorists attacked Mumbai on 26-11 days ago how can the country forget it
This country can never forget their sacrifices .
Today if terrorism is seen in every part of the world and in one way then it has become an extremely exaggerated form of incident happening everyday .
We have been suffering a lot from terrorism since last 40 years in India .
Then there were many people of the world who could not be prepared to take it seriously but today where terrorist attacks are making their own bars , then every government of the world believes in humanism , the governments who are trusted in democracy , are watching terrorism as a big leader .
Handicappedness has challenged the humanity of the world .
Terrorism has challenged humanism .
They are going to destroy human powers .
And this is why not only India but also all humanitarian powers of the world have to defeat terrorism together .
Lord Buddha , Lord Mahavir , Guru Nanak , Mahatma Gandhi , the same is the chariot of this earth which has given the message of ahimsa and love to the world .
Terrorism and excitement make us a nefarious attempt to separate them by weakening our social tension .
And therefore being more aware of humanitarian powers is the demand of this time .
My great countrymen , on the fourth December we will celebrate all the Navy Day - boating day .
Indian boating keeps our passengers safe and peaceful .
I am enjoying all connected with boating .
Everyone knows now that our civilization is penetrating on the banks of the rivers .
Whether it is soft , whether it is Ganga , Yamuna or Saraswati , our rivers and sea are important for both economic and environmental purposes .
This is our entrance for the entire world .
This country has a unique relationship with the oceans of our land .
And when we look towards history then at the time of Chaulnavi - Chaulanaukadala eight hundred and nine hundred years ago Chaulanokadala was considered to be one of the most powerful boats .
In the extension of the Chaul empire , it was a very big source of their boating in making it the economy of that time .
The humble , search journeys of Chaul Nevi are found even today in the magnificent confluence literature .
Very few people would know that in most of the world women had got loyalty at warships for a long time .
But in Chaulanokadala and that too eight hundred - nine hundred years ago women had played an important role in a large number and that is that even women used to fight .
To tie ships with the Chaul rulers , there was a very rich knowledge of the construction of ships .
Then if we talk about boating , then who can forget their capabilities of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and boating .
The shores of Konkan where the tribes are very important , they used to come under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj .
Several forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj , such as Sindhu Durg , Murud Ganjeera , Golden Durg etc . were either at the edge of Syria or were surrounded by Syria .
The responsibility of the protection of these forts was to lift the Maratha boats .
There was a combination of big ships and small boats in Maratha boats .
They were extremely efficient to attack their boating and escape from them .
And when we discuss Maratha boating then do not remember Kanoji English how it is possible .
He brought Maratha boating to a new hat and at many places he had established a plan to go to Maratha boating .
After independence our Indian boating also showed its cycle at different times .
Then it is the freedom movement of Goa , whether it is the 11th India - Pakistan war .
This year in May - June when the flood had come in Sri Lanka even then three ships of our boats immediately reached there and provided help to its government and its population .
In the month of September in Bangladesh also our boating ship INS horses had provided humanitarian support to Rohingya .
In the month of June when the government of Pappua - New ealand had sent us the message of Takid and had planned to save the fishermen from their fisherman boats then we had helped our boat .
Our boating ship had also reached to help INS Trikund in the western Akshay Kshetra to leave a trade ship from Chanchis .
To reach Fiji island , to provide immediate relief , our boating has always been doing a proud job to bring human help in comparison to the neighboring country .
We always have respect and respect towards Indians , our conservations , then that landmass , boating or airplane , salute the courage of our gods , gallantry , mercury and sacrifice every countrymen .
Residents of hundreds of crores of countries can live the life of Sukhchen therefore they sacrifice their own country to go .
Every year we celebrate the seventh December as the flag of the armed army .
This is the day of committing pride towards the armed forces of the country and expressing respect .
I am happy that this time the Ministry of Conservation has decided to run the campaign from 1st to 7th December . reach the citizens of the country and make people aware about the armed forces and make people aware .
Apply all these flags on chest all the whole week .
A movement of respect towards the army starts in the country .
On this occasion we can also distribute the flag of armed forces .
The experiences of those who are associated with the architects who are in their identity in their surroundings can possess their violent footsteps with video and photo farmforceflagday associated with them .
In schools , colleges , by calling the people of sugar , you can get information about the army from them .
Our new body can become a good opportunity to get in mind about the army .
This procedure also gives the opportunity of collecting bundles for the welfare of all the soldiers of our armed forces .
The families of the soldiers martyred in this brave war are spent on their rehabilitation for the welfare of injured soldiers by the Army Welfare Board .
Come on this occasion we also do something that increases the mood of our armed forces .
We also give our contribution to their welfare .
My great countrymen , on the fifth December is the world soil day .
I want to talk to our fellow brothers and sisters also .
There is an important part of the earth - soil .
Whatever we eat is connected to this soil .
In one way the whole grain is connected to the soil .
It feels scared even after thinking , whether there is land or not , if there is no leave , then what could be the life of man .
Whatever might be possible , in our culture a lot of time it was concerned about it and we have been aware of the importance of our land since ancient times that is probably the reason behind it .
On one side in our culture there is such a simple effort to stay in people towards fields , soil , devotion and respect towards people , while on the other hand such scientific methods of nutrition of this land are living in our life .
In the life of the peasants of this country both matters have been important , in which along with the devotion towards their land and the protection of the land is being done scientifically .
I had heard about the accomplices of Tohu village of Bhoranj Taluka of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh .
The merchants there used to use half the chemical fertilizers first and due to this their health of the land has worsened .
The yields were decreasing and as a result the growth of the earth was also slowly decreasing .
Some of the villagers understood the seriousness of this situation and after that they tested their land from time to time . They considered the way they were asked to use fertilizer , fertilizer , nutritious substances and living fertilizers .
You will also be surprised to hear the results , what was the result of the guidance which the farmer received by the health of the land and the guidance he received
In the season of Rabi . 216-1 these peasants the production of wheat has increased three to four times .
Our casualties have made more than ten crore sweet healthcare in the country so that they can understand their land more properly and also save them unfairly .
We worship the mother of the earth but how much harm do we do to her health by chemical fertilizers like urea  How many times do you think
It has been proved by every kind of scientific experiment that by giving more urea to the mother of the earth serious damage occurs .
This is the demand of today 's time to make the relationship of mother and daughter aware again .
Our peasants , our geographers , can we imagine the sympathy of our earth that when they use the urea as much as they use today , however it will take 5 years of independence in 2022 then shall we make this use half
How changes start coming in the life of the peasant
We all have started feeling the globe warming and adventurous change .
There was a time when the cold was starting before Diwali.
Today the December binoculars are cracking and the cold is increasing gradually .
But as cold begins , we all feel that it does not feel good to get out of the holiday .
But in such a weather also people who stay constantly aware can bring such beautiful results and these examples are inspiring for all of us .
In spreading the message of cleanliness that little child Tushar has done inspirational work .
He tells that there is no age of cleanliness , whether there is any border .
Small child or old person , woman or man , cleansing is important for everyone .
And for cleansing it is also necessary to check the eye .
Our Divyang is the collection of brother-in-law .
We get to learn something in the afternoon .
Today they're doing well everywhere.
Whether there is a field of sports , there is any competition , there is a social first , our divine generosity is not behind anybody .
Now everyone will remember that our Divyaang players had won four moons by showing beautiful performance in Riya Olympics and also made champions in the Blind Tea Twenty Cricket World Cup .
There are many kinds of competitions throughout the country .
A few days back in Udaipur the 13th National Parasviming competition was organised .
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters coming from different parts of the country participated in it and gave introduction to their poetry .
Even in the 0 . national para swimming competition they won golden stars .
They were chosen for the competition of 0-20 paralysis by India 's sports sub-division .
They are one of 32 , Para - Tirthankaras , who will be trained in the Central For Excellence in Gandhinagar of Gujarat .
I salute the zeal of my brother , jewelry and read them my good wishes .
Today special attention is being given on the ease and technique of use for Divya Gangaj .
Every person in the country is our attempt to become strong .
The creation of a combined society increases equality in society with the feelings of our mother and move ahead together with everyone .
I read heartily good wishes to all the countrymen and I hope that this festival gives us all new inspiration to increase peace and harmony in the society .
Forget sadness and do not forget happiness .
I feel that we should propagate this thing .
We try to recall many interesting events of the past year in the medium of spread there once again .
Can you give your contribution in this
Can we divide five positive experiences of our life this year
Remember such incidents of inspiration to others .
If I remind you of good things, you'll wake up your mind to do well.
Good things, give energy to do good.
And I'll try to reach the people of the country in what the world's minds are on the Pacific India Heshteg Positique India.
My great countrymen, the next month I'll come again in the midst of what the heavenly mind is.
We'll have a lot of talk.
On Ol India Radio October 2, 2001
The Maha festival celebrated six days after Diwali is one of the festivals celebrated with maximum rules and principles in our country .
In which conventional rules are followed from diet to childhood .
The unique festival of Chhath Puja is completely connected with nature and the worship of nature .
Sun and water , Mahaparva are in the center of worship of Chhath , then utensils and utensils made of bamboo and soil , there are various things connected with its reproductive system .
The message of the worship of the sun rising in this festival of faith and the rising sun is sufficient with unique culture .
The important expression of cleanliness in our life is also included in this festival .
Before sixth along with cleaning the entire house , along with river , pond , pond , shore , worship place i . . cleaning of valleys , all people connect together with full sight .
There are also festivals of sunrise or sixth worship , environmental protection , disease relief and superstition .
Normally people understand the immense feelings of taking something by asking , but in the sixth puja there is a special tradition of eating after asking prasad in the morning .
Behind this tradition of seeking prasad it has also been demonstrated that ego is destroyed by it .
It is very natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India .
My loved countrymen , the love of mind , the joy also happens , the joy also happens .
But whenever I look at the effect of the mind , then my belief becomes strong that with the people of this country the mind has ended with a hundred percent distinct relationship .
Take examples of khadi and handloom only .
On Gandhi Jayanti I always keep going for handloom , for food and what is the result of this
On the same store of khadi and handloom so much sale , on hearing that you must have also enjoyed , satisfactory .
During Diwali about 680 percent increase has been recorded in the sale of khadi gift coupons .
In the total sale of khadi and handicraft items this year about 0 percent increase has been seen .
This shows that today young , elderly , women select people of every age eating and handicappedness .
I can imagine how much benefit would have been done to many adult families , poor families working on handloom .
In the life of a poor man , handcuff is standing as a powerful means of making him strong by bringing a change in the life of a poor person .
This is playing a very big role for rural areas .
Mr . Rajan Bhatt has written on Narendra Modi app that he wants to know about the experience of my brother along with the security forces and he also asks how our security forces are considered demonstrated .
Shriman Tejs Gaikwade has also written on Narendra Modi app , why can there be arrangements for our house to reach sweet security places
We also remind of our virgin security forces .
We also feel that our house should reach the sweet country .
Everybody would have celebrated Diwali with great fanfare .
Deepavali also brought me a special experience this time .
I once again got the privilege to celebrate with our populated security forces on the border .
This time it was unforgettable for me to celebrate with the security forces in the Guerrez sector of Jammu and Kashmir .
For the struggle , dedication and describing the hard and difficult situations facing the border , for our protectorate country , I respect every visit of our security forces from every countrymen .
Where we get the opportunity , as soon as we get the opportunity , we should know the experience of our going , we should listen to their pride .
Many of us do not know that going to our security forces are playing an important role not only in our border but also in establishing peace in the world .
Being a youth calm , they are glittering the name of India in the world .
In the past, on October 24, the United Nations Day, United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everybody remembers its positive role in the efforts of UAN to establish peace in the world .
And we are believers of the Vasudhaiv family that is , the whole world is our family .
And due to this belief India has been seen active partnership in the various important initiatives of the youth since the beginning .
As soon as you know that both the words of the proposal for the detention of India and the proposal of the UAN Charter begin with the words of the POPLE .
India has always emphasized on male equality and Humaan Rights of Union Development is its living quantity .
Its first focus was, 'All men are born free and equal' which was changed with the efforts of India's defendant Hansa Mehta and later switched down, al-Human beings are born free and equal.'
Although this seems to be a very small change but it is visible in a healthy thought .
There will be many people from your mother who are getting this information for the first time .
More than 18 thousand Indian security forces have provided their services in the UN PEACEKEEPING Operatives.
At present, India's nearly seven thousand soldiers are connected to the UN PEACEKEEPING INSITIVES and it is the third most invented worldwide.
By August 2001, the Indians have given their services to the UAN's worldwide 1 PEACEKEEKEEPING OPERATIONS around 50 OPERATIONS.
This OPERATIONS runs in many countries in Korea , Cambodia , Laos , Vietnam , Kongo , Cyprus , Liberia , Labenon , Sudan , world territory .
More than 200 thousand patients have been treated and innumerable people have been rescued in the hospital of Indian Army in Kong and South Sudan .
The security forces of India have not only protected the people there in different countries but have also taken their hearts by making People Friendly Operations .
Indian women have played an important role in the work of establishing peace .
Very few people must have known that India was the first country to send Female Police Unit to the peacekeeping Mission of the United Nations in Liberia.
And see , this foot of India has become an inspiration for the nations worldwide .
And then all the countries started sending their parents the Women Police Unit.
It will be overwhelming to hear that India ' s role is not only limited to Peacekeeping Operations but India also works to teach Peacekeepers of about 85 countries .
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha our great calm demonstrators have conveyed message of peace and prosperity throughout the world .
Peacekeeping Operations are not easy.
To go to our security forces one has to work on going to the inaccessible areas .
Many people have to stay in the middle .
Different situations and different cultures have to be known .
They have to slope themselves according to the local needs , environment there .
They were the only UN Peacekeeper.
Lieutenant General Premchandji is one of the Indian Peacekeeper who has developed special identity in science.
At the age of 18 he was made a Force Commander for Operation in Namibia and he provided his services to ensure the freedom of that country .
General Thimaiya, who has also been the chief of the Indian Army, has led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and has renounced himself for peaceful work.
India has always been giving message of peace , unity and prosperity in the world in the form of peace .
We believe that everybody lives with peace , harmony and moves forward towards the construction of a better and peaceful period .
My dear countrymen have been decorated with such great people who have served humanity with the humility .
Sister Nivedita , whom we also call patience , was also one of those extraordinary people .
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland but Swami Vivekanand gave him the name of Niwadita .
And privacy means that which is fully dedicated.
Later on he proved himself as per his name .
Kale Sister Nivadeta had 150 m of Jayanthi .
He was so impressed with Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his happy life and dedicated his life to the service of the poor .
Sister Niwadeta was very sad about the excitement in the British state .
The British not only made our country a slave but also tried to make us slave mentally .
By showing our culture down , creating infinite feelings among us , this work continued continuously .
Bhagini Niwaditaji reconstructed the glory of Indian culture .
Making people aware of national consciousness worked as one thing .
He went to different countries of the world and voiced against the adverse effects of the sanitary religion and philosophy .
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramaniam Bharti is famous for its revolutionary poem ' Pudumai Penn ' , New Women and Women ' .
It is said that its motivation was only against the goddess .
Bhagini Niwaditaji also gave support to great scientist Jagdishchandra Basu .
He helped in publication and propagation of buses through his writings and compositions .
This is the special beauty of India that spirituality and science in our culture is sufficient for each other .
Geography and scientific Jagadishchandra Basu are its strong examples .
In 18th Calcutta there was a horrific plague and hundreds of people died in Jotzota .
The director of Bhagini started the work of cleaning the nick and roads without worrying about his health .
They were such women who could live a comfortable life but they were dedicated to the service of the poor .
After getting inspiration from their sacrifice people joined them in the service work .
He taught people the importance of cleanliness and services through his work .
And it is written on his samadhi - 'Here reposes Sister Nivedita who has been all to India' - are resting here for the sake of the goddess who has offered her all India.
Undoubtedly he did this .
Today for this great personality they can not have any better faith than this that every Indian people try to walk on that service path by inspiring from their lives .
First of all , on the birthday of our first elder chief Jawaharlal Nehruji Childrons Day , on the child day all the children are very happy .
Children are the most important heroes of the creation of new India .
Your anxiety is true that the diseases which used to occur in the old age earlier , the last stage of life used to come near that nowadays it has started appearing in children as well .
Today it is very surprised when we hear that children are also suffering from diabetes .
Such diseases occurred in young people luckyly .
But our lifestyle has changed .
Today these diseases are known by the name of lifestyle disorder .
The main reason of occurrence of this kind of disease in youth is the deficiency of physical activities in our lifestyle and change in our dieting method .
The society and family need to pay attention to this matter .
When they think about it you don't need to save anything.
It is only necessary to change your habit by doing small things properly , regularly , make it one of its own ways .
I would like the family members to try that children adopt the habit of going to the open field .
If possible then we also play the elders of the family with these children in a very open way .
Instead of coming up in the lift make the children habit of going stairs .
After dinner the whole family walks a little while keeping the children together .
Yoga for Young India.
Yoga , especially to maintain our young friends a healthy lifestyle and to prevent lifestyle disorder will prove to be helpful .
Before going to school see how much benefit is seen in yoga of 30 minutes .
You can also do home and the speciality of yoga is this itself - it is easy , easy , easy and I am saying that any adult person can do it easily .
How effective is yoga in controlling diabetes knowing that many studies and researches are happening .
In AIIMS also studies are being done on it and the results that have come up till now are very encouraged .
We should not only take Ayurveda and yoga in the form of treatment - treatment , make it a part of our life .
My loved countrymen , especially my youth friends , good news has come in the past in the field of sports .
In different games our players have named our country .
In Hockey India has won the status of Asia Cup hockey by playing a grand game .
Our players performed an excellent exhibition and on this India has made Asia Cup champion after ten years .
This next India was made Asia Cup champion in 203 and 20 .
All teams and helping staff from me, very good wishes from the countrymen.
After hockey good news has also come to India in Badminton .
Bedmint star Kidambi Srikanth has created an emotion of pride in every Indian by winning the title of Denmark Open while excellent performance .
After Indonesia Open and Australia Open they have this third Super Series Premier title .
I have read our young friends a lot of enjoyment for their achievement and to increase the glory of India .
Dudes , this month FIFA Andr-1 World Cup was organised .
The teams of the world came to India and everyone showed their respect on the field of football .
I also got an opportunity to go to a match .
There was a lot of enthusiasm among the players and visitors .
The biggest context of the world , the whole world is watching you . .
Such a big match . . I was stunned to see the emotions of all youth players ' energy , enthusiasm , doing something .
World Complex was successfully organised and all teams performed their best .
Although India could not go away but the youth players of India took the heart of everyone .
The whole world including India considered this festival of Khail and this entire competition was interesting and entertaining for the lovers of football .
The future of football is very bright , its signals are visible .
Once again I congratulate all the players , their colleagues and all the sports lovers , give me good wishes .
The number of people who write me about my loved countrymen , clean India , I feel that if I think of doing justice with their feelings then what will I have to do daily and what will I have to dedicate on the subject of cleanliness .
The photographs of some forgetful attempts are sent , then somewhere the story of the social efforts of the youth is done .
Somewhere there is a matter of innovation regarding cleanliness or there is a question of changes occurring due to the genus of any officer .
In the past I have received a very recent report , in which there is one thing about the confrontation of Chandrapur fort of Maharashtra .
At the same time the entire team of an Engines named Ecologistic Protection Organization campaign for the cleaning of the Chandrapur Fort was carried out .
He sent me the details of the fort before cleaning and after cleaning .
Seeing the photographs I am stunned and whatever they see these photographs in their minds also sometimes feel depressed by seeing dirt around me , sometimes they feel that how the dream of cleanliness is fulfilled then I will tell them how the youth of ecologistic protection organization , their sweat , their symptoms , their symptoms , you can see in the lifestyle .
On seeing this your depression will be turned into faith .
This variety of effort of cleanliness is a unique example of beauty , socialism and harmony .
Fort is a symbol of our heritage .
The responsibility of keeping the historical heritage safe and clean is of our fellow countrymen .
I am very enjoying the colloquial protection organisation and its entire team and the citizens of Chandrapur .
My dear countrymen, on 4th November this village we will accept all the gurus vanity.
He thought about the welfare of all human species , he counted all species as equal .
She had put stress on women 's energies and women 's honor .
Guru Nanak Devji walked 28 thousand kilometers on foot and during his journey he gave a message of true humanity .
He communicated with the people , showed them the path of truth , sacrifice and communism .
He gave a message of equality in the society and told his message not only by words but by his own words .
He drive a lump from which people were born of service .
By taking a lump by sitting together the feeling of unity and equality among the people became aware .
Guru Nanak Devji gave three messages of literary life - name of God , work , work and help the needy .
Guru Nanak Devji had also constructed ' Gurbani ' to speak his words .
In this village in 2001 we are going to celebrate the 550th light year of Guru Nanak Devji .
Come , let us try to move forward on the path of their message and education .
My dear countrymen , two days later on 31 October we will accept the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patalji .
We all know that he had put the foundation of modern impure India .
Today we can learn a lot from this extraordinary journey of the great mother of India .
On 31 October Shrimati Indira Gandhi also left the world .
The speciality of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was that he did not only give changeful thoughts but he was also impossible in finding out the behavioral alternative of a very complex problem to show it .
He had a break in making the thought to be fulfilled .
Sirdar Vallabhbhai had drew the dryness of binding India in a sword .
He decided that hundreds of Indians should be brought in the umbrella of a nation and a bandage .
His determination gave him the ability to cross all the obstacles .
Where there was a need for recognition he made recognition , where there was a need for use of fuel .
He had said , we can not stop any difference between species and pandals , all are girls and girls of India , we all should love our country and build our justice on mutual love and harmony .
This statement of Sardar Saheb is still inspiring for the visit of our New India , prescribed .
And this is the reason that their birth day is considered as a national unity day .
His contribution to the country in the form of a ruined nation is inappropriate .
On 31 October on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb ' Run For University ' will be organised in the country in which children , youths , women , all age groups from all over the country will be included .
My father is insistent that you also participate in this festival of mutual support .
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Diwali, with new compassion, with a new determination, would have joined your daily life once again.
My loved countrymen, smile to yourself.
Three years have been completed while quitting the mind through the medium of airways . Today it is 36 MO APSOD .
And when people from all the corners of the country bring me those things in what I say , then maybe I can tell you very little things but I get a lot of treasure .
Most of them are inspiring me from them .
Many are for improvement in the government .
Somewhere personal complaints are also there then sometimes attention is attracted towards social problems .
And I take half an hour of yours once in a month but on the thirteenth day people bring their words to the mind .
And its consequences came that in the government also there is a feeling of sensitivity , how powers have fallen in the far-flung society , it is getting its attention .
And that is why this journey of three years of mind is a journey of feelings and feelings of the countrymen .
And perhaps in such a short time I have got the opportunity to know the feelings of the common man of the country and for this I am very proud of the countrymen .
And I am convinced that this idea - understanding will also be useful for what will be the mind in future , in which a new consciousness , new energy will be obtained .
When I once said the mother of mind that we should worry while eating that we should take as much as necessary , we should not make it unsuccessful .
But after that I saw that all the media came from all the corners of the country , many social organizations , many youths are already doing this work .
How many people working on the food that is left out of the palm together have been used so that my mind got very satisfied , very happy .
And after that I saw that many people came forward to do such work for cleanliness .
Once I saw a survey of a Sarpanch of Haryana with a daughter and I kept talking to everyone in my mind.
In Jota-Jota, not only in India but also in the world with Daughter a big campaign was launched.
This is not the only source of social media .
This occurrence of a new self-confidence , new pride in every girl .
Every parents felt that I too used to sleep with my daughter .
Every girl started feeling that I have some importance , I have some importance .
In the past I was sitting with the Tourism department of the Government of India .
When I told the people going to Tour that wherever you go, send a photo there on Incredible India.
Lacs of chickens of every corner of India , in one way the people working in the Turism area became very high .
How big adventure starts from the smallest thing I have experienced in what habit of that mind .
It was decided to say all these things today because when we were thinking that three years have passed , many incidents of last three years have stopped in my mind .
To go towards the right direction the country is constantly untouched .
For the good of every citizen of the country , for the betterment of the society , asking for something to do for the progress of the country , I have learnt from the countrymen in the campaign of my three year old mind .
For any country it is very big mood , there is a very big power .
I bow down to the countrymen with heart .
If there is a sheet in the house , towel , curtain . feeling that the attraction of khadi has increased in youth generation .
The sale of khadi has increased and due to this the direct employment of the poor in the house has been added .
Discount is given in khadi from October 2 , many riddances are given .
I will once again inspire that the campaign of khadi should be carried forward and increased .
By buying khadi we will reveal the lamp of the lady in the poor house , we will work with that feeling .
The poor of our country will get strength from this work and we should do that .
And due to the increase in money towards this treasure the enthusiasm of thinking a new way has also increased among the working people in the field of treasure , in the Indian government .
How to bring new technology , how to increase productivity , how to bring solar-hearted .
Those old heritages who were completely closed for 20-20 , 25-25 , 30-30 years , how can they be revived .
In Varanasi Sevapur of Uttar Pradesh , Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri had been closed for 26 years but today it has become residual .
Many types of activities have been added .
New opportunities of employment were produced to many people .
Khadi and Village Department in Pumpore in Kashmir resumed its closed training center and there is a lot to give it to Kashmir .
Now due to the resumption of this training center the new generation will get help in working in modern ways , making new things and I am very happy that big corporate houses also give gifts to Deepavali .
People have also started giving food items in the form of gifts to each other .
How does things move forward with a simple feeling we all feel .
My dear countrymen , in the last month in what mind we all had made a conception and we had decided that Gandhi - Jayanti will celebrate the festival of cleanliness throughout the country for the first 15 days .
I will join the genitals with cleanliness .
Our ideal president ji started this work and the country got involved .
Children - aged , men or women , city or village , everybody has become the victims of this cleaning campaign today .
And when I say that Siddhi from simplicity , how is this cleaning campaign moving forward towards a simplicity , we are seeing it in front of our eyes .
Everybody accepts it , gives support , and gives some contribution to the work .
This time one thing is also seen , one is that we should clean somewhere , the other is that we should not make dirt by staying aware but if we have to make cleanliness then a medical movement is also important .
This time many competitions were organised with the service of cleanliness .
More than two and a half crore children participated in the campaign of cleanliness .
Thousands of children made pictures .
As far as the matter of cleanliness comes , I never forget to accept the glory of the people of the media .
We can see how much of our country's Delectronic Media, our country's print Media's country, in the same service we can see.
Somebody had paid attention to me just a few days back in relation to the 18-year-old children of Srinagar .
And you will be happy to know that the Srinagar Municipal Corporation has built Brand Ambassador for purity and when it comes to Brand Ambassador then you must feel that he might be a artist, perhaps he would be a hero of mess.
Bill Dar has been engaged in cleansing since the age of 12 - 13 years .
The biggest lake of Asia is near Srinagar where there is plastic , polythene , used bottle , it is cleaning .
Some of these are also earned .
Because his father died due to cancer in a very young age but he also added his life to cleanliness along with lifestyle .
I also want to give happiness to the Srinagar Municipal Corporation for their first and for their imagination of Ambassador , because Srinagar is a tourist destination and every citizen of India wants to go to Srinagar and get so much bleeding there is a very big thing .
And I am happy that he made Bala only brand Ambassador it is not so but while cleaning Bala has given a car this time , calculated and he also goes to other places and teaches people for cleanliness , motivates and goes back till the results come .
Billa diarrhea is young but is the cause of inspiration for everyone interested in cleanliness .
This month of October is the month of remembering many great men for us .
These magnificent feelings gave us direction for the 20th century and 21st century , our leadership guided us and he suffered a lot for the country .
The birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastriji on October 2 is the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan and Chhotaji Deshmukh on 11th October and on 25th September is the birth anniversary of Pandit Dayal Uyadhyayaji .
This is also the year of Chhotaji and Dindayalaji .
And what was the center point of all these great men
One thing was common in his life and that was to live for the country , do something for the country and not just advise , in his own life guide people through its conduct .
Gandhiji , Jaiprakashji , Dindayalaji are all such great men who stay away from the shepherds of Satta but lived moments with life , stayed joyous and everybody has been doing something universal happiness .
Chhotaji had left the country - facing political life and when we are celebrating their centuries today it is very natural to be respected towards their rural work .
When the former president of India Shriman Abdul Kalamji used to talk to the youth then he used to always talk about the rural development of the small country .
He used to speak with great respect and he himself went to the village to see this work of the small ji .
Remembering all these great men is not favourable to them , they remind of these great men so that we get the path ahead , get the direction ahead .
I will definitely tell about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in this village , but on 31 October the Run For University of the entire country is going to be the best India program .
In every city of the country , in every city there should be programs of run for unity on a very big way and this weather is also such that it is also necessary to get iron power like Sardar Sahib .
And Sardar Sahib had done one thing to the country .
We should also move forward the mantra of unity by running for unity .
We say very naturally - unity in diversity , specialty of India .
We glorify diversity but have we ever tried to feel this diversity
I will often tell my countrymen of India and especially my young men tell me that we are in a state of awareness .
Understand the diversity of India , touch them , feel their aroma .
You see , for the development of your personality also these varieties of our country work as a very big school .
The vacation is , the days of Diwali , the nature of going somewhere else in our country , people go as a migratory and it is very natural .
But sometimes there is an anxiety that we do not see our country , do not understand the varieties of the country , but after coming under the influence of jokes we have started enjoying foreign tourists .
You go anywhere in the world , I have no wolf but sometimes look at your house as well .
The person of North India does not know what is in South India .
The person of western India does not know what is in East India .
Our country is filled with so many varieties .
All these great men made a broad tour of India .
In the beginning of his work he tried to know , understand India .
Try to live in itself India .
Can we try to learn and understand different states of our country , different communities , groups , their methods , their tradition , their clothing , their food habits , their feelings as a student
Vallue administer in Turism will happen only when we do not just meet , but as a student try to keep them alive and alive .
I have my feeling that I must have got an opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India .
More than four and a half districts would have been such that where I would have got the chance to stop the night , and today when I am taking care of this responsibility in India then the experience of this tour is very useful .
There is a lot of convenience in understanding things .
You also have my resistance that you feel the store of inadequate power of our large India while speaking a message of unity in diversity .
The dream of India - best India is included in it only .
How many kinds of diet are there .
Even if you keep eating a different diet everyday then there will never be any recurrence of any diet .
This is a great power of our tourism .
Do the diversity of Kotkoti people in future .
This feeling will make your life rich .
Your thinking will become big .
And who can be the greatest teacher than the experience
Normally the time from October to March is mostly of tourism .
People travel .
I am convinced that even if you go this time you will take this campaign more ahead .
Wherever you go, divide your experience, divide yourself.
You must be photographed on incredible India.
Not only the buildings , but also the people there get to see their photographs .
Not only of natural beauty but also some things of the life there .
Write good arrangements for your journey .
If possible they should go to seven places .
Can you give any information about that
If you see , if all the people of one state tell this part then I will tell in the government that they will miss it and prepare that propaganda literature on the common seven things that have come to each state .
That is , in a way how to get the excitement of tourist places with the effects of the population is my objective .
Government of India will work on it .
Come on, join me.
You can also play an encouraging role in increasing the tourism of the country from October to March .
I'm invited to you.
My loved countrymen , many things like a human touch me as well .
It enjoys my heart .
Leans deep impact on my mind .
That is why I am also a human like you .
We have seen a unique example of women's power and patriotism.
We can imagine that when the world has grown up in this young age then what will be their mental state
For 11 months he got training by labouring and dedicated his life to fulfil the dreams of his husband .
Similarly Nidhi Dubey 's wife Makesh used to work as Nayak in the army and she was martyred for the motherland .
His wife Nidhi also decided in mind and she also joined the army .
It is very natural for every countrymen to be respected towards our mother power , our virgins .
I am giving great pleasure to both of these arms from the heart .
He has made a new inspiration , a new consciousness for the people of the country .
These two arms are very pleasant.
There is also a great opportunity for the youth generation of our country among my loved countrymen , Navaratri festival and Diwali .
The World Cup of FIFA Under 1 is going on there.
I believe that football will be lost all around .
Each body juice will grow in football.
The field of any school , college of India should not be such that where our young people do not fall in the sight of playing .
Come , when the whole world is coming to play on the earth of India then we also make sports a blessing of our life .
My loved countrymen , Navaratri festival is going on .
There is an opportunity to worship Goddess Durga .
The entire environment is covered with sacred fragrance .
The atmosphere of an spirituality , the atmosphere of festival , the atmosphere of devotion and this festival is considered to be the festival of the means of energy .
It is known as Sharadi Navaratri .
On this sacred festival of Navaratri I give very good wishes to the countrymen and pray to the mother Shakti that our country achieves new heights to fulfill the hopes and desires of the life of the common man of the country .
The country gets the ability to face every challenge .
The country progresses fast and 75 years of India ' s independence is finishing in 2022 , then the attempt to fulfil the dreams of those who swimming for freedom becomes the imagination of the hundreds of hundreds of crores of people , making a rad map of five years to fulfil that imagination , unfathomable , unfathomable , unfathomable .
You're all very happy.
Festival also increase enthusiasm .
Money Ki August 2001
My loved countrymen, Sadar Namazam.
On one side the country is drowned in festivals and on the other hand when one comes to know of violence from any corner of India then it is natural for the country to worry .
This is the country of our country Buddha and Gandhi , the country of Sardar Patal which gives complete strength to the unity of the country .
For centuries our ancestors have accepted the values of public life , ahimsa , equal respect , have been in our future .
Ahinsa Paramo religion : We have heard it since childhood , have come to say .
I had also told on the Red Fort that no violence would take place in the name of faith , even if it is a communal faith , even if it is faithful towards the political ideals , whether it is faithful towards that person , even if it is faithful towards that tradition .
Among the bonds which Babasaheb Ambadkar has given us there is arrangement of every person to get justice .
I want to assure the people of the country , who take the law in hand , whoever passes Daman in waiting for violence , whether it is a person or a group , neither will this country bear any government .
Everyone will have to bow in front of the law , the law will determine the responsibility and will remain with the detainees .
My loved countrymen , our country is full of diversity and these varieties are not confined to eating , living and wearing .
In every behavior of life we get to see diversity .
Our festivals are also filled with diversity and because of our cultural heritage thousands of years old we need cultural traditions , see social traditions , historical traditions , if you want someday from 365 days , which we will not be associated with any festival there .
Now it has also been mentioned that every festival of ours is going according to the time of nature .
There is direct relation with nature .
Our festivals are connected directly to the peasants , connected to the mosquitoes .
Today if I am talking about festivals then first of all I want to call everyone a microscope .
The festival of Kale Santasari was celebrated in Jain society .
Parushan festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadrava in Jain society .
The last day of the festival is the day of Samvatsari .
This is really a unique tradition .
The festival of Sanvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness , ahimsa and friendship .
It is also called a forgiveness festival in a way and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other a microscope .
Senspier has written in his play The Merchant of Venice the importance of forgiveness that - Mercy is twice blessed, it blessed him that he is geeves on that takes , meaning forgiveness and whoever is forgiving both gets the blessings of God .
Bal Gangadhar Devmanya Tilak had given birth to this tradition 125 years ago and 125 years before independence he had become a symbol of freedom movement .
And since independence they had become the symbol of social education , social consciousness .
The festival of Ganesh Chatthi goes on for 10 days .
This festival is called the symbol of unity , equality and comfort .
Every countrymen want a lot of good wishes of Ganesh Chaturthi .
Nowadays festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala .
One of the colorful festivals of India is the main festival of Onam , Kerala .
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance .
The festival of Onam shows the rich cultural heritage of Kerala .
Together with giving messages of love and harmony in this festival a new joy , new hope , new faith in the minds of people .
And now our festivals are also becoming the reason for tourism .
And I would like to tell the countrymen like the festival of Navaratri in Gujarat or Durga festival in Bengal - has become the attraction of Turijam in a way .
Our other festivals also have an opportunity to attract foreigners .
In this direction we should think what we can do .
After a few days in the category of these festivals the festival of Eid-ul-Juha will also be celebrated throughout the country .
Each countrymen want a lot of good wishes of Id-ul-Juhan .
Festivals are a symbol of faith and faith for us , but we also have to make festivals in new India a symbol of cleanliness .
Festivals and cleanses are connected in family life .
The opinion of preparation of festivals is clean .
This is not a new thing for us but it is also important to become a social nature .
The aim of public purification should be to make a unique violence not only in our entire village , in the entire city , in our country , in our country , cleanliness , along with those festivals .
My loved countrymen , the tradition of being modern are changing .
Now a new dimension, a new parameter, how modern you are, how long your little professions are, it's been working to know how long it is, and it's so regrettable about the environment.
If it is against it , then it is considered bad today in the society .
And the same consequence I am seeing today that even in Ganeshotsav these days Deco Friendly Ganpati , as if a big campaign has been started .
If you go to Yutube then children are making Ganeshji in every house . are making Ganeshji by bringing soil .
Different kinds of experiments are being done in every family .
In a way such a comprehensive training of the Environment Council has been seen in this Ganeshotsav which lucky has ever been seen before .
Media Housse is also inspiring people for the statues of Deco-Friendly Ganesh in large numbers , guided .
And as I said that our country is full of hundreds of thousands of glaciers .
And it looks very good when some new innovatives get to know.
Somebody told me that there is a gentleman who is engineer himself , he gathers a special kind of soil , giving training to the people to make Ganeshji by collecting its combination .
And if Ganesh swells in water then he keeps water in a doll so that he melts immediately in water .
Three years ago when the cleaning campaign was started , on 2 October it would be completed for three years .
And its positive results are visible .
Coverage of toilets has reached about 3  to 6  .
More than two lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from defecation .
A few days back there was a terrible flood in Gujarat .
Many people lose their lives but when the water decreased after the completion then such dirt had spread everywhere .
At such a time the workers of Jamiat-ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera of Banaskantha district of Gujarat cleaned the stages of 22 temples and 3 mosques affected .
Everything sweated out .
The best example of unity for cleanliness , such examples of inspiration to everyone have been given by every workers of Jamiat-ulema-e-Hind .
Trying dedicated to cleanliness , if it becomes our permanent nature then where can our country reach
As you get the opportunity, wherever you get the opportunity, we'll find the opportunity.
But we all join.
Work together on the day of holiday or on Sunday .
Go to the population of Adash-Padash , go to the nearby villages , but do it as an entertainment .
A security has been built on which after the construction of the toilet you can enter the name of your father and the name of that family which has helped .
My social media friends can run a constructive campaign and the work discussed in Virtual World can become a very inspiring inspiration .
This campaign of the Ministry of Physics and Cleanliness is a prohibition for you , competition for making tiny films , competition of paintings is being organised .
In these you can write a ban in various languages and there is no limit of age in them , no leg-limit .
You can make your tiny film , you can make your mobile .
You can make a film of 2 . minutes which inspires for cleanliness .
He may be in any language , he may also be a sylant .
Those who participate in this competition and those of them who will get three choices will be on the distributed level, they will be rewarded three on the State Level.
So I invite everyone to join this campaign of cleanliness as well .
I want to say once again that this time on 2 October Gandhi Jayanti should enjoy cleaning up as 2 October and for this from 15 September to reach the same service mantra from home to home .
Definitely take some step for cleanliness .
Become participants in it by working on your own.
Now see how Gandhi Jayantti will shine on October 2 .
You can imagine , after this campaign of 15 days cleaning , after that service of cleanliness , when we will celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October , then how would we have a sacred joy inside to give devotion to the worshipper .
My dear countrymen , I want to accept the season of everybody especially today .
I ask you to express your glory from the heart ' s deepness , that is , no matter what much long time your mind is connected to , but I ask for expression , because I ask for acception of the moment because with no mind this program lakhs of people from every corner of the country join .
The number of listeners is in crores but lakhs of people write me sometimes , sometimes message comes on the phone , which is a big treasure for me .
To know the minds of the people of the country this has become a big opportunity for me .
I am waiting for your messages more than what you want to hear .
Sometimes some things become such a victim of our habit that we do not feel that we do wrong .
Prime Minister , I am speaking indecently from Pune .
I want to tell you about one of my witnesses.
He often starts trying to help the people but I am troubled about his habit .
I once went to mall to shop with him.
For a sari he spent 200 rupees comfortably and the auto rickshaw which he had taken for Pitja to go to 450 rupees and mall , he kept rubbing for five rupees for a long time with the resident .
While returning they bought vegetables from the way and saved four - five rupees by roaming on each vegetable again .
I felt very bad .
We miss the big and big places without asking once and again and fight with the living brother and sister for a few rupees .
Do you not feel that when we come to sell some luggage around our house , some fairy person comes , some small shopkeeper or vegetable seller or some auto-rickshaw - whenever we come in contact with the living people by doing some hard work we start dealing with it - No , reducing two rupees , reducing five rupees .
And whenever we go to eat in some big restaurant then we do not even see what we have written in the bill and immediately give it out money .
Not only this , even if you go to buy saris in Shaw room , we do not make any feelings but we can not stay with any poor without feeling .
What would happen in the mind of the poor - We have thought of it ever .
For this the question is not of two - five rupees . Her heart is sorry that you are that poor so doubted her respect .
There is no difference in your life from two - five rupees , but this little habit of yours would have caused adverse effect on his mind .
Madam, I am your career, you have given me a message by calling such a phone that you touch the heart.
I am convinced that even my countrymen will have their habit of doing such behavior with the poor if they will definitely leave .
My dear youth friends , on the day of 2 August the whole country celebrates as a national sports day .
This day is the birthday of the great hockey-player and the magician of Hockey Major Dhyanchandji .
His contribution to hockey is incomparable .
I am reminding this thing because I want to join the new generation , games of our country .
Sports - learning is part of our life .
If we are counting among the youth countries of the world then our youth should also be seen in the field of sports .
Sports i . . physical fitness , mental alternates , personality management , I understand what should be more than this .
Sports - sports is a very big pocket of heart attack in a way .
The youth of our country move forward in the game and today in the computer age I also want to take care of whether the plainging field is more important than that platform .
FIFA RAMO on computer but sometimes in the field outside also show contact with football .
You will play cricket on computer but in open fields the pleasure of playing cricket below the sky is special .
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out , then the mother first asked whether - when will they come back
Today the situation is such that children start watching cartoon films in one corner with coming home or they stick on the mobile game and then the mother has to say that - When will you go out
It is a time for time , that too was a time when the mother used to tell the child that when will you come and today the condition is that the mother has to say - Daughter , when will you come out
Young friends , Khel ministry has prepared a Sports Talent Sergeant portal for the discovery and refraining of the talents , where any child in the entire country who has achieved anything in the field of sports , there are talents in them - he can upload his biodeta or video on this portal .
The Cabinet will give training to the chosen newly elected players .
Come , welcome our youth guests coming from all over the world with this festival of sports and sports , accept games and games , create an environment in the country .
When I am talking about sports and sports today then I want to shayer with those people who made my mind a touching event last week .
I got the opportunity to meet some girls of a very young age and some of them are born in the Himalayas .
Who has never had any relation with the sea , such six ladies of our country who work in Navy , their enthusiasm , their courage gives us inspiration to all .
These six sticks , taking a small boat INS Tarni will have to cross the sea .
The name of this campaign has been given - Navika Sagar Parikrama and after roaming all over the world after months , India will roam around after several months .
Sometimes I'll spend 40-40 days in the water, sometimes spend 30-30 days in the water.
In the midst of the waves of the sea along with adventure our six labourers , and this is going to be the first destruction in the world .
Would be Hindustani which is not proud of our labourers .
I salute the enthusiasm of these ladies and I have told them that they will divide their experiences with the whole country .
I will also make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the Narendramodi app so that you can read from every need because this is a thrilling story in a way , self-reliant story and I will be happy to reach you the words of those girls .
My girls have a lot of good wishes, a lot of blessings.
My great countrymen , on 5th September we celebrate all the educational days .
The former president of our country, Dr.
Radhakrishnanji is the birthday .
They were presidents but today used to present themselves as a teacher .
He always used to like to live as a teacher .
They were dedicated to education.
The great scientist had said to Albert Einstein - it is the Supreme Court of the Teacher to awaken the pleasure in the creative expression of abandonment.
That is , awakening the joy of creative emotion and knowledge among your students is the most important quality of this one teacher .
This time when we celebrate the teaching day , can we all communicate together
And in our country when we talk about change then in the same way as the mother is remembered in the family , the teacher is remembered in the society .
Teacher has a very big role in change .
Sometimes such incidents have been made in the life of every learner that their natural effort must have been successful in bringing changes in life of somebody .
If we make a social effort then we will play a very big role in the change of the nation .
Let's take this mantra, Teach to Transform.
My name is Dr . .
Unfortunate.
I live in Mumbai city and work for Indian Research Centre at Howard University .
Our loved countrymen , Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana , Financial Inclusion , is a matter of discussion of the pundits of the economic world not only in India .
On 28 August, 2014, taking a dream in the mind started this campaign.
On 28th August this campaign of Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana has been going on for three years .
30 crore new families have been associated with it , bank accounts have been opened .
This figure also increases the activity of many countries of the world .
Today I am very satisfied that within three years my poor brother sitting on the last end of the inner society , has become part of the root of the economy of the country , his habits have changed , he has started living in the bank , he has started saving money , he is feeling the security of money .
In the Prime Minister 's Jan Dhan Yojana about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited by our poor .
If seen in one way then this is the preservation of the poor , this is their strength in the coming days .
And along with the Chief Minister Jan Dhan Yojana whose account has been opened , they also got the benefit of insurers .
Prime Minister Life Jyoti Vima Yojana , Prime Minister Safety Vima Yojana - one rupee , thirty rupees very common prime minister today he gets a new faith in the life of the poor .
In many families , due to the price of one rupee when the debt came on the poor , the life of the family members had come to an end , in a few days he got two lakh rupees .
Prime Minister Music Plan ' ,  Stand up plan ' - those who are included , tribals , women , who are young , who are neglected youth , who have the desire to do something on their own , hundreds of thousands of youth have received money without any guarantee from the banks and they have their own legs .
Not only this , everyone has also made successful efforts to give employment to one another .
A few days back the people of Bangkok had met me, due to the Jan Dhan Yojana, due to Insurance, due to Rupay Card, he had benefited ordinary people because of the Prime Minister's posture plan and many inspired cases came out.
Today there is no such time but I will tell the people of Bangkok so important that such cases are MyGov .
They can also give new inspiration to new generations by introducing such people .
The changes occurring in changing weather cycle and environment have a very negative effect .
In the past few days some areas of India , especially Assam , Ishaan , India , Gujarat , Rajasthan , Bengal have to face natural disaster due to overcrowding .
The areas affected by such floods are being fully tested .
Relief is being done at a broad level .
Probably there my colleagues of the Ministry are also reaching Rubru .
State governments are also making sufficient efforts to help the victims under the leadership of their parents .
Social organizations , cultural organizations and civilians also are making immense efforts to help people in such a situation .
If you have to go to the army from the Government of India , to go to the airplane , there are people of the National Freedom Relief Team - NDRF , there are half - weekend teams , all are connected to the hearts and minds of the injured .
Because of the flood life becomes very unsuccessful .
The team of NDRF has taken care of .
They have been made free friends and they have been trained to do what to do and not to do at the time of freeing .
Self-servicemen have been prepared , in such a situation by lifting up a folk organization they have been taught to work in a distorted state .
Gradually we also make people such a nature that according to the environment we maintain our activities so that we can escape from harm .
Whenever I am ready for what satisfaction I see that more citizens of the country are prepared than me .
This time almost all such papers have come to GST , all these phone cells have come .
And even today people are expressing happiness about GST .
And in a phone call I also hear you... the Namas Prime Minister, I call Nitu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard the discussion of your chartered accountants day, and I'm very impressed.
Similarly in our country the beginning of Gudz and Service Text GST was started in the same week .
Can you tell whether the results are getting the same as the government had expected , or not .
I want to know your thoughts about this , thank you .
And when a poor tells me by writing a letter , because of GST the feelings of the lifestyle of the poor have decreased , things have become cheap , then I feel very satisfied .
Now I was seeing how the effect of GST has been on the transport area .
Now the trend of tracho has increased .
It is getting less time to cut the distance .
Highways have been freed from traffic jam .
Earlier because of being different kinds of treasures the papers of most of the resources of Transport and Logistic areas used to be kept in mind and they had to make their new godowns in every state .
But GST or which I call goose and simplicity .
He has recently had a very positive effect on our economy and has produced adverse effect in less time .
The fast which has changed simplicity , which has become very fast in one another , new records have been done , he has created a new faith in the entire country .
And sometimes the experts of the economy , experts of management , experts of technology , researching the use of GST of India in the form of delay will present a certain world .
For many universities of the world he will become a case study .
All the decisions have been taken together by the States and the Centre .
And the result of this is that there has been only one priority of every government , because of GST there is no restriction on the palm of the poor .
I read all the ministries connected to this work , the workers of all the departments , central and state governments with great harmony .
GST is an excellent example of the success of India 's strategic power .
This is a historical proverb.
And this is not just a reform , it is a mechanism of giving strength to a new culture of reproduction .
In one way it is also a campaign of social reform .
To successfully make such a big effort successful , I once again commit a cottage to hundreds of countrymen .
My exclusive countrymen are the month of the month of Ogst month of Cranti .
Since childhood we have heard this thing and the reason for this is  1 light , 120 , unsuccessful movement started .
Ogst , 142 , India shoes movement started which is known as Ogst Cranti .
And 15 August, 14 - the country was free.
In one way in the month of August many incidents of freedom are specially connected .
This year we leave India - ueen India is going to celebrate the 5th anniversary of Independence .
But very few people know this thing that Dr . Yusuf Meher Ali , the narrator of India , had given it .
Our new generation should know what happened to me on August 142.
The way the countrymen continued to conclude with you from 185 to 142 freedom struggle , the plains of history are our inspiration for the formation of India .
Leave India Adolan was an important concert of freedom movement of India .
This mandol had embraced the whole country for free from British rule .
This was the time when in the corners of the Indian democracy country , Chahe village , city , city , educational , educational , poor , poor , horrifying , leaving India by mixing horrific apprehension .
Jan Akrosh was at its peak .
Lacs of Indians were jumping their lives in the war with the mantra of death or death on the Hakal of Mahatma Gandhi .
Lacs of young people of the country had left their education and sacrificed books .
The bugyal of freedom had come out after listening .
Mr . President Mahatma Gandhi had defeated India , but all the big leaders were hoisted in the British handicraft jelly .
And that time was that in the country the great men like Dr . Lohia , Jaiprakash Narayan played a forward role .
In unsuccessful movement and India shoes in Adolan two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi are seen in 120 and 142 .
The format of unsuccessful movement was different and the situation of 42 was different , the speed had increased so much that Mahapurusha like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of death .
It was folk potential behind all success, was folk potential.
The world was complicated, the world was struggling, the whole country was fighting one.
Sometimes I think , if we see a little connecting the leaves of history then the first freedom struggle of India happened in 185 .
The freedom struggle started in 185 was going on in some corner of the country till 142 .
For this long time the countrymen gave place in the hearts of freedom fighters .
Everyone has been compelled to do something.
The muscles changed but there was no dearth in imagination .
People were coming, watching, going, going, coming new, watching new, and trying to expel the British Sultanate.
This tradition from 185 to 142 produced this movement in such a situation that in 142 he reached the peak and such a desert of Indian plants was blossomed that in five years the British had to go to 14 .
From 185 to 142 freedom fighters reached the population of 142 to 14 years of age , became such a worldwide , imaginatively became the reason for freedom of the country with success in the form of five decisive year of Siddhi .
These were five years of decisive year .
Now I want to connect you with this count .
We were free in 14, today is 201.
About 0 years have passed , governments have made arrangements , changed , developed , increased , everybody tried to get rid of the problems of the country .
Likewise from 142 to 14 complications, Siddhi had a decisive five years.
I am seeing that from 01 to 022 - imagination the more than five years of age towards Siddhi has come to us .
We will celebrate the 15th August of this 2001 as a compassionate festival and when 5 years of independence takes place in 222 then we will continue to convert that imagination into proven .
Try to fulfil hundreds of crores of complications .
So as the five years from 142 to 14 became decisive for the freedom of the country and these five years could become decisive for the future of India from 21 to 2222 .
After five years I will celebrate the independence of the country for 5 years .
Come on , in this month of August , with the imagination of the complications of the synthesis run a great impression of the sympathy .
Each Indian residents , social organizations , local units , schools , colleges , different organizations - take some complications for every New India .
Such a symptom that we will prove to be in the coming five years .
I am specially online World because we are somewhere or not , but online is definitely there .
Which is the world of online and especially invites my youth friends , that they come forward for innovative contribution in the construction of new India .
Widows , posts , blogs , analysis , new thoughts , bring everything using technology .
Makes this zoobesh convert into a lifestyle .
On the Narendramodi app also the ' uit India ' quiz sharu sharu for young friends .
This queue is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and introduce them to the leaders of freedom struggle .
I believe that you must spread it extensively .
There he does not speak a person , the voice of a hundred crore countrymen swings from the Red Fort .
This time also I request you to send your thoughts to me on MYGOV or on Narendra Modi app .
I read it myself and as much time as I have on 15th August I will try to present it in it .
In the last three times I got to hear a complaint in the speech of my 15 August that my speech becomes a little longer .
We see whether success is achieved or not .
Countries, I'm asking for one thing too.
There is a social economic science in the economy of India .
And we should never think that less .
Our festivals , our festivals are just the occasions of happiness and love .
Our festivals , our festivals are also a campaign of social reform .
But with this our every festival has direct relation with the economic life of the poor .
A few days later , Raksha Bandhan , Janmashtami , then Ganesh festival , after that fourth moon , then Anant Chaudash , Durga Puja , Deepavali , one after another , the same is the right time when the poor get the opportunity of economic award .
As far as the matter of economy is concerned , in hundreds of household industries start making sheep in hundreds of families from many months of defence .
The business of sheep maker , sheep seller , sweet - thousands of rupees joins with a festival .
The family of our poor companions runs from it only .
We inspire Deepavali , that is the light festival not only that , that is the festival , the decoration of the house is not the same .
Its direct relation is with the poor families making mud sizes .
But today when I talk about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals , along with that I would also ask for talks of environment .
I have seen, and sometimes I think the countrymen are more aware than me, more active.
For the last one month the citizens of awareness towards the environment have written me a letter .
And he has warned that in Ganesh Chatti he should talk about Eco-Friendly Ganesh in advance so that people make plans on the choice of soil Ganesh from now on .
First of all I am honored with such aware citizens .
He has warned me that I spoke on this subject before time.
This time the public Ganeshotsav has a special importance .
Lokmanya Tilakji started this great tradition this year is the 125th year of the public Ganeshotsav .
Once again in this year of Ganeshotsav we should convene a banquet , make discussion meetings , remember the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak .
And how to take the emotions of Tilakji again in that direction , how to make this emotion stronger and at the same time for the protection of environment the eco - friendly Ganesh made of earth , Ganesh , this is our imagination .
And this time I said very fast:
I must believe that you will join me everybody and the benefit from this will be that the poor artists who are our poor artists , who make idols will get employment , the poor will fill the stomach .
Come let us connect our festivals with the poor , join with the economy of the poor , the joy of our festivals becomes the economic festival of the poor house , it should be the attempt of all of us .
I read a lot of wishes for festivals for many festivals coming to every countrymen .
My dear countrymen , we constantly see whether there is a field of education , whether it is a economic field , social field , playing - our ladies are illuminating the name of the country , getting new heights .
We are prideing the countrymen on our labourers .
In the past itself our girls have made a grand show in the Cricket World Complex .
I got the opportunity to meet all those ladies in this week .
I liked to talk to them very much , but I was feeling that the World Cup could not live , it was very bad on them .
Its pressure was also on their face and there was tension .
We have seen many such games that if the players of India fail in it then the anger of the country breaks on those players .
Some people tell such things by breaking the limits , write such things so that there is a lot of pain .
But for the first time it happened that when our ladies could not be successful in the world compound then hundreds of hundreds of millions of people took that defeat in their clutches , but suddenly they did not let them fall on the ladies .
Not only that , what these girls have done , they have glorified their virtues .
Actually the youth generation of our country , especially our girls are doing a lot to illuminate the name of our country .
Once again I want to develop the youth of the country , especially our beggars from the heart , read good wishes .
My dear countrymen, once again remind me of August Cranti, once again reminds of August, once again of 15 August, once again reminds me of 2022, 5 years of independence.
Every countrymen imagine , prepare a five-year roadmap to prove the imagination of every countrymen .
We all have to reach this country at new heights , reach and reach it .
Come let us walk together , do something .
The fate of the country will remain better , that will go ahead with faith .
A lot of good wishes.
The weather is changing .
The weather has become pleasant due to rains in many parts of the country .
After rains one feels relief from the heat falling in the past days in cold winds .
We have seen that there are many problems in life , many tensions , personal life , there is a public life , only the arrival of rain changes our mind .
Today the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannathji is considered to be very faithful and joyous in many parts of the country .
Now in some parts of the world the festival of the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannathji is considered .
And the poor of the country are associated with Lord Jagannathji .
Those people who do.
Baba Saheb would have studied Ambedakar , he must have seen that he used to praise the temples and traditions of Lord Jagannathji because he was subject to social justice , social harmony .
Lord Jagannathji is the god of the poor .
And very little people must know that there is a word in English language, Jugernaut and that means a grand chariot that nobody can stop.
Also in the decisive sense of this Jagarnata it is also seen that this word has been produced along with the chariot of Jagannath .
And therefore we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way .
On the occasion of the journey of Lord Jagannathji I read every country and pray in the shrines of Lord Jagannathji .
The diversity of India is also its speciality , the diversity of India which is also the power of India .
People of the holy month of Ramzan celebrated with the holy feelings of Idabad .
Now is the festival of Eid .
On this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr 's many good wishes of everyone from me .
Ramjan is the menstruation of male and female .
Happiness is the month of partition and happiness increases as much as you divide .
Come on , let us divide the treasure of happiness by taking inspiration from these holy festivals together and proceed ahead of the country .
In this sacred month of Ramzan a motivational incident of Bijnor village of Uttar Pradesh came in front of me .
Approximately three and a half thousand our Muslim brother-in-law's family lives there in small villages , in a way more disadvantage is of the brother-in-law of our Muslim family .
In this Ramzan the people of the village have decided to build toilets together .
And this personal toilet also gets help from the government and they have been given about one lakh rupees as much as they have been given .
Expend this one lakh rupees for other facilities of the village nearby .
I wish every village of Mubarakpur to convert this holy occasion of Ramzan into the occasion of goodwill of the society .
One thing of them is also very inspiring .
And the biggest thing is that he freed Mubarakpur from open defecation .
We know that three states of our country Sikkim , Himachal and Kerala are such that have already been declared free from open defecation .
This week Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF .
I consider the administration , rule and people of these five states to be special honor by changing this work .
We know very much that in the life of the person , if something has to be done in the life of the society then we have to work a lot .
If our letter is bad , if it has to be improved then one has to try to stay very aware for a long time .
Then the habit of body and mind changes .
The subject of cleanliness is also like this .
Such bad habits have become a source of our nature .
Our habits have become a hissus .
We have to make efforts to get rid of it continuously .
Everybody has to attract attention .
It is necessary to remember good inspirational events .
And I am happy that cleanliness today is not the only government program .
In the past, I noticed a very best event, which I would like to say before you.
This incident is of Vijaynagaram district of Andhra Pradesh .
The administration there has taken a big task from the division of the people .
A 10-hour non-stop expedition.
And what was the goal
To make ten thousand domestic toilets in one gram panchayat in a hundred hours .
And my loved countrymen , will be happy to know that people and the government successfully completed the work of making ten thousand toilets in 10 hours together .
1 village got off.
I am reading a lot of enjoyment to the people sitting in the regime , government officials and citizens of that village of Vijaynagaram district that by reaching the polls of the labour they have presented a very inspiring example .
In the minds of these days I keep getting reflections from the people continuously . Narendra Modi keeps coming on coming to Ape , Mygov .
It keeps coming on in , comes from the papers , keeps on coming on the window as well .
Shriman Prakash Tripathy has reminded Katokati that on 25th June he has presented in the history of democracy as a period of time .
This awareness towards the folk democracy of light tripathy is praiseworthy and democracy is not just an arrangement , it is also a culture .
15, 25 June - That was a dark night that can't forget any democratic lover.
No Indians can forget.
In one way the country was converted into jail .
The opposite voice was pressed .
The glorious leaders of the country including Jaiprakash Narayan were closed in jail .
Trusting arrangement was also not able to escape from the shadow of that horrific form of Katokati .
The kids were completely made useless .
The students of today 's journalist Jagat , people working in the democracy , those people who remind of the black art , constantly and constantly try to increase awareness towards the democracy and keep doing it also .
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail .
When Katokati had come a year then Atalji had written a poem and he described the mind of that time in his poem .
We have to make this heritage more powerful .
My loved countrymen , every Hindustani is feeling glorious by lifting up the head in the world today .
On 21st June , 2001 the whole world became yogamayam .
From water to the mountain people welcomed the sun rays in the morning through yoga .
Almost all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of yoga their own .
In China people sacrificed yoga on the Great Wolf of China , then people sacrificed at the height of 240 metres above sea on the World Heritage Site Machu Pictu in Peru .
People did yoga in the African tower sanctuary in France .
In the Abu Dhabi of UAE more than 4000 people have done social yoga .
In Afghanistan , by making yoga on Afghanistan Friendship Dam - Salma Dam in Hairat India has a new expectation of friendship of India .
At small places like Singapore programs were held at 0 places and they campaigned for weeks .
Yoga session with yoga masters were organised in the UN headquarters .
The UAN officials, along with the world's doors, were involved in this...
This time once again Yoga has also worked as World Record .
In Gujarat about 55 thousand people have made a new world record by combining together in Ahmedabad .
I also got a chance to stay in the program of yoga in Lucknow .
But for the first time I got the privilege of doing yoga in the rain .
Where our soldiers have minus 220 , 25 , 40 degrees temperature they also did yoga in Siachen .
Our ordinary fores , be BSF , be ITBP , be C . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On this yoga day I had said that three generations because this was the third international yoga day , then I had said that three generations of the family do yoga together .
Some TV channels also forwarded this thing .
I got many photographs , some of which have been collected on the chosen Narendra Modi app .
Chief Minister Shri , I am speaking to Dr . Anil Sonaar , Ahmedabad , Gujarat .
Saheb , I have a question that in recent times we had heard in your statement in Kerala that instead of the gifts and gifts of flowers at different places we should give good reading books in the form of mementos .
You have also started this work in Gujarat in your work time , but sir , we are not able to see this work in some days .
So can we do this
Peaker Foundation is organised and people have the habit of reading books , people are aware of reading books , therefore reading day and reading month are celebrated .
For this I got an opportunity to go to its beginning .
And the handicraft of khadi , which also gives encouragement by eating .
As far as I was in Gujarat , this was the habit of all of us , but after coming here my habit was released .
But when she went to Kerala, she once again remembered.
And in recent times I have started giving information to the government again below .
We can also gradually cry a nature .
And the life of flowers is very less .
Once we took it in hand , then put it on it .
But if we give the book then he becomes a household asshole in a way , becomes a slave in the family .
Welcome by giving a towel of khadi , so many poor people get help from it .
Expense also reduces and in reality it is also used .
And when I am telling this thing then how historical value of such things is there .
When I went to the youth last year , then in London the queen of Britain , ueen Alizabeth invited me to eat .
How many years have passed , despite this ueen Alisabeth has kept the towel given by Mahatma Gandhi safe .
And when I was watching, they meant that I would touch.
A small gift of Mahatma Gandhi has become a source of his life , became part of his history .
I believe that the habits do not change at night and when they talk about this then they also have to become victims of vaccine .
Despite this there will also be vaccine , but if we talk then change will also come slowly .
Because of being the chief minister of my countrymen , many types of works are done .
I have to stay lying in the file , but I have a habit for me that I read some of the papers that come everyday from them and by this I get a chance to join the common man .
Different kinds of media comes , different types of people write the papers .
These days I got the opportunity to read such a letter , I feel that I should tell you about it .
In the far south , in Tamil Nadu , a housewife of Madurai Arulumoji Saranan sent me a letter .
And in Chitthi he had written that in my family I thought to do some economic activity along with paying attention to the study of children , so that family gets financial support .
So I took money from the bank through the ' Mudra ' plan and by bringing some goods from the market started a small work towards sending them back .
In such a situation I noticed that the Government of India has an arrangement of the name of the Servant e - Market Palace .
So I discovered about it , what he is , asked people about it .
Then I myself registered it.
I want to tell the countrymen that if you also get the opportunity , then you also take the meeting of EGIM -LRB- IGM -RRB- on the internet .
Those people who want to send a recognition of anything in the government , want to send small things , want to send electricity bulbs , want to send a dustbin , want to send a newborn , want to send a chair , want to send a table , want to sell , those people can register their name in the site .
In what quality they have , they can keep writing in it , how much they will sell , they can write and the people of the government department will also have to face that size , it will be worth seeing that they do not bind in the quality of the old sending .
And after that they have to give order .
So within E . . . those who get their names registered , they have to see every department of the government .
Because of not being adult in the middle things are found very cheap .
Now this Aurulmozi Medium has registered all those things which could give on this website of the government .
And the fun thing is that the letter they have written me is very interesting .
He has written that one of me got money from ' Mudra ' , my trade started , kept all the information that I can give inside E . . . and what would have been asked to me from the Prime Minister 's Office , he has written that the Prime Minister bought two turmos from me .
And I got my bill of 160 rupees too .
This is power.
This is the power of the country .
There is also transparency in it , there is also efficiency in it , there is also industry support in it .
This is the Government e-market Palace - GEM .
I would definitely want that those people who want to sell their wealth to the government in this way , those people add more to this site .
I believe that this minimum government and Mexicum Government -LRB- at least the most government -RRB- is a wonderful example and what is its goal is at least price and maximum simplicity and transparency .
My loved countrymen , on one side we pride people taking yoga , on the other side there are our achievements in Spass - Science , for this also we feel proud .
And this is the speciality of India that our legs are on the ground connected with yoga , then our dreams are to cross those shortcomings far and wide .
A few days back India has also done a lot of work in sports and science .
Recently two days before Egypt lunched 30 grains of satilitate with cartosate - 2 searies satilit .
And in this satellite, France, Germany, Itli, Japan, Britain, America - almost 14 countries other than India are included.
And with this direct satellite campaign of India we will get a lot of help in the field of agriculture , in the field of cattle , in the field of natural threat .
A few days back , we will all remember that Egypt had successfully lounched that ' GCT-1 ' .
And so far this is the most weighty setlite in the satellite which India has launched .
And the newspapers of our country had compared with the weight of his elephant , then you can imagine how much of our scientists have done in the interior area .
On 1st June one thousand days of ' Mars Mission ' has been completed .
But I am happy that our scientists had the power to fulfil the efforts of our scientists successfully for six months and now even after a thousand days our mungayan machine is working .
The photo is sending , giving information , Santific data is coming , it is working more than its age , even more than its age .
The completion of one thousand days is an important step in our scientific journey , our interior journey .
Even in the field of sports we are seeing that the interest of our youth is increasing .
Now it is seen that along with studies our youth is also showing their future in sports and because of our players , because of their hard work , because of their achievements the name of the country also gets illuminated .
Recently India has increased the value of the country by fascinating its victory in the Bedminton player Kidambi Srikanth in Indonesia Open .
For this achievement I want to read them and their coach from the heart .
T.
There was an opportunity to stay in the inauguration ceremony of the Synthetic Trek for Usha School of Athletics of Ushaji .
Sports - sports play a very important role in the development of personality .
The importance of playing games in the entire personality development is very big .
There is no dearth of immunity in the country .
If children are interested in playing and playing in our family also then they should be given an opportunity to play .
While lifting them from the field , shutting them down in the room , should not be compelled for books , they can also move forward in them , but if they are capable of playing , then school , college , family , nearby people - Everybody should be encouraged , encouraged .
Everyone should have dreams for the next opposite .
Once again the feeling of this Kalkhand is a new experience of my loved countrymen , rains , festivals .
We can never forget the heat of this year .
We are waiting for rainy season .
Today when I am talking to you then the holy month of Ramzan has started .
On the coming of the sacred month of Ramzan I give the people of India and around the world , especially Muslim community , the heartual good wishes of this sacred month .
In Ramzan prayer , spirituality and donation are given great importance .
We are very lucky Indians that our ancestors have formed such a tradition that India can pride this thing today , we can guarantee that all the communities of the world are present in India .
This is such a country in which people who believe in God also stay and people who deny God also stay , people who worship the idol also stay and people who oppose the idol worship also stay .
All kinds of thoughts , every kind of worshipping method , every kind of tradition , we have suicidalized the art of living together and therefore religion , communalism , ideological , tradition , gives us the same message - peace , unity and harmony .
It will be necessary to move forward this path of peace , unity and prosperity of the holy month of Ramzan .
I once again give everyone good wishes .
Last time when I was talking about mon ' I used a word and especially told the young men to do something new , come out of the computer zone .
Take new experiences , and this is the age when life can be lived in this way , can take some risk , can be invited to problems .
I am enjoying that many people have given me adverse effect .
Individually everyone showed me the enthusiasm of telling myself .
Some dramas learn and some people have written that we have started writing poems now .
The habit of reading me was almost lost .
Therefore I decided to read in these holidays .
When I started reading about freedom struggle then I realized how much struggle has to be done to give India freedom , how much sacrifice has to be given , how many freedom fighters have spent years in jail .
I have been very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who has done a lot of things in a very little age.
Therefore I resist you that in this matter give some messages to your generation .
I am happy that young people are interested in knowing about our history , our freedom fighters , those who give sacrifice to this country .
Innumerous great men who spent their youth in Jello , many newborns laughed and laughed .
How many acquaintances he suffered and that is why today we are breathing in independent India .
One thing we must have seen that the great men who spent time in the movement of freedom they did a lot of work of writing , studying and fulfilled the freedom of India .
Many years ago I had gone to Andaman Nicobar .
Cellular Jail had gone to see .
Today the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar is there .
Veer Savarkarji had written the book ' Majhi Janmatha ' in Jail .
They used to write poems, write on the walls.
They were closed in small cottages .
Think about how tortured people who take care of freedom .
When I read Savarkarji 's book ' Mazhi Janmatha ' then I got the inspiration to see the cellular jail from them .
There also runs a lit and sound show ' which is very inspiring .
There is no such state of India , there is no language speaker of India who has not given his youth in this cellular jail in the jail of Andaman for freedom , taking care of black water .
Every language speaker , people of every province , every generation had left the yatras of the British today the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji .
I will definitely tell the youth of the country how many problems people had to face the freedom that we have found , if we see the cellular jail then we will come to know .
After going there only it is known as the decoration of black water . If you also get the opportunity , then this one way that is the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle , you must go there .
My loved countrymen , five June , the first Monday of the month .
The meaning of connecting with Nature is to nutrition the better planet .
And who can call this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi .
Mahatma Gandhiji used to say many times - One most car about a world one will not see.
That is , what we do not want , we guarantee that we also take care of it .
If you have come very tired and open the windows of the room , open the door , fill the fresh air in the breath then a new consciousness comes .
When this body of the five greatभूतs is formed in that contact with the five greatभूतs then self-confidence appears to be a new consciousness in our body - a new energy appears .
We all have done this experience but we do not record it . We do not join it in a corner , in a corner .
After this you must see that when there is contact with natural condition then there will be a new consciousness in you and therefore we should also make our own campaign to connect with nature on 5th June .
And our ancestors are getting some benefit from protecting the environment .
If we protect then our coming generations will get benefit .
In Vedas earth and environment are considered to be the source of strength .
And Arthurveda is the biggest direction - maker of environment in one way and has been written thousands of years ago .
We are said there - motherland : sons of Aham Prithvivaya : It is said in Vedas that the purity among us is due to our earth .
Earth is our mother and we are her sons.
If we recall Lord Buddha then one thing must be revealed that the birth of Mahatma Buddha , the achievement of knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana , the three trees had come down .
But we need to connect it with modern techniques in modern words .
These days I keep getting information from the states .
In almost every state , on the coming of rain a big campaign of trees is going on .
Trees are planted in the number of crores .
My loved countrymen, 21 June, now 21 June has become the world's well known day.
In the form of World Yoga Day the whole world considers it .
In very little time , this world Yoga day of 21st June has spread in every corner , is connecting those people .
On one hand when many powers of dividing in the world are showing their deformed face , in that time yoga is the biggest gift of India to that world .
Through yoga we have joined the world in a message .
Like yoga connects body , mind , intelligence and soul , yoga is also joining the world today .
Today due to lifestyle , due to increasing responsibility , life free of stress is becoming difficult .
And it has been kept in mind that this situation is also coming in people of young age .
While taking medicines and passing days , in such a time Yoga 's role is important for life of stress free .
Yoga is a guarantee for both velanas and fitness .
Yoga is not just exercise.
How to walk under health from body , mind , thought , care - if you have to experience the journey under it then through yoga .
Now just two days before , I have written a letter to all the governments of the world for Yoga day , all the leaders .
Last year I had announced some competitions related to yoga .
Gradually working forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third international yoga day and told me that this time on the third international yoga day three generations of the same family do yoga together .
Grandfather or aunt , grandparent or aunt - aunt , three men should simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously simultaneously .
In the past , if there is such a mixture of today and coming time then yoga will get a new time .
I am blessed for this information and I also feel that as we had run the campaign of Selfie with doctor and had experienced a very interesting experience .
These three pedestrians will sacrifice sacrifice for the country and the world .
I invite you to yourself .
Now we have about three weeks for international yoga weeks .
Start studying -LRB- practice -RRB- .
I will keep pasting something related to yoga everyday from one June to Twitter and keep on pasting till 21 June continuously .
Share with you.
You also propagate , propagate the subject of yoga for three weeks , join the people .
In a similar way this preventive healthcare is only administered .
I invite you all to join it .
Because I got a very interesting phone call, and I didn't even think about it like this.
But the way they caught this thing I am afraid of it .
You will also come to mind from this phone call .
Namasta Modhi, I'm naked, from Mumbai.
Whether it is mumbai or Surat , people have adopted cleanliness in the form of a mission on your desire .
The rubbish which you had picked up from the valleys of Kashi has now taken the form of an instruction by taking your inspiration .
Your thing is true , wherever I go there the government system does the work of cleaning but during these days the festival of cleaning also becomes in the society .
Five days before taking my meeting , seven days before , ten days before , many programs of cleanliness are organized .
Media also gives a lot of importance to such programs . Now I had gone to the Kutch of Gujarat a few days back .
You can imagine how much joy would have occurred on knowing this , and how beautiful the country is also taking care of these things .
During my journey the matter of cleanliness is connected , what could be more happy for me than that
For the welcome of the elderly there will be other preparations to be there but cleanliness will be the main thing .
This is also pleasant for any clean lover , inspiration .
I enjoy every person who helps in the work of cleanliness .
Somebody gave me a suggestion.
However , the information is such that it spreads a little joy .
I don't know if I can do that.
Modiji now before meeting , tell those who want to invite you , if you want to speak to me , then how will the level of cleanliness be
It was very good to think , but I had to think .
However , it is true that it should start the movement that it would be better to give other things in gifts that we should clean up such tons of garbage and give it in gifts .
How many people can we stop getting diseased .
How big work of humanity will be done .
One thing I would like to say suddenly that we should not consider the dogs and garbage which we have , this is a welth , a source .
Do not see it in the form of garbage only .
Along with the help of state governments the Government of India has decided to start a major important campaign of West management with the help of reproductive systems of cities .
On 5th June , on the day of World Environment in about 4 thousand cities of the country there are equipments to gather Solid West and Liquid West .
There will be two types of chapattis available , one of green colors , the other of blue color .
Two types of garbage are dissolved - one liquid vaste and the other dry vaste .
If we stay in superstition , in those four thousand cities where we have to apply kachrapetty , then put dry raisins in blue cheeks and put wet raisins in green kachettis , like the raisins that erupt from the kitchen , the vegetable peels , the bad diet , the eggs or the leaves of the tree are so wet kitchen and put them in the green kachetti .
This entire activity is such that work can be done in the fields . If color of fields is green , then it will be remembered if you have to put some garbage in green cheese .
And the rest of the wastes like , radical paper , cardboard , iron , glass , cloth , plastic , polythene , broken dubba , rubber , dhatu , and many other useless things - all these things are called a kind of dry garbage which have to be recycled by putting in the machine .
Just a few days back you must have heard a message that the Versova Beach considered dirty in Mumbai has become a beautiful clean specimen today .
Its full responsibility was preserved by the Residency Wolntier -LRB- VRV -RRB- .
I read the wishes of Shriman Afroz Shah .
I read this movement very well .
And the way they converted people of all over the region like public transport and converted them into public transport , this is actually an inspiring example .
My dear countrymen , for the last 15 days , months , if there is a print , whether there is a television or a societal mixed , all of these are continuously going on for three years of the present government .
Three years ago you gave me the responsibility of the principal servant .
A lot has happened , a lot of opinion pools have come , I see this process as a very positive signal .
On every episode this 3 year work period has been estimated .
People of every stage of the society have reviewed it .
This is an excellent process in democracy .
I have obviously believed that governments should be responsible in democracy , should give the status of their work to the reproductive organs .
For an aware nation, for an ideological nation, this movement is very important.
My dear countrymen , I am also a common citizen like you and the effect of every thing on me is on me as if on the mind of any common citizen .
But when ' Ki Baat ' sees it as a point of view , some people also make it temporary , but after such a long experience I feel , when I started ' Mon Ki Baat ' then I did not even think that ' Ki Baat ' program would make me a member of every family of India .
It seems as if I sit in the middle of the family and talk home .
And there are hundreds of such families who have sent me to write these things as well .
And as I told you they have an ordinary man, my mind has an impact.
Two days ago in the Rashtrapati Bhavan , the ideal president , the ideal superstar patriotism , the ideal specurer mahoda , man Ki Baat , summed up a relevant book . As a person , as a normal citizen , this incident is going to be very exciting for me .
I am a teacher of Akbar Sahib .
My dear countrymen , now till the time it is found , the rains have come in every corner of the country , the weather must have changed , the results of the tests must have come , the beginning of the newly married life will be done , and along with the coming of rain a new happy environment , new breath will spread .
Come let us all move forward while enjoying nature in this environment .
You all have good wishes from me .
Most of those people who try to reach me are those who actually do something in their life .
For doing something good they are trying according to their intelligence , strength , capacity and situation and when this thing comes to mind then I felt that this information is not normal , it is left out of the numbness of the experience .
I had never thought that today the youth in our country have been doing this work for a long time .
Yes , some social organizations work that we have come to know for years , but the youths of my country are engaged in it then I only knew it .
How many videos have sent me .
There are many such places where roti bank runs .
People combine roti from their side in this roti bank , combine vegetables and are the needy people they also get it from there .
Those who give it also get satisfaction . those who take it also never have to look down .
This example of how work is done with the help of the society .
Today the month of April is ending , the last day is .
On the first day of May the establishment of Gujarat and Maharashtra is the day .
On this occasion the citizens of both the states wish many lucks from me .
Both the states have made every effort to simultaneously improve the new heights of development and have contributed to the progress of the country .
I have a lot of wishes to these two states .
There was a time when ' adventurous change ' was counted as the subject of education and world , it was considered the subject of traditionalism , but today , we also feel it in our daily life and express it suddenly .
Nature has also changed all the rules of sports .
The heat that falls in our country in May-June comes to experience this time in March-April and when I was receiving information about what fate then what should be done to me in this summer only people have given it .
Although all things are popular , it is not new , but even then the time its reconstruction comes very much .
Sriman Prashantkumar Mishra and T.
S.
Many friends like Kartik have expressed concern for birds .
These friends have said that in balcony , water should be kept on the roof and I have seen that small children of the family do this work very good .
Once they should understand why this water should be filled , then they go to see 10 times in that day whether there is water in the utensil which has kept or not and that too the birds have come or have not come .
We have to say that this game is going on , but in recent times it is a unique experience of absorbing concentration in the mind of the child .
You also sometimes see , some such feeling with animals and birds also experiences a new pleasure .
Although in our country animals and birds , things of life with nature , we are colorful in its color , it happens only , but it is necessary to force such efforts on a social basis .
When I was the chief minister in Gujarat then Daudi Vohra Samaj 's religious goddess Syedna Saheb used to take hundred years .
I got a chance to start it .
He had divided the corners of the world about 52 thousand furnaces .
He also got a place in the Guinese Book of World Record .
Sometimes we are so busy that printing , milky , vegetables , any part comes in our courtyard , but we forget that there are days of time , first ask him for a little water .
Young friends , I want to do some things with you as well .
Sometimes I am worried that our youth is enjoyed spending life in Asho-Aram itself .
Parents also take care of them in a protective condition .
I believe some friends will definitely try and tell me too
Do you use this time of vaccine according to my suggestion  I do three suggestions , if you use three of them then it is very good thing , but try to absorb one of the three .
That must be a new experience.
Try to learn new skills .
Never saw , if you do not think , do not know , but even if you want to go there then try to go there .
New places, new experiences, new curiosity.
Sometimes watching something on TV or reading about it in the book or listening to it from the acquaintances and feeling of that thing on its own , there is a difference between them .
I will inspire you to know what you have in this vaccine , use newly .
If you are very positive , even if you are out of a little rest then do it .
We are of middle class family , are of happy family .
I do not say that do it again and again , once again feel it .
It is evening time , taking your football or taking a volleyball or taking any means of sports and sports reach a very poor population .
Walk yourself with those poor kids, you see, you'll get the joy of playing like you've never met before.
And I am confident that if you go once you want to go again and again .
This feeling will teach you a lot.
Many self-confidence organizations continue to work as service .
You are also associated with the guggle guru.
But at the same time you feel as if you have done such camps , you have learned the program of personality development , then you can reach such people who do not get the opportunity to participate in such camps in the society and learn those people who have learned without taking the money .
How can they develop now they can learn .
Every person has become busy elsewhere with technology .
Community is also a culture, socialism is a power.
Today there is a collection of horse riding .
Sometimes it feels scared that our youth machine is not becoming human-robot
Away from technology, trying to spend time with you.
You are learning some musician , you are learning 5-50 verses of any new language , you are , you are , Telugu , you are unsuccessful , Bengali , Malayalam , Gujarati , Marathi or Punjabi .
How many countries are filled with diversity and if you look at then you can find someone learning around us .
You want to learn car driving . Do you ever feel like learning auto rickshaws
Oop psychologists have run but three wheeled cycles , which take people - have done the desire to run sometimes .
Now you will see all these new experiments , this skil is such that will give you enjoyment as well and the life which has been bound in a pair of which he will also bring you out .
Out of Books do something dude.
This is the only time for making life .
And you think that all the tests are completed , if you learn to go to the new level of the carriage then this opportunity will not come .
Later on you will fall into other jerks and therefore I will tell you that if you are fond of learning the magic then learn the magic of the card .
Keep showing magic to your yards .
I am on my experience that by seeing the world we get so much learning and understanding which we can not imagine .
By this you will get to learn a lot .
I would like and it is also true that when you are going , then make me sure about it as well .
Have you seen something new
Where did you go
Use your experiences by using ' Heshtage Incredible India ' .
Friends , this time the Indian government has also given good opportunity for you .
There is a plan of the Government of India .
If Bhima App is downloading up then you will also be using it .
But refer that to the other.
Adjust someone else and that new person does transaction three times , financial work three times , then you get a price of 10 rupees for doing that work .
10 rupees will be collected from the government in your account .
If you have got 200 people given in a day then on getting evening you will get a price of 200 rupees .
Traders can also be earned , students can also be earned .
And this plan is till October 14.
You will have your contribution in making digital India .
You'll become a guardian of New India.
So the vaccination and earnings of vaccination .
He had become a symbol of VIP clutches in a way, but feels that the red light used to look at the vehicle, but he used to smell in the brain and dynamically had a VIP cluture home.
Nowadays the red light has gone , no one can claim that the red light that has been swallowed in the brain must have gone out .
I got a very interesting phone call.
Well , in those phones he has also expressed the possibility but now this phone is estimated by the cell that normal humans do not like these things .
One feels it to be removed by this .
Namaskar became the chief minister , I am speaking Shiva Choubey , from Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh .
I'm asking you to say something about the government's red beacon lift ban.
I read a line in Newspaper in which I wrote, "Every Indian is a VIP on a raad on hearing this, I was very proud and happy that even today my time is equally important.
I do not burst in traffic jam and I do not even stay for anyone .
So I want to give you a lot of harmony from the heart for this decision .
And in the clean India campaign given by this our country is not being cleaned , on our roads the claim of VIP is also being cleared - then that change is the source of an arrangement to go to the red light from the governmental decision .
But with mind also we have to take it out with effort .
If we all try to get out with awakening then we can get out.
Our concept of New India is that the importance of EPI in place of VIP in the country increases.
And when I'm calling EPI instead of VIP, my feeling is clear - Every Person is impotent.
Every person has the importance , every person has the importance .
If we swim the importance of 100 crore countrymen , if we swim the Mahatma of 100 crore countrymen then how big power will be achieved to fulfil the great dreams .
We have to do together .
My dear countrymen , I always say that we keep reminding history , our cultures , our traditions repeatedly .
We get energy from these , we get inspiration .
This year we are convinced of 100 million countrymen saint Ramanujacharya ji 's birth anniversary .
Because of some reason we have become so close , so small that we think of more than a century .
For other countries of the world centuries are very important .
But India is such an ancient nation that we have got the opportunity to celebrate thousands of years and more than thousand years old memories in its cash . How will the society of a thousand years ago be .
How would it happen a thousand years ago
Very few people would know that the evil which was in the society , the feeling of high - low , the feeling of secret and untouchability , was the feeling of communalism , there was a great fight in front of it .
Through their own movement the society which was considered untouchable had swallowed them .
Thousands of years ago he had planned to enter his temple and successfully entered the temple .
How lucky are we that in every age a great man is born from our society to eliminate the evil of our society .
The 1000th birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharyaji is celebrated then there is strength in the organization for social unity - take inspiration from them to achieve that feeling .
The Indian government is also going to relay a stamp in the memory of Saint Ramnujacharya on May 1 .
I bow down to Saint Ramanujacharya very proudly , I offer devotion and rituals .
My loved countrymen , Kale 1 May also has a different importance .
It is also considered as a labor day in many parts of the world .
Labour is discussed... Labourers are discussed... so I remember Baba Saheb Ambadkar that is very natural.
And very few people will know that for the facilities which the workers get today , we are admired to Baba Saheb .
For the welfare of the workers the contribution of Baba Saheb is unforgettable .
Today when I talk to Baba Saheb , then the great saint of 12th century Karnataka and social reformer Jagat Guru Basveshwar ji also remembers .
I had an opportunity to go to a pillar only in time .
This was the occasion of the publicity of the collections of their mutiny .
If you say in other words then hard work is Shiva .
Today when I talk to the workers then it is very natural to remember the patience .
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha full moon.
People associated with Lord Buddha all over the world consider the festival .
The problems which the world is passing through today , competition of violence , war , violence , weapons . .
When this weather is seen then the thoughts of Buddha appear very relevant .
And in India the life of Ashoka is an excellent symbol of the journey of Buddha from war .
My privilege is that on this great festival of Buddha Purnima Vesak Day is celebrated by United Nations .
This year he is going to be in Sri Lanka .
On this sacred festival I will get an opportunity to offer devotion to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka .
You will get an opportunity to refresh their memories .
My loved countrymen , in India always attempts have been made to move ahead with the same mantra .
And especially for our neighbouring countries .
This is an excellent example of our resistance towards South Asia .
On 26th March , 2001 the root of the program of the Chief Minister ' Ki Baat ' on Akashwani .
My loved countrymen , my namaskara with yourself , most of the families in the country will be busy in the examination of their children .
Those whose examinations have been completed they will have some light weather there and where the examination is going on , there will be little concern in those families even now .
But at this time I will say this only that at what time I will listen to what things I have done to the students .
At the time of examination that twist will definitely come into use .
Today is 26 March.
On 26th March is the day of independence of Bangladesh .
A historical fight in front of injustice , unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh in the leadership of Bangkok .
Today on this important day I give a lot of good wishes to the citizens and sisters of Bangladesh to the freedom day and wish that Bangladesh will proceed , develop and I assure the Bangladeshi people , India is a strong partner , a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace , safety and development within the entire region .
We all have the pride of this fact that Ravindranath Tagore , his memories , this is our connected heritage .
The national nationality of Bangladesh is also the construction of Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore .
One very interesting thing about Gurudeva Tagore is that in the year 13 he was the first Asian person of the Nobel Person who received the Nobel Personnel , along with this the British had given him nitrous .
Three days before this , on March 23 , the British had hanged Bhagat Singhji and his partner Sukhdev and Rajguru on the floor and we all know that incident of March 23 - Bhagt Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru had the satisfaction of doing service of Mother Bharti on the face of Rajguru - There was no fear of death .
All dreams of life had honoured Mother India in the sacrifice of freedom .
And these three verses are still inspiration of all of us .
We can not even decorate the story of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev and Rajguru in words .
And the entire British Sultanate was scared of these three youths.
There were closed in jail , Phansi had fixed , but how to move ahead with it also the British were worried about it .
And then it was to be hanged on 24th March, but it was dropped on 23th March.
Fancy was slapped with chicken pox, which is not usually used.
And then by taking their body into today 's Punjab the British had quietly burnt it .
A few years ago when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time then I used to feel a kind of waves on that earth .
And I will definitely tell the young people of the country that whenever you get the opportunity , go to Punjab , definitely go to the place of the samadhi of Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru , Bhagt Singh 's mother and Batukeshwar Datt .
This was the time when the swing of freedom , its rapidity was increasing its expansion .
On one side Veers like Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru had inspired many youths for admiration , then Mahatma Gandhi had performed Champaran Satyagraha on 10th April 11 just a hundred years ago .
This champaran is the year of the centuries of Satyagraha .
In the movement of India 's independence Gandhi Vichar and Gandhi style , its appearance was seen in Champaran for the first time .
In the entire movement journey of freedom this was a big threshold .
Especially from the point of view of the method of research , the truthfulness of Champaran in this period , truthfulness of Kheda , the stirring of millions of people in Ahmedabad , all of them had a great impact on the thought and style of Mahatma Gandhi .
In 15th century Gandhi returned from abroad and in 11th century on going to a small village of Bihar he gave a new inspiration to the country .
Today on the basis of what is the birth of Mahatma Gandhi in our mind we can not imitate Champaran Satyagraha .
Think that one person who returned to India in 15th century only two years of work .
Neither did the country know them , nor did they have any effect , even now it was started .
At that time we can estimate how much hard they have to face , how much work they have to do .
And Champaran Satyagraha was such in which Mahatma Gandhi 's organization Kaushalya , Mahatma Gandhi ' s Indian society can cross the nerves of the Indian society , Mahatma Gandhi ' s introducing , inspiring , inspiring , bringing this miraculous vision to the field for the struggle .
And therefore in this form we feel the strangeness of Mahatma Gandhi .
But if you think about Gandhi a hundred years ago , that championship is a matter of great study for any person who starts the life of the world .
What kind of social life can be started , how much hard work has to be done in itself and what Gandhi did we can learn from them .
And this was the time when we heard the names of the elderly Dighaj leaders , Gandhi had sent them all to the villages at that time Rajendra Babu , Acharya Kripalaniji .
Together with the people , the people who were working had to learn the method of coloring it with the color of freedom .
And the British could not understand what is the methodology of Gandhi , the struggle also goes on , the surgeon also walks and both walk together .
Gandhi knew that he had made a coin on both sides .
On one side of the coins conclude and on the other side the creation .
On one side filling the jail and on the other hand giving homage to yourself in constructive works .
There was a very amazing balance in Gandhi 's work style .
What is true word , what can be uncomfortable , what is unsuccessful in such a big salt . Gandhi of a whole new variety had established by words but by a successful experiment .
The desire for this change of hundreds of millions of countrymen , this is the attempt of this change , this is the only one that will give a strong foundation of new India , New India .
New India is neither a government program nor a switching of any state party nor a project .
This feeling is that hundred crore countrymen together ask how to make a grand India .
There is hope in the minds of hundreds of hundreds of millions of countrymen, there is a joy, a compassion, a desire.
My dear countrymen , if we want to know what is happening around us , we will be surprised to know what is happening around us , if we go away from our lives even a little away from our lives , then the sympathetic people will be surprised to do something for the poor , for the poor , for the poor , for the poor .
And they also do as a dress , as a dress , as a dress .
Many people go to the hospital daily , help the patients .
Many people who know that they run for blood donation immediately .
There are many people who think of their food if someone is hungry .
Our country is very busy .
This mantra is in our blood .
If we once see it in the form of socialism , then we will know how big it is .
When there is talk of New India then it is very natural to see it from the point of view of its vaccination , discouragement , different point of view and it is necessary in the democratic system .
But this thing is true that if the sixteen crore countrymen imagine , determine the way to prove complications , then the dream of New India - 100 crore countrymen can prove to be in front of our eyes .
And it is not necessary that all things happen from budget , from government project or government money only .
If every citizen imagines that I will follow the rules of traffic , if every citizen imagines that I will enjoy my responsibilities with full quantity and determination . If every citizen commends that one day in a week I do not use petrol diesel then how big changes can happen .
The meaning of saying is that every citizen follows his citizen religion , follows rituals .
That itself can become a good beginning of New India .
My beloved countrymen , I seek to accept the glory of today as well .
In the past few days there has been such an environment in our country , in large numbers people have become partners in destitution , digitization movement .
How can Lead God become without obstacles , its curiosity has also increased .
The poor person is also trying to learn and gradually people are also moving forward towards how to trade without stopping .
There has been a lot of increase in the different methods of degital supplementation since vibration , notbandi .
If the beginning of Bhima Ape is so much time has been done only for two and a half months but in recent years about one and a half crore people have downloaded it .
Our loved countrymen , black pearls , we have to go ahead with the fight against corruption , can hundreds of millions of countrymen imagine working for two and a half thousand crore digital labor in a year
We have announced in budget .
If they want this work for 100 crore people then they do not need to wait for one year , they can do it in six months .
Two and a half thousand crore digital ladder , if we have to fill the fixed fees then do not fill the obstacle , we will fill with digital , we will have to travel in the railway , if we want to travel in the airplane then we will buy medicines , we will do dessert if we run the shop of cheap cereals then we will arrange digital arrangements .
We can do these things in everyday life .
You do not imagine but by this you can do a lot of service of the country and you can become a virgin soldier to fight against black pieces , bristles .
In the past several programs of the DGDN fair have been held for public education .
There is a concept of making 100 programs throughout the country .
80-85 programs have been done .
There was also annam plan in it .
About two and a half lakh people have achieved this name of the Grahak .
The name of which 0 thousand people had received for traders .
And everyone has also enjoined this work forward .
And many times as had been decided before and on 14th April the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar has to end the DGDN fair .
After the completion of 100 days one is going to be the last major program .
Many big dresses have also been stored in them .
I am confident that in whatever time the birth date of Babasaheb Ambedkar has been left with us we propagate Bhima Ape .
How to reduce the obstacle behavior , how to reduce the behavior of the noto , in this we give our contribution to it .
I am happy , my countrymen , because every time I want to ask information from people for the sake of mind , then every kind of information comes .
But I have seen that for the subject of cleanliness the people have always been inspired .
I want to talk to you about my mind .
I want to say , people have to understand how important cleanliness is .
I pass through a river everyday in which people throw lots of garbage and pollute the river .
That river flows from near the Rispna bridge and comes to my house .
On going to that river and in many areas many people have also spoken seven things about it , but they have no benefit .
And the best thing is that Gayatri himself is also expressing his anger , is also informing me and alongside he is also telling that he has made many attempts but he got success .
Cleanliness movement has started from Jaira .
Every person has been connecting it positively .
He has also taken the form of a movement .
Resistance towards dirt is also increasing .
Awakening , active partnership , movement all of them have their own importance .
But cleanliness is connected to habits while enjoying .
This movement is an inclination to change habits , this movement is an inclination to create the habit of cleansing .
This movement can happen in a collective way .
Work is difficult but it has to be done.
I am confident that this feeling has been awakened in the new generation of the country , in children , students , youths and this flow is a signal of good results .
Today I will tell all those countrymen who are listening to Gayatri in my mind ' s program that this message of Gayatri should be made a message for all of us .
Since then I have been getting a lot of information on one thing since the beginning and most people have expressed concern about the ruins of food .
We know that we take more food in family and in community meals as well .
Whatever things they see , they take everything in the palm and they can not eat .
We can not eat half of it as much as we fill in the palm and we walk on keeping it there .
You have often thought how much harm we do from the food that we leave .
Have you ever thought that if we do not spoil the food then we can fill the stomach of some poor people .
Someone keeps on making some effort , yet sadness on this subject is a social treachery .
It is connected with the poor .
I do not care much about this but I want to increase awareness .
Their life inspires us that we do not spoil food .
Take as much as we have to eat .
Look , there are such methods for change .
And those people who are aware of body health they always say - keep some stomach empty , keep some plate empty .
We also know the word depression .
One estimate is that more than 35 crore people in the world are suffering from mental depression .
The problem is that there are such people around us but we can not recognize them and maybe we are conscious of talking openly on this subject .
Those who are suffering from depression themselves do not even speak because they themselves feel sadness in this part .
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not such a disease that can not get rid of it .
For this there is a need to increase a psychological environment and the first mantra to come out of it is that instead of the conspression its expression is needed .
Talk to your colleagues , friends , parents , brothers and teachers openly about what you are feeling .
Sometimes one feels loneliness and especially students living in the hospital have more problems .
Family is big , they stay mixed there because of which there is no chance of depression .
In spite of this I want to tell my parents , sometimes you have seen that any member of your daughter or daughter or family is sitting with everyone and he says that I have not been able to go any longer , then he will not come to the table .
You should understand that this is the first leg in the direction of depression .
If he does not like to stay in the group and stays in a single corner then keep in mind that it does not happen .
This is the best way.
And depression itself becomes the cause of mental and physical diseases .
Like , diabetes becomes the victim of all diseases , in such a way depression also ends the ability of our stay , fighting , adventure and taking decisions .
Your friends , your family , your family and your care can stop you from going into depression mixing all these and if you have gone then you can get out of them fast .
Help your mind , divide their happiness and misery , you will feel that the pain inside yourself will end .
If you try to understand their sufferings , do it with care , then a new self-confidence will be born inside you .
By joining other people , doing somebody 's service and doing unsuccessful service your mind will get twelve light .
Although yoga is also the best way to keep mind healthy .
Yoga is very helpful in getting rid of stress , getting rid of pressure and moving towards happiness .
21 June is the International Yoga Day and this is the third year .
You make all the preparations and celebrate yoga festivals in lacs of numbers .
If you have any information about the third international yoga day then send me through mobile application .
Whatever songs and poetry can be prepared about yoga , it should be prepared so that it can be understood easily by people .
But along with work women also have special responsibility .
They also take care of family responsibilities and they also cooperate in the financial responsibilities of the family because of which sometimes their newborn children are often affected .
Then the Government of India has taken a very important decision that these nocritic women have been given 26 weeks by increasing the first 12 weeks of their delivery .
There are only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this regard .
If this happens then these children will become the invaluable name of the country .
The health of mothers will also be maintained and for this it will continue to be an important decision .
Because of which in the estimation of working in the formal sector 16 lac women will have the benefit of this .
The life of all these great men keep inspiring us , and gives us the imagination of New India to be fulfilled .
Two days later , Chaitra Shukal Representative , Year Representation , New Conversion is this new year for all of these good wishes .
After the season of monsoon the snakes will start and the peasants will get the fruit of their hard work this is their best time .
In different parts of the country nine years are produced in different forms .
What is the mind (2nd grade)
Flowers bloom .
Not only flowers but fruits present on the branches of trees appear shining in the sun .
Fruits of summer season can also be seen in the spring .
On the other hand yellow flowers of mustard stop the hope of the peasants .
Flowers of caterpillars indicate the coming of holi .
Amir Khusro has described the weather change moments beautifully .
Amir Khusro has written : If the flowing mustard is blown , the flowering mustard is blown , the flowering , the coyal speaking , the fear and fear when the nature is happy , the weather is beautiful then man also enjoys a lot of joyment of this weather .
Festival of spring panchami , Mahashivratri and Holi glitters the color of happiness in the life of man .
We have to declare Phagun in the atmosphere full of love , brotherhood and humanity last month and we are ready to welcome the new month Chitra .
This is the combination of the monsoon season for two months .
First of all I consider lakhs of citizens of the country to be respected for this fact that whenever I want to ask for the matter of mind then a lot of information comes .
Show Jaal has written me on the Narendra modiapp, that many people are not sympathetic to the Christianity and that's why he said six, I gave some information about 104 neighbourhoods and interceptor measles.
Shobhaji has done you very much pride or the context of the pride of India .
To remove poverty , to escape from diseases , to join the world , to bring knowledge , information , technology - science has increased its place everywhere .
15 February , 2001 is the glorious day of India .
Our scientists have raised India 's glass in front of the world .
And we all know that Christ has successfully completed many unprecedented machines in a few years .
Mars Mission on the Mangal Grah . After the success of sending Mangalyaan , in the last days the Egyptians have made a world science in the field of interior .
And it is also a matter of joy that this is the 38th successful lunch of PSLV .
Not only for Christians but also for the whole of India it is a historical achievement .
This Coast of Egypt has become a strange - unprecedented program for the entire world and the world sent me the success of Indian scientists .
Brothers , this 104 tops of the arm is very important .
Carto sat 2D is the premise of India and it will get a lot of help for the planting of arbon developing arbon development , meping of materials , infrastructure , development .
Especially my kitchen brothers - What kind of water sources are there in the country , how can it be used , what should we take care of , on all these things our new preference cataro sat 2D will help a lot .
As soon as we went to our premise we also gave some temporary sentiments .
He has started his work .
The thing of happiness for us is that the leadership of this entire campaign has been done by our young scientists , our women scientists .
Such a very strong partnership of young and women is a pride of the success of the Egyptians .
I am giving great pleasure to the scientists of Israel from the countrymen .
The less we give all their teams to our scientists .
Shobhaji has asked another question and that is why India has achieved a lot of big achievement in this regard regard regarding the safety of India .
Now there is no big discussion of this thing , but the attention of Bahuji has gone on this important thing .
India has also successfully tested Belistic Interceptor Missile in the field of conservation .
During its test this machine with intraception technology has achieved success by destroying the mistrust mistle at a height of about 100 kilometres from the ground .
This is a very important achievement in the field of safety .
And its speciality is that if even 200 kms away from India also comes to an ideal to attack then this missile will destroy it in an interval only .
As soon as new techniques are required , some new scientific achievement is achieved then we enjoy .
And in the development journey of human life the citizens have played a very big role .
And the special intelligence that keeps reflection does not let the zeal stay in the form of zeal , he also raises questions inside them , finds new zeals , creates new zeals .
And this gynaecology becomes the cause of new discovery .
As far as they can not get the answer , they sit on the leg .
And if we observe the development journey of human life of thousands of years then we can say that there is no complete break of this development journey of human life .
Full rest is impossible .
The efforts of human mind to know the laws of the universe continue continuously .
New science , new technology is produced from them .
And every technology gives birth to a new age of every new science .
My beloved young friends , when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists then many times I have told me in the matter of mind that the attraction towards the science of our youth should increase .
The country needs many scientists .
Today scientists become the reason for a stable change in the life of the generations coming in future .
In the past days Neeti Yoga and the Foreign Ministry of India had planned a very unique kind of competition during the 14th migratory India day .
For social useful researches -LRB- innovation -RRB- was invited .
To identify , to show such researches , to give information to people and to such researches how to work for ordinary people , how to produce organic products , how to use their business and I have seen how important work has been done .
Many times problems also show significance of science for solution .
The rains occurred in Mumbai in the year 2005 , the flood came , the sea also got filled and there was a lot of trouble , confusion came , and whenever any natural fault comes then the first agreement comes to the poor .
Two brothers worked on that part by heart , and they developed the construction of such a house which protects those living in the middle , protects those living in the middle from water , can also be saved from the diseases of water .
And our society also becomes based on technology .
Organisations also become technologically based .
In a way technology is becoming a unique violence of our life .
In the past days there was a lot of importance on digestion .
Gradually people coming out of the blocks are moving towards the DGD movement .
In India also taking digital is increasing rapidly .
Especially young people have started having the habit of doing digital payment from their mobile phones .
I consider it a good news .
In the past days in our country the Lucky Grahak scheme DGDM business plan has got a lot of support .
About two months have passed . 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day .
And one of these two plans has welcomed the entire country in the first way of making Dessert Building a population in India .
And the interesting thing is that till now ten lakh people have got the award under the DGDN scheme , more than fifty thousand traders have got the award and more than one and a half hundred crore rupees have been found in this name , the people who carried forward this great campaign .
Under this plan most of the grocers are such who have got the award of one lakh rupees .
There are more than four thousand traders who have got the reward of fifty fifty thousand rupees .
Whether it is a trader , a small businessman , a businessman , a householder , a student , all participate in this plan with enthusiasm .
From Mysore Shriman Santoshji has written Harshafully on Narendra Modi app that he got the name of one thousand rupees under the Lucky Grahak scheme .
But he has written the biggest thing that I should tell you .
He said , I got a thousand rupees and at that time I came to know that there was a fire in a poor old woman 's house .
When the luggage was burnt then I felt that on the name I got , perhaps this poor old mother had a hook on him , then I gave him a thousand rupees .
You did a lot of inspiring work.
All the descendants keep giving knowledge of this digital all the time .
They keep talking with so much enthusiasm , encourage others as well .
I will resist the people of the country , especially the youth of the country and the people of this Lucky Grahak plan either the name of the DGP business plan they have received , that you have made it a messenger by yourself .
You move it forward and that work is one way anti-corruption worker .
One way you are a soldier of militarism.
You know , when the Lucky Grahak plan is completed for 100 days then on 14th April Dr .
It's a memorable day.
On 14th April the print of a huge crores of rupees will be drawn .
Now there are about forty-five days left .
Can you do one thing after remembering Babasaheb Ambedkar
Nowadays Babasaheb went to the 125th Jayanthi of Ambedkar .
While remembering them you should learn at least 125 people doing Bhima App download .
How does Lead God happen from it , learn it and especially to learn the small traders around you .
This time Babasaheb Ambedkar 's jyanti and Bhima Ape give him special importance , so I would like to say , Dr .
For the last two - three months this has just been going on , many townships , many villages , many cities have achieved great success .
--- my loved countrymen , there is a big contribution of agriculture in the root of our country 's economy .
The economic strength of the village gives strength to the economic activity of the country .
I want to tell you a lot of happiness today .
Our rich brother-in-law has made a lot of food by doing hard work .
Due to the hard work of the peasants in our country this year the production of record food has been done .
Every signal is saying that our casualties have broken all the old records .
In the fields this time there is such a passion that it seemed as if Pongal and Baisakhi are today .
This year more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food have been produced in the country .
This is also 8 percent more than the last record that has been registered in the name of our companions .
So it's a wonderful proven.
I specially want to thank the peasants of the country .
I also ask to compensate the peasants for this reason that keeping in mind the poor of the country along with traditional crops they also make use of different pulses because the poor get the maximum protein from the pulses .
I am happy that the peasants of my country listened to the voices of the poor and approximately two lakh hectares of land have spent various pulses .
This is not only the product of pulses but also the biggest service for the poor of my country done by the peasants .
One of my prayers , for the way my country ' s comrades sat down and produced records , my compassionate brother-in-law is eligible for this .
My countrymen , this is something going on in our country by the government , society , institutions , organizations , by every people towards cleanliness .
In one way everyone is seen doing awakening behavior in relation to cleanliness in some way .
And in the Barangal of Telangana state not only in closed rooms but what is the importance of the work of direct cleaning , it was to be used .
On February 1-18, the Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organized in Hyderabad.
It was cleaned by empty toilet pits of six houses and the officers themselves showed that the twin pit toilet can be used by emptying the tubes that are not used .
He also showed how convenient the toilet of the new technique and there is no discomfort about cleaning it , no hesitation occurs , which is psychological brier , that also does not stop .
And we also clean normally , in the same way we can clean a toilet tubectomy .
And the result of this effort came that through the medium of the country publicity of its care , gave it importance and it is natural that when an IAS officer cleans the bay of toilet himself then it is natural to take care of the country towards it .
And those who are cleaning the Toilet Pit from which we consider it as garbage , but if we see from the point of view of sweets then it is equal to a black gold .
We can see what's going on from Waste.
And this has been proven.
For the family of six members a standaard Twin Pit Toilet, that delay is filled in about five years.
After that by removing the garbage easily redirection can be done in another pit .
In six to twelve months the garbage accumulated in the pit becomes completely decomposed .
This decomposed waste is very safe in handle and the most important fertilizer from the point of view of fertilizer.
The merchants are very well aware of the ENPK.
And now there is a special program of cleanliness in television .
The more such things in them will be as much benefit as possible .
Different departments also consider cleanliness in the government .
In the first fortnight of March , the Ministry of Women and Child Development along with them tribe development ministry - Tribal Affairs Ministry will speed up this cleaning campaign.
And in the second Pakwadia of March, more than two ministries, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, will also pursue the last two weeks of purification campaign in March.
We know that whenever any poor citizen of our country does something good then the whole country feels a new energy , self-confidence increases .
We all welcomed this exhibition which our Divyang players performed in Rayo paralympics .
In the Final of Blind HT-20 World Cup organised in this month India defeated Pakistan and increased the glory of the country for the second time as a world champion .
This Divyaang of our country is proud of the achievements of the partners .
I often believe that Divyang is the patience of brother and sister , is strong , is adventurous , compassionate .
Every time we get something to be screaming from them .
Whether it is of sports or intimate science , women of our country are not behind anyone .
The country is moving forward gathering on foot and with their achievements the name of the country is illuminating .
In the past few days, our female players in Asia Ruggy Sevens Trophy won Silver Medal.
He's very fond of me every player.
On 8th March the whole world lady celebrates the day .
In India also giving importance to children and increasing awareness towards them in family and society , concentration increases .
This movement is going forward very fast .
Today this is not just a government program , it has become a campaign of social research , public education .
During the last two years this program has joined the common people .
In every corner of the country this flame has forced people to think and the old methods going on for years have brought changes in the thoughts of every people .
When this information is received that the festival was celebrated on the birth of the child then there is a lot of joy .
In one way positive thinking towards children is becoming the cause of social selfishness .
I have heard that under a special campaign in the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu state a ban has been imposed on child sex .
Nowadays more than 15 children and children have been stopped .
The district administration has opened the binoculars of more than 55-60 thousand children under the certain prosperity plan .
Under the Convergence Model in the Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir all the departments have been included in the Betty Savings - Betty Model Scheme and along with the organisation of rural areas , efforts are being made to ensure their shares by the district administration .
Under the ' Hahar Distak ' program in Madhya Pradesh a campaign is being run for the reading of children at home and at home .
Rajasthan has run a campaign to inspire the children who had been drop out of the children by running their children 's children 's children 's children 's children 's children 's children 's children 's children 's children 's children 's drops ' in school again and again .
The meaning of saying is that ' Betty Save - Betty ' has adopted this movement in many ways .
The entire movement is made of mass movement .
New imaginations are associated with it .
It has been descended according to local needs .
I think it's a good mark... when we're six to celebrate the women's day on March 8, we have the same feeling.
The woman is that power , powerful , she is the woman of India , neither at least , she is the officer of equality in everyone , my loved countrymen , you get an opportunity to do something in the mind at different times .
I know a lot from your side .
What is going on on the earth , what is going on in the mind of the village , the poor reaches me .
I am very happy to change your contribution .
Man Ki Baat, August 201
In the past many festivals have been celebrated .
Now in Gaikal only the Sri Krishna birth festival was celebrated in the entire Hindustan .
And every person can discover the present problems from the life of Sri Krishna .
Sometimes picking up the strips i . . one feels a newness in every matter .
And so, today, when I'm talking to you, I'm gonna pay attention to two moments.
In the situation of that time even thousands of years before Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohammad had used his intelligence , his capabilities , his capabilities , his thoughts .
And Charkhadari also chose a way like this , for the consciousness of humans for freedom , to get strength from the fundamental elements of personality , gave such a form to the jungle of freedom , which is astonishing for the whole world , is still surprised .
If there is importance of unconscious service , knowledge is important , or there is also an important importance of laughing in the middle of all the ups and downs in life , all this we can learn from the message of Lord Shri Krishna .
Today when we are discussing festivals then India is engaged in preparing for a big festival .
And not only India , it is being discussed worldwide .
My great countrymen, I am talking about Mahatma Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary.
Who gave a new turn to human history , established new Vikrams .
One thing has always been associated with Mahatma Gandhi , in one way he is becoming a part of his life .
Whenever anyone went , Mahatma Gandhi was always present for service whenever needed .
He not only gave importance to the service but also gave so much weight on the self-confidence associated with it .
From the life of father we can understand this very well .
For Mahatma Gandhi the humanity , society , humanity and humanity were the same world .
Then whether it is Finiks Forum in Africa or Tolstoy Forum , Sabarmati Ashram , or Vardha Ashram . He put special emphasis on social development , community activity in all places .
I am very lucky here that I have got a chance to bow down on going to many important places associated with worshipper Mahatma Gandhi .
I can say that Gandhi had also emphasized the organization with the help of service .
Social service and social reform, community service and community society are such imaginations that we can also bring down in our prone life.
Actually , this is the true faithfulness of Mahatma Gandhi , the truth is Karmajli .
Not the countrymen.
And socialism has its own strength .
In all these programs of Gandhi Sadhishwadi there are also community and service .
Why don't we get out of the whole glance together
If we have a team of football then the team of football , the football will play , but along with Gandhi will also do the job of service according to the ideals .
You can do a lot , divide old books together in the poor , spread knowledge .
And I believe, perhaps 130 crore countrymen have 130 million imaginations, could become 130 million adventures.
Just be honest , honest , sensible and served with complete dedication and that too is done for free comfort , an unprecedented joy .
My great countrymen , a few months ago I had gone to Gujarat .
The truthfulness of salt in the freedom struggle , dandruff is that very important turning point .
I inaugurated an extremely modern museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi of Dandi .
My father is inclined to take a meeting of somewhere associated with Mahatma Gandhi in this village too .
It might be anywhere.
Whether there is Porbandar , Sabarmati Ashram , Vardhana Ashram or is connected with Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi .
And write two or four words while expressing your feelings along with it .
Many programs , competitions , exhibitions have also been organised in this rural period .
But in this context one thing is very interesting , which I want to divide with you .
There is a well known art program named Venice Bienal which collects artists from all over the world .
This time a very interesting exhibition associated with Gandhiji 's memories has been kept in the Indian Pavilion of Venice Bienal .
Among these the carvings of Haripura were specially interesting .
You will remember that the conference of Congress was found in Haripura of Gujarat , where Subhas Chandra Bose 's teachers were elected , the incident is also included in history .
Gandhiji wanted to show the lifestyle of people living in India through art and exhibition of their art work is organised .
This is the same Nandal Bose whose artworks increase the splendor of our detention .
It gives a new identity to baldness .
And along with the decoration of their art equipments Nandal Bose has also made Amar .
Nandal Bhoj made some art paintings showing the life of rural India after taking the meeting of the villages nearby Haripura .
There was a lot of discussion in the Venice of Anamol artists .
The 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji again with the wishes of all the Hindustanis I possibly hope to communicate something or the other .
For the country, for the society, something must be done for any crossing.
And that child will be a good , primarily functional , dreams of Mother Bharti , you will remember that in the last few years we run the same service campaign in the country for nearly two weeks before October .
This time this campaign will start from 11th September .
During the expedition we will offer work to Mahatma Gandhi through serving out of the house of our parents .
By taking home or street , chowk or tube , school , college I will run a great care of cleanliness at all the public places .
This time special emphasis has been given on plastic .
Similarly we have to use plastic coming together once in a day .
This time on the second October when the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu is celebrated then on that occasion we will dedicate them to India free from excavation , along with that day I will also put a new public movement against plastic in the entire country .
I appeal to all the classes of the society , every village , living in small and big cities , by joining two hands pray that this year we will bring Gandhi Jayanti in a way this Bharat Mata to be freed from plastic waste .
Use 2 October as a special day .
On the day of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti a festival of special hard work is formed .
All the municipalities of the country , municipal corporations , district - urban system , rural panchayats , government - non-governmental systems , all organizations , together citizens , everyone is against me , whether proper arrangements are made for collection and storage of plastic wastes .
I also offer the copper area that when all this plastic waste is collected then they come forward for proper identification , arrangements for sale are made .
It can be chemicalized .
From this burning sensation can be made .
This way we can also fulfil the work of safe drainage of plastic waste till this day .
Just need complications .
There is no need to see the best for inspiration .
What else can be the inspiration from Gandhi
My exclusive countrymen, our Sanskrit is the duties of knowledge in one way.
Whatever we need in life can be found from them .
Nowadays my contact with them has decreased .
But I had a lot of contact before.
Today I want to touch a very important thing with a cultured goodwill.
And that is the words written centuries ago but how important it is even today
There is an excellent well - informed and he has said : Trini Ratnani , Jalam Annam , Subhasitham , Mudhai : Patharakhandesh Ratna , Ratna , etc . are the three rituals of water , food and well - known in the earth .
The foolish stone is called Ratna .
In our culture there is a lot of honeymoon of food .
Till now , but the knowledge of food has also changed into science .
Balanced and nutritious diet is important for all of us especially for women and newborn children , because these people have found the future of our society .
People are fighting in front of dogs in new and interesting ways .
Once a thing was brought in my mind.
In Nasik the whole of Dhani has become a big movement .
In these in the days of the complications of the sin , anganwadi workers collect cereals .
This cereal is used fresh food for children and women .
The person donating in it becomes awakening citizen , social worker in a way .
After that he also dedicates himself for this purpose and becomes a soldier of this movement .
We all have heard about food and prashan culture in the corners of India .
When the child starts feeding fixed diet for the first time then this process is done .
This is a very beautiful initiative which can be adopted anyway .
In many states people run third diet campaign .
If someone has a birthday , a good day , a memory day , then the members of that family go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food , tasty food , go to school and the members of the family themselves drink children , eat , share their happiness , and increase happiness .
The magnificent union of service and joy can be seen .
partners , there are many such things by which our country can fight an effective fight against malnutrition .
Today due to lack of awareness poor people are also suffering from malnutrition and happy , both kinds of families .
The entire country will be considered as a nutrition campaign of September .
But I have joined the youth of the world . I did not even think that in the hearts of our country and the youth of the world I would become such a place .
I did not even think of how many kinds of things the youth of our country and the world pay attention to .
I never thought that there would be any chance in my life to touch the young buffaloes around the world .
And it seems like - I went to Bhutan last week .
I have seen that as prime minister I have got any chance to go from Jayar , and due to international yoga day the situation has become such that if someone meets and sits in the world then some five-seven minutes takes a challenge with me about yoga .
Discovery has organised this program in 165 countries in their language .
Today when a world heritage is going on in relation to environment , global warming , adventure change . I hope that this program will help me a lot of adventurously in the message of India , the tradition of India , the sensitivity of nature towards the culture journey of India , this episode of the discovery channel to introduce the world from all these things .
And in our country people now want to know about the steps taken in the direction of adventurous efforts and clean environment .
But one more interesting thing is this also , which some people ask me with sympathy as well that Modhiji said that , if you used to call Hindi and Bir Greeces did not know Hindi , then how would it happen to you so fast .
Or later, it has been admitted.
He asks very carefully .
Go, there's no secret in it.
If there is this question in many people 's mind then I declare that myself .
If you see then that is not the secret .
The fact is that in the conversation with beer grills technology has been used immensely .
Satho Saath used to be linguistic and a small cordless equipment was put in the ears of Bear Greece so that it used to be included in English .
Although I used to speak Hindi , but it used to be associated with English , and with this the discussion became more simple and this is the same thing of technology .
After this show a lot of people have seen me discussing Jim Corbett National Park .
You must also go to places related to nature and wildlife nature and other creatures .
I have said before and where do I tell you loudly .
The world inside you will expand .
From 15th August on the Red Fort I had warned everyone that in the last 3 years at least 15 places of India would go to meet .
That too go to such 15 places for 10 percent tourism , see , study , take family , spend some time there .
This diversity will also fill you with diversity from inside as a teacher .
Your life will be expanded.
Your thinking will be broad.
And keep in mind that there are such places inside India from where you will come together with new surprising , new enthusiasm , new joy , new inspiration .
Your family will also mind .
My great countrymen , in India the care and concern of environment is found naturally .
Last month I had admired to declare the settlement of tigers in the country .
Do you know how many tigers are in India
A sympathy was taken while expressing concern about the decreasing settlement of tigers in the world .
This imagination was to double the number of tigers in the world till 2022 .
But this is India that we direct the goal quickly .
In 2001 we finished the settlement of tigers there .
Not only the settlement of tigers in India but also the number of reserved areas and community reserved places has increased .
When I was proclaiming the settlement of the tiger then I also remember the lions of Gujarat .
When I had taken charge of the chief minister there the residence of lions in the jungle of Gir was contracting .
Their number was decreasing.
We filled one step after another in the guerrilla .
In 200 it was decided to take care of women 's guards there .
To increase tourism storage reforms have been done .
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife then only we talk about protection .
But now we have to think about the compassion of compassion on moving ahead of your conservation .
In this matter we have found a very good guidance in our sciences .
Who can forget this historical declaration of Swami Vivekanandji of my elder countrymen , September 11 , 183
Those young sannyasis of India , which fascinates the human species of the whole world , had left India 's interesting identity in the world .
Swami Vivekanandaji had seen the form of India , Swami Vivekanandaji had known the potential of India , come , let us make it alive .
There is everything inside us . get out with self-confidence .
My great countrymen , you will remember everybody . 2 August is considered as the national holiday day .
On this occasion we have to start fit India Movement - Church India hubs all over the country .
My great countrymen, I'll wait for you, 2 August, in Feat India, in the month of September, and especially in the nurturing campaign from 1st September to 2th October, and for completely dedicated platic liberty.
Let's get out with a new funny, new complication, new energy.
My loved countrymen, as much as that of the mind today.
I'll get it again.
I'll wait for your words, your suggestions.
Come , let us all come out together to make India the dreams of freedom fighters , to fulfill the dreams of Gandhi . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Namaskar.
On 26 January , we all celebrated our calculation day with joy and enthusiasm in every corner of the country .
I hope that at all levels , at all times , at all times , as much importance is given to the superintendents , equal importance should also be found .
On both the sides of excess and taxation only the car of the democratic system of India can move forward at a full speed .
Kale is 30 January , our worship is the death anniversary of Bapu .
On 30 January we give devotion to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country keeping quiet for 21 minutes .
In the form of a society , as a country , on 30th January , 21st minute of devotion should be a simple feeling .
Whether it is 2 minutes but it should also be expressed in respect to socialism , imagination and martyrdom .
In our country a simple sympathy towards the army , security forces continues to appear .
In the eastern evening of this guidance day I am enjoying those virgins who have been honored with different gallantry priests and their family members .
There are many classes like Kirti Chakra , Shaurya Chakra , Param Vishishay Kshetra Medal , Vishishay Kshetra Medal .
I specially want to inspire young men.
Can you do one thing  This time the verses who have received this honor - search on the up net , write two good verses related to it and spread it in your partner .
When we know about their adventure , virtue , magnificently then we also get surprised , glory also occurs and inspiration is also available .
On one side we were happy with the joy and enthusiasm of all 26 January , then at that time the people of our army who were engaged in the service of our country in Kashmir got virginity due to snowfall .
I read respectfully to every virgin god , bow down .
My young friends , your father knows very well that I am constantly doing something .
January - February - March - April , all these months are months of Kasauti for every family .
There is an examination of one or two children at home but the whole family is subject to the burden of examination .
So I realized that this is the right time that I talked to the students , talking to their boys , talking to their teachers because I went where I got it for many years , testing was found to be a cause of a very big problem .
Families are seen to be troubled , students are troubled , teachers are troubled , in every house a unique psychological environment is seen .
And I always feel like going out of it and that is why I want to talk to young friends in some area today .
When I have announced this thing , many teachers , adults , students sent me messages , sent questions , also told me about problems , and after seeing this I thought in my mind , which I want to talk to you today .
I got a telephonic message of the creation .
So I ask you so much that this atmosphere can not be happy .
The question has been asked by the world but this question will be in the minds of everyone .
Testing should be an opportunity of happiness on its own .
The whole year has worked , which the time has come to show , should be such a festival of excitement and enthusiasm .
There are very few people for whom examination is that happy , then examination for most people is a pressure .
Decision is to be given that you will consider it happy or you will consider pressure .
Whatever happiness you want, it will get and the pressure you want will sink.
And therefore I believe that examination is a festival , take tests in such a way that whatever festival is there and when festival is there , then what is best in us comes out .
The feeling of strength of the society also happens during the festival itself .
Which is better than that appears . Normally we feel so grievous how much we are , but if we see the arrangement of the 40-45-day Kumbh fair then it is considered that the Make Shift Arrangement and what is the rest of the people
This festival has the power .
At the time of examination also in the entire family , in friends a festival should be made in neighborhood .
Now let us see that this pressure will turn into happiness .
Funny weather will make it free of weight .
And here I ask my parents to say carefully that now make the environment of this festival for three - four months .
It is the responsibility of all of us that every year we understand these three-four months in our way , considering our tradition , changing the environment of our family to the festival .
And so I'll tell you that Smile More, Score More.
It must have been seen that when you're happy, you've seen yourself relaxed... and you're simply relaxed and when you're at Relax, you're gonna remember your years old things too easily.
What the teacher had said in the advanced classroom for one year will remember the entire scene .
And you should know that the power to recall memory is the most in Relaxation .
If you are in tension then every door closes , does not go inside and does not come out .
The thought process stops, which becomes a boss on its own.
It has also been seen in the test that you remember everything . Chopudi recalls , the subject recalls , the chromosome recalls , it is written upwards in the ears that it is also recalled towards the lower side .
Why didn't you remember inside, there was pressure.
But the inside which he came out immediately and came out that you got Relaxed .
And that's why Memory Recall is the biggest medicine if there is any medicine then it is Relaxation.
And this I say on the basis of self-confidence that if there is pressure then we forget our things and if there is Relax then we have never even imagined and suddenly such things come to mind which comes very useful .
And it is not that you do not have knowledge , it is not that you do not have information , it is also not that you did not work .
But when tension occurs then your knowledge , your information gets over and your tension gets over it .
And so it is necessary that A Happy Mind is that secure for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it also appears that we can not see tests in true perspective .
It seems as if it is a question of life-loss .
The examination which you are going to give is the test of what you have learned about the whole year .
That's not the story of your life.
How do you live , how you are living life , how you want to live , do not test it .
In your life , apart from the tests given by the noatbook in the classroom there must have been a chance of passing through many stories .
And therefore with the success and inadequacies of life somebody has to take tests and get rid of such burdens .
In front of all of us, our former president.
That.
Which.
Abdul Kalamji is a very inspiring example .
Some rice Anandji has sent me a question : Today if I see the biggest situation in front of the education in this time then it is that education test has become centered .
Property has become the most important .
Due to this resistance has increased even more , along with this stress has also increased in students .
So seeking to know your thoughts about this current direction of education and its future .
Although they have given their own answers , but Richaji wants me to present my thing here as well .
There is a lot of limited use of marx and marksheat .
Not all that happens in life .
Life walks on how much knowledge you have achieved .
Whether you have tried to live with what you have seen or not life goes on on it .
You've got the sense of mission, which is your life of ambitian, is getting something between your mission and ambition or not.
If you trust in such things then the marx swing will come behind you , you will not need to escape behind the marx .
Knowing of yourself will come in life , efficiency will work , self-confidence will come out , imagination will work .
Tell me yourself that there will be any doctor from your family and every family member must go to it who is a family doctor .
There is none of you who has asked his family doctor , how many qualities he had passed .
Nobody asked.
Just , you feel that brother is very good as a doctor , you are benefiting and start taking their services .
If you go to a lawyer to fight a bigger case then do you see the markshiat of that lawyer
Now we see its experience , its knowledge and its successful journey .
And that is why the quality which is the weight of these sometimes stops us going towards the right direction .
But it does not mean that I don't just want to read.
It is necessary to use it for our cattle .
I was dead and I need to know where I am today.
Sometimes this happens and if you look at your own life closely then you will come to mind that if you fall behind the properties then you will find a tiny way in the tincture , you will catch some favorite things and focus on it only .
But if you focus on quality then gradually you are contracting yourself and you limit yourself to a certain area only to get the mark .
So it may be that in spite of being honeymoon in examination sometimes becomes incapable of life .
Richaji has also said one thing - competition .
This is a very big psychological war .
Actually , competitiveness does not work to move ahead of life . compulsion comes to the forefront of life , and when I ask for compulsion then its meaning is to fight with you .
How is the time coming from the time of time better
One speciality of the life of most of the successful players is that they compete .
We take the example of Shriman Sachin Tandulkarji only .
When you are going to test friends everywhere in life then think , if you are able to read peacefully for two hours then you can read three hours .
Mr. S.
Beautiful ji has expressed his feeling about the role of the volunteers .
They have to say that role of players in examination is very important .
He has written more . My mother did not listen to me , yet she used to sit near me and ask me to count me .
Because the mothers are aware of the future of the children in the house , they make things very easy .
Once you will learn to accept it then most of the problems will end there .
Every girl felt that she would have felt.
In comparison to girls , teachers it is found in the root of the problem .
Acceptance opens the way to solve problems .
Property makes the wait difficult .
By accepting the situation there is a chance of opening new ways .
And therefore accept what is it .
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not ask any question about his health after coming there .
As soon as you sit, and come, what is the situation there, how is the disease, do not talk like that.
The teachers started listening and in the first two-four minutes only made the environment light .
On going to the sick person many times we drive him from the disease .
I will tell the girls , sometimes we do this with the children as well .
Have we ever felt that in the days of examination the children should give the environment of laughter and happiness
You see, the weather will change.
I have come to the phone cell of a lotus .
Namaskara , Vadrapadhanashree , I can not call my name because I did something like this in my childhood .
And when I tried to pass by imitating , I also got caught in it and because of me many friends around me suffered a lot , your point is true .
You must have heard it many times, don't steal.
I also repeat this thing to you .
Once if the habit of chicken is fallen then there is no desire to learn anything in life .
Then where can you reach
His entire creativity , so much time if you read in the preparation of examination then probably you do not need the copy .
My first question is whether we can reduce the stress that arises during our examination and my second question is this that why does not we feel lighter than this
If you have to develop all the way then life is also outside the books and it is very big .
This is the time to live , learn it also .
Somebody says I'll first pass all these tests, then remie.
So that's impossible.
So the rest of the body parts should also get physical activity .
Have you ever thought that when all this is in front then take two moments out and look towards the sky , look towards the slight trees - plants , make some mind light .
You see, with a freshness, you'll come back in your room, in your books.
Keep what you are doing for a while , stand up , go out , go to the kitchen , find what you like . If you get an emotional biscuit then eat .
Whether it is just five minutes , take some break .
There is no need to stay closed in any room to take deep breath .
Go below the open sky , walk on the angle , after breathing for five minutes sit to read again .
You will feel that the body will become very light and the body will become light , it will also make the brain light .
Some people feel that they will wake up late at night - I will read more and more , not .
Definitely take as much sleep as the body needs .
It'll be fresh.
There will be a lot of increase in your functionality .
When I sit at the time of switching then sometimes my throat sits .
I came to see a folk song.
He came and asked me . How long are you sleeping
He gave me a jadibut.
So really , if we understand the importance of these things then we will get benefits , you see .
But this does not mean that staying just asleep .
Do not do this otherwise the people of your family will be disappointed with me .
And on the day your marksheet comes, you'll not see them, I'll see them.
(This person is a very big medicine to keep mind, intelligence, body aware.
But at the same time I will also tell you , do not let what I have told you to become a burden .
So as I give advice to your family - grandparents not to become fools , I also feel that thing .
Remembering your imagination go for testing keeping in mind yourself .
I have many good wishes.
To get off from every cassette make a sword , festival .
Then there will never be a scarcity.
Take this mantra forward .
Preferred national residents , February , 2001 are finishing forty years on that Indian coast guard .
On this occasion I give thanks to all the officers and visitors of Coast Garden for their service towards the nation .
It is a matter of pride that Coast Guard has made its place among all its 126 ships and 62 flights built in the country among the four largest coast guards of the world .
Last year along with their responsibilities the people of Coast Garden had also made a big campaign to clean the sea shore of our country and thousands of people had joined it .
And very little people will know that in our country not only men but women are also keeping their responsibilities in the same way by mixing their shoulders .
Coast Garden is also like our female officer pilot , observer , not only does the horror craft also take care .
Today when a matter of importance is made in the whole world , then on the forty years of Indian Coast Guard engaged in the cultural security of India I give them a lot of enjoyment .
On 1 February is the festival of spring fifteenth .
The spring has got approval in the form of the best season .
There is a queen of spring seasons .
It is considered the opportunity of worshipping the identities .
Not only this , there is also a festival of inspiration for the Veers .
Mara color the busty square - this is the inspiration .
On this sacred festival of spring fifteenth my countrymen have a lot of good wishes .
In my favorite countrymen , in the matter of mind the skyscrapers also always fill new forms with their imagination .
Since last month he has started listening to the matter of mind immediately after the fulfillment of my mind .
They have received extensive acceptance .
People from far off places are writing the papers .
I am giving a lot of enjoyment to the skywater for the work done by its own inspiration .
My patriots , Namaskara -LRB- Pranamas -RRB- , all of you have the best wishes of Christmas .
Today i . . in life there is an opportunity to give importance to service , sacrifice and sacrifice in our life .
Prabhu Isu had said that the poor did not give us favour , we want to accept that the Lord Isu has not only served the poor but also explained the services made by the poor , it is the real efficiency of this fact -LRB- generally , real -RRB- .
There is a story associated with it which is very popular .
It is said in Warta that Lord Isu was standing near the treasure of a temple .
Many people came there and they donated adult donation .
After that a poor widow came and he gave two copper copper coins in the form of donation .
If you go to see then two copper coins do not say that very big donation .
It is a very natural fact that the devotees present there are evil in their minds .
Then Prabhu Isu said that this woman has donated most because all other people have donated much in donor but this woman has offered her all the donors .
Today on 25 December , the birth anniversary of Mahamahim Madan Mohammad Malviyaji is also there .
Malviyaji brought awareness of imagination and self-confidence in Indian people gave a new direction to modern education .
Just two days back , I got an opportunity to start many development works in the penance ground of Malviyaji in Banaras .
In BHU , Mahamahim Madan Mohammad Malviya Cancer Centre has done the Khatmukhurta -LRB- Bhumi Poojan -RRB- in Mythransi .
This cancer center is being constructed in the entire area not only for the people of the eastern states but also for the people of Jharkhand - Bihar .
Today the birth day of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Dadaraniya Atal Bihari Vajpayee is also there .
This country can never forget the contribution of Atalji .
In their leadership we gave peace to the country by gaining facilitation in the field of perimeter energy .
The leader of the party or member of Parliament , minister or chief minister , Atalji has established an idealist in every role .
On the day of the birth of Atalji I worship him and pray to God for his good health .
I got the privilege of working with Atalji as a worker .
Many memories are swimming in front of them .
Today on the day of Christmas , in the form of gift , the countrymen have to get the benefit of two plans .
Otherwise for the countrymen two new schemes are going to start .
Whether the whole country , whether it is a village or a city , trained or uneducated , what is the casualties , how can the casualties trade run , how can it be bought without money -LRB- cass -RRB- - the atmosphere of science is spread all around .
Everybody asks to learn and learn from each other .
To encourage this thing , Mobile banking is becoming stronger , to make the habit of e - payment , two new encouraging schemes are going to start from today from the Government of India , for the customers and for small traders .
To encourage one plan carrier - the Lucky Grahak plan and the other plan plan to encourage traders - the Digidhan trade plan.
Today as a gift of Christmas on 25th December , fifteen thousand people will get the name from the Drocystem and that will be filled in the account of ten thousand people as a reward of one thousand rupees and this gift is not just a sufficient limit today , this plan will start from today to the next 10 days .
Everyday fifteen thousand people will get a reward of one thousand rupees .
In 100 days , lakhs of families have to get a gift of crores of rupees but this name will become a hazardous subject when you will use mobile banking , e-banking , rupe card , UPI , USSD -LRB- USSD -RRB- - the methods of digital cyclone and it will be dried on its basis .
Together with this there will be big drosses in a week , in which the name of the name will also be of lacs and after three months , on 14th April .
Baba Saheb Ambadkar is the birth anniversary , then there will be a bumper dro , in which the names of crores will be there .
The Digidhan Trade Plan is mainly for traders.
Traders themselves join this plan and also join the grahikas for making their trade as cashless .
Such traders will also be given different names and this name will be in thousands of numbers .
Traders will also have their own trade and they will also get the love of the award .
This plan has been made by keeping every section of the society , especially the general poor and the lower middle class in the center , and that is why if you buy something above 50 rupees and buy less than three thousand people will get the benefit of this plan .
Those who buy more than three thousand rupees will not get the benefit of this award .
The poor people from the poor can also buy goods through Facebook phones , ordinary phones using USSD and can also sell goods and also do the job of rupee and every person can become the beneficiaries of this plan .
In rural areas also people can buy and sell through AEPS and those people can also get the name .
This 30 crore people can become part of this scheme immediately .
I am confident that my countrymen will enjoy this arrangement and those youths who will be around you must be aware of it , you can ask them , they will definitely understand you .
Hey, in your family also there will be children studying in swimming in 10-12, those people will also be able to learn this easily.
This is very easy - the way you send a watts up message from the mobile phone this is the same easy task .
My countrymen , I am happy to know how to use technology in the country , how to do e - payment , how to do online payment , its awareness is increasing rapidly .
In the last few days casualties trade , non-payment trade has increased from 200 to 30 percent .
To encourage this the Government of India has taken a big decision .
How big is this decision , the traders can apply it properly .
The trader who will do digital la-veach will develop the way of online payment instead of hindrance in his trade , such traders have been freed from incompetence .
Everyone has advanced this campaign in the form of their parents .
In the headquarter of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Shriman Chandrababu Naidu has appointed a committee which is considering many plans in this regard .
But I have come to know that many state governments have also started many such plans in their own way and have also implemented it .
Someone told me that the Assam government has decided to give a 10 percent discount on the digital acquisition of Property Text and Trade Lines Fee .
Those rural banks whose breach will get at least two digital transactions of their 5 percent groups in the middle of January to March , they will get 50 thousand rupees from the government .
Until 31 March , 2001 , the villages doing 10 percent digital transaction have been declared as the best income of 5 lakh rupees under the government ' Panchayat for Disease Transfer ' .
Under the ' digital farmer Shiromani ' for the peasants the Asam government has decided to give a reward of Rs . 5000 to the peasants , which will be fully used for the purchase of second and peasants .
I am reading the best wishes of the Assam government , and giving it to every government that starts such a good start .
Many organizations have also made many successful efforts to encourage digital purchases among the rural poor crew .
I have come to know that GNFC - GNFC , Narmada Valley Fertilizers and Chemical Limited which mainly works as fertilizers , for the convenience of fertilizers where they sell a thousand possess Machines and 35 thousand kitchens have been given through 5 lakh kitchen bags digital medium and this work has been done in the last two weeks only and the interesting thing is that , in comparison to the last year , two percent increase has been recorded in the sale of GNFC .
Brothers and sisters , in our economy , in our lifestyle , informal sector -LRB- informal sector -RRB- is very big and most of the people are missed in cash , money , money , money or gathering , obstacles and we know that this is the reason that the miseries are absorbed .
Where there should be 100 rupees they get 80 , where they should get 80 , they get 50 , and there are other facilities from the point of view of health sector like insurers , they also stay devoid of them .
But now the case is getting worse .
Rupees are being deposited directly in the bank .
If seen in one way the informal area is changing in the opposite area , the exploitation is being stopped , it was also being closed and it has become possible for the workers to get such ordinary persons complete return .
Sathocath gets other benefits , they are also becoming harmful for the benefit .
Our country is the country of most youths .
Tension is easy for us .
If we like India then it should be the first in this area .
Our youth have made a lot of progress from the startup .
This digital movement is a golden opportunity .
With new ideas , with new technology , our youth should make this region as strong as possible , along with this we should also join the country with the campaign to get rid of blackness , corruption .
Most of the people in the category of other writers have paid attention to the fact that such good work , the work of the country 's calmness , such a sacred work , but however , how are they getting nausea , how are they looking for new ways for wrong blind people have also mentioned it .
And the third step is that in which people have given support in what is happening , but Satosath should go ahead with this fight , breakfast , black circles should be destroyed , for this one should take more hard steps , such enthusiasm increasers , writers are also there .
I am advising the countrymen to give me all these letters by writing .
Shriman Gurumani has written only on Mai Govi - This step of keeping an impression on the earmarks is appropriate for happiness .
We are getting troubled by the citizens , but we are fighting against all hatred and we are happy with the cooperation we are giving in this fight .
In front of bristles , black pearls , etc . we are fighting like wooden pearls , the same thing that Gaurumani Kabulji has written is emerging in the corner of the country .
We are all feeling it .
But this thing is also true that when the people are suffering from problems , they are facing problems then there is such a person who does not have pain .
I also have the same pain as you have .
But for a better purpose , to cross a high goal , when works properly , then in the middle of these problems , in the middle of pain , the countrymen also stay free from curse .
In fact these people are the oldest of changes .
I also give thanks to the people for another reason that they have not only given trouble , but also have given some such people the chances of misleading the people .
Somehow spreading , spelling written on the note is wrong , somebody has said , the feelings of salt have increased , somebody has to spread , somebody has to get the not fulfilled , the not of 000 and 000 is also to be fulfilled , this also has to be regained .
I also commit a hundred pledges to this capacity of the population .
My great countrymen , I am clearly feeling that there is nothing impossible when the cattle rose up with you with the millions of people .
The blessings of the people become the blessings of God .
I give thanks to the people of the country , I compensate them that people have participated with full enthusiasm in this greatness in front of bristles and black spots .
For political parties also there will be a comprehensive discussion in the Parliament House for the award of state birds .
If there was a message, it would be a good discussion.
The people who are spreading famine that the state birds have all been freed are wrong .
Those people who are unable to support open breastfeeding and black pepper , they keep on looking for the problems of the government all the time .
This government is for reproduction .
The government tries to take constant responsibilities of the population .
On the other hand I had said on the first day , the eighth trick had said that this fight is unusual .
For 0 years what is the strength of those vulnerables which have been associated with the black poles of baymani and breastfeeding
If I have decided to face such people then those people also adopt new instructions daily to defeat the government .
I want to congratulate the great countrymen in the end.
How did it become possible
I told his secret .
The secret is that all this information is getting me from the people.
As much as information is received from the government system , it is being received from many more monthly people and mostly we are getting success because of the awareness of ordinary citizens .
Who can imagine how much danger the aware citizen of my country is taking to open such elements .
And most of the information that is being received is getting success.
I am confident that for this the government has given an email address that you want to give such a measure on which you can also send it .
You can also send on my goove .
There is also a third group of journalists who are also in large numbers .
They say : Modiji will not get tired , will not stop , and as much hard steps have to be filled , but if we have taken the way once then we have to reach Manjeeel .
I give special impression to all those who write such letters because there is also a kind of faith in their letters , there is also blessing .
And there is no question of returning to the work for which the resource of millions of countrymen is blessed .
We have expelled it and we have made the law of a very stereotype property .
In these days those laws will also do their work .
For national interest , whatever has to be done for public interest is our priority to do .
My great countrymen , even last month I had said in my mind that among these problems also our casualties have broken the breakthrough of the last year in the volunteer by doing hard work .
This is a good sign from the point of view of agriculture .
Be fun of this country , be the peasant of this country , be young in this country , the hard work of all these is bringing new color today .
In the past days on the economic monastery of the world India has engraved its name in many areas very proudly .
In the Global Competition Report of World Economic Forum India has jumped 32 places .
In the Vaishno Devine Survey - 2016 we have facilitated the upliftment of 16 places and the transportation workability of the world bank has improved 1 cream in the list of 016 .
There are many reports which have also been directed towards this direction in its valuation . India is moving fast .
President , Vice President also expressed undesirable expression .
But in such situations also sometimes some good things are made and then mind gets a big satisfaction .
There was also such a good work in the middle of the courtyard of the Parliament , towards which the attention of the country was not taken .
Brother-in-law , today I feel very pride and joy telling this thing that the expedition that my government had taken out about Divyaang-Ja has passed in a widowed relationship associated with it .
For this I also express my glory to all the members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha .
I express the beauty of the country 's millions of Divyang-j .
Our government is committed to Divyangas .
I have also tried to make humble more conscious by taking it personally .
I mean, the Divya Ganjas get their huck, get respect, which they are honourable.
Our efforts and beliefs were strengthened by our Divyang brothers and sisters at that time when they brought four elephants alive in paralysis .
He not only increased the value of the country with his own victory but also surprised the people with his capacity .
Like every citizen of the country our Divyang brothers and sisters also we have an unparalleled heritage , can be immersed .
I am happy today that after the passage of this law in the hands of Divyaangzona there will be more chances of the nookers with the Divyangas .
For them in government nostrils the income of non - profit has been increased to 4 percent .
With this law special care has also been taken for the prevention of education , facilities and complaints of Divyangas .
The estimate of how sensitive the government is through the Divyangas can be estimated from this point that in the last two years the central government has planned four thousand three hundred fifty camps for Divya Gangajas . By spending a room of 352 crores 5 lakh 80 thousand Divyang brothers and sisters have divided the equipment .
The government has already passed new laws unfairly to the feelings of the national body .
My young friends , in the last few weeks such has come to know from the field of sports which has honored us all .
It is very natural for us to be proud of being Indian .
England of Indian cricket team has been successful in the category of opposite .
Among these some young players were worth examining .
The test was done by the Virat Kohli of dryness along with good battings as well .
Off-spineer R of Indian Cricket team .
ICC has declared Ashwin as the best crater and best test crater of the year 2016 .
My very pleasure to this person - many good wishes .
Even after fifteen years a lot of good news came in Hockey area , gave good news .
Our junior Hockey team did the world class.
After fifteen years this time has come as if Junior Hockey team has won world class .
Changing this proverb is a great pleasure to young players.
This proverb is a good signal for the future of Indian hockey team .
Last month our female players also told us .
The women hockey team of India also went to Asian Chempians Trophy and just a few days before , the women hockey team of India won Kansyachandraka in the competition of Asia camp for players less than 18 years .
I am enjoying all the players of cricket and hockey team with heart .
Last month we were enjoying all the Diwali .
Like every year on the occasion of Diwali I once again went to the border of China to celebrate Diwali with me .
To go to ITBP , along with going to the army I celebrated Diwali at the height of the Himalayas .
Not only that they were seen full of emotions and not only this , the good wishes which the countrymen sent to participate in the security forces of the country in their happiness was a marvellous effect .
And people did not just send messages that they were connected to the mind .
Someone made a video i . . almost every house became a guardian of the soldiers .
And whenever I saw those letters then I was also very surprised that how many imaginations are , how many feelings are filled and from them only Mayguv had thought that by pursuing some favorite things one should make a coffee table book of it .
Work is going on .
With the contribution of all of you , the imagination of all the feelings of the country 's army going to the country - the feelings that you have towards the security forces of the country will be included in this book .
But the truth is , this time it did not seem like this .
This time it did not even seem that there are festivals and I am not at home .
It seemed as if we are also accepting the mother-in-law with the people of the world .
When the entire nation stands with the army then the strength of the army increases 125 crores .
Some time back I had come to meet all the serpents of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir .
And with so much love , so humility these serpents of the villages talked , touched my heart every thing .
I resisted them to go and focus their attention on the future of those children .
Today I am happy that all those serpents coming from the Kashmir Valley have enjoyed the promise that they had given me properly , by going to the villages they made everyone aware .
Just a few days back when the board was tested then about 95 percent of the girls and girls of Kashmir participated in the examination of the board .
To participate in such a large number of students in the board tests he indicates towards this fact that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieve new heights of development through the medium of education for the future .
I have to read them enjoyment for this enthusiasm but along with this I give their parents , their own people , their teachers and all the village councilors a lot .
Dear brothers and sisters , at that time when I asked for advice from the people for the matter of mind then I can tell that the information of everyone has come to one side .
Everyone used to say, talk to the area at the not of 500 and one thousand.
Although on 8th November at night at eight o'clock in the name of the nation I had discussed to start a great campaign to improve the country .
The time I had made this decision , even then I had told everyone that the decision is not normal .
But the more important the decision is its acid .
And I had this estimate that in our normal life many kinds of new problems have to be faced .
And even then I had said that the decision is so big that it will take fifty days to get out of its effect and then we can go towards normal condition .
The diseases which we have been waiting for since last year can not be easy to get rid of these diseases .
I can understand your problems and problems properly .
But when I see the support of yourself , see your cooperation , many efforts are being made to mislead you , even then sometimes incidents that distract the mind come out , even then you have understood this path of truth properly , you have adopted this thing of the country to stop the boat of five hundred and thousand .
And such a big country , so much of all the notos , obsessions and these decisions are watching the whole world very fine , every economician is doing a lot of analysis , valuation .
The whole world is watching this thing whether the cattle of India will also get success by the millions of countrymen having problems and problems .
There may be questions in the mind of the world .
India has only faith towards hundreds of millions of countrymen . It is believed that the resource will remain fulfilling the imagination of the millions of countrymen .
And our country will go out in every way like gold , stretching out and its reason is the citizens of this country , because of which you are .
The way of this success is also possible because of you .
In the entire country all the units of central government , state governments , local health organizations , one lakh thirty thousand bank branches , more than one and a half lakh post offices , more than one lakh bank friends are engaged in this work day and night .
In the midst of various types of tension all these people are working on considering it as a yagna of the country 's service as an attempt of a great change .
If you start in the morning then he does not even know when the night will come , but all are doing .
And this is why it is clearly visible that India will be successful in it .
And I have seen that among these difficulties all the people of Bangkok , Post office are working .
And if you talk about humanity then they appear two times ahead .
Somebody told me that an elder brother suddenly got injured in the ruins .
Suddenly there was a need of nails .
This thing came in the sight of the local business worker there and I am very happy to know that they have sent money to their own elderly person so that help in treatment .
Such innumerable cases come out everyday in TV , in media , in newspapers , in conversation .
I consider all the partners who labour in this great throne to be intimately respected .
The pitching of power happens only when you get down from the skull .
I remember exactly that the campaign was going on for the big business plan and the way the workers of Bangkok had picked it up on their shoulders and the work that was not done in the last year was shown by them .
Once again he has raised this challenge and I am confident that the simplicity of hundreds of millions of countrymen will make this nation a new power by making it a new power .
They are searching for ways to save their money .
The sad thing is that in this also he has discovered the way using the poor .
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor , talking about greed or grief , putting money in their eating or doing some work to them .
I ask such people today - whether it is to improve or not , whether it is your duty to follow the law or not , it will see what to do .
But please do not shout with the life of the poor .
Do not do anything like this so that the name of the poor comes on the record and when the check is done then my dear poor people get stuck in trouble because of your sin .
And so hard law has been made of unauthorized wealth , which is emerging in it , due to which many problems will come and the government does not want our countrymen to face any problem .
My name crosses Asish .
I am a common citizen of Tirali village , Tirali Taluka , Harda district , Madhya Pradesh .
I want to say many examples in the matter of humanity that people have welcomed this tough decision for the upliftment of their nation by which enthusiasm will increase among the people and for the formation of the nation I am very important with the whole country .
I am very happy that you stopped the notes of thousands and fives .
I am speaking Yelappa Vellankar from this village of Copper district of Karnataka .
I ask you to give thanks because you had said that good days will come -LRB- someday -RRB- but no one thought that you would make such a big decision .
Seeing all these five hundred and thousand notes , black pearls and bristians have got buddhism .
Every citizen of India never gets better days than this .
For this I ask you to give complete blessings from my mind .
Some things are known through media , through people , through government sources then the enthusiasm of working increases a lot .
There is so much joy , so much pride that how is the unique potential of ordinary human in my country
Go to the ground and again get the opportunity to pass through this path then definitely pay the money .
And people go there , gather and pay money when they return from there after two-four days .
This is the power of my country in which there is also service , emotion and quantity of sacrifice .
I used to discuss in the square and this thing had reached all over the world .
People from many countries of the world have also learned to speak words of discussion .
But I didn't know that there was a wedding in the discussion too
I came to know that on 17th November there was such a marriage in Surat which happened with discussion .
In the Surat of Gujarat a daughter who came there in marriage gave her only tea and did not spend any other expenses .
The contributions made by Surat and Daksha Parmar who have fought against corruption through their marriage , against black nails in which they have been made inspiration .
If I had come late at night then I used to watch TV . I had seen in the newspaper that there is a small village named Dhekia Juli in Assam .
There are carvings of tea gardens and they get money every week .
If they get a net of two thousand rupees then what did they do
Four women of the neighborhood got together and shopped along with the four sides and they did not need a small noat because they bought together and decided that when we got the next week we would see the account by sitting .
People are searching for the ways of their parents .
And also see changes.
A message came to the government . people of tea gardens of Assam are saying that we apply ATM there .
Look how changes are also coming in the life of the village .
Some people of this campaign have got immediate benefit .
The country will get benefits in the coming days but some people have got immediate benefit .
Each municipality gets fifty percent vertebrae in the stomach .
But this time due to this decision of eight tables all the people ran to collect their old notes .
Last year in 47 urban units about three and a half thousand crore rupees were paid at this time .
You will be surprised to know , it will also be enjoyed that in this one week only 13 thousand crore rupees have been collected .
Now if four times the money has come in that municipality then it is natural that the water will be arranged in the poor population , water will be arranged , anganwadi will be arranged .
Many such examples are being found in which its direct benefit is also seen .
Brothers and sisters , our village , and our merchants are a strong strip of the economy of our country .
On one side because of this new changes in the economy , each citizen is improving himself among the problems .
In the midst of difficulties also the peasants have discovered the way .
The government has also taken several important decisions in which the adults and villages have been given priority but still there are problems , but I am confident that even if there is any problem in the adulteration , if there is always a stroke in them , then this time also there will be obstruction .
The small traders of our country who provide employment also increase economic activity .
In the last budget we had made an important decision that like the big mall , small shopkeepers of the village will also be able to do their business for twenty four hours now , no law can stop them because I had the opinion that if the big malle gets 24 hours then why should not the poor shopkeepers of the village be found
With the mudra plan they have been given a big initiative in the direction of giving loan .
Lacs of crores of rupees were transported to such small people because in large numbers people do small trade and give speed to the trade of unwanted rupees .
But by this decision they also face difficulty that is natural .
Even now download the App of Banko in mobile phones .
Even now put PH machines for creed cards , learn how it can be traded without noat .
Technological roads are safe and quick .
I would like to help yourself in making this campaign successful and not only this , also direct your change and I am confident that you can lead to change .
I believe that you can work on the basis of this technology in the entire village trade .
I also ask the elder brother and sister to say that you have suffered a lot .
There is a step on the paper and when it comes in hand then it is different .
Sometimes one gets full square and sometimes there is some excitement outside he has to give him some hissos and in the compulsions he makes this absorption a hisos of life .
With this new arrangement we want to eat six or even in the bank , the pieces of your footprint should be deposited in your bank so that the minimum ventilation is balanced .
Nowadays your mobile phone also works as e - packet - you can also get the money from the same mobile phone which you want to buy from the small shops of Adash - Padash .
That is why I specially insist on becoming a partner of this plan , because at the end I have taken such a big decision for the poor , merchants , woollen and victims of the country , which they should get .
Today I specially want to talk to young people .
We say in the world that India is such a country with which 65 percent population is less than 35 years of age .
Young and young women of my country , I know that my decision must have been chosen to you .
I also know that you support this decision .
I also know that you are also giving enough contribution to this thing to move forward positively .
But, my friends, yourself are my true guardian, you're my true partner.
We have achieved a unique opportunity to serve mother Bharati . The opportunity to take the country to the economic height has come .
Can my young men help me
I don't want to talk to you, I won't stop talking.
The more experience you are of today 's world , the old generation is not the same .
Maybe the elder brother does not know in your family and maybe even parents , cousins , mothers and mothers do not know .
What is the app he now knows , what is online banking he now knows how to book online tickets he knows now .
These things are very common for yourself and you also use it but our dream is ' Cashless Society ' which the country wants to do great things today .
100 percent cases are not possible but whether India starts ' lass society ' .
Once if we start the ' lass cass society ' today then the conglomeration of cassalous society is not too far and I will see your physical help in it , you will see your time , you will see your dream .
And I am convinced that you will never disappoint me because people who want to change the life of the poor of all India .
You know that today there is a lot of opportunity for digital banking or mobile banking for cassles societies .
Each binocular gives online facility .
The direct meaning of Wolt is e-packet .
Many types of cards are available .
Under the Jan-Dhan Yojana there are crores of poor families of India with rope cards and after 8 tariff which used to be very less use of rope card .
The poor started using the cotton card and about 300 percent increase has been registered in it .
Just as the prepaid card comes in mobile phones , in the same way the prepaid card is available for spending money in the bank as well .
A good platform is the ' UPI ' of doing business or by which you can also buy it , you can also get money , and this work is so easy that as much as you have sent on WTSAP .
The shoe will be an uneducated person , how does he send mesage on Wootsapp even today .
Not only this , technology will be so easy that there is no need of any big smaartphone for this work .
Every binocular has also been put on it and now it has also been impossible for the cost of online surgery and on such other types of cards the wrong expenses were coming to be seen that in 2 . days every expenditure has been impossible , so that the binoculars of cashless society are available .
My young friends , even after everything is like a whole generation which is unfamiliar with it .
And as much as I know, everybody is active in this great job.
As the Christianity Mesage is sending up on Woodspeak , I see all this poems , poems , cases , cartoons , new imaginations , and in the midst of how many difficulties this creative power of our youth is , then it seems as if this India is the speciality of the earth that at some time Geeta was born in the battlefield , just as we are passing through such a big change , then even inside this malic creativity will appear .
But my beloved young friends , I once again want to help me in this work .
Yeah-yeah, I repeat that I need the help of your father and I am confident that my country will do this work for millions of newborns .
Now do one thing , imagine from today that you will make yourself a hissos for ' cashless society ' .
The amount of technique to spend online on your mobile phone is available everybody .
Not only this , what is this technology for at least 100 families by extracting half an hour or two hours everyday , how to use technology , how to download your bank's app and how to spend the money spent in your eating  How can the shopkeeper be given
How to trade the shopkeepers as well .
You voluntarily this cassalous society , the campaign to bring out from the circumference of this boat , campaign to make the country free from corruption , campaign to free people from black money , campaign to get rid of problems and problems - giving them leadership .
Once the use of rope cards to the people is done then the poor will give you admiration .
If the ordinary citizens get this arrangement done then they will get rid of all the concerns and if all the youths of India get started in this work then I do not believe that it will take more time .
Within a month we can continue to grow in the form of a new modern Indian in the world and this work can be done through our mobile phones .
You can go to 10 houses everyday , you can also do 10 houses adding to it .
I am invited to you, come on, let's not mere support, we'll be the soldiers of this change and take changes.
We will go ahead with this fight to free the country from corruption and black money and we will have a blessed country in the world where young people have changed the life of that nation and they will have to believe what changes they bring newborns , revolutionise they do young people .
Kenya , he swiftly , UM-PESA used the technology of such mobile management , named UM-PESA and today almost all traders in this area of Africa have come on it .
This country has done a big revolution .
My young men, I once again, once again ask you to move forward this campaign.
Every school , college , university , NCC , NSS , community , personally , I want to get rid of this work .
We advanced this thing .
We have got an opportunity to do the best service of the country , which is not to lose the opportunity .
Preferred brother-in-law is today the birth anniversary of a great poet of our country Shriman Harivansh Rai Bachchanji and today on the birthday of Harivansh Raiji Shriman Amitabh Bachchanji has given a slogan for this cleaning campaign .
It has been seen that the most popular artist of this century Amitabhji is moving forward the campaign of cleanliness very well .
It seems that the subject of cleanliness has spread in their nerves and on the birth date of their father also they remembered the work of cleanliness .
Harivanshirayaji used to introduce himself through it .
Then his son Shriman Amitabji or whose nerves are running a mission of cleanliness , he has sent me by writing the poems of Harivansh royalty , clean mind , clean India , my acquaintance .
I bow down to Harivansh Raiji with respect .
By joining Shriman Amitabji in this way as well as changing the work of cleanliness and changing the work of cleanliness .
My dear countrymen , now through your thoughts , your feelings , through your letters , on the MYGOV , Narendra Modi app always keeps me in touch with you .
Now what is the problem of mind at 11 o'clock , but after that we have to start in regional languages immediately .
I am awaiting the sky , which newly those people have done so that even where Hindi language is not popular my countrymen will get the opportunity to connect with it .
It's very nice to all of you.
To see from a distance it feels as if Indian lifestyle is another name of festival , and it is also natural .
The festivals which have been traditional in India since the time of Vedic period have been the festivals of bringing about timely changes .
We have seen the motivation of finishing the tradition of external festivals from time to time and changes in the festivals according to the demand of time and society have also been accepted easily .
And he does this through the flame.
All these things have been taken by our ancestors in a very scientific manner .
Today the whole world discusses environment , natural destruction has become a subject of concern .
The festival of India tradition is going to make nature love strong . It is to make every person a culture by taking from the child .
Whether there are trees , plants , rivers , animals , mountains , birds , everybody 's responsibility is being celebrated .
Nowadays we keep a holiday on Sunday , but those who are the people of ancient generation , are those who are mosquitoes , mosquitoes etc .
That is , we also developed the tradition of keeping the queen there with Brahmund and science .
Today as we celebrate the festival of Diwali , as I said , every festival of ours is academic .
One thing we all know well , go to any corner of India , come from Amir to Amir ' s house , go to the brink of the poor from the poor , in the festivals of Diwali , the journey of cleanliness is seen in every family .
The corners of the house are cleaned .
But the demand of time is that not only the cleanliness of our house , the cleaning of the entire complex , the cleaning of the whole of the village .
We have to expand this nature and tradition .
The festival of Diwali is no longer limited to the borders of India .
The festival of Deepavali is remembered in some form in all the countries of the world .
Many governments of the world , even the Parliament there , the rulers there have also started becoming the snow of the festival of Deepawali .
This country is eastern or western , whether it is a developed country of tea or developing country , whether it is Africa , whether it is Ayurveda , it is all visible .
Now everyone will know , the US Postel Service of America , he has also thrown out the tapal ticket of Deepawali this time .
The chief minister of Canada has also made a serpent on his television tower publishing Diu in the memory of Deepavali .
The Prime Minister of Britain organised the program of this successful combination of all the society in London , he merged it in itself and maybe the youth .
And what is the question
16 women of Singapore are wearing Indian saris outside the Parliament and this photo has been viral .
And all this has been done on the day.
The festival of Diwali is now being celebrated in every street of Singapore .
The chief minister of Australia has encouraged the Indian community to join every society on the occasion of Diwali in different cities of Australia by reading the wishes of Diwali .
In recent times the chief minister of New ealand had come .
He told me that I have to return soon because I have to join the festival of Diwali there , the purpose of saying , Deepavali , the festival of this light , the festival of the world community is also becoming an inspiration to bring darkness towards light .
Along with good clothes , good food habits etc . on the festival of Diwali a huge humidity of fat is also felt .
And children , young people enjoy a lot .
Sometimes it does not even keep in mind what is happening around .
In the days of Diwali there is a lot of concern regarding sudden news , news of aggravation , death .
And one thing happens that on the day of Diwali doctors also have gone to celebrate Diwali with the family of parents in large numbers .
The festival of Deepavali takes place in our country very long .
That's not just one day.
Proclaim Govardhan Puja in it , say Bhaibis , say profitableness , and take Kartika to the light festival of the full moon , like that he walks for a long time .
Along with this we also celebrate the festival of Diwali and also prepare for sixth puja .
In the eastern areas of India the festival of Chhath Puja is a very big festival .
But one of its specialities is that they give a lot of deep messages to the society .
But the saying is that , brother , people in the world worship the rising sun .
Sixth Puja is such a festival in which the sun is also worshipped .
There is a very big social message in this festival...
I talk about the festival of Deepavali that you talk of worshipping Chhath , this time you have to read a lot of good wishes .
But along with it there is also a special time for me .
Especially the countrymen have to give thanks , express their glory .
In the events that have been taking shape for the last few months , our army is wiping out its own way to go for our happiness .
The sacrifice , penance , exercising of the sacrifice of the soldiers on my future world remains constant .
And one of these things had settled in the mind that dedicate this divine conservation team .
I invited the countrymen for a campaign called the message to Solajers .
But today I want to say by kissing the head that there is no such belief of Hindustan , in whose days the unprecedented love towards going to the country is glorious towards the army , as it has been expressed , it is giving strength to every countrymen .
To go to the peace groups we can not imagine that much of violence has emerged as a message of ourselves .
Schools , colleges , students , villages , poor , businessmen , shopkeepers , politicians , princes , players or singers , luckyly there must have been any remaining , who has not provided any message to go to the country , have not given messages to the country , even through the medium of propagation has converted this penance into a chance to express glory towards the army , and why not
Whether there is BSF , CRPF , Indo-Tibettom Police , Assam Rifles , Waterfall , Earthquake or Airplane , Coast Guard , I can not call the names of all , but what kind of problems do we have to go innumerable
I can imagine how pride this moment is to go to my country
All such acts have come on the message to the Soluzers Heshtage , what do you talk in reactive way .
Sriman Ashwini Kumar Chauhan has sent a poem that I want to read .
Such a sister Shivani has sent me a telephone message . Come on what do we call the Fauji family
Namaskar chief minister , I am calling the pleasure of Shiva .
Our friends are getting great encouragement from the message to solvers campaign which has been started on this day .
I am from a luxury family .
My wife is also the officer of the luxury .
My father and father-in-law have been the officer of the luxury .
So we are full of going to the whole family .
I want to say that along with Lashkri officers and soldiers their families , their wives also give such a sacrifice properly .
My great countrymen , this thing is true that the going of the army is available not only on the border but every monastery of life .
If there is natural efficiency , sometimes there is a comprehension of the arrangement of law , sometimes you have to sweep in front of the oppression , sometimes you have to show courage to return to the young men running on the wrong path , we keep on working inspiration from the nationalist motivation on every branch of our life .
You must have heard that the Himachal Pradesh was free from exhausting in the open-open defective flee.
Now Himachal has also been built . on the first November Kerala is also going to be formed .
But how can this success be seen
Now these people of our ITBP had gone to the village in holidays from their own fate .
So in the village , perhaps that time the village council was to meet , he reached the village village village village , and there was a discussion in it to make the toilet .
It was found that some families could not make toilets due to lack of money .
This link should be snatched , and see their patriotism , it was not so that only leaving the pills on the enemies used to serve the country .
He took out seventeen thousand rupees from his checkbook and gave it to the serpent of the village and said that those who did not make toilets in 5 houses , on my behalf make every family one thousand rupees . Make 5 toilets and make the village of all of us free from getting killed in the open .
I really want to be the honor of the young .
I noticed that in the far-flung jungles of Kerala , there is no way to go . On walking on foot throughout the day he can reach the village with difficulty .
The tribal Panchayat Idmalakudi there is difficult to reach there , that is why people do not want to go any time , in its nearby urban area the students of Anginiering have come to know that toilets are to be built in this village .
The students of NCC ' s cassettes , youths of NSS , engineering students , all decided together that we would make toilets .
The toilets which had to be taken , the into , cements , all the things , they went to the neighbouring jungle walking on their feet all day .
After working on his own, he made a toilet in the village and these young men made a small village open defeation fare in the remote forest.
This is the reason that the calorie is getting loose .
In Gujarat also all municipalities - the municipalities , probably more than 150 have been declared free from Shaukriya in the open .
10 districts have also been declared free from exhaustion in open .
Happiness has also come from Haryana . Haryana is also going to celebrate its golden jewellery in the first week and he has decided that in a few months the entire kingdom will be overwhelmed .
Till now he has completed seven districts .
Work is going on in all the states .
I have mentioned something .
I am giving a great favor to convert the citizens of all these states to this great work and to change contribution in the work of removing dirty blindness from the country .
If there is a lot of plans in my countrymen , governments and after the first plan it has to leave the first plan according to it .
But generally no attention is paid to these things .
Old plan is also going on and new plans are also going on and waiting for the coming plan is also seen .
This keeps going .
In our country there is no need of kerosene for those houses in which there is electricity in the house .
The families with whom there is a collision of gas , those families who have electricity have been discharged from the base number and I have heard that in present seven or eight districts have been kerosene freed .
The way he had taken this work on his hand , I am confident that the entire kingdom will soon become kerosene free .
And the convenience of the people will also increase . Yes , it will be difficult , the wives will be there , the infamy will suffer .
My great countrymen , Mahatma Gandhi is always guiding for all of us .
What should the country go every thing of them  Even today it determines the criteria for all these .
Gandhiji used to say , whenever you make any plan then first remember the poor and weak face and then decide whether there will be any benefit to the poor who are going to do this . When does it get harmed
You decide on the basis of this criteria .
Time demand is that now we have to satisfy the hopes of the poor people of the country .
To get rid of the problems we will have to fill one leg again .
Whatever our old thinking , the society has to be freed from the distinction of the daughter-in-law .
It's 21st century and there's darkness in the village, it can't move now.
And therefore for making the villages free from blindness , the hypocrisy of sending electricity to the villages is progressing successfully .
Time is moving forward in definitely .
After so many years of independence , what will happen to the health of the poor mother , cooking juice on the wooden peel , taking the smoke of 400 cigarettes in a day
Such five crore families are moving forward successfully to give life free of smoke . This is a cosmetic .
Small traders , small carbohydrates , vegetables sellers , milky , driven shopkeepers , poets used to stay stuck in the head of the businessmen .
My great countrymen , coming 31 October , the great men of this country have told the unity of India who made the mantra of their life alive .
On one side of 31 October is the festival of Jayanti of Sardar Saheb . the life of unity of the country is a great man .
On the other side is also the death anniversary of Shrimati Gandhi .
We should also do the same thing as we remind of the great men .
But one of the phones , their pain , me also touched . Prime Minister Shri Namaskar , Sir , I am speaking Jasdeep .
From Punjab , Sir , you know that the birth day of Sardar Patel is in 31st century .
Sardar Patel is such a miracle that spent his entire life in joining the country and he feels that he has also succeeded .
My great countrymen do not have this pain of a person .
A serpent , serpent , Ballabhbhai Patel , history is a witness to the fact that after Chanakya the variety of works of uniting the country have been done by a serpent .
The successful attempt to bring an independent Hindustan down a flag , such a big Bhagirath work which the Mahapurusha did was the centuries of the Mahapurusha .
But this is also a pain that Sardar Saheb lived for unity , remained joyful for unity , because of their priority , remained a victim of many ruthlessness , but never left the path of unity .
The birth day of the great man who lives for unity and the birth day of Sardar gives us pain to everyone .
But among these contracts also one has to move forward taking the mantra of unity .
Oneness in diversity is the strength of that country .
There are many languages , varieties , many wearing , eating and drinking , but unity in diversity , this is the power of India .
The original mantra of unity only gives strength to the best India .
The journey of life of Sardar Saheb started from the struggle for the peasants .
He was the son of the cattle.
Sometimes many people in us listen to the name of Amul .
Today people are also aware of every product of ' Amul ' outside India and India .
But very few people would have known that it was the divine view of Sardar Saheb who had imagined the cooperative milk producing group .
And Kheda district or which was called ' Kera ' district at that time , and in 142 he gave this idea the strength .
That shape , as a living example of how Sardar Saheb had made the creation of happiness and prosperity for the peasants of today is in front of us .
I am honorfully offering to Sardar Saheb .
And on this unity day , on 31 October wherever we are , remember Sardar Sahib , imagine unity .
There is also a festival of light festival of Kartiki Purnima -LRB- goddess -RRB- in this series of my great countrymen , the festivals of Diwali .
Guru Nanakdev , his body is not only for Hindustan but for the entire human species even today .
Woe to service , truth and everyone , this was the message of Guru Nanak Devi .
Peace , unity and harmony , this was the main mantra .
As we were there on the top of its deformity , separation , sect , height and bottom , then Guru Nanakdeva chose brother Lals as our helpers .
Come on we also goddess Guru Nanak which has given us the light of knowledge , the inspiration that gives us to distinction , if we have to go ahead with the mantra of everyone then goddess Girunak can be a good guide other corner .
I also pray to Guru Nanak Dev , when this light festival of his birthday is coming then in the end .
My descendants, once again the name of the country's goddess, this Diwali also liked you a lot.
It's very nice...
On the Ol India Radio the chief minister ' s mind is the root of what program .
My great countrymen , everybody 's namaskara -LRB- a few days before -RRB- , in the last days in an intimidating attack in the Uri area of Jammu and Kashmir we lost 18 virgin dreams of our country .
I bow to all those virgin soldiers and offer them homage.
It was enough to discover the entire country by making it circumference .
There is also doubt in the country , there is anger and this wrong is not only that family who lost their daughters , lost their brothers or lost their sisters , this wrong has fallen on the whole country .
My great countrymen, we are trusted on our army.
We are proud of our army .
We have many opportunities to speak to citizens , politicians . We also speak .
But the army does not speak , the army shows it by practicing .
Today I want to talk to the citizens of Kashmir as well .
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the immune system properly .
And as soon as they have begun to understand the truth , they have come out on the path of peace by mixing such elements with themselves .
Every parents want that the school becomes so fast , the peasants are also feeling that the crops , fruits etc which have been prepared for them reach the markets of the whole of India .
Financial activity also runs well.
And for the last few days carbohydrate has started walking well .
We know that peace , unity and harmony alone are the source of our problems , our progress is also the way of our development .
For our emotional generations we have to reach the new height of development .
I am confident that we will search for each problem by sitting together , take out the way and alongside I will punish the feeling of Kashmir on the best road .
The challenge of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of this rule .
In order to maintain law and order some legs have to be filled by the vehicle system .
And we will follow it completely .
Sometimes the people who think sweetly also present new ideas from what we think .
I get a lot of opportunity to know in recent social media .
From every corner of India , every kind of people have the opportunity to know , understand the feelings of people , and they give strength to the power of democracy .
In the last days a young man named Harshvardhan of 11th shoved a different kind of thought before me .
He wrote , I was very disturbed after the Orissa terrorist attack .
But the way to do something is not heard and what can happen even after doing such a little student like me
Out of these my mind came to mind how should I also work for national interest
And I imagined that I would study 3 hours a day.
It will be the best citizen to make the country work .
Bhai Harshvardhan , in this environment of across , at such a young age , you can think healthyly that is a matter of happiness for me .
But Harshvardhan , I will also say that the cruelty that is in the minds of the citizens of the country is its very big value .
This is the symbol of the consciousness of the nation .
But you'd know, as soon as the 165 war took place, Lal Bahadur Shastriji was doing our leadership and there was such a passion all over the country, Akrosh, the patriot.
Everybody wanted something , something like that .
Then Lal Bahadur Shastriji had made a very excellent attempt to touch this emotion of the country .
And he inspired the people of the country to work for the country by giving a mantra of Jai Jawan , Jai Kisan .
Another way to express the countrywide between the sounds of bamboo and binoculars is for every citizen that Lal Bahadur Sastriji had told .
When Mahatma Gandhiji was also driving the movement of freedom , when the movement was on its rapidity and there was a need for a stability in the movement , then he used to make a very successful experiment to turn the intensity of movement towards constructive work in the society .
We all , the army will fulfil their responsibility , the people sitting in the house will fulfil their duties and if we give some constructive contribution to the countrymen , every citizen , with the feelings of this patriot , then our country will certainly fulfil the new height .
My great countrymen, Mr. T.
Kartike has written to me on the Narendra Modi app that the players who had gone to Peralimpics have created history and their appearance is the result of human emotion .
Shri Varun Vishwanath has also written on Narendra Modi app that our players have done a lot of work . You should mention this thing in the mind .
Not only this , every person in the country has got an emotional link towards our players of paralysis .
Perhaps moving ahead of the game in view of paralysis and our players , the point of view of humanity , our point of view towards Divyanga has completely changed .
There is a lot of strength in this vocabulary .
This time 1 players including 3 women from our country participated in paralysis .
In comparison to other players as much as Divyango plays , physical capacity , adultery of sports , this is also a big thing as possible .
In the grandson Devender Jhajria Bhalafenk who received golden stars he again won gold stars and he also won again after 12 years .
The age of 12 years increases . once after winning golden strips the juice also decreases a little .
But Devendra told that the condition of body , that the increase in age could never weaken their imagination and they brought golden store again after 12 years .
And they wouldn't have been Divang since birth.
They had to lose one hand because of electric trash .
You think that person who gets first gold transfusion at the age of 23 years and at the age of 35 years gets second gold transfusion , how much he has done in his life .
Haigh Jump has won gold strips in high dogs .
And Thangavelu had lost his left leg at the age of just 5 years .
Poverty also did not come under the control of their complications .
They are neither living in big cities nor come out of middle class Amir family .
Despite passing through the life of problems filled with the age of 21 years , even in the middle of physical problems the country has been given the power to the country .
With the name of Deepa Malik of sports activity many varieties of winners have joined the pride of waving .
Varun C.
Bhati got the bronze moonlight in the high elbow .
This monk has done a lot of work to see these monks of paralympics , but in our country , in our society , in our country , in our country , in our country , in our country , in the direction of the Divyang brothers and sisters .
Our consciousness is just a place but our point of view to see this Divyaganga has also changed .
Very few people will know how this Divyangja has performed in the traditional of this time .
A few days ago, there was an Olympics competition in that place.
This time he has been built .
The race of 150 metres , in which the competition of Olympics was done , in which the Vikrams which were supplied , Abdeltif Baka of Alzheimeria established a new Vikram by breaking a total of 150 metres for Divyaangs for less than a century .
Not only this , I was surprised that the fourth number of those who came in Divya Ganjana did not get any snake as a runner but that too was running in less time as compared to the players of the gold snakes in the competition of common runners .
I once again give a lot of enjoyment to all these players and in these days India is also moving forward in the direction of making a clean plan for its development .
My great countrymen , last week I realized many wonders in the New York of Gujarat .
There was a lot of moments for me.
A mega camp of the Government of India was organised for Divyagangas and that biography was established in a number of world heritages .
On that day I also got the opportunity of the freedom of a book which has collected the successful legends of some Divyagans in the book .
There were very inspiring events.
World World Heritage has been built on the earth of India and New York which I consider to be important .
Within eight hours the machines to listen to the sixth Divyagan who can not hear it were successfully used to kiss the ears .
He got a place in the Ginness Book of World Records .
In the same day it is a matter of pride for all the countrymen to establish three world wars by Divyangas .
My great countrymen , two years back on the second October we started clean India Mission on the birth anniversary of Pujay Bapu .
And on that day I had said that cleanliness should become our nature .
Now on the second October when it is going on for two years then I can believe that in the country 's mother-in-laws have increased awareness towards cleanliness in the heart of the millions of people .
And I said, towards a straight cleaning, today we can all say, everybody has tried to move a step forward.
That is , the country has moved forward for hundreds of times towards cleanliness .
It has also been decided that the direction is true .
It has also been seen how good its fruits are , what happens by some such efforts .
Whether there is a bus station or rail , school or college , religious places , hospitals , hospitals , horse riders , children to elders , villages , poor , peasants , women , all are giving some contribution to any cleanliness .
Midia ' s friends have also played a positive geography .
We still have to go a long way.
For health , for the honor of citizens , especially for the honor of mothers and sisters , the desire to die in the open should be stopped .
In the direction of freedom from the habit of decaying in Andhra Pradesh , Gujarat and Kerala , complete success will be achieved in a very close future .
In recent times I had gone to Gujarat , then the officers told me that Porbandar which is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi will fully prove the goal of the ODF on the second October .
Especially for young friends or those who use a lot of technology today I want to present a plan for them .
Everyone has the right to know what is the situation of cleanliness campaign in your city and therefore the Indian government has given a telephone number - 16 .
We know that in 1866 Mahatma Gandhi was born .
By calling on this number 16 you will not only know the situation of the construction of toilets in your city but you will also get permission to make toilets .
Therefore definitely take advantage of it .
Not only this , in order to know the situation of sufficient complaints and disarmament of those complaints one has started a cleanliness app .
The Government of India has also asked the corporate world to come forward in it .
In the districts they can be sent in the form of clean India Fellows .
This cleaning campaign is not even a matter of keeping limited to the books .
If cleanliness becomes nature then it is not enough .
That garbage comes into use and for this it has also been started from the government ' s negative intercourse .
Khattar companies have been told that they buy the compound which is prepared from the garbage .
And the peasants who want to go to lifetime reach this fertilizer .
Those people who want to improve the health of their land , worry about the health of the earth , they want to stop the best harm they have caused due to chemical fertilizers , if they need such fertilizers in some quantity then companies give them such fertilizers .
And Shriman Amitab Bachanji - is giving a lot of contribution to this work in the form of brand ambassador .
I also request young men to get new start up in Kanchan humble from the west to wealth . Such equipments should be developed , develop such technology , work for its products in cheaper quantity .
This year from 25th September to 2 October a special program - Indonesian - India Swachhya Parishad is also being organized .
Throughout the country the ministers , chief ministers , mayors of the cities , commissioners , all of these together , only have to worry deeply about cleanliness .
What can happen in technology
What can be the economic storage
How can people participate
How can the chances of employment be increased in this
There is a discussion on all matters .
And I am seeing that almost new information about cleanliness is coming .
Just one day I read in the print that students of Gujarat Technology University went to 10 villages and started awakening campaign to build toilets .
He himself worked and gave his contribution in making a thousand toilets .
A few days back you must have seen that under the aegis of Vingakmandar Paramvir Singh a group took from Devprayag to Gangasagar , swimming and gave a message of cleanliness .
The Government of India has also made a calendar period of one year in the departments of their parents .
Every department will specially focus on cleanliness for 15 days .
In this rural month from 1 to 15 October , the Department of Drinking Water and Cleanliness , Panchayati State Department and Village Development have to work together to increase cleanliness in the area of the country .
And between the last two weeks of the month of October 16 October to 31 October the other three departments of Krishi and Kisan Welfare Department , Food Processing Department and Grahak subjects , these three departments will run a cleaning campaign where they are connected with them for 15 days .
It must have been seen that now the best campaign of cleanliness is also going on .
First of all , what is the situation of cleanliness of 3 cities , its report was presented to the people of the country .
Now the number of cities of the country with a population of more than one and more are their words and because of this there is a belief in every city , let us stay behind , but the next time we will do something better .
There is an environment of cleanliness .
I hope that all citizens should give as much contribution as we can to this campaign .
This village is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastriji on the second October .
The clean India campaign is also going on for two years .
From Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali I am insisting on buying something or the other of the khadi .
This time also I am sure that in every family there should be some cheese of fertilizer so that the light of the poor can appear in the house .
When this second is Sunday , how can we join ourselves in the work of cleanliness as a citizen
If you're a video, send a video.
If this movement will get new force once again from our efforts in the entire country , new speed will be achieved .
Remembering the myth of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri we commend something to do for the country .
And I have seen that as soon as I asked to leave gas in the past and the promise given by the people of the country is itself a very inspired event of national life of India .
When I was in Gujarat then all our workers used to come out in the galleries and used to ask for the old kids that are with the families and the kids who used to give them bats to the poorer areas which are the galleries .
Seeing the marvellous joy that was seen to see the poor kids as if they were joyful .
The lacs of workers like me who are working on taking care of the political thinking , the work of interpreting the state thinking , the pattern of the state associated with the roots of India , with the attempt to renounce the cultural heritage of India , who gave their own political views , alone - human views , are starting this year of the century of Pandit Dindayalaji .
Sarvajan Hittaya . The principle of all happiness endocrine is given to them .
Mahatma Gandhi also used to talk about the welfare of the person of Hawada .
How can the fruits of development be found in poor people
They gave jobs to each hand , water to every field , in both words the entire economic works .
When the country concentrates on their birth centenary year as a poor welfare year , the governments of the society , how the benefits of the development of the poor will be concentrated on it then only we can get rid of poverty .
As part of this where there is the residence of the chief minister and the path which was known by the name of the Rescribers Road of the present British has been named as the Pundit Dayal Upgradation of the Pundit Dayal Upgradation Programme for the centenary year .
This is a reactionary form of the poor welfare year of this century .
My great countrymen , on the day of Vijayadasamy , which I had started the heart attack two years ago .
In this I have been trying to make an effort to fulfil the activities of this government .
How is the humanity of this country inspiring me
What is the hope of common humans of this country
This week as soon as his two years are going to be completed , the way he praised the mind , the way he improved it , the way he gave him the blessing , I express the glory of everyone with the heart of the people .
I am also apprehensive of the window , who has not only propagated these things but also made an effort to bring them to all languages .
I am also admired to the people of those countries who wrote the letters after the reconciliation of the mind , published the windows of the government , published light on the government ' s faults and the Akashwani gave special program on these papers , calling the resistances of the government , finishing the moon for the problems .
That is , the mind is not only a message of 15 - 200 minutes but it is becoming a new opportunity of social change .
For any reason any other reason of satisfaction can be more than this .
My great countrymen , next week the festivals of Navratri and Durgapuja , the festival of Vijaya Dashmi , the preparations of Diwali are in a different way in the entire country .
This is a festival of possible worship . unity of society is possible only in the country .
Then it is that Navaratri , Durgapuja , how does it become the festival of worshipping the unity of the society
How does the mountains connecting humanity become
And when we become the means of that real ability then we can mix together and celebrate the festival of victory .
Come , do the means of possible . walk with the mantra of unity .
On 28 August, on 2016, the Chief Minister of the Akashwani had a complete reading of the program.
My beloved countrymen , Namaskar , Kalay is the birth date of Magic Grandchandji of Hockey at 2 o'clock .
This day is celebrated in the form of a national holiday day in the entire country .
I am giving tribute to Dhyanchandji and on this occasion I also ask you to remind yourself of their contribution .
He played an important role in giving hockey to India in 128 , in 132 , in Olympic games in 136 .
We also know the name of all cricket lovers , breadmen .
He had told for Dhyanchandji , he is a living example of Scores Goal Like Rans , Dhyanchandji Sportsman Spirit -LRB- cheerful emotion -RRB- and patriotism .
Once during the match in Kolkata a protest team player put a hockey on the head of Dhyanchandji .
At that time there was only 10 minutes left to finish the match.
And Dhyanchandji had made three shells in that ten minutes and said , I turned back the injury .
But I saw that this time bigger , everyone warned me , you must talk about Rio Olympics .
This much of appreciation towards ordinary citizen 's activities opposite , so much awareness and pressure on the country 's big business or speak something on it , I see it positive .
Apart from cricket also there is so much love in the citizens of India and also towards sports . Such awakening and so much awareness is there .
Reading this message for me also became a cause of great inspiration in itself .
One Shriman Ajit Singh has written on Narendra Modi app . Please talk to the ladies on their participation in education and sports , because he has honored the country by leading medal in Riya Olympics .
Some Sriman Sachin writes that , there is a resistance to yourself , at what point of mind this time definitely mention Singh , Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar .
The Chandraka which we got , these girls brought .
Our girls once again proved that they don't come out of any way.
These birds are from one north India , then from one south India , then from any east India .
So somebody is from any other corner of India .
It seems as if the girls of all India have gained the fear of making the name of the country glorious .
The peak on May Gov has written that we could exhibit better in the Olympics .
He has written , Adolescent Modi Sir , first of all enjoying the two medals we have won in the rays , but I ask you to draw attention towards the fact that , was our performance really good
And there's no answer.
We need to cut a lot of distance in sports .
Our parents still ask attention to reading .
Even today playing in the society is considered a break of time .
We need to change this idea .
The society needs inspiration .
Thus this emotion has been expressed by thousands of people .
Nobody can refuse this thing that we can not exhibit our hope unfairly .
It has also happened that the exhibitions which our players used to make in India were not able to reach there as well .
And only two medals could be found in Medal's focus.
But it is also true that despite not getting the lunch even if you look carefully then for the first time in many games the players of India have also told a lot of good poetry .
But why can we forget this one thing that she is the first Indian girl to volify for the opposite and opposite final .
In this way something happened with the link of Sania Mirza and Rohan Banpana .
After Usha for the first time in 32 years Lalita Babar converted to Trek Fild Field Fire .
You will be happy to know that after 36 years women reached the hockey team opposite .
Indian players , the coming time must be good for us .
Many players , for example , Aditya Ashoka , Dattu Bhoknal , Atanu Das are many names .
But my loved countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But if we keep doing the same thing as we have done then perhaps we will again become depressed .
I have declared a committee .
How can we do better and make a work map of it .
That thought , the king chooses one of his two games and plans how he can perform excellent exhibition in it .
I also resist the teams related to sports and associations that they also entertain neutrality .
And I also resist every citizen in India that whoever is interested in it send me information on Narendra Modi app .
Write to the government .
Give your income to the government by discussing Association .
The state governments discussed and sent their information .
But we are fully prepared and I am confident that 65 percent of our residents of the country are those who have a better status in the world of sports , who have to move forward with the imagination .
My dear countrymen , on September 5 is a trained day .
I have been spending a lot of time with students on the education day for many years .
But for this time if you have to go to the Je-20 peak poll then I realized that today I am expressing my feelings in the matter of mind .
The more mother has the place in life the same is the teacher and we have also seen such teachers who have more concern of their students than ourselves .
They dedicate their life to their disciples, their students.
Nowadays after Rio Olympic , the discussion of Pullela Gopichandraji is happening .
They are players but they have presented an excellent example of what is a good teacher .
Today I am seeing Gopichandji as an excellent teacher besides a player .
And on the day of teaching Pullela Gopichandji is deserving his penance , his dedication towards sports and his way of enjoying the success of his students .
The contribution of the teacher is always felt in the life of our fellow .
On September 5, the former President of India, Dr.
First is the birthday of Radhakrishnanji and the country considers it as a teacher day .
They may have reached any place in life but they always tried to live as a teacher .
Not only this , they used to always say - good teacher is those whose inner students do not die at all .
Despite being president 's footsteps , living as a teacher and keeping in mind the internal students alive - such a unique life has been seen alive by Dr . Radhakrishnaji .
If I think then I remember many things of my teachers because they were our heroes in our village .
But I can tell with happiness today , even if one of my teachers is now at the age of 0 years , even today his letter comes on me every month .
Because of this also if I see any good letters then there is a lot of feeling of respect in my mind .
It will be a glory and increasing the glory of our teachers in the society is the responsibility of all of us .
If you have any inspired thing with your photographs , your teachers along with your teachers on Narendra Modi app then definitely present it .
Seeing the contribution of the teacher in the country from the point of view of the students it is also very expensive .
My dear countrymen, Ganeshotsav will come in a few days.
Ganeshji is a scholar and we all want that our country , our society , our family , the life of every person remain uninterrupted .
But as soon as we talk about the Ganesh festival then it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji .
The tradition of the public Ganesh festival is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak ji .
Now not only Maharashtra but also in every corner of India public Ganesh festivals have started taking place .
Compensates . colorful competitions .
Even in the exhibitions which they have enhance the community touching the community in a very artistic way .
This big campaign of public education is run by the public Ganesh festival .
Surajya is our congenital prince , we now move towards Surajya , become our priority - can we not give message through this mantra through the public Ganesh festival .
Come on, I'll invite you to this.
This thing is true that festivals can be of the society .
This time many people have sent me a lot by writing Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja too .
Why should not you use the statue of Ganesha ji made of soil of the lake of the village
The statues made of POP are not incomplete for the environment .
The protection of environment , the protection of our rivers and streams from pollution occurring in them the protection of these small creatures of water - this is also God 's service .
Ganeshji is a scholar .
We do not make such Ganeshji who produces width .
I do not know in what form you will take these things , but I do not just say this thing , many people say and I have heard about many - one idolater is Shriman recited horsephle .
Unfavourable Ganeshotsav of the environment - this is also the work of a social service .
Durgapuja has more time .
Now we decide that old family which makes idols .
If I buy idols from them then they will also get employment and these statues will be made from the pond or the soil of the river then they will be found again in it .
Now Sahu has to read very good wishes of Ganeshotsav .
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mr Teresa, will be divided by the saint's title on September 4.
Mr . Teresa had dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor in India .
Those who have served the poor of India throughout the life it is natural for all Indians to be proud of such a mirror terrace when they get the preaching of the saint .
In the festival that will be held on 4th September the Government of India will also send a seventy times resistance component to the leadership of our foreign chief Sushma Swaraj from the countrymen .
From the saints , from the saints , from the sages , from the Mahapurusha every moment we get to learn something .
Let us keep getting something , learn and keep doing something better .
My dear neighbors , how big change comes when development becomes lifestyle .
Jansh Kit is considered to be the form of God .
With the help of five state governments in the past , the Government of India has made a successful attempt to connect people for clean Ganga , clean Ganga .
On the 20th day of this month the serpents of the village situated on the banks of the Ganges in Allahabad were invited .
The village does not let the Ganga river get dirty and came from any Uttarakhand for this imagination .
So somebody came from Uttar Pradesh, somebody came from Bihar, somebody came from Jharkhand from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the ministries of the Government of India who support this imagination , I also thank the chief prime ministers of all those five states who have made an important step in the cleaning of the Ganges connecting the people .
My dear countrymen , some things touch me sometimes and even those who are imagined they also have special respect in my mind towards those people .
In the Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh , more than seventeen students have written a letter to their parents in social ways .
The children of seven to seven years of age did this work .
As soon as this thought came , those who tried this effort also congratulated the students and those parents who decided to make their children 's letter seriously and make a toilet .
There are such things which inspire us .
In Koppal district of Karnataka a daughter of sixteen years Malamma came to be honest only against her family .
My loved countrymen , clean India has become the dream of every Indian .
Some Indians have become compassionate .
Some Indians have made it their goal .
But everybody is connected to it in some way . Everybody is giving his contribution .
Everyday news comes how new efforts are being made .
There has been a thought in the Indian government and has warned people that you should make a film of two minutes , three minutes on cleanliness . This short film should be sent to the Indian government .
You will get its details on website .
It will be opposed and the victory that will take place on the day of Gandhi Jayanti on 2 October will be given the name .
I also ask the channels , you also get competition by making such films adventurous .
Structurality - creativity can also give a power to cleanliness campaign .
New methods will be known , new motivation will be found and all this will happen with ordinary artists from the partnership of the Jantajnarad .
It is not necessary that there should be big studio , good cameras to make films .
A very important thing happened in the past.
Our ideal president Pranab Mukherjee started a new program in Kolkata - Akashwani Maitre Channel - Now some people will have to say , should the president inaugurate a radio channel
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage .
So on the other hand the Bangladeshi friend and on the other hand they will share mutual commodities . Bangladeshi people from both sides will enjoy the skyscrapers .
I also thank Bangladesh that they joined us for this work .
I also appreciate the friends of Akashwani whether they are also contributing in foreign policy .
My great countrymen , even if you have given me the job of adultery , but then I also feel like you .
And sometimes the events of events touch me a little more .
Such emotional incidents also give new energy . give new inspiration and this is the same which inspires people to get rid of something done .
In the past I got such a letter which touched my mind .
A mother of approximately 84 years who is a retired teacher he wrote this letter to me .
If he had never asked me to declare my name in this letter then today I would have talked with his name .
In the letter he wrote that whenever you had asked to leave the gas sabsidi then I had left the sabsidi and then I had forgotten .
The countrymen , you must know that I have tried that those people who left the gas sufficiently , sent a letter to them and some of my opponents would read it by going to Rabru .
My attempt is to write a letter to more than one crore people .
He wrote to me that you are doing a good job . The campaign to free poor mothers from the kiss of kiss is better . I am a free teacher .
The question is not of fifty thousand rupees but it is of the feeling of the mother and such a Kotkoti is the blessing of the mother Baheno who gets confidence and strength for the future of my country .
I pray to that mother and also offers to those Kotikoti mothers of India who always wish to someone by suffering from their own problems .
My dear countrymen , last year we were suffering due to bad times but this month was continuously filled with the problems of the completion .
In some parts of the country flooded .
The central governments , local self-esteem organizations , social organizations , citizens could do as much as possible .
But in the midst of these conclusions also there were some such cases which had to be more remembered .
What is the power of unity , if you walk together then how big results can be obtained for this year 's next month will be remembered .
In August 2016 , Gor State Contradictory Persons , the birds who do not leave any chance against each other and almost 0 birds of the entire country , even in the whole country , many of these birds spent the rope of GST together .
In the same way whatever happened in Kashmir , all the state birds of the country have spoken of Kashmir in the same voice .
If it is said to be at least in words then I will say that unity and compassion - these two things remained in the original mantra , and all of us believe that from the Sarpanch of the village to the advent of the country that if anybody dies in Kashmir , then he is a young man or a protector , this is our own harm , is our own country , those people who are trying to make these children imperfection in Kashmir , sometimes they will have to give their wrong children too .
My loved countrymen , the country is very big and is full of diversity .
In order to keep the country filled with diversity in the binding of unity , it is the responsibility of all of us in the form of a society , as a government that if we give more weight to the things that we get strength to unity , bring more out , then only the country will make its bright future .
My mother-in-law is confident of the gain of millions of people .
The root of the ' Ki Baat ' program on the airways of the Chief Minister .
My loved countrymen, Namskar.
Today in the morning I got a chance to spend some time with the young people of Delhi and in the coming days I will give color of sports to every young man in the whole country with enthusiasm .
We all know that in just a few days the great Kumbh of the world 's biggest games is going to celebrate .
The word rio will recurs in our ears .
The whole world will be playing.
Every country in the world must have kept an eye on its players ' performance , you will also keep an eye on it .
Our hopes are very much but those who have gone to play in the rays the task of increasing the enthusiasm of the players is of hundreds of millions of people .
Today in Delhi the Indian government has organised a good event for ' Ron For Rio ' , ' Lake Our Jio ' , ' Our Khillo ' .
Everything we can do in the coming days, wherever we are, to encourage our players.
As much as food habits are concerned , but everything has to be left out .
Even if sweet silver comes in winters then leaving bed one has to flee in the field and not only by playing but also his parents .
The players do not become night and night .
I am also ready to do this work from your side .
To bring your messages to these players the country is ready to become a major posterior of the country .
Come , let us increase their efforts as much as we can glorify each other in the coming days as we can .
And today when I am talking about Rio Olympics , then a student of a poem lover Punjab Central University has sent a poem to the sun light .
Maybe there are many other poets who might have sent poems, maybe write poems, but some will sworn him.
Technology keeps changing everyday , takes new form everyday , new effects are produced everyday , it keeps changing .
You can not catch the technology .
If there is no research and innovation then the way the water of Bandiar spreads dirt , technology also becomes bogus .
And if we stay alive without research and innovation with the confidence of old technology then we will become out of the world in changing age and therefore in the new generation we will have to give encouragement to the feelings of research and innovation towards science .
The innovation machine is being encouraged by Niti Panch .
One goal is that through this IM ' - one eco system is prepared in the entire country , innovation , experiment , anterpinorship , this program is going on and the chances of new employment is also going on .
Similarly there is direct relation of incubation center -LRB- medical center -RRB- with innovation .
And if I talk to the Atal Incubation Centre then for this also the government has also taken a view to give a huge amount of Rs . 10 crore .
Similarly India is facing many problems .
We have problems in daily life .
Now we have to find out the above mentioned through technology .
And through the Atal Grand Chellenge the youth of the country has been advocating that with the help of exploration , research , innovation and bring out the problem of vision .
Government of India asks for encouragement to give special encouragement to the following techniques for the solution of our problems .
And I am happy that people are interested in the words that when we talked about the Tincring Lab , then about thirty thousand schools sacrificed and when we talked about the incubation center then more than four thousand institutions came forward for the incubation center .
I am convinced that Abdul Kalamji has a real sense - research , innovation to solve the problems of our daily life technology , simplification for freedom from our problems will work as much as our new generation .
My dear countrymen , some time ago we were worrying about the drought and now the joy of rain is also coming .
The state government and central government are asking a lot of effort to help with the help of the flood victims .
Due to the reason of rains some problems also the mind of everyone , every human mind becomes complicated because the center of our entire economic activity is in the rainy season - agriculture .
Sometimes such disease also occurs that we are lost all life long .
But if we stay awake , be careful , stay alert then the way to escape from it is also very easy .
The dengue was brought.
One can prevent dengue .
Keep in mind a little cleanliness , be very careful and try to stay safe , pay special attention to the children and the disease that occurs in poor population is surprising but the case of dengue does not come .
Dengue comes first in the happy fields and therefore we understand it .
You will be watching the advertisements on TV but sometimes we are very sad to take care of the steps by becoming aware of it .
Government , hospital , doctor - he will do his job but we also do not enter dengue in our house , our family and I will be aware of this that there is no disease due to water .
I want to pay attention to the other problem , the loved countrymen .
Life has become so busy , so busy that there is no time to think for us .
On being ill one feels that he gets well soon and for this taking any antibiotic we get administered in the body .
But the bacteria that are of him tend to be patients of these medicines and then medicines prove helpless for these bacteria and then they spend years in fighting , making new medicines , doing scientific research etc . and till then these diseases produce new problems .
The bacteria which spread TB and malaria are bringing about such changes in themselves with a lot of hardship that the medicines do not have any effect on it .
In medical terms it is called antibiotic ray conditions and therefore the rules of using antibiotics are important .
When the matter of health comes out then I ask for one thing more .
Although in the last one decade the rate of maternal mortality rate has decreased , but even today life of pregnant mothers can not be saved in large numbers .
During pregnancy or deficiency of blood , delivery related infection , hyperbody , illness can not be known when its life becomes bad .
Keeping in mind these things the Indian government has started a new campaign for the last few months .
Under this campaign , the preserved Maternity Mission ' is being conducted freely in the government health centers of all the pregnant women every month .
Can my doctor , brother and sister not give this work for the poor for twelve days in a year
In the past many papers have written me .
Thousands of doctors have advanced considering my point .
But India is such a big country in which lakhs of doctors should join this campaign .
I'm sure you must see.
My loved countrymen , today the whole world climate change , global warming , environment - makes it very worried .
Its anxiety occurs in the country and in the world .
In India these things have been put forward for centuries .
During the war of Kurukshetra also Lord Krishna discusses the tree .
In Geetha Lord Shri Krishna says : The highest tree i . . in all the trees I gather .
It is said in Shukracharya Niti - Nasti Mool Anaushdhan - There is no such vegetation in which there is no medicinal properties .
Auspicious festival of Mahabharata - It has been discussed in many areas and it is said that the trees which wear are saturated for this .
There's no doubt.
Those trees who donate it they also give them the trees like children in the world .
A few days back I came to know an example of a daughter of Pune Sonal - she touched my mind .
It is said in the Anushasan festival of Mahabharata that the tree also fulfills the responsibility of the child in the world . Sonley has not only fulfilled the wishes of his parents but also the wishes of the society .
In the Junter Taluka of Pune of Maharashtra the companion of Narayanpur village Khandu Maruti Mahatra married his grandson Sonal in a very inspired manner .
All of them were given in gifts of Kesar or a plant and when I saw their spectacles in Soshill Midia then it was astonishing that in marriage the jewels were not visible but the plants were visible all around .
The scene of that tasvir was heart touching .
In a way Sonal 's wedding became a stories of nature love . I give a lot of good wishes to Sonal and Shriman Mahatregi for this new effort .
And many people use this .
I remember , when I was the chief minister of Gujarat then in the Ambaji Temple there a large number of pilgrims come in the month of Bhadrava .
And I will tell them that , see , this is the fervor of the mother . If she goes to your village and becomes big then mother will keep giving you blessings .
And lakhs of pilgrims used to come and lakhs of plants were divided that year .
Temples can also start the tradition of planting instead of fervor in this season .
A natural genetic movement can occur - of trees .
When I touched the bad brothers repeatedly or on the banks of our fields we make our land barbarous then why do we not plant timber instead of that tree
If we we wear such trees on the banks of our fields which come in furniture and house work then after fifteen - twenty years it can also be worn by cutting it with the permission of the government .
And one can also become a new instrument of your coming and India can also escape from visiting Timber .
The government has established a mass movement .
Rajasthan - Marubhoomi - has done such a big festival and has envisaged fifty lakh plants .
Fifty lakh plants in Rajasthan are not small things .
Those people who know the earth of Rajasthan know how big bear has risen .
Even the darkness has envisaged to increase its green cover fifty percent .
The central government has run Green India Mission under which the railway has accelerated this work .
In Gujarat also there is a very big bright tradition of the Forest Festival .
This year in Gujarat many such projects like Amravan , Ekta Van , Shaheed Van have been taken up in the form of forest festival and have run the campaign to plant hundreds of trees .
I can not mention all the states but they are also eligible for reception .
But for me the journey of South Africa was a kind of pilgrimage .
When we remember South Africa then it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela .
When this word of love , forgiveness falls in the world then the face of Gandhiji and Mandela gets swimming .
During the tour of South Africa I went to Finnics Settlement . Mahatma Gandhi 's residence is known as the best .
The train which Mahatma Gandhi had traveled on me and the train that had done the second rope to become Mahatma Gandhi , that Peter Maritsburgh station - I also got the privilege of that rail journey .
But this time I got the opportunity to meet such glorious feelings which gave my life for equality , for equality .
Twenty - twenty years had spent life with Nelson Mandela in jail for twenty - twenty years .
In one way he had encouraged the entire youth and I got the privilege to see these glory of Nation Mandela 's friend Shriman Ahmad Katha , Shriman Lalu Cheba , Shriman George Bezorie , Roni Kasaris .
The same kind of activity which has been considered to be the symptoms of activity in Geetha was completely witnessed .
He will remember my mind forever.
Equality and equal opportunities . no society and government can have any more mantra than this .
Primaryity will be different , but the path is the same and that path is of development , equality , equal opportunity , equality , equality , mama emotion .
Let us glorify our Indians who have also shown the original mantras of our life alive in South Africa .
My dear countrymen , I am honored with Shilpi Varma .
That those who have given me the message and their concern is very natural .
Because of being a woman I am sorry about that family .
And some people become illusioned and get stuck in the joy of money .
A new method of looting through this technique is spreading around the world .
And that too on a SMS.
And in a few moments they came to know that everything has been wiped out .
But in recent times I felt a pleasant experience .
Some students of Aligarh had come to me .
The artistic pictures are carved on the station .
If you ever go to Aligarh then definitely see the station .
From many railway stations of India today I am getting such information . local people are presenting their area identity on the walls of the railway station by their art .
There is a new feeling .
Its example is this that how can be converted from folk partnership .
Enjoying all those doing this kind of work in the country , special pleasure to my colleagues of Aligarh .
And you will also be joining home , outside also in the festival .
We have special importance of the festival of Raksha Bandhan there .
Like last year also this year on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan can you not give the mothers , sisters of your country to the elderly safety beam plan or life-threatening beam plan gift
Think , give such gift to the brain which gives them real protection in life .
And today is social security.
Today the true meaning of defence dam is .
My loved countrymen , there are many of us who have been born after independence .
And I am the first major of the country which is born in independent India .
The whole country becomes colored in the color of freedom fighters , once again the fragrance of freedom will feel all this environment will make us all and the freedom festival should not be the program of the countrymen .
Like Diwali we should have our festivals .
I hope you will also do something associated with the inspiration of patriotism .
Which you would like to keep yourself away from the Red Fort .
And nowadays the platform of technology is so easy that you can easily send things to me .
On the Ol India Radio the chief minister ' s mind is the root of what baat .
Every group makes several programs in the holidays .
And in holidays there is also season of pomegranate , therefore it is also believed that enjoy pomegranate .
And sometimes it feels such that if you get a little time to sleep in the afternoon then it is better .
But the horrible heat of this time has made all fun all around .
But I have seen that citizens also do very good efforts .
In many villages awareness is seen and what is the value of water , those who are suffering from the problem of water they know .
And therefore there is also a sense of water in such places and there is also the activity of doing something .
A few days back I had told someone that on the Hivar of Ahmad Nagar district of Maharashtra Bajar village Panchayat and the villagers there have taken water as a very sensitive question of the village .
The package which used to use the most water , then it is the sherbet , whether it is , has decided to leave the farming of such crops .
It seems very easy to hear , but it is not so easy .
And in which there is minimum need of water they all went on the field of gardens and vegetables .
They have collected fountains , drop irrigation , rain water collection , water conservation so much that today that village has become strong on its own strength to face the consolidation of water .
Okay , even if I talk to the village of Bajar in such a small hill , but there will be many such villages .
I also give all such villagers a lot of harmony for their best work .
Somebody told me that in the district of Deos in Madhya Pradesh there is a village Panchayat .
This Panchayat made an attempt to make false swords .
Although water remains saved but as soon as the surface of water comes up then there is also a great improvement in the quality of water .
Sometimes it seems that whenever the Indian government brought Latur water through the train , it became a memorial for the world .
This thing is true that the speed which the railway did this work is eligible for this favor , but the people of Pela village are also eligible for such admiration .
I will say , even more than the railways are capable of enjoying .
But many such plans which run by the citizens never come together .
The nature of man is , even though many problems pass through the middle , but if some good news comes out then it feels as if the entire contract has gone away .
This year the information about the possibility of rainfall occurring from 06 percent to 110 percent has been declared as if a message of great peace has come and it seems .
Till now it is time to come to the rains , but the news of good rains has also brought a new warning .
It will be rainy as much as it gives enjoyment , as well as gives a chance for all of us , also throws a challenge .
Can we run an expedition right now to save the village water
The peasants need soil . They are used in the fields .
This time why should not we take out the soil from the ponds of the village and take it to the fields
Due to this field land will also be good and water collection capacity of ponds will also increase .
Sometimes in the bags of cement , sometimes in empty bags of cement , rocks and soil filling up the path of water is that water can be stopped or not .
If water stops for five days , if water stops for seven days then water will come down in the ground then the surface of water will come up in the ground .
Water will come in our wells.
The water should be stopped as much as possible .
So even today if there is a stiffness of water , there is a state of evil , but we have time for one and a half months of this month .
And I am always there , whenever we go to the birthplace of Porbandar Mahatma Gandhi then in the different places we want there one place is also worth seeing , in order to save rain water , how many kinds of two hundred years old solders have been built under the house and how pure water remains in them .
Because this work has been going on for almost 30 years .
Many governments came , many plans were made , due to which it is very natural to raise this question in the minds of hundreds of people of the country like Bhai Kumar Krishna .
Those who are religious faithful , for them Ganga is Mokshadayini .
I will accept this magnificence but more than that I feel that Ganga is life-saving .
We get daily from the Ganges and we get a new power to live from the Ganges .
As the Ganges flows and also gives a new speed to the economic activities of the country .
One Bhagirath gave us the Ganga by bringing it , but to save it there is a need of crores of different parts .
This work can not be successful without participants .
And therefore we all have to say that for cleanliness , for cleanliness , resistance to change , repeated things .
Many attempts are being made by the government .
The states which have been on the banks of the Ganges are also trying to take full support from the kingdoms .
There is also an attempt to connect social , voluntary organizations .
There are also several steps to stop the dreams of Patan and industrial pollution .
Everyday in large quantity through the drains deep streams are stretched inside the Ganges .
In order to clean the waste , Trash Skimmer works to clean the streams flowing in water at places like Varanasi , Allahabad , Kanpur , Patna etc .
These machines have been supplied to all the local self-employed institutions and it has been suggested that they continue to run and clean the garbage from there .
And in the past I have been told that there is a lot of effort there , where everyday three to one tons of garbage is taken out .
Of the pulp and papper industry which has almost completely stopped coming out of garbage or black licker .
All of these are the signals of this fact that we are moving forward in the right direction and awareness is also increasing .
And I have seen that if a person is found not only on the banks of the Ganges but also on the south of the farthest south then it is sure that if Saheb , Ganga is clean then it will happen .
So this , which is the faith of the people , will definitely give success in the cleanliness of the Ganges .
People are also donating Ganga for cleanliness .
One is running this arrangement very well .
My great countrymen, today is 24 April.
In India it is considered as Panchayatiraj day .
Today Panchayatiraj was started in our country .
And today the Panchayatiraj system in the entire country is successfully working as an important unit of our democratic state .
And therefore with the help of state governments the Indian government has run India campaign from 14th April to 24th April , 10th day from rural areas .
And today in 24th century I want to celebrate Panchayatiraj on going to that state where I live in Jharkhand or where our most tribal brothers and sisters live .
And at 3 o'clock in the afternoon once again I have to talk to all the Panchayats of the country for the sake of Panchayatiraj day .
This campaign has done a very big job of awareness .
How do democratic institutions become strong at the level of the village in every corner of India
How does the village become self-reliant in itself
How to make the village plan for its own development
The birthday of the daughter should be the festival of the village .
There are many such plans .
In some villages there were programs of donation of food .
Perhaps in all these villages of India these various programs have been going on together for 10 days , this becomes very less time .
I congratulate all the princely governments , the companions of the villages for this matter .
Together with very malicious , with innovation this entire process has been converted into a chance of the strength of the democracy for the development of the village , for the welfare of the village .
The same awareness that has come in the villages is the guarantee of India .
Chief Minister Namazam
I am speaking from Mumbai to Sharmila Gharpur .
I have a question about education in school colleges .
For the last several years there has been a need to improve the education sector .
Like lack of adequate schools or colleges or lack of quality in education .
Today in every family if parents have any first dream then they are of good education of children .
After home , car , everyone thinks .
And for countries like India this feeling of human mind is very powerful .
Being able to learn and learn good education to children , their concern should increase even more and more awareness should come .
And children also become aware that I go to school for this work .
And therefore I will first inspire all the girls , parents to talk to the child in detail about the activities happening in school .
And if some thing is kept in mind then go to school and talk to the teachers .
This is also the technique which can reduce many evils from our educational system .
So in one way, the effort to spread education all around was preference.
And he was also important.
But even more important than this is to spread the importance of improvement in our education .
We have done a very big job of expansion .
Now we have to focus on quality education .
With the testimony campaign it will have to make our priority now .
Entry , entrance , entrance , mantras have been continuously lost , but now those children who have reached school we have to focus on proper education , proper education .
You must have seen the estimate of the present government as well .
Efforts are being made to give comprehension to good education .
But the thing of Sharmalaji is true that there is a need to bring improvement in us from arteries .
This time you must have seen in the geometry that work has been done by chewing chila .
In the estimation , ten government universities and ten private universities have told them to get rid of government damsels and to come on the path as a result , come , let us tell what you want to do to become the most united university .
This plan has been implemented with the intention of giving them complete freedom .
Universities of India can also become University Protecting Universities .
Along with this the importance of education is the same importance of Kaushalya .
Similarly technology will also play a very important role in education .
Remote education and technology will also make our education easy .
And in a very close future I believe that its results will be visible .
For a long time people keep asking me on one subject .
Some people write on Vebbortal May Goa .
Some people write me on the Narendra Modi app , and mostly these young men write .
In today 's era along with studies for youth Khelkuad is also very important .
So one day I also gotta talk to the people, before that I talk to all seven.
The result of this came that I just called such a meeting in which NCC had elders , were elders of NSS , was adults of Scott and Guides , were from Red Cross , Naru was of the youth center .
And when I asked them , when did they get together before , they said , little brother , after our country was free this kind of first meeting has been arranged .
I have got that benefit in childhood only and I also believe that a new life of these organizations should be supplied , new power should be supplied .
This time I have kept some things in front of them .
I have told them , brother , why do not our youth , all organizations do a lot of work of water conservation in this season
Which such programs can be created to connect the country .
What can be the common age - life of all our organizations
What new things can be included in their work style , program .
If you write on my Narendra Modi app, I'll get it to the right place.
That's how it's going to happen.
My descendants , today I have told you the same thing as to compel us all to think .
I also see it as a thing that makes us feel better .
You must have seen that the political situation of our country is such that in the last few slidings there used to be discussion about how many slinders of the bird gas would be given .
And every state bird felt that if one has to reach till the middle class community with the point of view of swing then the bats of gas are very big .
On the other hand economists used to keep pressing , reducing subsidis .
And due to this many committees used to sit , in which there was a lot of room for reducing the capacity of gas , information came .
Crores of rupees were spent behind these committees .
But the thing remained there only .
This feeling is of everyone .
But outside it sometimes came to mind .
My countrymen , today I am happy to give my account to everyone that I adopted the third way .
One crore families voluntarily submitted their gas subsidiary layer .
But after counting it came to know that in one crore families there were more than 80 percent of those people who opened their fictitiousness there , grew up in the queue and by giving them in writing they lost their lives .
This incident has also forced the economics of the country to think newly .
And if the meaningful people of the world will also be like this , then the results will come , in this way that makes the economic equations .
For them also the extent of their thoughts is this incident outside , about which sometimes one has to think .
I specially want to tell the entire royal class today , that we must do one thing that depends on the population everywhere .
You don't even think we'll get such a result.
And we should go in this direction.
Those who are sending marcus by giving their tests keep on putting it on them .
Sometimes I feel as if we must declare that there is no ticket checker in the root of the railway which is today .
Every brakeing news is bad news in every newspaper and News channel .
Does it not happen properly around us in the country with the population of the spinal cord .
Please change this situation.
Abdul Kalam always used to say this thing , print only positive messages on the first step of the print .
They were constantly talking about this.
A few days ago he also wrote a letter to me and he had said that we have decided that on Monday we don't give a single negative message.
The biggest reason for the inspiration of doing good news is that .
Although it is true that as much as we burn the goodness , the place will be less for evils automatically .
If I show you, the darkness will be removed, it will happen to me.
You can also contribute to it .
Raviji has given a good suggestion but please do not regret me .
We all try to compete together and try to speak negatively .
The speciality of our country is - Kumbh Mela .
Kumbh Mela can also be the center of attraction of tourism .
Very few people of the world will know that all these long time hundreds of people come to the bank of the river .
For the last two days I have been watching that many people are uploading the tunes of the Simhastha Kumbh .
I would like the tourism department of the Indian government , the tourism department of the state government to oppose it .
Photography , and telling people to upload themselves by making beautiful photographs .
How will the weather become sufficient and people will also know how many varieties of things are being filled in the corner of the Kumbh fair .
So it must be done .
Juo , this thing is true , I had met the chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh . They used to say , we have given special emphasis on cleanliness .
And that's not just clean there.
From there people also take message of cleanliness .
I believe that this Kumbh festival may be religious - spiritual fair , but we can also make it a social opportunity .
How does the love of water increase from this Kumbh fair , how the faith towards water increases , how can we also use this Kumbh fair in giving a message of water conservation .
This important day of my great countrymen , Panchayyatiraj in the evening I have to meet you once again .
Man Ki Baat, Julia 201
You will remember that during the past I had discussed a book of lovechandji 's utterances and we had decided that whatever book we read would share with everyone through the medium of Narendramodi app .
I was seeing that a large number of people have divided information about many types of books .
I liked that people are discussing and discussing the books written on science , technology , innovation , history , culture , trade , lifestyle on many such subjects .
Well, I must talk to you about some other books.
But I have to accept one thing that now I can not give too much time to read books .
But one advantage is that if you are sending people to write then I am getting the opportunity to know about many books .
But from the experience of past month I feel that we have to move it forward .
Why would we make a permanent Book corner zone on the NarendramodiApp and whenever we read new books, discuss it there.
And you can also suggest a good name for our books corners.
I want this Book's corner to become an active manch for readers and writers.
Keep reading , writing and also keep on divided it with all the partners of ' Ki Baat ' .
There are many kinds of effective efforts going on in the country towards water conservation .
People have told about traditional methods and methods .
Midia also has a lot of new swings on water conservation .
There are governments , agencies , everything is doing at the battlefield .
Seeing the efficiency of socialism the mind is feeling very good , it is getting very satisfied .
Like in Jharkhand at some distance from Ranchi , in Araram village of Organisation , the enthusiasm that the villagers there have shown about water supply has become an example for everyone .
You will also be very happy to know that Ishaan has become the first state of India 's beautiful state Meghalaya which has prepared its water policy .
I congratulate the government there .
In Haryana , those crops are encouraged in which less water is needed and there is no harm to the farmer .
I want to give special pleasure to the Government of Haryana that by communicating with the peasants he inspired them to gain less water from traditional farming .
Now the time of festivals has come .
On the occasion of festivals many fairs are also organized .
Why do we not even use this fair for water conservation
Satellites , some things enjoy enthusiasm in us and specially gives new energy to the achievements of children , their perfections , and therefore today I feel like talking about some children and these are - Nidhi Baipotu , Monisha Joshi , Devish Ravat , Tanush Jain , Harsh Devdharkar , Anant Tawari , Prati Nag , Arthrava Deshmukh , Arantesh Ganguly and Hardik Ala - Nanda .
Whatever I say about them you will also be filled with pride and enthusiasm .
We all know that cancer is such a word from which the whole world is scared .
It seems that the death door is standing but all these ten children have destroyed not only cancer-like disease in the jungle of their life but have named India in the whole world with their practitioner .
Actually this month the World Children 's Winners Games was organised in Moscow .
This is such a unique sports competition in which yang cancer survivor meaning those people who have come out fighting cancer in life take the same part .
In this competition competition competitions like shooting , chess , swimming , raning , football and table tennis have been organised .
All these ten champions of our country have won the moon in this tournament .
Some of these players have won the moon in more than one game .
My dear countrymen , I am sufficient assure that you must have been proud of the success of the sky , in the interior , India - I am talking about Chandrayan-2 .
Sanjiv Haripura of Jodhpur of Rajasthan , Mahendrakumar Daga of Kolkata , from Telangana .
Aurobindorao, many such people from different parts of the country, have written me on Narendramodi App and MyGov and they have intended to discuss Chandrayan-2 in 'Man Ki Baat'.
In fact , with the point of view of interior 2001 was very good for India .
Our scientists had left A-SAT in March and then Chandrayan-2.
At that time there was not much discussion of big and important information like A . . .
In just three minutes from A-SAT missile, we had the ability to break satellites three hundred kilometers away.
India having achieved this achievement became the fourth country of the world and now on 22 July the whole country saw with the pride that Chandrayan - 2 had lifted its wing towards the interior from Sriharikota .
But if you ask me what two big learnings have been received from Chandrayan-2 , then I will say , these two learnings are - Feyth and Fearlessness i . . faith and imperfection .
We should be dependent on our telescopes and capacities , we should have faith in our immunity and capacity .
You will be happy to know that Chandrayan-2 is completely covered in Indian color .
It is Indian in the form of aim and emotion .
It's completely an indigenous machine.
The way our scientists finished all the technical problems by uniting in the Vikramshi period , in the day and night and launching Chandrayan-B is unprecedented .
This great penance of scientists has been seen throughout the world .
We also have to face temporary setbacks i . . temporary problems in our life , but always remember that the ability to cross them is within us .
I am very hopeful that Chandrayan-2 campaign will inspire the youth of the country for science and innovation .
Therefore science is the only way of development .
Now we are waiting for the month of September with surprisingness when Lander Vikram and Rover - Pragya will be inaugurated on the surface of the moonlight .
Today through ' Man Ki Baat ' , I ask to share information about a very interesting competition with the students of the country along with the youth partners and request the youth and youths of the country for a queue competitiveness .
Gynaecology related to interior , Space Mission of India , Science and Technology - This queue will be the main subjects of competitiveness , like what to do for rocket leaves .
How to establish satellite in the room and what information we get from satellite , what happens to A-SAT , many things are there .
I resist young partners , students that participate in this queue competitiveness and make it interesting , interesting and memorable with my partnership .
I specially inspire schools , boys , enthusiastic teachers and teachers to make their schools victorious .
Encouraging all the students to join it and the most thrilling thing is that the Government of India will take the most qualified students from every state to Sriharikota at their cost and in September they will get the opportunity to become witnesses of that moment when Chandrayan is getting down on the surface of the moon .
This will be the historical event of their life for the victorious students .
But for this you will have to participate in quiz competitiveness , you will have to get the highest number , you will have to win .
Comrades , my suggestion must have come to you - Yes , you have a pleasant opportunity .
My dear countrymen, you must have noticed one thing.
The words of our mind have accelerated the cleanliness campaign from time to time and in the same way the efforts being made for cleanliness have also always inspired ' what kind ' .
This journey started five years ago is being established today with the participation of the people , new standards for cleanliness .
It is not that we have achieved ideal situation in cleanliness , but the way the campaign of cleanliness from ODF to public places has been successful , it is the power of the imagination of one hundred and thirty crore countrymen , but we do not have to escape from this much .
This movement is now moving towards beauty with cleanness .
Just a few days back I was watching the talk of Shriman Yogesh Saini and his team in Midia .
Yogesh is the engineer of the army and has returned to the service of Maa Bharati leaving his job in America .
He has spent a few years before not only cleaning Delhi but also making it beautiful .
He started with his team with the garbage of Lodhi Garden .
Through Street Art , the work of decorating and decorating many areas of Delhi with beautiful paintings .
From the walls of the Over bridge and school to the huts , he started cutting off his town then the people got together and this program started .
You will remember how Prayagraj was also decorated with street painting during the Kumbh .
I came to know that brother Yogesh Saini and his team played a very big role in it .
Whether there is any sound in color and lines , but the message of those indulgents who are made of it proves to be more effective than thousand words and we also feel this thing in the beauty of the cleanliness campaign .
It is very important for us to develop the culture of making West Towelth in our society .
If you say in one way , then we have to move forward in the direction of making waste .
My loved countrymen, in the past I read a very interesting drop on MyGov.
This command was of the brother Muhammad Aslam living in Shopia of Jammu and Kashmir .
He wrote - Man Ki Baat ' is interested in hearing the program .
I am happy to say that I played an active role in organizing my state Jammu and Kashmir in the Community Mobilization Programme - Back to Willage.
This program was organised in the month of June .
I feel that such programs should be organised every three months .
Along with this arrangement of online monitoring of the program should also be done .
With my opinion it was the first such program in which the people directly contacted the government .
The message which brother Muhammad Aslamji sent me and after reading it my desire to know about the BACK to Village program increased and when I came to know from this area then I felt that the whole country should also have its information .
The people of Kashmir are so interested in connecting with the mainstream of development , how exciting it is , they know from this program .
This program lasted for weeks and in almost four and a half thousand Panchayats of the state government officials informed the people of the village from the area of government plans and programs .
How can it be strengthened more .
How can they increase their income
What effect can their services produce in the life of ordinary humans  The people of the village have also declared their problems unconscious .
Friends , not just did not imagine in this program that the officers returned to the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in Panchayat , so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village .
In order to make that program interesting many other things have also been included .
Under Khelo India sports competition has been organised for children .
Further , Sports kit , Job card of Manrega and SC-ST certificates were also divided .
The people of Kashmir became participants in this festival of development .
The joy of this is that the program of Back to Village was also organised in such remote villages , in reaching where government officials had to travel one and a half days on foot for mountains roaming through inaccessible roads .
These officers also reached those bordering panchayats , who always stay in the Othar of the pillars coming across the border , not only in the sensitive areas of Shopia , Pulwama , Kulgam and Anantnag districts .
Some officers were so impressed by their welcome that they were staying in the village for more than two days.
Such programs and participation of people in it show that our brother-in-law of Kashmir wants Sushan , this also proves that the strength of development always falls heavier on the strength of the boy - boy .
It is clear that those people who seek to spread hatred in the path of development , ask for obstruction , they can never be successful in their nefarious warriors .
Sriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendra , honored with my loved countrymen , knowledgepitha Purskar , has presented something like this in the month of the month of Shravan in one of his poems .
In this poem he said . . the construction of rainy season and water stream is unique and on seeing its beauty the earth is faint .
In the whole of India people of different cultures and languages celebrate the month of the month of the month of the month of the month of the month of the month .
In this weather whenever we see around us then it seems as if the earth has covered green sheet .
During this time the festival of patronage of love of brother and sister also comes .
When the matter is going on in the month of Shravan then you will feel very happy to know that this time most devotees have joined in the last four years in the Amarnath Yatra .
Since 1 July till now more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave .
The number of pilgrims who had joined this journey running for 60 days in 2015 has joined this time only 28 days .
For the success of Amarnath Yatra , I specially want to praise the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests .
Those people who return from the journey become admirers of the feeling of glitter and spirituality of the people of the state .
All these things are proving to be very beneficial for tourism in future .
I am told that even in Uttarakhand this year four Dhamas journey has started , since then more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham in one and a half months .
After the physical offerings made in 2013 , for the first time in such a record number the pilgrims have reached there .
My father is sufficient that you must go to those districts of the country whose beauty glitters a lot during monsoon .
To see this beauty of our country and understand the feeling of the people of our country tourism and journey , perhaps no other teacher can be more than this .
My father is well wished that this beautiful and life-saving month of secretion will communicate new energy , new hope and new comparatives in all of you .
Similarly the month of August comes in memory of ' plants ' .
Although when we look at TV then only one side of the rain shows us - all sides are flooded , filled water , trophic jam .
You're very grateful to all.
I also want to join you in this journey .
I also have the same concern as you are concerned about the test of your children .
But if we change our way of watching tests then maybe we can become anxious as well .
In my last thing I said that you must send me your experience on the Narendra Modi app , I am happy to hear that .
The students whose work has been very successful , the parents , some thinkers of the society have sent me to write a lot of things .
Those who have heard , who have read , who have told me , will also talk some of them .
Whatever I feel , how much of it will be .
I want to listen to the messages that they have sent to India ' s youth who have the honor of such Bharat Ratna Shriman Sachin Tandulkar .
You must do hard work , but decide a real achieved goal for yourself and try to achieve that goal .
When I was playing cricket, there was a lot of expectations from me.
So it was very important for me to find a solution for this .
So I thought I would rather quit and fulfill my goal.
But if that is fulfilling the goal of my loyalty and he is fulfilling , then I am definitely doing something good for the country .
And that goal I always tried to achieve .
My focus was on the words and goals gradually became comfortable .
I'll tell you that it's very important to have your ideas negative.
Why resistance
Why not compulsion
For how to fight with others we make our time strong .
Why don ' t we compete together .
Why don't we decide to break all our old records
You go, you can't stop moving forward.
And when you break your own old records, then you will not have a chance to enjoy , satisfaction , no one has a chance , a satisfaction will appear from the future.
Do not consider friends tests to be the game of figures .
Do not stay stuck in the number of places wherever you reach .
Life should be associated with some great purpose .
One should walk with dreams .
These tests are true whether we take care of them or not , our speed is right or not .
And therefore if dreams are huge , irresistible then testing will become a joyous festival on its gain .
Every test would have a step to fulfil this great goal .
Every success will become the key to that great purpose.
And what will happen this year , what will happen in such tests , do not remain intact in it .
Walk with a very big motive and if sometimes remains less in it then depression does not come .
And the courage to try with greater strength will come .
Thousands of people have written me small things with mobile phones on my app .
Shree Gupta has put stress on the fact that healthy mind remains in the body itself .
Students , along with your studies keep in mind your health so that you can write properly in the test .
Now I am not so on the last day that you start to sit down and go to run three kilometers , five kilometers .
But one thing is true that especially in the days of test how your heart is .
Our daily life of 365 days should be incomplete with our dreams and dreams .
I agree with one thing of Shriman Prabhakar Reddieji , they have specially warned that you should sleep on time and you should revive whales waking up in the morning .
One should reach the examination center before taking the entrance and other things .
This thing has been done by Prabhakar Reddieji , maybe I do not obey to say because I am a little sad about sleeping .
And many of my friends also complain to me that you sleep very little .
And this is possible.
Well, we're not talking about sleeping.
If there is some difficulty in some parts of our body , even in our body then you must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable .
Not only this , our daily activities also disappear .
And that's why we don't consider any cheese as small.
You must go , which is certain you do not get yourself fixed in the habit of understanding with it .
Certainly, look at it.
Friends , sometimes I have seen that the students who go for examination have two types of students .
You must have seen these two types of students.
If this thing can be done better than me , then check up is done which has mastered and those who have checked the world 's big players .
Chempian Vishwanathan of Vewa Cheese will tell his experience .
Come , let us learn the way you check out from them in this test .
Hello, I am the joy of Vishwanathan, first of all, read your exams and start my talk.
I'll talk a little about the tests I gave and his experiences.
Researches have started looking like problems coming in life later .
When you are playing then you do not know what pain will come now , even in classes you do not know which question will be asked in the test .
If you are calm , healthy and have sufficient sleep then you will get the right answer which will give you brain at that moment .
Therefore stay calm .
Do not give too much pressure on your own , do not keep too much expectations , it is very important .
Look at it as a challenge - I remember what I have seen during the year , I can raise problems .
In the last minute the things which you do not think properly , pass through important things .
In some cases you can remember with teachers or students who will be helpful in writing in the test .
If you repeat the questions which you feel difficult then it will be fresh in your mind and you will be able to write about it better in the test .
Therefore stay calm , take enough sleep , do not stay in excessive faith , do not stay depressed , initially there is fear but I can successfully cross these tests .
Therefore keep complete faith in the way .
Vishwanathan ' has actually spoken very important things .
Sometimes we used to listen to the destruction of Arjun ' s life - how did his eyes stay on the bird ' s eyes .
Regrettably walking , wrapping the books in the last moments , then your mind can not be calm again .
Laughing , laughing a lot , walk with friends as Jox says , as soon as you see , the atmosphere of peace will be fulfilled .
You can imagine Kalpa or a lake at the bottom , and you can see beautiful things beneath the lake .
But suddenly in some water the stones burst and boiling starts in the water , what would be seen the beautiful things that were visible in the lake
If water is calm then things may be so deep that it appears .
But if water is unconscious then nothing is visible below .
Then I feel, no... if I get some lighter... then I'll feel better.
So I've developed my own tactics.
Perhaps it may be my experience , which will also benefit you .
Rajat Agarwal has told a good thing .
They write on my app - We feel light with friends , family members for at least half an hour daily , father has told this very important thing , because mostly we want to sit to count how wrong we have done .
We get stuck in it itself .
Do not do this , brothers .
Build half an hour after coming out of these .
The thing of Rajatji is really like understanding .
While expressing it in the present context of Ramcharitmanas , they are trying to reach this culture of the country and the world .
Such worshipped muraribapu also has a very important time for the students .
And he is also a teacher , anxiety is also and that is why there is concentration of banana in his words .
I feel that by accepting the situation we can be very happy and happy .
In your test you will definitely get success and if success is not achieved then you will not have the glory of being unsuccessful and you will also have the pride of being successful .
I also appreciate Pujayashree Muraribapu that he gave us a very good message .
Friends , today I want to tell another thing .
I am watching that this time those people who have told me their experiences have definitely discussed yoga in them .
Well, my friends, I will make it clear today, if you start doing yoga from morning then it will be wrong with you.
But this thing is true that students are in life or in the north of life , yoga is a big challenge in the development journey of distance .
There is easy chewing .
Look, if you can do it.
I have a lot of faith in it .
That's not the guys.
But if we read the instructions then maybe we cover us or yes , well , let us go , I have to go like that .
And I will inspire you whether you go into it for five minutes , but definitely read the instructions .
If we read for the first time , then it seemed that it does not come to me , but if I read that thing again , then I have come to mind that neither the question nor the question has been asked in another way , but this is the same thing that comes to me because of not understanding the questions some questions are difficult .
Rao , he has put a burden on patience .
In very less words also a very good message has been given to all the students .
Come , let us hear the messages of Rao Saheb .
This is from Bangalore to C.
En.
R.
I am speaking .
I understand that it is natural to have anxiety because of examination .
And in it it is a competitive test.
Don't worry, you do a good job.
I am like this to my young friends .
There are many opportunities in this country forever remember that .
Like mountains and trees you also have the authority to stay here .
You should have strongness , sensitivity and penance .
With such quality you will be successful in every test and in other attempts .
How is the way to talk about a scientist ' Good Blast '
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of scientific mind .
Inspired the children of the country that change I am the leader of Rao Saheb .
That's what they've done - nista, penance, that's the same thing - dedication, determination, deligence.
If you're stuck, you'll be scared too.
And the golden future is defending you to do good work.
Now interesting on my app has given almost a message to the right experience of examination .
They have said that in their families there is an effort to create a positive environment at the time of examination .
This thing is true that Sachinji also said and Positiv Aproch , Positiv Frame of Mind .
We read in our study about the researcher Thomas Elva education of electric ball .
But friends have often thought that how many years have they taken to do this work  how many times they got fail , how much time has gone , how much money has been spent , how much depression would have occurred due to failure .
But today this electricity , that bulb also illuminates our life .
It is said that the chances of success is also hidden in failure .
Who does not recognize Srinivas Ramanujan  One of the calculated names of modern times - Indian scholars , you will know .
The subjects of counting were not included in their official education , they did not even have any special training .
But he gave deep contribution in various areas like metametical analysis , number theory .
K.
Rolling is an excellent example that success can be achieved any time .
Hairy Potter category is popular worldwide today but in the beginning it was not so .
They had to face many problems .
Roling had said that in difficulties he used to put the entire energy in such work which was really important for them .
Nowadays tests happen not only to the students but also to the entire thinking , and to the entire school and teacher , everyone .
But without the client and the teacher the student is alone that condition is not good .
If there are teachers , lawyers or sinner students , all of them together making a team and moving forward in a similar way with a similar thinking then examination becomes easy .
Mr . Keshav Vaishnav has written me on the app - they have complained that parents should never put pressure on their children to bring more marks .
They should be encouraged only to prepare .
If the child is talking to his friend then do not stop him .
Make a light environment , make a positive environment , your daughter or daughter , see how much coffee comes .
You can also see that coffee.
Friends , one thing is certain , especially I want to tell young friends .
Every moment new research , new technology , regulating colors of science are seen .
And that's not what we just feel.
We like to join it and we also want to go ahead with the raft of science .
I am doing this because today is the national science day .
The science festival of the country is celebrated on 28 February as the national science day .
28 February, 128 Sir C.
Raman had described their research Raman effect .
He got noble reward for this discovery .
That is why the country celebrates February 28 as a national day .
Gynaecology is of the people of science .
And without science and technology new research can not be possible .
On this national science day new research has been put on the country .
All these things of knowledge , technology should be made easy association of our development journey .
And this time there is a theme of national science day Make in India Science and Technological Drive innovatives.
Friends , sometimes success is achieved after a long time and when success is achieved then the vision of seeing the world changes .
If you are very busy in the examination , then you may be able to fulfil many things in your mind .
But I also want to tell the countrymen this thing again .
You must have heard in the past that there has been a very big and important research in the world of science .
The scientists of the world laboured , muscles came , did something and after about a hundred years a success took place .
Our scientists have found out the gravitational Waves.
This research is a very far-reaching success of science .
This discovery does not measure the theory of our great scientists of the past century but is considered a great describe for physiotherapy .
This world will come into use all human species .
But being an Indian we have the joy of this fact that dreams of our country were associated with the honeymoon scientists of our country in the process of entire research .
In future also our scientists will be trying to advance research .
In international efforts India will also become violent .
And my countrymen have made an important decision in the past.
To achieve more success in this research, the government has decided to open it in Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory Tunk, which is called Lego.
By combining India this process will get new energy and new speed .
India will definitely become an active partner in this large scientific research process of human welfare among its limited resources .
Once again I encourage all the scientists , read good wishes .
From time to time you can listen to my mind by making a mess on that number .
You can also hear in your mother 's language .
The number to miss, 8108-8108 again where I am.
81908 - 81908 posts , your examination is starting .
Well, hey, hey, goodbye is the budget.
On the day of Paramadise we all celebrated the festival of Christmas and now preparations for the welcome of the new year are going on .
India is full of diversity .
On one hand every festival goes waiting for another festival .
Sometimes it feels that India is such a country where there is a sense system running from festival .
This becomes the reason for the economic activities of the poor people of the society .
From me many good wishes of all the countrymen of Christmas -LRB- Natal -RRB- and many good wishes of the new year of 2016 .
The year of 2016 brings a lot of happiness for everyone.
New joy , new enthusiasm , new imagination will bring you new heights .
Sri Ganesh V . from Pune .
Sawlaskar has written to me that this weather is the weather of the tourists .
Tourists from all over the world come in large numbers .
People also go to see the holidays of Natal .
The more clean our tourist places will become India ' s sixties in the world .
I welcome the thoughts of Ganeshji and I am bringing the message of Ganeshji to the countrymen .
Anyway we call the guest goddess Bhav , where we have to come any guest there .
At the same time , at our tourist places , at the favorite places of tourists , at our travels , indeed it is a special purpose worth giving .
Although they are ordinary carpenters and work hard works , makes fun .
He has done such a unique work that his words are very often printed .
And when that thing came in my mind then I also felt that I reached this point .
In Bhojpura Gaya he has made 100 toilets till now considering that this work is a sacred work without taking his hard work .
I am giving Dilip Singh Malviya a very brilliant brilliance in the end .
Sometimes we hear depression things about the country .
And this is the thing that pushes the country ahead and then it seems very natural for them to be proud of taking the glory of Dilip Singh in what spirit .
This is the result of the unfathomable efforts of many people that the country is moving forward very fast .
By gaining stature hundred crore countrymen are moving forward even a day and increasing the country as well .
Besides education , excellent professionalism and daily new opportunities .
The people of normal family who can never reach till the windows of the bank , it is a big task to provide easy dimension under the mudra plan .
Who can forget this context of Yashoda Mata and Krishna  Where Balkrish had opened his mouth and made the mother Yashoda see the whole of Brahmind .
The destruction of yoga has made India aware of it .
The matter of cleanliness is swinging in the house in a way .
The participation of the citizens is also increasing .
After all the years of independence in the village where electricity can be reached , how much enthusiasm and excitement is there due to the removal of the darkness of that village , perhaps we can not come to the people living in the cities or those who use the electricity .
Till now its extensive discussion has not been done in the procession , but I am confident that media will definitely reach such villages and the biggest benefit from this will be that the workers of the government who are doing this work will get so satisfied that they will get so much enjoyment that they have done something that is going to change any village , any life .
Whether these good services should be reached or not by farewell , poor , young , young , women .
That is why it should not be reached that what did any government work and no government worked .
But therefore they should reach that if they are interested in this matter then do not let them go .
For getting their hak they should also get information
We all should try that the truth , good thing , the thing about the work of humanity , the more people can reach it .
This is also the work of one service .
I have also made a small attempt to do this work in my way .
I can't do everything alone.
But what should I do from what I am doing
A common citizen can also join me by downloading Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone .
And I keep splitting such small things on it .
And it is a matter of happiness for me that people also tell me a lot of things .
How will I reach without the help of this
Come on, let us all together bring the words of the common human beings in the language of common humanity and inspire them, to get their goods
After that this thing was also going on in all the departments of the government .
My young partners , on 16th January the Government of India has to start the complete action plan plan plan of Startup India , Stand up India .
And in this program the I . . . . , Central University , N . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Like , if there is a digital world or IT business , this startup is for them only .
Yes , we have to bring changes in it according to the needs of India .
We'll get the market.
In the same way is the intellectual relationship of our youth slightly limited to some cities .
This thinking is wrong .
In the corners of India the young men have reflection , the Chem should get the opportunity .
This startup should not be adequately limited in India , Stand up India .
And I also insist on the state governments that we move this thing forward .
On 16th January I will definitely talk about this in detail while presenting your presence and will always be required for your information .
The birth anniversary of Swami Vivekanand Ji is on 12th January .
Who are getting inspiration from Swami Vivekanand Ji .
On 15th to 12th January Swami Vivekanand Jayanthi -LRB- National Youth Festival -RRB- is celebrated in the form of national youth festival .
This year he is of 12th January to 16th January in Rampur of Chhattisgarh .
And I have come to know that this time their theme is because their organisation is based on the theme , that the theme is very good , Indian youth of Development Skill and Harmany has told me that more than 100 thousand youths from all the treasuries of India are going to gather .
The view of youth India is to be decorated .
In one way dreams have to be fulfilled .
There is a feeling of complication .
Can you inform me about this youth festival
I specially insist on young friends, that's what Narendra Modi App.
So I'll wait, my friends, to know your ideas about the youth festival on Narendra Modi app.
Dilip Chauhan of Ahmedabad Gujarat , who is a Visually Children 's Teacher , had celebrated accessible India Day in his school .
He told me his feelings by calling me, sir, and in my school there was an accessible Indian hub.
And the competition of students was unique . We enjoyed in school and inspired and encouraged children to help the disabled in the society .
I think it was the first to be done by your father.
Dilipaji is very charming to you.
And now you are working in this area yourself.
If you understand these things very well and give it then there will be many problems .
Sometimes there comes a chance to meet such a person in the society , then some thoughts come in our mind .
We also express our views of going to them according to our thinking .
And many words have been used in Jag for such people , but always contemplation has been going on towards words .
Every time people feel that identification of this word does not look good for them , it does not seem respectful .
This year when the Government of India started the successful India campaign , then I had to go to that program .
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu and especially the program to go there i . . that day I could not be present in that campaign program .
But it was to go to that program that some thoughts were going on in my mind .
Then at that time it was thought in my mind that the soul has given some damage to those who have given some deficiency in the body , some part of the body works properly , they also call them infected and knows in the form of wildlife .
But sometimes they come in their introduction then it is known that we see a deficiency of them from the eyes , but God has given them some special effect .
After this my mind came to mind that from the eyes we feel that he is a disabled , but it feels that there is no extra power available to him .
And then I thought that why should not I use the word Divyaang instead of the individual in our country
These are those people who have such organs that there are other such organs in which there is divineness , there is a communication of divine potential which is not with us , ordinary body .
I like this word very good .
Can our countrymen , can we popularise the habit of word Divyaang in place of disability
I hope that this thing will go forward .
We have started the successful India campaign .
Under this I will make it easy for the people of Divyaang by improving the intestines both physically and indirectly .
Whether there is school , bus station , there are rail stations in which there are rimps . easy parking , easy lift , braille lipi .
In order to facilitate their availability in all these new researches should be done , technology should be done , arrangement should be done , sensitiveness should be done .
We have taken the risk of this work .
Public participation is also being found .
Those files should not be dead .
In the past , how did the Indian government make an effort to reach the schemes which are desperate
In our country gas syndrome is given subsidis .
The government made some changes in it .
Whether the product is eating , base card , with the help of that product the world 's largest , largest direct binefit transforcing skim brings the subsidi to the bank account of the beneficiaries directly .
This plan is known by the name of first and the experiment has been very successful .
By the end of November approximately 15 crore cooking gauges have become the beneficiaries of the urban pilgrimage plan .
Government money has started going straight in the account of 14 crore people .
No witches, no need for any reconciliation, no chance of any breeding.
On one side the campaign of base card , on the other hand to open the products , on the other hand the state government and Indian government together prepare the list of beneficiaries .
Till now through different plans about 40 thousand crore rupees have started going straight into the eating of the beneficiaries .
The sixth estimate on me is that the direct direct direct interference of around 35 to 40 plans is being included in the binefit transfort .
My great countrymen , 26 January , a golden moment of Indian publicity day , this is also a pleasant union that this time the horse riding doctor Baba Saheb is the 125th birth anniversary of Ambedkar .
In the case also special discussions were kept on contracting for two days and felt very good .
All the birds , all the members have made a very excellent discussion on the purity of shutdown , importance of shutdown , understanding shutdown in the right way etc .
We should move this thing forward .
In the right sense of the day of childbirth , can the people join the system
Our detention gives us a lot of authority and the official is discussed in a positive way , and should also happen .
But obstacles also give pressure on obstacles .
But it has been seen that the discussion of duty is very less .
Most of the swords are there when all the four sides are declared , on the walls are written , hoardings are kept that it is our holy fruit to donate .
During maternal grandfather there is a lot of talk of famine , but why does not there be talk of famine in social life also .
This year when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar then by making a merit on 26th January can we enjoy colonies in schools , in our villages , in our cities , in different societys , in the organizations , competition , competition , competition etc .
If the residings of the millions of countrymen go on taking one step after another with the activity then how big history can be drawn .
Can you send it to me
I want to know your thoughts .
Send me that on my portal May Gov.
I would definitely know what I think about the youthful activity of my country .
One feels like doing a little information .
On the day of 26th January when we celebrate the day of Prajasattaka then by the citizens , by the children of school colleges , as much as the statues of great men are there in our city .
And this I am not asking for the government .
The dance of the society , the country , can you make it our natural nature
On 26th January we all tried together that the idols of such great men should be glorified , cleaned there , cleaned the premises and all this happens easily by the citizens .
Great countrymen, once again wishes a lot of new year's 2016.
You must also have got the opportunity to go .
And trade - drills must have started with new excitement .
On the other hand preparations for Christmas must have started .
Festival has its own importance in social life .
From every corner of the world continuously gets the message of natural threats and if you have never heard or have not thought then you get the message of natural threats .
People are also feeling how fast the effect of adventurous change is increasing .
Many people have died .
In the moment of this contract I express my regret towards all those families .
The state governments are able to work with full potential in saving relief .
The central government also always works with care .
Now a team of Indian government has gone to Tamil Nadu .
But just as we want to talk about narrowness all around then we have needed to bring a lot of change in it .
Since today 15 years ago natural sufficiency was a source of agriculture because then maximum natural sufficiency meaning duration was limited till now .
Today its form has changed itself .
At every level we have become very important to work for the formation of our capacity .
Governments , civil society , citizens , every small big institution has to work for making very scientific capacity .
After the earthquake of Nepal I had spoken to Pakistan with Vadrapadhanashree Nawaz Sharif .
And I had made them a suggestion that we should make a joint statement for the eastwards of supplied by the SAARC countries .
I am happy that a tabletok of SAARC countries has been concluded in Delhi on the basis of exercise i . . bad practices .
It's a good start.
Today I got the phone of Lakhwinder Singh from Jalandhar of Punjab .
-LRB- Yes , Lakhwinder Singh speaks to Jalandhar of Punjab district .
We do organic farming here and give guidance to many people .
Lakhwinder Singh ji , I am very happy to hear your messages .
Not only this , you know the problem of the peasants .
And your concern is true but this happens only in Punjab Haryana .
This is our habit throughout India and in a traditional way we walk on the way to encircle the remains of our sin .
But the pain you have expressed is true .
The first way is that we have to train our fellow brothers and sisters .
But this is not true.
The remains of the bridge are also very expensive .
It is a biological fertilizer on its own .
We put it white .
Not only this if its small pieces are made then it becomes a dry fruit for animals .
Second because of burning that the upper layer of the ground is burnt .
Think for a moment that our bones are strong , our heart is strong , the kidney is good , everything is good , but if the skin above the body is burnt then what will happen
Even if the heart is going on then you can not live .
The upper layer of our land burns which pushes our yield land towards death .
And therefore its positive efforts should be made .
If this knot is burnt again in the ground then also it becomes fat .
Or if a little water is inserted by melting in some skin then it becomes the best type of organic fertilizer .
The animals come in the work of food and our land also survives , not only this , if they put the date prepared in it then they give double benefits .
Once I got the opportunity to talk to the peasants who have eaten bananas .
And he told me a good experience.
Earlier when they used to eat bananas and when the sin of bananas was over they had to spend five thousand , ten thousand , fifteen thousand rupees every hectare to clean them .
And as far as the people who picked up it do not come with the trekker - baker , they used to stay lying like that .
But some peasants proved that six-six-six-eight-eight-eight-inch pieces of this thumb were made and they were burnt on the ground .
The water which is in that thumb keeps the water alive .
Dear countrymen , the next three December will remember the International Day of Persons with DC Abilities worldwide .
During the past I had discussed on the donation of the body .
For organ donation I had also discussed the helpline of Notoine .
On 2nd November Indian Organ was considered as Donation Day.
Many well known people including film actress Ravina Tandon joined it .
Organ donation can save valuable life .
When the organs go from one body to the other then that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life .
I believe that in this area also widespread awareness will increase and in reality the needy will get the best help , because this help can not be obtained from any other person till date .
I told earlier and on 3 December it is considered as a disabled day .
Physical and mentally handicapped people also have an unprecedented courage and capacity .
Sometimes pain occurs while they are fun .
Sometimes the feeling of bitterness and patience is expressed .
But if we change our vision towards them then these people can inspire us to live .
You can inspire to get rid of something .
We start crying even if there is a small problem .
- Then it is remembered that my problem is very small , how does it feel .
And therefore all this is the source of inspiration for us .
Their imagination is also praiseworthy to reflect the methods and complications of living with their life .
Jayed Ahmad, I want to talk to them today.
The age of 40-42 years is .
In 16th century Jawad Ahmad was shot by the treasonists in Kashmir .
The capability of staying up on your feet has gone forever , but Jawad Ahemad did not believe it was defeated .
Even the injury of treason can not defeat them .
The body does not support but for twenty years they have been drowned in the study of the children .
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped people
How to develop arrangements for handicappedness in government machinery at public places
They're working on it.
He also turned his studies into that direction .
He achieved Master Digri in social work and became an awakening citizen as a social worker he is doing a fun revolution today .
Does the life of guidance not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I specially remember the life of Jawad Ahemad his penance and his dedication on December 3 .
In deficiency of time I am talking to the same guidance but in every corner of India the lamps of such inspiration are flowing .
The new light of life is spreading , is showing the way .
On three December there is an opportunity to get inspiration from them by remembering all these .
The person of the middle class , be the person of the lower middle class , be poor , poor , suffering , afflicted , worrisome , for them the government has to keep on running with governmental arrangements .
And sometimes in a civilized life sometimes somebody gets a bad experience from the side of some government boy .
And that very bad experience changes our point of view towards the governmental system throughout the life .
Often we do not even know because it is so easy that we do not know that any governmental arrangement , some government servant is doing this work .
Hope worker in our country which is network throughout the country .
We have never heard of the discussion of hope worker among the people of India or have you heard .
But as the world famous family Entrepreneur of Bill Gates Foundation their success has become a visible worldwide .
Such Bill Gates and Milinda Gates both of them were given the Padma Vibhushan at the time of the past .
They do a lot of social work in India.
The time of their retirement and whatever earnings they earn for the whole life are using for the work of the poor .
In the last days Orissa government has made special respect on the Independence Day of a hope worker .
On the basis of the primary arrangements they have to be taken for treatment .
Use pesticide mosquitoes in every house , put pressure on it .
Just as your child slept properly and as much as care should be taken , the same way Ashavarkar Jamuna Mani Singh is working with complete dedication to prevent the entire village from mosquitoes .
And he compared to malaria , prepared to face the entire village .
If you come, you'll have so much jamunami.
How many lakhs of people will be around us .
We will look at them with respect .
Such people become very capable of our country .
How big partner of happiness of society becomes .
I sing all such hope workers through the medium of glory .
In relation to the motivational incidents of an e-book clean India , regarding the ideal village of the community and health sector , regarding health .
I'm warning you to see it.
Not only this , show others also .
Read it and it may happen that you have the mind to understand some such thing .
So you must migov.
Please send in.
Such things do not come very quickly in our mind but that is true for the society .
Only positive is the biggest energy .
You also tell good incidents - divide them .
So you can become a social teacher in the true sense .
The temperature of the earth should no longer increase .
It is also the responsibility of everyone , anxiety is also there .
And the first way to escape temperature is .
The rest of the energy conservation of the energy is 14 December National energy conservation day .
Many plans are going on from the government side .
Bulb plans are going on .
I once said that one should bathe in the light of full moon for hours by shutting down the light of Sheri ' s light at night .
They should experience the light of the moonlight .
Some friend had sent me a link and I got an opportunity to see him, so I thought I was telling you that.
A woman named Noorjahan in Kanpur does not appear on TV , she may have got the privilege of reading more .
But they are doing such a thing which probably no one thinks .
They are working to give golden energy to the poor by using sun rays .
He has made a unit of women and has established a plot of phanus running from Solar energy .
And they give finance from the rent of 100 rupees a month .
People take phanus in the evening and come in the morning and give it again for charging .
And in a large number, I've heard that 500 households come.
Now see what the world ' s largest people will do for the change of hypocrisy , but such work is being done to inspire everybody in a unique way .
And anyway the meaning of Noorjahan is to publish the world .
They are spreading light through this work .
I congratulate Nurjahan and also congratulate J . . . because he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur in front of the country and the world .
Very pleasant.
I have done a phone to Mr . Abhishek Kumar Pandey of Uttar Pradesh .
We ask from Vadrapradhanashree to know that in what way the mudra bank runs in which way the adventures like us are helped .
Music traders encourage adventures .
The mudra produces the chances of earning .
And mudra makes it strong in true sense .
This mudra plan is going on to help small adventures .
However the speed at which I want to go is left to come again .
But the beginning is good.
In such a short time approximately 66 lakh people have received those people from the Prime Minister 's posture scheme of 42 thousand crore rupees .
Whether it is dumb , white , white , reader , milk seller , small traders and if I am happy then it is about 24 lac women in 66 lac .
And among those who get this help most of the SC , ST , OBC are those people of this category who try to run the family with respect by doing their own hard work .
Abhishek has spoken of his enthusiasm himself .
There are many reports coming to me .
Someone just told me that some childhood bounces in Mumbai .
Under the mudra plan he got a measure of Rs . 8 . lakh from the bank .
And he started the trade of Suez Dress cleaning.
I had said during my cleanliness campaign , cleanliness campaign is such that it will prepare new adventures .
And Shailesh Bhonsle told me.
They have brought a tenker he is working and I have been told that in such a short time two lakh rupees have also been lost to the bank .
Therefore this is the objective of our mudra plan .
And he makes it out, but before they used to bring money from more business.
And due to excessive business and other reasons the money that used to be spent now started to be saved more than one thousand rupees every month because of coming in their hands .
And a good business of their family also began to grow slowly .
But I would like the plan to be more propagated .
All our bank becomes more sensitive and helps maximum small people .
Actually , these people run the economy of the country .
Only those who do small works can get the economic of the country .
We also ask for pressure on it .
It's better but it's better to do more... my loved countrymen, on 31 October, on the day of Sardar Patal Jayanthi, I discussed an India, the best India.
There are these things towards which there should be constant awareness in social life .
What is the plan of the program
What is logo
How does Lok Bhakti increase
I told you for all these information .
I was told that many suggestions are coming .
But I compare more information .
I possibly possibly possess many challenges .
And I have been told that participants have to get quantity .
Some big plans have been declared .
You also run your creative brain.
How can this mantra of unity become an India , excellent India make this mantra a mantra connecting one Indian .
Be even jewelry , glorious , lifeless , and easy to connect everyone , what do the government do
What does society do
What does civil society do
There may be many things .
I am sure your information will come into use .
My dear brothers , sisters , winters have come .
My intention will be that for keeping the body healthy definitely for some time use this good weather exercise - Yoga will definitely do for this .
And make the environment in the family itself , there is only one festival of the family , one hour everyone has to do this together .
You see how consciousness comes and how much body gives the whole day .
So if there is a good weather then a good habit also falls .
Wish my loved countrymen once again .
Jaihind...
My great countrymen, my smile to yourself.
Once again the privilege of joining everyone with the point of mind has touched me .
Today the fifth day match is going to be played in Mumbai between India and South Africa .
This category has been given the name of Gandhi-Mandela category .
And therefore the importance of last match has increased a lot .
I wish all the players a lot.
Today I want to congratulate the friends of the Kannur center of Akashwani .
I would like to take care of such awareness and active people in the area of such a climate centers across the country then the purpose of running the country with folk participation will get a new power .
And this is why I am giving great pleasure to all the partners of the Kannur Akashwani center .
Students of St . Mary Premier School of Chittor have written me a letter in Kerala .
The paper is special in many ways .
First of all these children have prepared a picture of Mother India from the mark of their thumb .
The picture of the map of India has sent me .
Earlier I felt very interesting , how he got the map of India made from his thumb print .
But as soon as I read their journal I understood how good resistance he has given .
These are those children who have tried to make the chief minister aware , not this .
They are running the campaign of folk singing for organ donation .
He has also developed the plays going to many places so that people understand the donation of organs .
Organ donation becomes a recurrence and activity.
These children have written me in the letter that in what way your mind should inquire people about donating organs .
They say , body part donation should be made a festival .
In recent times I have many messages on the phone cell too .
Devashji of Delhi has also given me such a message .
In which people come forward and help each other .
This thing is very important , I feel like .
There is a need of donation of more than two and a half lakh kidneys , heart and liver every year in the country .
But in the country of 100 crore we can gain only five thousand transplants .
Every year one lakh eyesight is needed .
And we can reach Kewal up to twenty five thousand .
In front of the need of four eyes we can only give one .
Efforts have also been made to give guidance to the states in this direction .
Some states have made a great attempt to accelerate it by reducing the script .
Today I can say that Organ Donation - Tamil Nadu is in front of the place of donation .
Many social institutions , many voluntary organizations are working very well in this direction .
National Organ and Telugu Transplant Organisation - Noto has been established to encourage organ donation .
A helpline working for twenty four hours is also available for 180  1140 services .
And we have been told there that is the technician Bhunjitha .
The best description of the joy of doing sacrifice is in this very synonymous Bhunjitha mantra .
A few days back we had seen everyone on TV that went to Delhi .
And that operation was successful.
A life has survived.
Organ donation should be done by us to fulfil the feelings of technician Bhunjitha and we must fulfil this thing .
Famous countrymen , in recent times we celebrated the festival of Navaratri and Vijaya Dashmi .
And a few days later the festival of Diwali will also be celebrated .
Even this is excellent , Ganesh Chaturthi .
The organization of India - Africa Foren Summit is being organised in the capital of India from 26th to 2 October .
This is being organised at such a large level for the first time on the earth of India .
The leaders of the European countries and the unions have been invited .
Outside Africa there is a combination of the wages of the biggest combination of African countries .
The relations between India and Africa are deep .
As much as the population of India is of African countries .
And if we gain both then we are the third part of the world .
And say, it was the same landscape millions of years ago.
Later these two branches of the Indian Ocean were divided .
In natural resources we get rid of such good things .
And about 2 lakh people of India have been living in this country for a long time .
India has economic relations with African countries . cultural and political relations .
But India plays a very important role in training the youth of most African countries .
More than 25 thousand African students are studying in India .
And today there are leaders of many countries of Africa who have read in India .
So we're not so deep
And from that point of view this peak council is very important .
Normally when the peak is found then the chiefs of different countries are found .
Similarly the chiefs have to sit in this peak council .
But our effort is that there should also be a mixture of people in it .
About 100 schools participated in it .
There were also outside schools of India and India .
And thousands of children of thousands of schools have written the words of giving wages to the relations of India and Africa .
On the other hand an exhibition named Memorial of Mahatma Gandhi from Porbandar , the birthplace of Mahatma , mobile exhibition is moving from Porbandar to Northern states on 22 October to Delhi .
Lakhs of children of school saw this exhibition .
The people of the village observed how Mahatma Gandhi was playing a great role in the relations of Africa and India , how was the effect of Mahatma Gandhi 's personality on both of these landscapes .
The extent to which the children of schools of our small places are also thrilling , their vision is wide , and how deep they think , they are seen in them .
Although this peak combination is of India - Africa , but how is the chance of connecting the people becomes clear to us .
I congratulate all the children participating in the competition , more than 16000 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development .
On 15th August last time I had put a precaution about the community ideal village plan.
After that many communicable friends have fulfilled this work .
I'm very fond of it.
Last month a workshop was organised in Bhopal .
Where this ideal village is being formed in it , the clerks there , some of the members there , the Indian government , the state government , all of them together discussed deep discussions about the ideal program program .
Several kinds of new things came into mind and many exciting things were found to be known .
Some of these things I definitely want to bring in mind .
Jharkhand , in a way is a large area , tribal area .
He chose Parsi village Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to make an ideal village .
It was difficult to go there for government workers as well .
I am enjoying the adventurous council , Shriman Karia Mundaji .
And in such a way that school gives education to children in the morning and to make children a teacher in the evening .
And approximately five hundred fifty innocents were divided by these children , reading and writing them .
If you see , there is no geopolitical arrangement in the society , no circumambulation , no special arrangement , but how big change can be brought from the willfulness through the village council .
This village is considered good for the production of Sherdi and for the wooden jaggery in the kingdom .
Shriman Ruwalaji started the Kurtai Gol Sherdi festival on 11th March in this village .
People of old declared life also came .
The government officials who worked there also came and an exhibition was also adopted for sale of sugarcane products .
How can the village be made the center of economic activities , how can the sale of the same product of the village be made by them .
Together with the ideal village the attempt to make a self-reliant village is actually the officer of rejoicing Shriman Ruwalaji .
My elder brothers - sisters , talk of mind and how can it happen if there is no talk of cleanliness
The Savita Rai of Mumbai has sent me a message through telephone . We clean our houses every year for the preparation of the day .
This Diwali makes us clean along with our house and even after Diwali keep its cleansing .
He has paid attention to the truth .
I want to remind you , my elder countrymen , after the festivals of Deepavali last year , especially the media run a big bloom in our country and told everything wherever the cracks of flame had fallen after Diwali and said that this is not right .
All the midwives had run a campaign of awareness .
And the result of this came that immediately after Diwali a clean campaign was going on .
So Savitaji is true of your point of view that the more we worry before the festival we should do even after the same festival .
One should do in every public program .
And today I want to give special pleasure to the entire media world of India .
On the second October , on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhiji and for one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan I had convinced me to participate in the successful combination organised by India Today .
He gave Clin India Awards and I was also watching how many types of activities are going on .
For this people themselves are working like the One Lyke One Mission .
How many places are there in our country which have been kept so clean .
All these things came to light and at that time I had concluded that pleasant work of India to Day group .
Through the medium of ETV for the last one year they are constantly encouraging the work of cleanliness .
He has added about 55 - 56 thousand schools to this work as much as 51 lakh children .
Whether there is a place , station , religious place , hospital , park , in many places a big campaign of cleanliness has been run .
Now these things themselves show the ability to fulfill the dream of clean India .
Its Mission Clin India is hundreds of channels of our country , thousands of prints are there , because of lack of time I can not take the name of everyone , but everyone has run this campaign .
And therefore according to the information that Savita Raiji has given today the whole country is considering this work as its own and is pushing it forward .
From Meghalaya we have written a letter to our Rajepal Manniya Shanmuganath there .
And through that letter I have mentioned the Mavalyanong village of Meghalaya .
He has written that for the last few years this village has taken the precaution of cleanliness and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this cleanliness .
And it is said that a few years back he got the award of the most clean village of Asia .
I am happy to hear this that there is also such a village in Meghalaya in the far-flung North East in our country which has been engaged in the cleaning area for years .
This nature of the citizens there has become the culture of the village .
This is the only one that creates faith in us all that our country will definitely become clean .
In the year 2001 when we will rise to one and a half centuries of Mahatma Gandhi ' s efforts we will be able to tell hundreds of millions of people by excavating our chest that we have freed our Indian mother from dirt , my great countrymen , on 15th August I had told them on the Red Fort that some such things have been done .
When the poor person goes for a small job then no one knows how many problems he has to face . How do the groups of children get their money fixed .
I have never heard that there are some psychologists in the world who fully observe any person in the interview of two minutes .
And in this opinion only I had declared that why should we not ruin the tradition of intervy for small dresses
My young friends , today I want to say pride that the government has completed all the procedures and now the interview of the central government's group D group C and group B is not being taken on non-getted steps .
This rule will come into force from January 216 .
We will not make any obstacles in the process where the process is going on , but from January 22016 it will come into effect .
So you want young friends to be my luck .
Similarly, in the past genius, we declared an important plan.
Gold has become part of social life in our country in a way .
Gold is considered to be the medium of economic peace .
Chavi is considered to be of the time of contemporary time .
This tradition has been going on for centuries in social life .
Under this you can put your gold in the gold bank and the bank will give you a tax on it . The way you collect money and get a tax .
Earlier we used to keep gold in the lord and we had to pay the lord ' s rent .
Now I will put gold in the bank and the bank will give you money in the form of a business .
Talking countrymen can no longer become a wealth of gold
Can the gold die convert from the corner into a living power or not
Just this is what we have to do.
Now do not keep gold in the house .
Its safety and exercise . Two benefits .
Surely take advantage.
There is another plan . Sovereign gold bond does not come in your hand , but a paper comes .
But the price of this paper is as much as one gold . On the day you return this paper , the same amount of gold will be returned to you the same amount of money .
So we are starting these plans .
Therefore now we do not need to buy gold .
So this plan with the security guarantee will be presented to the countrymen for the next week .
I am happy to say that we are also bringing gold coins of Ashok Chakra .
Our freedom has been about 0 years , but till now we have been using foreign gold coins either gold Builian bars , pockets have also been used .
Why should not our country have indigenous marks
That is why in this village weekend and density will first be available to ordinary citizens from Dhanteras . Indian golden coins with five grams and ten grams of Ashok Chakra are starting .
Along with this the gold boolean of twenty grams will also be made available to the people .
I am confident that the new plan will bring new changes towards economic development and I will get your support .
My great countrymen , on 31 October is the birth anniversary of the iron male Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .
On reminding one India , excellent India , Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel the map of impossible India comes out .
For the unity of India this great man has given a lot of contribution .
Iron has introduced its capacity in the form of human .
We will offer tribute to Sardar Saheb , but he had a dream of making India one , which he had made geographically , but this mantra of unity should always become the medium of our thought , behavior , expression .
India is a country full of diversity .
Many pages , many sects , many speaking , many species , many wearing , some varieties of our country , and this is the same diversity because of which our splendor is .
If this is not diversity then perhaps we would not be able to take the appearance for which we take pride .
And therefore diversity is the mantra of unity .
Peace , harmony and unity , this is the root of development .
For the last few years on 31 October the programs of Ran For University are organised on the banks of the country .
I have heard that this time also its organisation is being organised four times .
People are preparing for the race of fervor , unity .
The race of unity is the race of development in the right sense .
In other words the guarantee of development is also a race of unity .
Come , give tribute to Sardar Sahib .
Increase the mantra of unity .
I have to go to Britain on the second day of my countrymen , Deepavali .
This time I am very thrilling for my trip to Britain .
Government of India also and state governments also give scolorship to such classes of society , then those who are individuals , those who are pursued , those who go to learn foreign countries .
I believe that when such children of India go to participate in Britain then this place of Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage for them .
And therefore I am saying that I am specially thrilled about my trip to Britain .
And now that building is becoming the wealth of hundreds of crores of countrymen , along with which the name of Babasaheb Ambakkar is connected then you can estimate the happiness of people like me as much as possible .
I have to get another opportunity in London .
Many years ago what God Basheb had done for folk treasure , what women have done for power is actually a studyer of the world .
The democracy of the statue of Lord Basheb at the house of Landon was the best example of how many great men of India used to think about these centuries ago .
Now you know that when such incidents have joined then the mind of all the countrymen gets thrilled .
My loved countrymen are connected with what kind of folk .
Later on there is also discussion on the skyline of your papers .
There is a discussion by calling government officials .
Some people write their problems and try to bring relief from problems also .
In countries like India we should learn many languages .
Although a good boat has stopped between us .
I was finishing a year when I went.
Today we are entering new year .
I want my great countrymen to be happy once again .
Jayhind.
The original reading of the mindset program of the Prime Minister on the Old India Radio .
My great countrymen, smile to yourself.
There is a basic thinking in my life and because of this my immense belief has been on the life force but the thing of your mind has taught me , which has come to know , which I can tell from what we think is more incomparable than that .
Our ancestors used to say that genitals are part of that god .
I can tell my experiences of ' Ki Baat ' that there is a lot of power in our ancestors ' thinking , it is very true , because I have experienced that for the matter of time I used to ask for information and every time I could talk about only two or four suggestions but in lacs of numbers people used to give me information , this is a big power .
Yes , these lacs of papers gave me big bondage too .
Different departments of the government have analyzed people 's letters and what is the matter of justice . What is this thing that is personal question , which is not in the mind of the government .
The source of these information will become ' a matter of mind ' , who thought that .
I had said that one day , Self-view doctor and the whole world got surprised .
Perhaps in all the countries of the world somehow in the number of lacs selphie white doctor ' and the girl got the poorest .
And when he used to do Selfie View doctor then he used to increase the enthusiasm of his daughter but also used to create resistance inside him .
Even when people were watching it felt that the neglect towards the beggars would have to be looked at now .
There was a silent revolution.
Keeping in mind the tourism of India I had told the same citizens . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But how big a change has occurred . Such tender people of every corner of India sent , perhaps the tourism department of the Government of India , the state government has never thought of it or we have such beautiful heritage .
There was a time for nation.
Doesn ' t the time ask if ' poor for fashion '
Today I am very satisfied that in the last one year the sale of fertilizers has almost doubled , now this work has not happened because of some government manifesto .
On a TV channel I had seen that a retired teacher was standing in a widow lady line, to leave the sabsiddy.
The general population of the society is the middle class , the lower middle class for which it is difficult to leave the society but such people have left .
Is not this silent revolution
Does not this vision of life force
Governments also have to learn intellectuals that the work that happens in our government offices is a powerful , powerful and complicated society of a large population outside the humble .
Every small thing made its own and tried to connect itself for the good of the country .
What can be the biggest satisfaction of this
This time I thought of making a new experiment in Ki Baat .
I had prayed to the citizens of the country that by doing telephone record your questions and information .
I'm gonna pay attention to him in the matter.
It's a very pleasant experience.
All the adults have given the message .
I liked to hear some messages myself . I liked it .
My team is working on the rest .
You might have taken a minute or two minutes but your phone cool for me, your message is very important.
The entire government will definitely work on your instructions .
But one thing was surprising for me and was joyful .
However it seems as if there is negativeness around , negativeness .
But my experience remained different .
This Panchavan thousand people had to speak their own words .
We could say anything . but I am surprised that all things were like that in the shadow of ' the talk of mind ' .
Completely positive, informative, creative.
More than the remaining 0 percent one energy filling , enjoying things have been told by people .
They must have heard radio.
For the visionless people how important the radio would have been washed me with this point .
I am watching a new dimension and telling such good things that these people and the government are also sufficient to make sensitive .
I have given this message to the visitor from Alwar Rajasthan .
Listen what they ask - Surely listen - my name is Pawan Acharya and I am from Alwar Rajasthan .
I am confident that like a wind your feeling will definitely reach every corner of India , fall .
We have suggested properly , neither the mood nor the mood of the soil nor the dunes of the soil are also incomparable .
On the day of my elder countrymen , on the day of Ganesha Chaturthi I got an opportunity to spend two - three hours with the goal of the army .
Water, land and navel protectors, we have nine-services, land mercenary, air-service-- Armi, Air Force, Navy.
The war of 165 was completed with Pakistan for 50 years .
He has built a Shauryajli exhibition near India Gate in Delhi .
If you see from the point of view of history then you can learn a lot and see for inspiration in life then perhaps it can not be any more inspiration to serve the motherland .
If fight is of Hajipira , is of the real north , if you see the scenes of Jeet near Hajipira then thrills and pride towards our soldiers .
My meeting with these virgin families also happened to meet the families of the sacrifices and those who participated in the war are also in the northern part of life .
If you want to make history then it is important to understand history deeply .
I returned in two and a half hours but you will definitely take three-four hours .
Look at the strength of democracy . a small child has advised the elderly , but the child has forgotten to call his name fast .
We should also make the nature of cleanliness and also make arrangements for cleanliness .
I got a lot of satisfaction from this child 's message .
I also have to hear a lot .
I see the best thing from them that the country 's relations are also discussing the cleanliness of India .
And look at the other side , Parliament on one side and on one side the child of this country talks on both cleanliness - what could be the good fortune of this big country
This movement which is going on - the environment of nefariousness towards the dirt - awareness of cleanliness has come - it will also turn the governments out to work , move and move .
Even if there is deficiency we have to move forward and this is India in 2001 , when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi , we will work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi , and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say .
Once he had said - if I have to choose one of the two freedom and cleanness then I would prefer cleanliness , after independence Gandhi had more importance than independence .
Gulshan Aroraji has kept a message on Maya Gaw from Delhi .
He has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Dindayalaji .
My great countrymen , the life of great men always remain the reason of inspiration for us .
And it is not our task to examine what the great man was thinking .
Now extract any text , some of the texts of history will get the name of some great man .
In the coming days we remember all these great men , let us bring the message of their life to the household , and we also try to learn something from them .
I'm specially asking you to move once again for October 2.
2 October is the birth anniversary of worshipped Bapu Mahatma Gandhi .
I had also said last year that you will have all kinds of fashion clothes , all kinds of fabrics , there will be many things but there should also be a place of khadi in it .
I once again touched or touched , from October 2 to one month is free from the khadi .
You should take advantage of it .
And along with khadi the handloom should also be given the same importance .
The poor maker of khadi will go to the house of the widow and hence in this diwali we must give place to our house , give place to our body .
And see when the sale was almost doubled .
How many poor have benefited .
The work which the government can not do with the declaration of unemployed money has been done by the people with small help .
This is the genetic power and therefore I guess you once again for this work .
Great countrymen , I am very happy with one thing in my mind .
You should also get a little taste of this joy .
I had gone to Kolkata in the month of May . I had come to meet the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose .
His nephew Chandra Bose had organised everything .
For a long time I got the opportunity to spend the evening of happiness with the family members of Subhashbabu .
You can imagine how happy will be for me .
Perhaps the family of Netaji had come to know about going to Vadrapadhan Niwas together for the first time in his life .
But more than this the thing of happiness for me is that in the Vadpradhan Niwas place the good fortune of such hostility has never come , which is going to meet me in October .
More than 50 people of Subhash Babu and the entire family live in different countries . All people are coming specially .
I got a message from the side of the Bhargavi Kanda and listening to his voice , I felt as if he feels lider on his own and maybe he would become a leader .
The name is Bhargavi .
I ask Vadrapradhanji to make such a request that you wake up the young man about water registration so that in the coming time the violence of the young man increases and in future the important cooperation of the young man is being chosen and run by the government .
Every tenant in the democratic system has the fate of the country and this awareness is increasing gradually .
Some years ago we used to see that our switching is working only as a controller but in the last few years there has been a big change in it .
Today our switching is not just controlling but has become a comfortable friend in a way and in all its thoughts and plans there is a favorite center . This huge change has come .
The maternal maid should be upgraded and we should also keep cheating .
Where am I in the time of switching or drinking water after first donation .
How pure is the work , everyone should do it .
On the ultimate day I visited Kashi .
I got a seventh student named Nitiz Pande .
In the Central Vidyalayas of Banaras Hindu University these seventh shoes are different .
Although it is of very strong intelligence .
But in such a small age I saw his interest in the research of physiques .
How did the conventions come in robots , what was he saying . That brother was very proud .
There should be continuous questions in the mind of the child . Why
How to .
When
This child should ask the mind .
Similarly I had to meet a very small boy with a golden petal .
There is an age of nine years .
She is a daughter of a very poor family of Sadabriz Patal , a resident of Sundarpur of Varanasi and I am surprised that the whole of the burning song is narrow to her .
But the biggest thing I felt that when I asked him he used to call Shalok as well , used to speak meaningfully in English , used to speak in Hindi .
Only Geeta reads or others are different .
If we take history then in the evening it has everything in the mouth .
Say . We all are surprised to know how he is so resistant in the whole family .
I was really very impressed.
Sometimes some children have the desire of selebrity but Sonam does not have anything like this .
Apart from what you see on TV , other than reading in the newspapers we do many things and sometimes there is also enjoyment of such works .
Similarly, my conversation with these two kids was memorable for me.
I have seen that some people take a lot of work for me in the matter of mind .
"Sandeep ji, what will you do to me
To do once in a month also I have to make such a difference , time has to be done so much .
Sometimes my friends of our skyscrapers have to sit waiting for half an hour .
But I respect your feelings .
I am your career for your suggestion .
Now it is right only for a month .
The ' Ki Baat ' has been completed for one year .
Do you know how much Subhas Babu used to use radio
He started his radio from Germany and in relation to the freedom movement of the citizens of India he used to keep them alive through radio .
He started the independent Indian radio from a weekly News Bulletin.
They used to run this radio in English , Hindi , Bengali , Marathi , Punjabi , Pushtya , Urdu all languages .
I also got a year after talking about the sky on the window .
I also talk about you and this is my satisfaction .
In the next month I will regain for the talk of minute .
You should keep getting the signal .
Government also benefits from your suggestions .
The beginning of improvement begins .
Your contribution is very much for me .
Once again, you're all very happy.
Chief Minister Shri Narendra Modi ' s name is Ki Baat .
My great countrymen, smile to everyone
Once again I got an opportunity to come in the midst of our father to talk about me .
People in remote areas are celebrating the festival of Onam and in the past the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan has been celebrated all over the country .
With regard to social security the Government of India has implemented many new schemes for common humanity .
I am happy that in very little time , everyone has accepted these plans in a large quantity .
I had done a little bit offering this protection plan to our arms with the permission of the security banden.
The primary information that has come to me is that since the beginning of this plan eleven crore families have joined this plan .
Mostly I have also been told that about half of the benefits have been received from mothers and sisters .
I consider it a good signal .
I give all mothers and sisters many good wishes of the sacred festival of Raksha Bandhan .
Today when I am talking to you , since then the ' Jan Dhan Yojana ' was taken over by a big hand .
What work has not been done for eighteen years will happen in such a tiny time .
I also saw the poor
We had to open the account from the shoe balancing .
But the poor saved the income of twenty thousand crore .
News have got employment .
You will be happy to know that in a year this banking sector , economy and poor people - one lakh three thousand financial fighters camps have been organized to solve them .
Not just to stop opening the accounts .
And now thousands of people also became officers of getting overdraft under this ' Jan Dhan Yojana ' and they also took it .
And the belief that the poor could get money from the bank was also born .
I bring it to you now it is your job to maintain it .
You should be active in eating all of us .
I'm sure you do this.
Last days the incidents of Gujarat , the Tandwe of violence made the whole country restless .
But in very little time all my famous citizen brothers and sisters of Gujarat have taken care of the situation .
The situation worsened that was the first active role and once again the Gujarat went on the path of peace .
Peace , unity , brotherhood - this is the right way .
And we have to walk by taking care of the path of development only .
Development is the solution of our problems .
In the past I had a chance to meet the scholars of Sufi tradition .
We got an opportunity to listen to them .
And what I really realized was the way I got the opportunity to hear their words that some music is singing in one way .
I felt very good .
Perhaps it has become the most important thing to bring the true form of Islam in the world .
I am convinced that Sufi tradition which is associated with love , generosity will bring this message far and wide which will benefit the human species .
And I also ask others whether we believe in any community , but sometimes you should understand the Sufi tradition .
I'm gonna get a more chance in the coming days... and I'm very lucky to see this invitation.
In India , the scholars of the Buddhist tradition of many countries of the world are coming to Bodhgaya .
The first Prime Minister of India Pandit Nehru had gone to Bodhgaya .
I have to get the opportunity to go to Bodhgaya with these scholars worldwide .
My elder brothers and sisters, I once again want to tell you something specially today.
I have also mentioned this thing in ' Mon Ki Baat ' .
It must have been heard, I must have heard in the message, I must have heard in the public meetings, and I must have heard in Ki Baat.
Every time I have come to tell one thing that the mind of the government is open in this regard which is going on in relation to the Land Exhibition Act .
I am ready to accept any information for the treatment of Kison and I have been telling it again and again .
But today I have to tell my brothers and sisters that the matter of improvement in the Land Aquarius Act came out , carefully came that if the village , poor peasants have to do whatever they want to bring water to the fields , to bring electricity in the village , to make roads for the poor people , to make houses for the poor people of the village , to make arrangements for the employment of the poor youths of the village , then we will have to leave the ears from the square of this Alamdarshah .
And then the proposal of improvement came .
But I saw that so much fear was spread , Kisan was so scared .
My poor brothers and sisters , my misconception should not be deluded , and fear should never happen .
And I do not want to give any such opportunity to anyone who fears , misleads the cases .
We presented an ordinance.
In the coming the meeting of Ordinance is being completed on the third August .
And I've decided to let him finish.
That means that the situation that was next to my government has now been reproduced.
But one work was incomplete in it .
And for this reason we had brought them in Ordinance but because of these discussions they also got screwed up .
And I blame my brothers and sisters that the John - Jai Kisan for us is not the hero , this is our mantra .
The village, the story of poor Kisan.
And that is why on 15th August I had said that not only the artificial department but also the Kisan and Kalyan department will be built .
And when it comes to the war of 165 then it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastriji .
It is also natural to remember Jawan - Jai Kisan ' mantra .
It is also very natural to remember all those martyrs who keep the Tripura flag of India alive .
I pray to everyone connected with the victory of the war of 165 .
They got the opportunity to hear and I was happy that in the field of science India is doing a very good job in many directions .
Our scientists are actually doing excellent work .
Now we have the opportunity to reach these researches to the people .
How to convert the principles into equipments
How to connect Lab with Land
It has to be pushed forward as an opportunity .
I got some new information.
I can tell you that it was also an extremely inspiring for me .
And when I had told in the last time that our students should move forward towards science .
After this meeting I feel that there are many opportunities , there are many possibilities .
I get many letters of citizens .
It has been written about Skil Development .
From Chidambaram of Tamilnadu Shriman Prakash Tripathy has put emphasis on the need of good teachers for primary education .
In the education sector the burden has been kept on reforms .
I have also told my young friends one thing .
On 15th August I had told above the Red Fort that why for the interview of the lower level
And when the interview comes then where will every poor family , widow mother , widow , get the job with whom
The poor do not have to run for emotion .
Exploitation doesn't happen, it doesn't work.
These days in India guests from many countries of the world have come .
For health - especially for the reduction of maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate the world 's fourteen countries together contemplated on India 's land .
This program was done for the first time in any other country outside America .
Although there has been a lot of improvement .
India ' s praise has also started at international level , yet this figure is not small .
Just as we got rid of the polio , we got rid of it as well as the death of mothers and children .
The world has accepted this .
Nowadays the news of dengue continues to come in brothers and sisters .
This is true that dengue is dangerous but its protection is very easy .
And what I am talking about is directly connected with it .
We need advertisमेंट on TV .
In this matter public education is being done at a broad level but our attention is not taken .
I will tell everyone carefully that we should not make death so cheap .
Life is very expensive.
Regrettably about water , sadness about cleanliness - that becomes the cause of death that is not right .
The facility of free checking of dengue is available at around five hundred four centres in the entire country .
Together cleanliness should be given a lot of importance .
These days festivals are held in our country in a way from Raksha Bandhan to Deepavali .
Why should not our every festival be joined with cleanliness now
You see, the culture will become the nature
Hitendra Mahajan, Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan . but in his heart the desire to serve the tribals of India is strong .
Both of these brothers have increased the glory of India .
This year these two brothers got victory in this race .
Increased the respect of India .
I give these two brothers a lot of good wishes .
But the most enjoying me is that they are doing this with the intention of getting rid of their entire campaign ' Tim India - Vision for Tribal ' - tribals .
Look, how every man is trying to push the country forward
And that is why when such incidents are heard then chest swells .
Sometimes because of perspective we sit in the wrong way with our youth .
My experience in relation to the youth is different .
Sometimes if we talk to young people then we also get to learn a lot .
I have found many such youths who say that my brother , I have taken a break in life that ' Sande on Cycle ' .
Some people say that I have kept a cycle-de every week .
Today I want to give special pleasure to the Maharashtra government .
The new government of Maharashtra completed this work and now Babasaheb will be the magnificent , inspiring memorial of Ambedkar there .
When Indians traveling all over the world go to London then the memorial of Babasaheb Ambadkar which is now to be built there by the Maharashtra government will remain our inspiration place .
I am giving sadness to both these efforts to respect the Government of Maharashtra to Babasaheb Ambadkar .
I'm very good to you.
Man Ki Baat, John 201
My loved countrymen, Namazam.
Once again after a long interval, in the midst of the mother-father, we are starting the talk of the people, the talk of the people, the fact of the people, the fact of the people.
While sitting in the midst of itself , in a light atmosphere 130 crore people used to listen to many things , repeat and sometimes our words became inspiration for us .
You can imagine that this middle time has gone , how it must have gone .
Maybe it wasn't a lifeless program.
I was missing something every minute and when I'm speaking, the words are probably mine, but the story is yours, the sympathy is yours, the sympathy.
I was just using my words, my volunteer and because of that I was missing you, not this program.
One was feeling empty.
But wait a lot on this Sunday .
Finally the opportunity has been received .
In a hereditary environment , minute , light , social , life , which become the cause of change .
In one way this sequence of it gives rise to a new feeling and in one way giving support to the knowledge of new India this sequence goes forward .
I feel intelligence .
Sometimes I feel that this is my journey of contact with myself .
This is the journey from my ego to wages .
For me , with you this silent reminder was also part of the experience of my spiritual journey in a way .
Many people have asked me a lot of questions about how I went to Kedarnath in the race of swing .
Most of the people have brought out political meanings from them .
For me, that was the chance to meet me.
The rest is your advice . I think sometimes it will also be discussed .
As people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar , in the same way your effort to give strength to a positive thing , I am constantly feeling in your words .
The papers which come for ' Ki Baat ' which get input are completely different from the regular government work .
Sometimes the work of pushing my thinking process forward makes some of your words .
If someone writes for cleanliness then he is also showing his disappointment towards dirt but also explains the efforts of cleanliness .
If someone discusses environment then its pain is felt , but along with that he also tells what he has done in himself - he also tells what he has seen and the imaginations that he has in his mind also pains .
That is , in one way I am feeling the glimpse of how the solution of problems is to the society .
Manki Baat is like a mustard for the country and society .
He shows us that there is no dearth of internal strength , strength and tenderness within the countrymen .
It is necessary to include strength and strength , to give opportunity , to implement it .
But ' Ki Baat ' also tells that in the development of the country all 130 crore countrymen want to join with strength and activity and I will definitely tell one thing that in ' Ki Baat ' I have so much media , so much telephone cool comes , but the elements of the complaint are very less and somebody wants anything for themselves , then one thing has not come in my mind in the last five years .
When I am analysis of such things - you can imagine how much enjoyment will come to my heart , how much energy will I get .
Acutaly didn't come to me, you've brought me, you've just made me sit down and you've given me a chance to speak again.
Come with this feeling , then let the order of Ki Baat go forward .
When the catacity was planted in the country then its opposition was not confined to the state area only , till the royal leaders , the movement was not confined to the slopes of the jail .
There was an attraction in the heart of the people .
There was a thirst for the lost democracy.
When eating at the time of day and night then what is the hunger that does not know what is the enjoyment of the rulers of democracy in normal life then it is known when some folk traitors take away .
In Katokati every citizen of the country had started feeling that something has been snatched .
Perhaps everybody in any country of the world has not only given the opinion of their rest of the people , officers , needs for democracy , then such a swing has been seen in this country .
In recent times the Maha festival of democracy , a huge swinging campaign , has been created in our country . From Amir to poor , everybody was happy to replace the future of our country .
When any cheese is very close to us then we do underestimate its importance , its amazing facts also become ignorant .
This number can seem very common to us but if I am in the world ' s account , if we leave one China then in India more than any country of the world have been waiting .
As much as the voters gave a vote in the public meeting of 2001 , their number is more than the total population of America , almost double .
The number of total tenants in India is more than the population of the entire Europe .
This introduces the largeness and comprehension of our democracy .
Till now in the history of the popularity of 201, the world's largest democratic choice was.
You can imagine how large it would be to fulfil this kind of switching and the need for human energy would have been increased .
Millions of teachers , officers and workers can become possible to switch by day and night .
In order to successfully enrich this greatness of democracy where about 3 lakh security personnel of half-sairian team have enjoyed their responsibility , then 200 lakh police personnel of different states also observed labor .
As a result of hard work of these people , this time more than last time has been felicitated .
For donation approximately 10 lakh polling stations in the entire country , more than 40 lakh EVM machines , more than 1 lakh vivid machines , you can imagine how big pen - jam .
All this has been done so that it can be ensured that no litigant is devoid of his litigants .
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh only a woman mesmerising station was built .
You will be surprised to know that the officers of the sweet five had to travel for two - two days to reach there - this is the true respect of the democracy .
The highest level of the world 's merit center is also in India .
This center of opinion is situated at a height of 15000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh .
Besides this there is also a fact filled with pride in this chutney .
Perhaps this was the first time in the history that women have done rituals like men .
The percentage of feeding of women and men in this choosing was almost equal .
One more encouraging fact associated with this is that today Record 8 is a woman friend .
I give multiple enjoyment to each person associated with the switching and switching process and bow to the awakened tenants of India .
My loved countrymen , you must have heard many times from my mouth that ' no book ' , my intention was to give books instead of flowers in welcoming culture .
Since then people have started giving books at many places .
Recently someone gave me a book named Premchand Ki popular Kahaniya . I liked a lot .
Although I could not get a lot of time , but during the drive I got a chance to read them sometimes again .
In simple , easy language their words , which express human sentiments , also touched my mind .
The entertainment of the whole of India is consolidated in their scriptures .
When I was reading the story of his written addiction , then my mind was going on the economic problems in the society itself .
I remember the days of my youth how there were discussions on this subject till night .
The son of the landlord , Ishwari and the hero of the poor family learn from this statement that if you are not aware then the effect of the bad world is not known .
The second time , who touched my heart to the inside , that was ' Idgah ' .
The sensitivity of a child , pure love for his grandmother , such a oppressive feeling in such a young age .
When Hamid of 4 . years reaches his grandmother by taking a chipio from the fair then the human sensitivity really reaches its peak .
In this time a living picture of the problem of life of poor peasants has been seen .
Despite its sin being destroyed , but light accomplishment is so happy that now it does not have to sleep in the fields in hard cold .
Although this time is almost centuries ago but its prostitution is even today as much as possible .
After reading it I felt a different kind of feeling .
When there is talk of reading then in some media , I used to read about the literary library of Kerala .
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village situated amidst dense forests of Idukki .
P . . the teacher of the primary college here .
Chinnathampi , both of these have done unfathomable work for this library .
There was also such a time when books were brought here by binding in the pot and lading on the back .
Today this library is showing a new way to everyone with tribal children .
Gujarat ' campaign was a successful experiment in Gujarat .
In lacs of numbers people of every age had participated in this campaign of reading books .
In the digital world of today , I will also inspire you to take some time to place books in my daily Daily Routine .
You will actually enjoy it very much and write about the books which you read on narendra Modhi app ' so that every source of ' Mon Ki Baat ' can also know about it .
My dear countrymen , I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about the point that is not only present but also a big challenge for future .
I was studying your concentrations on narendra Modi Ape ' and  Mygov ' and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water .
Besides the Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi , the Situated Mohammad Parida of Bhubaneswar besides Yash Sharma , Shahab Altaf many people have written me about the architects connected with water .
Water has great importance in our culture .
It is said about water in the drytham . . . . . . . . . i . . water is the source of life giving energy .
Give your respect to your mother i . . mother like your mother . your grace should be on us .
Due to lack of water many parts of the country are affected every year .
You will be surprised that only 8 percent of the water that comes from rainy season is saved in our country .
Only 8 percent.
Now the time has come that the solution of this problem is taken out .
I am convinced that like many other problems we will also adjust this contact with the ability , collaboration and imagination of one hundred and thirty crore countrymen with public participation , energy .
Considering the importance of water , new water power ministry has been built in the country .
With this decisions will come on every matter related to water .
A few days back I tried to separate something .
I wrote a letter to the serpents of the country , the village chiefs .
I wrote to the village chiefs that in order to save water , to save water , to save water drops and drops of rain , they will talk to the village council by sitting with the villagers and discuss them .
I am happy that he showed full enthusiasm in this work and hundreds of people have committed labor in the twelveth century of this month .
In the village - village people enjoyed collecting one drop of water .
Today I want to tell you about a serpent in the ' Ki Baat ' program .
The people there are once again ready to play their active role for water conservation .
From me every village chiefs , every serpent has many good wishes for their activity .
There are many such serpents throughout the country who have taken the risk of water conservation fast .
In a way this opportunity of the entire village has become possible .
It seems that the people of the village are now engaged in the competition of making water temples in their village .
As I said , many positive results of social effort can be obtained .
There can be no formula to come out of water consolidation throughout the country .
For this various efforts are being made in different parts of the country .
But the goal of everyone is the same , and that is to save water , water conservation .
The dryness lines in Punjab are being fixed.
With this effort we are getting rid of the problem of water logging .
The life of the people of the village is changing due to the construction of a tank in Thimaipalli of Telangana .
There has been a big change in the small lakes built in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan .
I was studying about a social effort in Vellore of Tamilnadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river .
I have also read about those women of Garhwal who are doing a lot of good work together on Rainwater Harvesting .
I am confident that many such efforts are being made and when we try together , firmly then we can also make impossible .
When the people join, the water will survive.
Today through the medium of ' Man Ki Baat ' I am resisting 3 people of the country .
My first resistance is . Just as the countrymen gave cleanness the form of a mass movement , let us start a mass movement for water conservation as well .
We imagine to save every drop of water together and I believe that water is the enjoyment given to God , water is the form of Paras .
Earlier it was said that iron becomes gold from the touch of Paras .
Where am I that water is transparent and a new life is formed from the touch of water from Paras .
In order to save one drop of water start a awareness campaign .
Tell about the problems related to water , along with it propagate the ways of saving water .
I specially insist on the leadership of innovative campaigns for water conservation of different regions .
Whether it is the world of films , whether it is the field of sports , whether it is our partners of media , people associated with social organizations , people associated with cultural organizations , those who are stories and describing , every person directs this movement like his parents .
Leaving the society , joining the society , joining the society .
You see, we can see changes in front of your eyes.
The countrymen are my second resistance and many traditional methods are being used for the protection of water in our country for centuries .
I urge you to shave all those traditional methods of water conservation .
If any of you has got the opportunity to go to the birthplace of Porbandar , Pooja , then there is another house behind the house of Pujaya , there is a 200 year old water tank and even today there is water in it and there is an arrangement to stop rain water , then I used to always say that whatever queen goes to the temple , see this water tank .
There will be many such experiments everywhere.
Come , let us inspire people for water conservation by making a needle of more and more methods connected with water conservation .
You can share your content using all JanShakti4JalShaktiheshteg.
My dear countrymen , I also have to express the glory of this for one thing and also express the glory of the people of the world .
On 21 June once again with the activity of yoga day , three-three , four-four generations of each family came together and celebrated yoga day .
In the awareness that has come to the Holistic Health Care the importance of yoga day is increasing .
In every corner of the world , if any yoga lover welcomes it as soon as the sun rises then that is the entire journey till the sun rise .
Perhaps there would be such a place where there is human and there is no associated with yoga , has taken the form of such a big , yoga .
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian ocean, from Siachen to Sabarine, from Aircraft Carriers, from AC Gyms to the deserted desert, from villages to cities - wherever possible, not only yoga was done at all such places, but also collectively.
The presidents of many countries of the world , chief ministers , well known personalities , ordinary citizens told me on Twitter how he considered yoga in the country of his own country .
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family.
We know very well that for the formation of a healthy society healthy and sensitive persons are required and yoga determines them .
Therefore the propagation of yoga is a great work of social service .
In the year 2001, the declaration of Prime Minister's Awards was a matter of great satisfaction for me to give an excellent contribution to the promotion and devolution of yoga.
This work has been given to those organizations around the world about which you have not even imagined how they have given important contribution in the propagation of yoga .
For example take ' japan yoga niketan ' which has made yoga popular throughout Japan .
Drinking Yoga Niketan runs many institutions and training courses of yourself or volcano .
Take the name of Antonietta Rozzi who started ' Sarva Yoga International ' and propagated yoga throughout Europe .
It is an inspirational example in itself .
If this is a matter related to yoga then can Indians stay behind it
Bihar Yoga Vidyalayas , Munger has also been respected , for the last several decades he is dedicated to yoga .
Similarly Swami Rajarshi Muni was also honored . He established Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University .
The massive upliftment of yoga and the honor of those who bring the message of yoga at home , both made this yoga day special .
To join your thoughts , there is a very big journey for me .
Come let us meet . talk .
Keep listening to your feelings , be cautious , understand .
Sometimes he keeps trying to live the feelings .
Let's get your permission.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Come along with you enjoying ' Man Ki Baat ' , also keep on enjoying the responsibility of life .
Manki Baat, February 2001
Ten days before the mother of India has lost her virgin dreams .
For the protection of hundreds of thousands of Indians we sacrificed their hobby by these magnificent verses .
The countrymen can sleep peacefully , therefore this was done by our virgin dreams day and night .
After the martyrdom of the Veerjains in the tragic attacks of Pulwama there is an adverse impact and attraction of the people and people of all over the country .
Condensations on all four sides against the martyrs and their testimonies have been broken .
I bow down to all the virgin dreams of the country that saved my life from the protection of Mother India .
We all have to face the challenges that have come in front of the country by forgetting the communalism , communalism , stateism and all other opinions so that terrorism becomes even more straighter than ever before .
Our armies have been giving introduction to unique adventure and practitioner from time to time .
To establish peace he has shown wonderful ability .
On the other hand the attackers have also worked to give answers in their language .
It has been seen that how steps have been taken in 10 hours of attack .
The army has concluded to destroy the group of terrorists and helpers .
After the martyrdom of Veer soldiers the motivation of the members of their family through the medium of expansion has been given protection and force to the entire country .
Ramaniran ji , father of martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur of Bihar , also introduces us all the passions that have been introduced in this hour of pain .
He has said that he will also send his other girls to fight against enmity and if necessary he will also fight himself .
The whole country is saluting the unprecedented courage of the wife of the martyrs of Jagat Singhpur of Orissa , Prasanna Sahu .
They have also taken the initiative to fill one of their one girls in the C . . .
When the body of martyr Vijay Soren reached Gumla of Jharkhand wrapped in Tripura then his daughter-in-law had said that I would also join the stage .
The juice of this muscle shows the feeling of one child in the whole of India .
Such feelings are being seen in the household of our virgin martyrs .
I resist the young man that they try to know and understand the passions that these families have shown .
What is sacrifice , penance  We do not need to go towards the ancient event of history .
Sri Omkar Shettyji of Karnataka fluttered on Narendra Modi app has expressed his happiness changing the preparation of National War Memorial -LRB- National War Memorial -RRB- .
I was also surprised and pain was also happening , there was no National War Memorial in India .
This is such a memorable place , where for the protection of the nation the royal stories of the virgins who want their lives can be kept alive .
I decided that there should be such a memorial in the country .
We decided to build National War Memorial -LRB- National War Memorial -RRB- and I am happy that this memorial has been prepared in such a short time .
In the coming days i . . on 25th February we will offer millions of countrymen this national soldier 's memorial to our army .
The country will make a small attempt to lose its season .
The heart of Delhi i . . that place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti have come . Just near it this new memorial has been built .
I believe it would be appropriate for the countrymen to go to any pilgrimage to go to this national soldier 's memorial .
This national soldier 's memorial is the symbol of the grace of the nation towards giving the highest sacrifice after independence .
The design of the memorial shows the unique courage of our soldiers .
The martyrs of Amar Chakra are the symbol of the martyrdom of the soldiers .
The other is the Sircle Veerata Chakra which expresses the courage and harmony of the soldiers .
After that sacrifice is cycle .
This circle shows the sacrifice of soldiers .
Among these the names of the soldiers giving the best sacrifice to the country are written in golden letters .
After this protective cycle shows protection .
There are dense trees in this circle .
The identity of the National Army Memorial will be raised in the form of a place where people will come here with the aim of studying their gratitude to know about the great martyrs of the country .
Who have saved their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can stay safe and develop .
In the development of the country it is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces , police and paramilitary forces in words .
In the month of October last year I also had the privilege of dedicating the National Police Memorial to the country .
That too was the symbol of our same thinking , under which we believe that those who are constantly busy in our safety should be gratitude to the country towards the men and women going to the police .
I hope you will definitely visit the National Army Memorial and National Police Memorial .
Thousands of media and comments are available to me through different mediums for my great countrymen , our minds .
This time as I was reading your comments , then a very interesting drop of Atishay Kshetraji came in my meditation .
He has written that in the year 000 when the British had grabbed Birsa Munda on 3G March then his age was only 25 years old .
Yoga Yoga is also the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tattta on 3th March itself .
They further write that these two personalities are completely from different family backgrounds which have enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand .
It is appropriate to bow down to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand in a way to give tribute to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tatt .
These two great incidents have illuminated the name of not only Jharkhand but also the whole country .
The whole country is committed to their contribution .
Today if our young men need any inspirational personality for guidance then that is God Birsa Munda .
When they used to sleep then the British had hiding them with a lot of swimming .
Do you know why , why did the British take the help of such a caretaker activity
Because the British who raised such a big empire were also afraid of them .
Lord Birsa Munda had defeated the British rule decorated with bindus and cannons only with her traditional shrine .
In reality when people get a motivational leadership then on the strength of the handicapped people 's social desire gets heavier .
Lord Birsa Munda did not conclude with the British only for royal freedom .
But fights were also fought for the social and economic officers of tribals .
They told all this in their tiny life .
In the blind life of worries and adults he spread the shine like the sun .
Lord Birsa Munda gave her sacrifice only at a young age of 25 years .
The dreams of Bharat Mata like Birsa Munda have happened in all parts of the country .
There is no such particle of Hindustan , where no one has contributed in this part of the freedom struggled for centuries .
But unfortunately , the words of their sacrifice , sacrifice and sacrifice have not reached the new generation .
If individuals like Lord Birsa Munda gave us the identity of our existence , then the greatest institutions like Jamshedji gave the country to the nation .
Jamshedji Tata was very interesting in the meaning of which not only saw the future of India but also put its strong foot .
He knew very well that making India the center of science technology and industry is important for future , that was their own vision .
Or , as a result of which the institute of science was established which is now called the Indian Institute of Science -LRB- Indian Institute of Science -RRB- .
Not only this , he also established institutions and industries of world class like Tata Steel .
My great countrymen , the last prime minister of our country , Moorarjibhai Desai was born on February 22 .
Now everyone knows that this day comes only once in four years .
The owner of simple and peaceful personality Moorarjibhai was one of the most distressed leaders of the country .
In the independent India the sequence of exhibition of maximum geography is known by the name of Morarjibhai Desai .
Morarji Desai did the skilled leadership of India in such a difficult time , where the country 's democratic tension was dangerous .
Morarjibhai Desai had jumped into the movement of the Katokati opponent for the protection of democracy .
That is why they had to pay a lot of price even in the old age .
The government of that time had put them in the jail after making their noise .
But when Janta Paksha won in 1 he became the chief minister of the country .
It was also warned in this improvement that the collective performance of malicious officers found under the Kalam-20 and 21 of the detention can not be done .
For the first time such arrangements were made that only after the legislative recommendation of the Ministry the President will declare the status of the status of the status of the status of the status of the factory can not be increased more than six months in a single time .
In this way Morarjibhai made it clear that the way democracy was executed in 15th century by loading the autocratic load , it could not be repeated in future .
Their invaluable contribution to maintaining the premium of Indian monarchy will always be remembered .
Once again I pay my tribute to this great leader .
Like my great countrymen , this year also there was a lot of enthusiasm among the people about Padmapuraskaras .
Today we are moving on the path of a new India , in which we want to respect those people who are doing our work in a necessity at the level of Paya .
On the basis of their hard work those who are bringing positive changes in the life of others in different ways .
In fact they are true compulsory , which remains unsuccessful in the national service ahead of the population , social community and all these .
I want to tell you about some such people .
If we talk about Abdul Ghafur Khatriji of Gujarat then he did a unique job of reviving the traditional disease art of Kachh .
They are doing great work to bring this rare painting to the new generation .
I felicitated former US president Barak Obama with the artwork of the tree of life built by Abdul Gaffur.
In getting Padmapuraskar the Shabid Syed of Marathawad is known as the servant of the goddess .
The way he has submitted his entire life to the service of Goddess , he is indeed uncomfortable in himself .
You will be surprised by listening to Tao Porchon-Lynch of America . Linch has become a living institution of yoga today .
Even at the age of 100 he is giving yoga training to the people around the world and has made one and a half thousand people yoga teacher till now .
In Jharkhand Jamuna Tutu , known as Lady Tarzon , has done adventurous work to face the Mafia and Naksalists of Timber , he did not save only 50 hectares of jungle but encouraged ten thousand women to consolidate trees and wild animals .
Despite being a Divyang in itself it is difficult to find out the example of the works they have done for the production of Divyang women .
He has presented an example in the direction of making women healthy and field beneficial .
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women of their area to become economically by joining their own group .
My great countrymen , what I have been feeling for the last few days I want to talk about the feeling of everyone touching the heart .
Nowadays I am trying to go anywhere in the country , that is , the plan of Ayurveda India Pmjay i . . Chief Minister , some of the beneficiaries of the health plan .
In the last five months of brothers and sisters about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this plan .
I have seen how big changes are coming in the life of the poor .
Now if you know any such poor person who is unable to get treatment without money then tell him about this plan .
This plan is for every such poor person .
The time of testing in my elderly countrymen , schools is in the beginning .
Different education boards in the entire country will start working for examination of 10th and 12th standard board in the next few weeks .
All the students of the test providers , their girls and all the teachers have horrific desires from me .
A few days back a very big event of examination papers in Delhi happened in the form of Townhole .
The speciality of the discussion program was that there was an open discussion on various subjects related to examination .
Some such passes have come out which can definitely be beneficial for the students .
All the students can see this entire program on their parents and teachers youth , then for this rural examination I wish the warriors of all my tests a lot .
My great countrymen , there is talk of India and there is no talk of festival .
Perhaps there is no such day in our country which has no importance , which has no festival .
Because we have this tradition of thousands of years old culture .
After some days the festival of Mahashivratri will come and this time Shivaratri is celebrated on Monday and when Shivaratri is on Monday then its special importance is lost in our mind .
Even on the sacred festival of this Shivratri wish everyone a lot .
My great countrymen , I had gone to Kashi a few days ago I got the opportunity to spend time with Divyang brothers and sisters .
So he said , I am doing the memories of the Chief Minister .
Actually that Divyang was very impressed with the power of young man .
My great countrymen , without mind , have been a unique experience for me to connect with everyone now through the program .
Through the medium of radio I meet with hundreds of families in a way every month .
Sometimes while talking to everyone , listening to the thoughts sent on the phones given by you or reading your journals , I feel that I have considered as the hissos of my family .
This is a very pleasant experience for me .
Friends kissing is a very big source of democracy .
For the next two months we will be busy in all the swings .
And for years what will keep your mind talking to you .
Once again I give everyone a lot of harmony from the heart .
Man Ki Baat, January 2001
My loved countrymen , Namazam , in the 21st century of this month the country got a very sad news .
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to the society .
Lord Basveshwar has screamed us - i . . being responsible for doing hard work , the residence of Lord Shiva is equal to being in Kailasham Dham .
His fame was in the form of a scholar whose English , Sanskrit and Kannada languages were unique .
They were a social reformer.
He put his entire life behind this point that people get diet , shelter , education and spiritual knowledge .
The casualties of the casualties are of every kind , that was the primary of the life of the Swamiji .
Siddhiganga monastery used to organise animals and artificial fairs regularly .
I have got the privilege of gaining the blessings of supreme worshipping Swamiji many times .
On this occasion Kalamsaheb had heard a poem for worshipping Swamiji .
This poem of Dr . Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhaganga monastery beautifully .
Once again, I offer my faith to such great men.
There is a very important institution in our country which is a different part of our democracy and is older than our calculation - I am talking about the square fifteen of India .
No matter what is left to ensure in our country that every citizen of India who has a recorded consultation , registered is given an opportunity to pay attention to it .
When we hear that in Himachal Pradesh maternity center is also established at a height of 15 thousand feet from sea level then in the international islands of Andaman and Nicobar Islands also arrangement of maternal grandeur is done .
Only for a curse
When we hear these things then it is natural to be pride at the square panch .
Keeping in mind a client , he gets the opportunity to use his client , for this the entire team of clients go to the far-flung areas and arrange for maternity and that is the beauty of our democracy .
I appreciate the switching five to constantly try to strengthen our democracy .
I also appreciate all the security workers , other workers who participate in the merit process and ensure free and unsuccessful switching of all the states .
This year there will be folk songs in our country , this will be the first time where the youth born in the 21st century will use their opinion in the public meeting .
For them there has been an opportunity to take responsibility of the country on their shoulders .
Now they are going to become the hesitant of the decision process in the country .
It has been time for our dreams to join the dreams of the country .
I resist the young man that if he is eligible to donate his opinion then he will definitely record himself as a liaison .
Every one of us should feel that becoming a wealthy in the country , getting the authority of the opinion , that is one of the important achievements of life .
Together with it it is my duty to donate it - this feeling should be kept in us continuously .
Because of any reason in life , if you are unable to donate opinion then there should be extreme pain .
Sometimes if something is wrong in the country then it should be painful .
I resist the famous personalities of the country that all of us together get the record of the currencies or make people aware by running an expedition about it on the day of consultation .
I hope that in a large number of youths will record in the form of charity and will give more strength to our democracy by their partnership .
My loved countrymen , this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done some unforgettable works for humanity .
On 23 January the whole country accepted their jayanti in a different way .
I got the privilege of inaugurating a museum dedicated to the verses of my contribution in the struggle of India 's independence on Netaji 's jewellery .
You know that many rooms , buildings were closed since independence inside the Red Fort .
The rooms of the closed red fort have been converted into a very beautiful museum , the dedicated museum dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and Indian National Army  Yad-e-Jalia and the first freedom struggle of 185-year-old and this entire complex has been dedicated to the country in the form of ' Karnti Mandir ' .
In each brick of these museums the aroma of our glorious history is settled .
The particles of the museum inspire us to go inside history to present the story of the verses of our freedom struggle .
At this place the virgin dreams of Bharat Mata - Colonel love Sahagal , Colonel Gurubakhsh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan had played a case by the British rule .
When I was visiting the memories associated with Netaji in the Kranti temple in the Red Fort then the members of Netaji 's family gave me a very special hat in gift .
Netaji used to wear this cap .
I kept that cap in the museum so that people taking a meeting there also see that cap and inspire patriotism from it .
In fact it is necessary to bring the pride and patriotism of his heroes to the new generation repeatedly in different ways .
Just a month before 30 December I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands .
In one program the tricolor had flown in the same place where Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose had flown tricolor five years ago .
This way when the tricolor was roamed on the Red Fort in October 2001 , then everyone was surprised because there is such a tradition on 15th August .
This was the occasion of the completion of 5 years of the study of the independent Hindu government .
Subhashbabu will always be remembered as a virgin soldier and a skilled organization .
A virgin soldier who played an important role in the fight of freedom .
Dilli Chalo , kiss kiss , kiss kiss , kiss kiss kiss , kiss kiss kiss , kiss kiss , kiss kiss kiss , kiss kiss kiss kiss , kiss kiss kiss kisss , kiss kisss kisss , kiss kisss kisss   kiss  kisss   kisss  kisss  kisss   kisss   kisss   kisss
For many years there was such a demand that the files associated with Netaji should be made public and I am happy that we could do that thing .
I remember that day when the whole family of Netaji had come to the chief minister 's house .
We together talked a lot of things associated with Netaji and paid tribute to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose .
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop many places connected with the great heroes of India in Delhi .
Chah is the 26 Alipur Road connected with Babasaheb Ambedkar or the Sardar Patal museum or that is the Kranti temple .
If you go to Delhi then definitely go to see these places .
My dear countrymen , today when we are discussing Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and that too in Man Ki Baat , I ask you to say a story associated with Netaji 's life .
I have always considered a very important medium of connecting radio with people like Netaji also had a deep relationship with radio and he also chose radio to contact the countrymen .
In 142 AD Subhashbabu started the independent Indian radio and through the medium of radio he used to contact the soldiers of Azad Hind Fauj and the people of the country .
I was told that that radio station , Samadhishwar Temple Bulletin used to also extend which used to live in English , Hindi , Tamil , Bengali , Maratha , Punjabi , Western and Urdu languages .
In the conduct of this radio station resident of Gujarat .
Vyas ji played a very important role .
The programs being broadcast on independent Indian radio were very popular among the common people and with their programs the warriors of our freedom struggle also got a lot of strength .
A visual art museum has also been built in this cranti temple .
This attempt has been made to show Indian art and culture very attractively .
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and more than 450 old paintings and art works have been kept there .
Excellent works of great artists like Amritta Shergil , King Ravi Varma , Avanendra Nath Tagore , Gaganendra Tagore , Nandlal Bose , Jamini Rai , Seloz Mukherjee have been exhibited beautifully in the museum .
And I will especially resist you that you must also see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore there .
Now you will think that there is talk of art here and I am talking about seeing the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore .
Till now you must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and musician .
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made pictures on many subjects .
He has also made pictures of animal birds , he has also made pictures of many beautiful scenes and after that he has also done the work of bringing human characters to Kenwas through art .
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not give any name to most of his works .
He believed that those pictures who see their pictures themselves understand those pictures , see the message given by them in the pictures from their point of view .
Their pictures have also been exhibited in European countries , Russia and America .
I hope you will definitely go to see their pictures in the cranti temple .
My loved countrymen , India is the land of saints .
Our saints have given the message of goodwill , equality and social understanding through their thoughts and actions .
There were such a saint - Saint Ravidas.
On 1 February Ravidas Jayanti is there .
The daughter of Saint Ravidasji is very famous .
Saint Ravidasji used to give big messages through a few penances .
They used to say that if God is in reality in every human being then it is not appropriate to divide him on caste , pandh and other social basis .
Guru Ravidasji was born on the sacred ground of Varanasi .
Saint Ravidasji tried to understand the importance of labor and labor in his entire lifetime through his message .
It is not wrong to say that they have understood the real meaning of the prestige of the world .
They used to say . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The messages of Saint Ravidasji have influenced every level , people of every class . Chah had the king and queen of Chittor or mirabai , all were their followers .
I once again bow to Saint Ravidasji .
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidre has written on My Govt that I have published light on the inner programs of India and its sides connected with its future .
They also wanted to ask me to take students interest in the interior program and to think about going forward from the sky by cutting something different - Kiranji , I appreciate this idea of yours and specially the message given to our children .
A few days back I was Ahmedabad , where I got the privilege to unveil the statue of Dr . Vikram Sadbhai .
In our interior program innumerable youth scientists of the country have the contribution .
We pride this thing that today our students are developing upgradations and sounding rockets are reaching the distance .
This ' Kalam - Sett ' built by our scholars on 24th January has been launched .
Sounding Rockets built by university students in Orissa have also made many records .
Since then as much as the space mission took place till the year 20014 , almost as much as the space mission has started in the last four years .
Together with the same interior plane we have also made the world class of launching 104 satellites together .
We have to record the presence of India on the moon through the medium of Chandrayan-2 campaign in a tubectomy itself .
Our country is using Space Technology beautifully in the protection of Janmahal .
Whether there is a window , or rail and road safety , all of them are getting a lot of help from Space Technology .
Navic devices have been divided between our mosquito brothers which are also helpful in economic progress along with their safety .
We are using Space Technology to make the delivery of government services and even better .
In this scheme about 40 lakh houses of 23 states have been jio-teged .
At the same time under Manrega about three and a half crore wealth has also been tagged .
Our satellites today are the symbol of the increasing power of the country .
It has a lot of contribution in our better relations with many countries of the world .
South Asia Settlements has been a unique initiative so that our neighboring friends have also given rise to development .
India today also launches competitive settlements of developed countries not only through our different competitive lunch services .
The sky and stars are always attractive for the children .
Our interior program gives children a chance to think big and move ahead of those borders which were considered impossible till now .
It is the desire to inspire our children to discover new stars along with watching the stars .
My beloved countrymen , I always say that whoever plays he will play and this time many young and young players have come out by playing in India .
In the month of January about 6 , 000 players participated in 18 games in the Indian Youth Games in Pune .
When players at local level will perform excellent performances then they will also perform excellent performance at the global level .
This time in India the players of every state have performed a good performance at the level of their own .
The life of many players who win the medal is very inspiring .
In Mukkabaji young player Akash Gorkha won the rajat Chandraka . I was studying that the father of the sky Rameshji works as a watchman in a complex in Pune .
They live with their family in a parking shade .
So the underworld of Maharashtra 21 women are the residents of Sonali Halevi Satara .
He lost his father in a very young age and his brother and his mother encouraged Sonali 's honor .
Many times it is seen that in sports like Kabbadi girls do not get so much encouragement .
Still Sonali chose Kabddi and performed excellent exhibition .
The ten year old innovative Shaw of Asanasol plays the golden moon of the youngest age in Khelo India Youth Games .
In Karnataka the daughter of a daughter of a peasant has won golden elephant in vetlifting .
When we are talking about the formation of India then the imagination of youth power is just New India .
These stories of Khailo India are showing that not only the contribution of the people of big cities in the construction of New India but also the people coming from small towns , villages , young boys , youthful talents .
My dear countrymen, you must have heard of a lot of prestigious beauty competition.
But have you heard of the competition to shine the toilet
Hey , in a unique competition running for the last nearly one month more than 50 lakh toilets have also taken hiccups .
The name of this unique competition is - clean beautiful toilet .
People are also making beautiful by making some pictures making them colorful by keeping their toilet clean , you will also get to see many photographs of beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Kachh to Kamrup .
I wish all the serpents and villagers to direct this campaign in my Panchayat .
Definitely synthese your clean beautiful toilet with MyIzzat Ghar on social media .
Friends, on October 2, 20014, we started a chirping journey together to free our country from clean and open defecation.
With the help of the people of India today India is heading towards the open defecation very early on 2 October , 2001 so that the father can give him a tribute to his 150th birth anniversary .
In this irresponsible journey of clean India there has also been a great contribution to the enemies of ' Ki Baat ' and therefore with your help it is enjoying that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and 60 districts have made themselves free from open defecation and purification coverage of 8  in rural India and the facility of toilet has been provided to about nine crore families .
My little friends, the days of tests will come.
The resident of Himachal Pradesh Ambul Sharma has written on My Govt that I should talk about the warriors of tests and tests .
Anshulaji, you're grateful to raise this issue.
Yes , for many families the first Hindu examination of the year is a period of time .
From students , their parents to teachers , many people are busy working related to tests .
I read all the students , their parents and teachers wishes .
I would like to discuss this matter today , but you will be happy to know that after two days I will have to talk to students from all over the country in the program at  Preservation Peach ' on 21st January in the morning . This time students ' songs and teachers also have to become the victims of this program .
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in this program .
In this examination ' I will talk very much to my young friends in relation to all aspects related to tests , especially stress free tests .
I had requested people to send inputs and aids and I am very happy that a large number of people are keeping their thoughts on MyGov .
Some of these think and I will keep the information in front of you during the truly town hall program .
You must be the hissos of this program...
Through the medium of social media and namo ape you can also see its live transmission .
My dear countrymen , on 30 January is the priest of Pujaya Bapu .

Wherever we are also then give the martyrs a tribute for two minutes .

Initiate this journey of 2001 successfully .
My best wishes to bear you, very brilliant.
Man Ki Baat, December 2018
What should we do so so that we can bring about changes in our life and give our contribution to the progress of the social country and society .
You all wish for a lot of good wishes of the year 2001 .
You must have thought how to remember the year 2001.
On 2001 India will remember its population as a country , how it will be important to remember .
He is honoring us all .
In 20018, the world's largest health insurance scheme started in Ayushman India.
Electricity has reached every village in the country.
The world ' s calculated institutions have admitted that India is providing free from poverty to the country .
With the imagination of the countrymen cleaning coverage is progressing towards crossing 5 percent .
For the first time from the Red Fort after independence , the Tricolor was run on the 5th anniversary of the independent Indian government .
The highest statue of the world was found in the honor of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel , which served the country in the list of unity .
The name of the country has increased in the world .
The country has been honored with the best environmental awards of the United Nations.
In solar energy and cleaning chains India ' s efforts have got place in the world .
The security of the country has got new strength .
This year our country has successfully finished the nuclear Triad , that is why now we have become a paramount power in both water , place and navel .
The daughters of the country have prideed the country touring the entire world through the medium of boating sea venture .
The first waterway of India started in Varanasi .
With this a new revolution has occurred in the area of Water Ways .
The longest rail route of the country - Road Pul Boggibil Bridge was inaugurated .
Inder-1 cricket world cup and blind cricket worldwide has achieved India victory .
This time in Asian sports India has won a large number of Chandrakots .
India has also exhibited a lot in Para Asian Games .
However , if I keep talking to the men of every Indian , our social efforts then what will our mind be so long that perhaps 201 will come .
All this has been possible with the unforgettable efforts of 130 crore countrymen .
I hope that in 2001 this journey of advancement and progress of India will continue in the same way and our country will be able to gain new heights with greater strength .
My loved countrymen , in this December we lost some exceptional countrymen .
Doctor Jaychandran was known for giving cheap treatment to the poor .
People say that they used to always be ready for the treatment of the patient .
They used to give rent to the elderly patients coming to treat themselves - going .
I'm thebeterindia.
On com website they have studied many such works which inspire the society .
Similarly , on 25th December the funding of Sulagiti Narsimha of Karnataka was found .
Sulagiti nersamma was helpful in delivery of pregnant mothers and mothers .
He gave his service to thousands of mothers and sisters especially in the inaccessible areas of Karnataka .
In the beginning of this year he was respected with Padmashree .
There are many inspired personalities like Doctor Jaychandran and Sulagiti Narsamma who have dedicated their life to everyone 's wishes in the society .
When we talk about health care then I would also like to discuss the social efforts of doctors in Bijnor of Uttar Pradesh .
In the past some of our participants told me that by applying some youth doctors camps of the city they treat the poor free of cost .
Today hundreds of poor patients are being benefitted from this camp every month .
The enthusiasm of these doctor friends associated with unconsciousness is really capable of happiness .
Today I am talking very seriously that due to social efforts clean India Mission has become a successful campaign .
Some people told me that some days ago in Jabalpur of Madhya Pradesh more than three lakh people joined together in the cleaning campaign .
We got to read about Jaychandran and when we got the chance, then thebetterindia.
On going to the comp I am trying to know the inspiring things .
I am happy that today there are many such vabsites that are introducing us from many stories inspiration from the lives of such people .
Like thepositiveIndia.
Com is working to develop positiveness in society and make society more sensitive.
I believe that more and more people will be able to know about our heroes that bring about changes in society .
It is easy to spread negativeness but many good works are being done around us in society and all these are happening with the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians .
In every society sports activity is important .
When games are played then the mind of the advertisers also gets filled with energy .
We experience the names , identity , honor of the players , many things .
But sometimes because there are many things behind them which are like those who are moving ahead of sports , which are very bigger than sports .
I want to talk about the world of Hanaya a daughter of Kashmir who has won gold moonlight in Karat Chempianship in Korea .
Hanya is 12 years old and is a resident of Anantnagar of Kashmir .
Hanaya studied Karata with hard work and showed it by observing its fine observation .
I read the best wishes of the future of all the countrymen .
Many good wishes and blessings to Hanya.
Similarly there has been a lot of discussion in the media about a daughter of 16 years of age .
You must have read too.
Rajni has won gold moonlight in the Junior woman Mukkabaji competition .
The queen swallowed up on a stall of milk and drink one glass of milk while winning the lunch .
After that Rajni wrapped his chandra in a cloth and put it in a bag .
Do you think why did Rajni drink one glass of milk
He did this in honor of his father Jasmer Singh Ji , who sells luxury on a stall of waterfall .
Rajni told that his father has made a lot of sacrifice to bring him here , he has suffered a lot .
Jasmer Singh used to go to work every morning with Rajni and his brother-in-law .
When Rajni expressed his desire to learn boxing before his father then the father encouraged him to get all possible help and help .
Rajni had to start the practice of Mukkabaji with old taste because at that time the economic condition of her family was not good .
Despite all these widows , the royal rituals did not stop and kept on learning Mukkabaji .
He has also won a star in Serbia .
I give happiness and blessings to the queen .
And I also congratulate her parents Jasmer Singhji and Usharaniji to give her admiration and to increase her enthusiasm .
This month a 20 year old daughter of Pune has become the fastest Asian to roam around the world from Vedangi Kulkarni cycle .
He used to run around 300 kilometres of cycles daily for 15 days .
Do we not get inspiration by knowing this kind of achievement
Especially when my youth friends listen to such incidents then we also inspire to show something in the midst of problems .
If complications are capable , enthusiasm is sufficient then the inconvenience gets destroyed automatically .
The problems can never be interrupted.
If we hear many such examples then we also get a new inspiration every moment in our life .
Many festivals filled with joy and enthusiasm are coming in my Paya countrymen , in January - like Lohadi , Pongal , Makar Sankranti , Uttaran , Magh Bihu , Maghi .
During the time the sun enters the Makar rashi through the descending .
After this day the day starts increasing gradually and the cough of cold starts getting cut .
We also have many good wishes to our non-vegetarian friends and sisters .
Oneness in diversity is a India - the hobby of the feelings of excellent India , our festivals have concluded in themselves .
We can see how many festivals , festivals are connected with nature .
In Indian culture society and nature are not considered different , here the person and the community are the same .
There is a good example of our relationship with nature . based on festivals calendar .
Along with festivals there is also a list of grah-nakshatras .
This traditional calendar shows how old our relationship with natural and astronomical events is .
Based on the speed of the moon and the sun the date of festivals and festivals is determined according to the moon and the sun calendar .
It depends on which calendar is considered .
In many areas festivals are also celebrated according to the location of the Grah Nakshatras .
All these festivals are celebrated according to Chandra Kelander , if you are considered to be pucca , toxic , toxic , toxic , toxic , toxic , toxic , toxic , toxic , toxic - all these festivals are celebrated on the basis of sun calendar .
In many of our festivals the feeling of saving rivers and water is especially incompatible .
Sixth festival - rivers , lakes are connected with sunrise .
On Makar Sankranti also lacs of people drown in the sacred rivers .
Our festivals , festivals also give us the understanding of social values .
On one side it has an archaeological importance , on the other hand every festival is learned very easily from the inspiration of living with partners .
I read a lot of good wishes to you and I wish you to enjoy the coming festivals .
Tell them all the tents taken on these festivals so that everyone can see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture .
My dear countrymen , there is a lot of such things in our culture on which we can pride and can show the whole world with respect and one of them is the Kumbh fair .
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
In films too much has been seen about its grandeur and grandeur and it will be true as well .
People from all over the world come and join the Kumbh .
In the Kumbh fair the Jansagar of faith and faith gathers .
Lacs of people from all over the world join together .
The tradition of Kumbh has flown and flourished from our great cultural heritage .
This time on 15th January the world famous Kumbh fairs going to be organised in Prayagraj , which you may be waiting for all of them with great enthusiasm .
Celebration of the arrival of saints and goddesses has already started for the Kumbh Mela .
Its global importance can also be estimated from the fact that last year UNESCO has identified the Kumbh Mela in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity .
A few days back the princes of many countries saw the preparations of Kumbh , there the national heritage of many countries was fought together .
In this Kumbh fair organised in Prayagraj more than 150 people of the country are likely to come .
With the diversity of the Kumbh the beauty of India will spread its color throughout the world .
Especially for youngsters it can be a very big experience of learning .
I had gone to Prayag a few days before myself . I saw that the preparation of Kumbh was going on with Joshur .
The people of Prayagraj are also very excited for the Kumbh .
There I inaugurated the Integrated Common Control Center, and the devotees would get a lot of help in it.
This time too much emphasis is being laid on cleanliness in the Kumbh .
If there will also be cleanliness of faith in the organization then its good message will reach far and wide .
This time every devotees can also visit Akshayavada after sacred bath in Sangam .
The symbol of the faith of the people this axe was closed in the fort for hundreds of years , whose devotees could not see .
Now the gates of Akshayvada have been opened for everyone .
My father is resistant that when you come to Kumbh then keep yourself on different sides of Kumbh and other social media so that maximum people get inspiration to go to Kumbh .
The Kumbh of Ayodhya becomes the great Kumbh of Indian philosophy .
This Kumbh is also the Kumbh of the nationality of faith .
This Kumbh of the devotees also becomes a great Kumbh of national unity .
This Kumbh of artisticism also becomes a great Kumbh of creative powers .
Pujaya Babu and South Africa have a unique relation .
That was South Africa from where Mohammad became Mahatma .
In South Africa itself Mahatma Gandhi had started his first Satyagraha and stood firmly in opposition to color discrimination .
He also established Phoenix and Tolstoy Forms from where he had gazed for peace and trust in the entire world .
The birth of Nelson Mandela is also celebrated in the form of a centenary year , which is also known by the name of Madiba .
We all know that Nelson Mandela was an example of various conflicts in the whole world and who was the inspiration of Mandela
He got the support of spending so many years in jail and inspiration from Pujay Bapu only .
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only inspiration for the whole world but their ideals always encourage us to build a society full of love and compassion .
My dear countrymen , a few days back on the Narmada coast of Gujarat where the world ' s highest statue is Statue of Unity , there was a meaningful discussion with the police workers of the country .
What kind of steps should be taken to give more strength to the safety of the country and the country , it has been discussed with the area .
That time I also announced to start Sardar Patel Purskar for national unity . This award will be given to such people who have given their contribution to national unity in any form .
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country .
They have always been trying to keep India 's imperfection incomplete .
Sardar Saheb believed that the power of India is implicated in the diversity here .
While respecting that feeling of Sirdar Patalji we offer tribute to them through this work of unity .
My loved countrymen , on 13 January is the festival of the sacrifice of Guru Govind Singh Ji .
Guru Govind Singh Ji was born in Patna .
For most of the time of life their peninsular land remained in north India and in Nanded of Maharashtra he sacrificed his life .
Birth land in Patna , Karmabhoomi in north India and the last moment of life in Nanded.
If you say in one way then the whole of India got their blessings .
If you see their lifetime then a glimpse of the whole of India is found in it .
After the martyrdom of his father Shri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji Guru Govind Singhji had achieved the foot of Guru at the young age of nine years .
Guru Govind Singhji got the courage to fight the battle of justice from the Sikh Gurus in Baras .
They were calm and simple personality but when attempts were made to press the voices of the poor and weak people , then Guru Govind Singh ji blamed his voice strongly for the poor and weak people and therefore says - one lakh to one boy , chidio , sweet , sweet , sweet , fool , fool , fool , fool , fool , fool , fool , fool , fool , fool , fool , fool , fool , fool , fool , fool , fool , fool .
They say that strength can not be exhibited fighting people of weaker sections .
Sri Govind Singhji knew that the biggest service is to remove human sufferings .
They were a divine man full of virtue , gallantry , sacrifice , religious purity which had an adventurous knowledge of both science and science .
They were a thrill , along with it were also the scholars of many languages including Gurmukhi , Brajbhasha , Sanskrit , Persian , Hindi and Urdu .
I'm bowing to Mr. Gurugovind Singh once again.
That's being done by Food Safety and Standard Authority of India.
Many programs are being organised throughout the country in the celebration of the year of Mahatma Gandhi 's 150th anniversary .
FF in this series.
Under the Eat Righat India campaign healthy India travels are coming out all over the country .
This expedition will run till 2nd January.
When India is clean , then India will also be rich .
For good health the most important is - nutritious food .
You also take part in it and especially I will inspire that you must show these things to the children .
The importance of food habits is important from childhood itself .
This is the last program of my loved countrymen , 2018 .
In 2001 we will get again , talk of mind again , life of the person , life of the nation , life of society , inspiration are the basis of progress .
Come , new inspiration , new imagination , new imagination , new achievement , new height - move forward , change yourself , change the country too very much .
Man Ki Baat, November 20018
On 3 October , 20014 , through the sacred festival of Vijayadashmi . Manki Baat we all started a journey together .
The same 50 episodes of this journey ' Ki Baat ' have been completed .
Similarly this Golden Jubilee episode - Golden jayanti episode is today .
This time the papers and phones you have come are mostly related to this 50th episode .
On May Goa development Yadav from Ambakumar , Amarkumar and Patna , in the same way Monica Jain of Delhi , Birdwan , President of West Bengal and musicians of Nagpur have asked all these people about one kind of question .
They say that many times people connect you with latest technology , social media and mobile app , but why did you like radio to join people
Your curiosity is very natural that in today 's era when radio had almost been ruined , why did Modi brought radio at that time
I was nine months and I was going to some other place while traveling in the evening .
In the mountains of Himachal the evening becomes cold , then stayed on a dhaba on the way for tea and when I gave order for tea then before that , that was very small dhaba , only one person used to make tea , was selling .
There wasn't even the cloth above.
The same rod was standing on the edge of a small lari .
He said , No , sir , you don ' t know what , that is a matter of great happiness .
I didn't understand, he said, listen to Saheb Radio, the discussion was going on on on the radio.
The reach of communication and its deepness , maybe no one can do the correctness of radio .
This thing has been done in my mind since that time and I had come to know of its strength .
So when I became a big chief then it was very natural to take care of me towards the most powerful medium .
And when I took charge as a ' Prime Minister' in May 20014, I had the desire that the unity of the country, our magnificent history, its pride, its diversity, the variety of India, the serpents of our society, the people's pursuit, patience, sacrifice, penance, all these things should be brought to the people of India.
From far off villages to metropolitan cities , from kids to youth traders . .
Recently Akashwani also had a survey on ' Ki Baat ' .
I saw some such effects from them which are very interesting .
Out of those people among whom surveys have been done , average 0 percent are those who listen to us regularly .
Most people feel that the biggest contribution of ' Ki Baat ' is that they have increased the feeling of negativeness in the society .
Through the medium of ' Ki Baat ' the people ' have got excitement at large level .
There is also a comprehensive discussion on IndiaPositive.
This is also a glimpse of the feeling of positiveness , feeling of positiveness in our countrymen 's mind .
People have also told their experience that there has been an increase in the feeling of doing something from ' volunteerism ' i . . self-suffering .
Along with radio , mobile , internate , fascinating lives and periscops , Narendra Modi is also connecting to ' Man Ki Baat ' through Ape ' .
I am giving gratitude to all the members of the ' Ki Baat ' family to express their faith in it and to become his association .
Your fear is true .
Actually the leader gets mic and if he is listening to the number of lakhs of crores then what should be done then .
Some young friends have done a study on all the subjects related to ' Mon Ki Baat ' , all of them had analysis , lascical analysis of the word of episode , and they have studied how many times the words were spoken .
What words were spoken again and again.
One of them is that this program has been unreasonable .
When ' Ki Baat ' was started then I had decided whether there should be no politics in it , neither there should be any public happiness in it , neither there should be any Modi in it nor the biggest force , the biggest inspiration among you to fulfil my imagination .
Modi will come and go, but this country will be so much, our culture will be incomplete.
These small things of 130 crore countrymen will always be alive.
This country will take new inspiration , enthusiasm at new heights .
When will any government have so much strength that the hub of selfieuidaughter starts from a small village of Haryana and spreads not only in the country but also abroad .
Every class , celebrities of the society , all get connected and in a new , modern language of thinking in society , which is considered to be today ' s generation gives light to them .
Sometimes the joy of ' Ki Baat ' also emerges but in my mind there are always 130 crore countrymen .
Its heart is my mind .
But ' Ki Baat ' is not a government thing - this is a matter of society .
"Man Ki Baat" is an aspiratioonal India, an important thing about India.
The original life of India is not princely but also the root of India is not the royal power of life .
The original life of India is society and society power .
There are thousands of passes of social life , in which there is also a passionate royalty .
That's not a good arrangement for the healthy society.
Sometimes incidents and royalties of royalties become so impossible that other talents and other pursuits of the society go away .
For the bright future of countries like India , we get a sufficient place for human rights , that is the social responsibility of all of us and ' Man Ki Baat ' is a humble and small attempt in this direction .
Your question is a question of suicide in a way .
I believe that the biggest achievement of 50th episode of ' Monkey Baat ' is that you are asking questions to a friend of one of your nicknames .
Whatever question you have asked , if I answer its direct words then you will say - nothing .
Actually, "Man Ki Baat" is a very easy job for me.
Every time the media of the people comes in front of the ' Ki Baat ' .
On May Gov and Narendramodi mobile app, people tell their thoughts... there's also a toll free number-1800180.
Collecting there people also record their messages in their voice .
As soon as the episode of ' Mon Ki Baat ' comes close then during the tour , I read the thoughts and information sent by you very finely .
And because of this when I read the media then I can easily connect that place and context with me .
Then I keep recording some factors like the name of the village , the name of the person , etc things .
If you ask the truth then you have heard in ' Man Ki Baat ' but examples , emotions and emotions are of my countrymen .
There are lakhs of people whose name I have not been able to take till date but they keep sending their letters , their tips without being disappointed - your thoughts , your feelings are very important in my life .
I am sufficiently convinced that I will get many times more things beforehand and will make ' Ki Baat ' more interesting , more effective and useful .
Such efforts are also made that those letters which are not included in which baat also pay attention to the media and information related departments .
From their hard work ' Man Ki Baat ' reaches maximum number of people .
The team of skywater prepares every episode in many languages for transmission .
Some people efficiently hear ' Ki Baat ' in the same tone .
In this way he becomes Narendra Modi only for 30 minutes .
I am also honoring those people for their patience and curiosity .
I will wish you all that you must listen to this program in your local language as well .
I also ask my friends of Midian to give enjoyment to the heart which spreads ' Man Ki Baat ' on their channels regularly every time .
Never happiness is felt by any royal Midia , he feels that he gets very less coverage or whatever coverage he gets is negative , but the media has made many things taken in ' Man Ki Baat ' .
There are many topics like cleanliness , road safety , drug free India , selfie with doctor whom Midia has done the task of moving forward by giving a new form of a campaign .
Without your cooperation this journey of Man Ki Baat remains incomplete .
Actually if I say then I have no secret.
What I am doing is happening in all the families as well .
If you want to say in a simple language then I try to put that young man inside , keeping myself in that condition and trying to make a balance with its thoughts , to make a vibrant match .
That old bag of our life is , when it does not come in the middle then it becomes easy to understand anyone .
This is the best of today 's youths that they do not do anything on which they do not believe themselves and when they believe in any idea then they leave everything for it and go behind it .
Many times people discuss the communication gap between the elderly and young people in the family .
Actually in most of the families the conversation with young people is very limited .
Often things of reading or habits or habits of lifestyle , do not do this , it happens to be a hindrance , things of unsuccessful mind , gradually lessening in families and that is also a matter of concern .
Instead of expect, disccusing and dismissing will make the promise effective.
Through different programs or social media my attempts are made to talk to the youth continuously .
I am always trying to learn what they are doing or thinking .
They always have a store of acids .
They are extremely powerful , full of new and concentrated .
I try to divide the youth ' s efforts , their words more and more through ' Ki Baat ' .
Many times complaint occurs that young people ask a lot of questions .
Where I am , it is better that the newborns question .
This good thing is because it means that they ask to check from the roots of all things .
Some people say that young people do not have patience , but I believe that there is no time for young people to walk . This is the same thing which helps young people to become more innovative because they ask for things fast .
We feel that today 's youths are very important and think of many big things .
Well, look at big dreams and get big successes.
Finally, this is New India.
Some people say that young people ask to do many things at the same time .
Where am I wrong in it
They are transparent in multiskin therefore they do this .
If we run our eyes around then whether it is a social interpretation or a start up , whether it is a sports sports or a young man who brings a big change in any other region - society .
Those youths who showed courage to ask questions and see big dreams .
If we take out the thinking of young people on the ground and give them an open environment to express them then they can bring positive changes in the country . They are doing this also .
From my dear countrymen , Gurugram Vinitaji has written on Mai Govt that I should talk about the coming day i . . on 26th November in Ki Baat .
They have to say that this day is special because we enter the 0th year of adoption of contract .
Vinitaji, you have a lot of respect for your suggestion.
Yes , Kalay is the evening day .
The day of reminding those great things who made our bondage .
Our detention was adopted on November 26, 14.
To fulfil this historical work of stopping the Bandharan Sabha took 21 years and 11 months .
Let us imagine that within three years these great things gave us such a comprehensive and extensive solution .
The extraordinary speed which he has built is still an example of timing management and productivity .
He also inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities in the record time .
The Bandharan Sabha was the confluence of great talents of the country , from which every person was compelled to give such a bondage to his country so that the people of India become strong , poor person also becomes capable .
The special thing in our detention is this that it has been described in the area of excess and duty i . . Rheits and Duties .
The coordination of these two will take the country forward in the life of the citizen .
If we respect others then the protection of our officers will be automatically and in this way if we follow our duties given in detention then also the protection of our officers will be automatically .
I still remember that in the year 2001 when 60 years of India had been finished , then in Gujarat we had taken out the excitement of bandage keeping on elephants .
It was a memorable time for increasing awareness about the detention of the youth and joining them with the sides of the detention .
In the year 2002 we will finish 0 years as a genetic system and in 2002 our independence will finish 5 years .
Come , let us all move the values of our departure and ensure Peace , Progress , Prosperity i . . peace , progress and prosperity in our country .
Talking about my favorite patriots , Bandharan Sabha , he can never forget the contribution of the great man who was at the center of the Bandharan Sabha .
On 6th December their Mahaparinirvana is the day .
I bow to Babasaheb from all the countrymen who have given the authority to live hundreds of Indians with respect .
The democracy was settled in the nature of Babasaheb and he used to say - the democratic values of India did not come from outside anywhere .
What is the calculation system and what is the relational arrangement - it has never been a new thing for India .
In the Bandharan Sabha he had made a very emotional appeal that we have to protect our blood from the last drop of freedom found after such a struggle .
They also used to say that even though Indians are of different backgrounds , but we have to keep nationwide above all things .
My dear countrymen , on 23 November two days ago we all celebrated the sacrifice of Shri Guru Nanak Devji and we are going to celebrate their 550 light festival in the next year i . . in 2001 .
Guru Nanak Devji always thought for the welfare of the entire humanity .
He always showed the way of truth , action , service , mercy and harmony to the society .
This way Guru Nanak will also run a train on the path of the sacred places associated with Devji .
Recently when I was making a sit related to it then at that time I remembered Lakhpat Sahib Gurudwara .
During the earthquake of 2001 of Gujarat that Gurudwara had suffered a lot but the way the state government had renovated it together with the local people is an example even today .
The Government of India has made an important decision to make Terrapur corridor so that travellers of our country can easily visit that sacred place of Guru Nanak Devji in Pakistan , Terrapur .
My dear countrymen , after 50 episodes we will get once again , in the village 's village ' Ki Baat ' and I am confident that this program of ' Man Ki Baat ' has got the opportunity to keep me in touch with you for the first time because you asked such a question , but our journey will continue .
As much as your partner adds , our journey will become more deep and will make everyone satisfactory .
Sometimes there is a question in the mind of some people that what did I get from ' Ki Baat ' .
I ask to say today that one thing touches my mind in the effects of ' Ki Baat ' . Most of the people said that when we listen to what baat ' sitting together with everyone of the family then it seems that the elders of our family are divided ourselves with us by sitting in the middle of us .
When I heard this thing extensively then I felt very satisfactory that I am from you , and in one way I will also be coming repeatedly in the form of members of your family , joining you .
Your ambition, my ambition.
Come , let us move this journey more .
Very glorious.
Man Ki Baat, October 20018
About six and a half months before independence, on January 24, the world's famous International Magazine, Time Magazine, had a synonym of synonymous panels on its face.
In his main stories he had published a map of India and that was not the same map as we want today .
It was the map of India divided in many parts .
Time ' Magazine ' had written that there were dangers like division , violence , food fabrication , precious and state politics on India .
Time ' Magazine ' further writes that among all these if there is the ability to serve the country in the list of unity and fill the jewels then it is the same gallery .
How he gave direction to Bardoli Satyagraha .
For the country their quantity and resistance was such that from the peasants , merchants to industrialists , all used to trust them .
Then whether it is Junagarh or Hyderabad , Travancore or the Rajvadas of Rajasthan were the same serpentine pattern whose Suzbuz and Ranitika Kaushalya today we can see one Hindustan .
Seeing this nation tied in the binding of unity , seeing our Bharat Mata we naturally remind Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .
This is to be special on 31 October - on this day we will dedicate the status of unity to the nation by giving true devotion to the Sardar Patal .
The height of this statue established on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is made up of the State of Liberty of America .
This is the highest skycraft statue of the world .
Every Indian can now pride on the fact that the world 's highest statue is on the earth of India .
Those serpents who were connected to the ground will now increase the beauty of the sky .
I also salute the family of our soldiers for their adventure , but do you know why do we accept the citizens of Hindustan for this npantri day
This is the same day when the soldiers of Indian Army had descended on the earth of Kashmir and had protected the valley from the horsemen .
This historical event also has direct relation with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .
I was reading an old interview of Sam Manekshaw who was the great military officer of India .
In the Interview, Field Marshall Maneksho was remembering the time when they were Colonel.
During this time in October 14 , the military campaign started in Kashmir .
Field Marshall Manekshaw had told how the Sir Vallabhbhai Patel had become illegitimate for the delays being sent to Kashmir during a sit-down . During the sitting in the Sirdar Petal he looked at him in his special style and said that there should not be any delay in the military campaign in Kashmir and as soon as it is resolved .
After that to go to the army we took a flight in the Kashmir Bhani airplane and we saw how the army got success .
On 31 October our past chief minister Shrimati Indira Gandhiji is also the pious date .
Indiraji is also honored with respect.
My loved countrymen, don't like games.
It's been my two memorable meetings.
We got the opportunity to get our muscular athletes of Asian Para Games 20018 done earlier in Jakarta .
In these games India made a new dimension by winning a total of 2 moons and increased the glory of India .
I got the privilege of meeting with all these responsibilities para athletes and I congratulated them .
Similarly the chances of meeting the witnesses of the Summer Youth Olympics in Argentina were found .
You will be happy to know that in Youth Olympics 2018 our youth have done the best performance till now .
In this event we also got 3 other Chandras in the Mix Everests besides 13 Chandras .
You will remember that this time also India 's exhibition was excellent in Asian sports .
See , how many times in the last few minutes I have used the best , the most glorious words till now .
This is the story of today 's Indian sports which is touching new heights everyday .
India is making new programs not only in sports but also in those areas about which it was never thought .
For example I ask you about Pera Athlete Narayan Thakur who has won Gold Medal for the country in Asian Para Games of 2018 .
That is Divyang from birth itself .
When they were eight years old they lost their father .
Then he spent the last eight years in an orphanage .
After leaving the orphanage to clean the buses of DTC and worked as a vettor in Dhaba on the sides of the road in Delhi .
Today in the same Narayan International events golden moonlight has been going on for India .
Not only this , see the increasing Dairy of excellence in India 's sports , India ever in Judo , then it is a sinner taker or junior takel , no opposite medal has won .
But Tababi Devi succumbed to the history of winning the freedom fighter in the judo in the Youtholympics.
The youth player of 16 years Tababi Devi is a resident of a village of Manipur .
Their father is a journal when the mother works as a fish seller.
Many times such time came in front of their family when they do not even have food money .
In such situations also the curse of Tababi Devi is not visible .
And he created history by winning the medal for the country.
If you come then there are innumerable stories .
Every life is inspiration .
Every young player, their craze is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, you'll all remember that we had successfully organized Fifa Under 1 World Cup in 2001.
The whole world had also praised it as a very successful tournament .
FFAUNDER 1 World Cup also played a new record about the number of visitors.
In different stadiums of the country more than 12 lakh people enjoyed football matches and increased the confidence of youth players .
This year India has got the privilege of organizing the World Cup of 20018 in Bhubaneswar .
The hockey world cup will start from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian wants to play any game or he has interest in any game , in his mind there is definitely a feeling towards hockey .
There is a golden history in India 's hockey .
In the past India has got golden moonlight in many competitives and has also been winning the world cup once .
India has also given hockey many great players .
Whenever there is talk of hockey in the world then the story of hockey will remain incomplete without this great player of India .
The Magic Major of Hockey is aware of the whole world with meditation .
After them from Balwinder Singh Sinior , Leslie Claudius , Mohammad Shahid , Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai Hawki has cut a big market .
Even today the players of team India are inspiring the new generation of hockey with the success achieved due to their labour and persecution .
There is a good opportunity to see adventurous matches for Khel lovers .
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only increase the enthusiasm of Indian team but encourage all teams .
I read good wishes to the Indian men hockey team for this competition and assure them that 100 crore Indians are standing with them and their support and I also read very good wishes to all the world coming to India .
The way people are coming forward for my loved countrymen , social work , they are becoming self - sufficient for all the countrymen , they are inspiring .
But in the new age , newly , new generations , new enthusiasm , taking new dreams are coming forward today to do these works .
Every Indian will feel pride after seeing the enthusiasm and happiness among them for this work .
IT'S SOCCETY, MANNY NO NO HAM, HAM, HAM, NOT YOU WAY, THE SHOUT THE SOCITY.
If someone is watching then some elderly are watching .
If someone is connected to cleanliness then he is helping some cattle and there is no desire behind doing all that but there is an unsatisfactory feeling of dedication and imagination in it .
A young man learned Wheelchair Basketball to help the Wheelchair Basketball team of Divangs.
This is the dedication which is the dedication - this is the ongoing activity with Mission .
Does any Indian not get the pride of this thing
But this feeling of ham ' will inspire us all .
My dear countrymen , this time when I was watching your suggestion for ' Mon Ki Baat ' then I got to see a very interesting drop of Sri Mannish Mahapatra from Puducherry .
He has written on My Govt . By greeting you should talk about this about how the methods and traditions of the tribes of India are the best examples of co - existence with nature .
How we need to adopt their traditions in our life to develop percentage , some of them need to learn .
I am admiring you to keep this subject among the enemies of ' mankind ' .
This is such a thing which inspires us to look towards our glorious past and culture . Today the entire world is discussing environmental protection and is looking for new ways for balanced lifestyle - Balanced life .
Although our India year is also not free from this problem but for its movement we have to donate only inside us , to see our rich history and traditions , and especially to understand the lifestyle of our people 's community .
Staying concentrated with nature is joining the culture of our tribal community .
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship the trees and flowers like goddesses .
In the Bhil tribe of central India especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship with respect of trees like Peepal and Arjun .
In the desert like Rajasthan the Bishnoi society has shown us the way of environment conservation .
Especially in relation to the conservation of trees they are acceptable to sacrifice their lives but they do not have any harm to any tree .
The sweets of Arunachal claim to have their relationship with the tigers .
They consider them to be their brother-in-law .
In Nagaland also tigers are seen as the protector of the forest .
People of Barali community in Maharashtra consider tiger as guests , for them the presence of tigers is going to bring prosperity .
In central India the coal community believes that their luck is connected to the tiger . If the tiger does not get food then the village will also have to stay hungry - it is their faith .
In the season of the Gond tribe of central India the fishing stops in some districts of the Kaithan river .
They consider these areas as the shelter of fish because of this process they get fish in a healthy and sufficient quantity .
The tribal community makes their homes with natural materials , along with being strong it is also suitable to the environment .
In the confluence areas of the Nilgiri plains of South India a small species of community - dolls , traditionally their resources are made of things available at the local level .
My dear brothers and sisters , this is the fact that tribal community believes in staying with a very peaceful and mutual fair but when someone is harming their natural resources then they are not afraid to fight for their officers .
It is not surprising that among our first freedom fighters there were people of tribal community .
Lord Birsa can forget Munda who fought hard in front of the British regime to protect her wild land .
The list of what I have said is very long . There are many such examples of the tribal community which teach us how to stay together with nature and for the wealth of the jungles which we have today is the season of our tribals .
Come on, let us express our respect towards them.
In my favorite countrymen , ' Man Ki Baat ' we talk about those people and institutions who are doing some unusual work for the society .
Such activity which looks normal in the first glance but in reality it has a deep impact on changing our mentality , changing the direction of society .
A few days back I was studying about the crew of Punjab Gurubachan Singhji .
A common and hard worker was the marriage of the daughter of Gurubachan Singh Ji .
Before this marriage Gurubachanji had said that we would marry simplely .
You know, there are other things, there is no need to spend any money.
Some such things that may be difficult to give to the family members of the girl , but you will feel nice to know that Bhai Gurubachan Singh was a direct slave , what he said , who was quiet , is the true strength of our society .
Gurubachan Singhji told him that you promise me that you do not burn any change in consciousness now .
You can think how big social strength is there in it .
This thing seems to be of Gurubachan Singhji but he shows how huge his personality is and we have seen that there are many such families in our society which convert personal affair into the context of society .
The family of Shriman Gurubachan Singh has made such an example in front of us .
I have read about Kallar Majra another village of Punjab which is near Nabha .
Congratulations to brother Gurubachan Singh.
Kallar Majra and the people of all those places who make their best efforts to keep the environment clean .
You are moving forward the Indian heritage of all healthy lifestyle as a true successor .
The way the penetrating lake forms the same way small awareness and activity and positive work always play an important role in creating positive environment .
My dear countrymen , our texts are said : . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In life , in heart , in me , in stars , in the particles of the world , establish peace everywhere .
This year there is special importance for India because on 11th November the first world war has ended 100 years ago , that is , during that time the completion of heavy destruction and loss of life will also be completed a century .
The first world war for India was an important event .
If said in true sense then we did not take any action directly with that war .
Even then our soldiers fought with Bahaduri and played a very big role , gave the best sacrifice .
Indian soldiers showed the world that when the matter of war comes then it is not behind anyone .
Our soldiers have also shown their pride in inaccessible areas , in difficult situations .
The only purpose behind all these was to restore peace .
In the first world war the world witnessed the destruction of destruction .
According to estimates , about 1 crore soldiers and almost so many citizens lost their lives .
From this the whole world understood what is the importance of peace .
In the last 10 years the definition of peace has changed .
Today the meaning of peace and harmony is not just war .
From treason to change in environment , economic development to social justice , all of them need to work with global cooperation and coordination .
The development of the poor in the poor is the true symbol of peace .
My loved countrymen , our glory is nothing but a matter of India .
The natural beauty of the north east is unique and the people there are extremely reflective .
Our glory is now known for all its best works .
Ishaan India is such a region which has made a lot of progress in biological farming as well .
A few days back Sikkim has won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award to encourage the food system .
You will be happy to know that this award given for the determination of the best policy in this area is similar to oscar in that area .
Not only this , our Sikkim has chosen this award by leaving the 51 nomenclatures of 25 countries behind , for this I am giving a lot of favor to the people of Sikkim .
My loved countrymen are on the end of October.
To all the countrymen a lot of good wishes of all these festivals .
I will resist yourself that keep in mind yourself also in these festivals , keep in mind your health and also keep in mind the Hindus of the society .
This festival will also become an opportunity in your life to move forward in the form of a mission .
Your progress is a major heritage of the progress of the country .
The same will be the progress of the country as you will achieve .
I wish you a lot of good wishes.
