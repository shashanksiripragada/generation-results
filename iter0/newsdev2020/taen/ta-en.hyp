Ramadoss said that the people had failed to see the struggle for the problems of the Belberg district and had voted for them by relying on the opposition's lie and bullshit.
Ramdas, who asked him why he would forget to work for the people and ask for the lies, promised that people would be better if he came back.
Even though he was unable to walk in the old age, Goluni or Golunny said he was deliberately saying that he would fight for this Tamil creed, not those who came to politics from Kodambakkam, but peasant masses.
Different programmes are being implemented throughout the district in terms of national development programme that will unite today (26) for the country to be implemented on the fourth day of the Badula district.
Several programmes related to drug addiction, rural power and encouraging women engaged in small business attempts, including the office office of the district secretariat, were held in the district office today.
The incident took place under the leadership of Ceylon navy Lebtinan Anura Jaysingh, the leading psychological adviser to the president's drug addiction division, to clarify the government school teachers under the drug addiction program.
He also pointed out that there is currently a large number of drug addiction problems in the country and that the teachers are very responsible for redemption of young people who have been participants in the country and currently three percent of women's population is involved in this drug addiction.

The police surveillance organisation has been advised on the friendship with female worker Genefer Arguria.
While the London mayor, the independent office will now assess whether the prime minister should be questioned for a criminal crime in government position.
The Greater London Attorney (GLA) has registered a surveillance officer in a report that he was accused of being preferred by Mrs. Arguri's prime minister.
'When there is information that there could be a criminal charge,' he said.
It doesn't mean it was proven in any way.
The IOPC will now review whether the matter should be investigated.
The matter is now recommended to the IOPC, which handles complaints against the police in England and Walls.
At that time, Mr. Janson was in the position as a combination of the police and criminal commissioner, which was recommended to the supervisory system.
Mr. Janson denied that there was nothing wrong with his brother-in-law with Mrs. Arguria.
Though he insisted that they were 'confirmed on a person,' he had previously agreed to the London legislative council's order to provide details of his involvement with Mrs. Arguria.
Seven years ago, Thirumathi, a migrant American to London, was given 126,000 from the public fund to Arguri, after the Sunday Times report that he was allowed on the basis of concession in three foreign trips led by Mr. Janson.
After that, the government has been restructured to revive the decision to provide 100,000 measurements to the Heker House, the company of Mrs. Arguri.
It reflects these questions on the surveillance practices taken before the payment of money.
Digital Minister Med Varman said in the public meeting that his department had 'new ordinary practices' and the company had a British telephone account.
Many reports, however, suggest that the calls made for the telephone were turned into 34-year-old California office.
With the workers of women , the prime minister 's allies know secretly .
The JLA's move to advise the Prime Minister to the Freedom Office for the police operation has wrangled nearly 10.
This was a 'politically provoked attack' and at the time of the Conservative Party convention, which stated that a senior government report was 'public political'.
'The surveillance officer did not provide any evidence of any charges,' he said, 'The prime minister has no chance to respond to the surveillance officer before the report was issued on Friday night.'
The public and the media will be well aware that it was obviously blinded with political perspective.
Tr. Janson's close connection with the California worker, with the help of the London Tourism Mumbad Muhammad, was previously called the Standard today as 'all known secret'.
The former officials in the London  Partners (LPB) face recalled how Thirumathi Arguri was shifted to Mr. Janson's foreign trips under his leadership at the time when some of the companys at that time were said to be 'unprecedented.'
In the death of McMiller, one was accused of having been addicted to the third.
Las Angeles (AP) - Last year, a third person was arrested and smuggled intoxicants in connection with the death of rapper McMiller.
In September last year, court documents show that Stephen Walter suspects that the miller-contained oxidated oxidant pills in Fanton were supposed to be unrecognised before he suddenly smoothly succumbed to the consumption of thousands of lives in Cocaine, alcohol and US, in Fanton.
Another person, Cameron Pette, has been accused of blending pills to Miller.
The court documents published Tuesday's report that Pette was obtained drugs from Walter since August.
Earlier this week, Ryan Rewiss, who was arrested at Arizona's Lake Hawasu City, was accused of acting as a 'Runnner', who took the pills to the box.
None of them was directly charged for Miller's death, and none of them appealed.
Walter, who was released in a drug case in 2005, has already been ordered to experience a five-month jail sentence to redeem his liberation conditions.
On Thursday, the well-known Internet DMEST, the lawyers, who first disclosed this case, told the Walter to be in jail until the trial.
No immediate telephone consignment sent to his lawyer was given.
On September 4, Pete was charged in the Federal Court and his lawyer refused to comment.
Miller's replacement is a clear talk of his depression and drug use, which has obtained some of the greatest people in the hip-hop as fans.
He was a genuinely named Pittsburk, James Mys Meccarmik, who was in a two-year relationship with the singer Ariana Grand, which ended in the beginning of 2018.
After his death, the singer shared a lovely colony about him near his Instagram and published a song 'Theng You Negst,' in which he was described with love.
In recent years, Miller's death was one of the deaths of musicians associated with the use of Opioid.
Matthew Roberts, who was a graduate artist in the 3 Tors Town group, died in 2016, in Fanton and hydrocotone in his body.
The article has been revised to show that Walter's thirties are not Steven, Stephen.
Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendre Singh Rawat said that 650 grams of Parasitamal pills are enough to be taken and not to take it too much.
The irrelevant talk of the Chief Minister has created a major church in the motherland.
More than a thousand people have been suffering from dengue fever in the state of Uttarakhand.
Opposition parties, including the Congress, are accused of not taking any state-of-the-art precautionary measures.
In such a situation, the Uttarakhand-elector, who claimed that the state's effective process was less damaged by the state-of-the-art process, had been suffering from dengue and went to the government hospitals to seek health.
If he had enquired of health and come, he would not have been able to do so, but he did not have a suggestion.
In response to 500 grams of Parasitamal pills, 650 grams of Parasitamal pills have been taken and said that the dengue fever will erupt even if it rests.
He has been speaking as health officials say that those afflicted with dengue fever will not be able to take medicines on their own.
A few months ago, the same chief minister commented that the breathing problem would be straightforward when there was a wind out of the Greens.

Scratch 2 approves the creation of sports, anaemics and stories in Angland or Afghanistan.
So far, more than 30 cell phones have been used in hungry.
The boy has refused to hijack a volunteer in this game.
The player will get a statistic when he takes the volunteer out of his hideout every time.
I learnt at a boot camp how to create a game.
"Now, I am active in making a game at the time of fighting me," he said to CN.
In March, his father joined him in a 5-day boot camp for children between 5 and 15 years of age.
The camp, which was organised by the Codfest International Agency, was envisaged to vibrate growing techniques such as children like hungry, ropatics and technician truth.
In his father's hungry, Okbara Chineseers said they had played a lot of cell phone games in the hungry season.
When he was always picking up the phones, he was 4 years old, I bought a telephlet.
He played most of Candidates and Temple Runs," said his father CNN.
But after his father plans to spend all the time in sports, he was hungry at the age of 7.
"Like that day, he played a peacock in his telephlet, so I got angry," his father said.
With concern, 'You are always playing, do you think others are making a game to play your game'
I was angry when I told it, but I don't know he took it seriously.'
First of all, he was very interested in learning how to make sports, so his parents bought him a messenger and included him to learn the basics of making sports.
They are named on the basis of what their sports are in the future hungry that they want to be scientists.
One of his sports is 'Maskedo Mash' in Khukil Blastore.
The most number of young people in African world are in the forefront of the hungry in the protest when they come to be renewed.

The former leader of the North Carolina Republican Party is going to accuse him of lying in the lunch investigation.
Carolina's former president will agree to the court on Friday that he lied to Federal officials who have been conducting a lunch inquiry into the main political graduate.
The Federal Court calls for Raffin Heys to confess the crime next Wednesday.
Heys was told that he was a part of the Criminal Acquisition Treaty, in a document based on the truth signed by Haiz's lawyer, the FBI agents who conducted a lunch trial in 2018 had been informed of the unprecedented reports.
The crime acknowledgement treaty has been branded and does not really mention what charges he accepts.
The charges were initially imposed on him on the execution of the Saddam Plan, giving lunch and informing the opposite of the truth.
The state's leading insurance system was blamed by lawyers on the involvement of former parliamentarian Hayes in the project of a special privilege officer in reflection of the election campaign.
Two of the officials, Greg Lindberg and his colleagues, have been accused of attempting to give lunch to state insurance commissioner Mike Case.
Lindberg is a cop and investment company firm, who has been one of the state's leading political graduates in recent years, donating more than 5 million in the first year of 2016 to state and professional candidates.
Though he participated on Republican policies and its politicians, he also thanked the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to the email sent on Friday.
Gerans Davis, who was a lawyer to Haiz, did not respond to further comments on Friday.
The court documents on Friday reported that Heys lied to the FBI agents in August 2018 that he never spoke to Kase about the worker in the state insurance sector.
But Heys actually spoke to the insurance commissioner about Lindberg's demands to change the workers inside the organisation's face.
Attorneys said he was helpful when Lyndburgh asked for a meeting with Casey, and he was directly consulting the regulator about the lunch.
The charge published in April blames Lyndberg that he wanted special privileges for his insurance industry and had imposed up to 2 million for the 2020 re-election campaign in Kase.
The charge claims that Lyndberg's company had a demand for a revision of the departmental officer.
Casey, a Republican leader, told Federal intelligence officials about the attempt to lunch, helped them to prosecute.
There is no charge against him.
During a speech by Lindberg and Casey, a Lyndberg ally told Haiz to send 250,000 to Kase's reconstruction campaign.
Heys, who initially refused to say that it would be noticed if it was to send such a large amount, was accused of reducing criticism at the end of the speech.
'What you all want, we will do,' he said.
"Okay, I do this to him."
The information officer did not respond to the Federal Prosecutor's Office for further information on the crime contract.
The client has hid the number of wishes to try to improve the welfare of the travellers.
Some libraries cannot be found anymore in the world's first testing effort to improve the livelihood of the volunteers.
On the contrary, these wills will be individual and only those who responded to such a test conducted by Instagram in Australia in July.
The trial of Mohnool, which began on Friday, will also start Australia.
Australian library director Mia Carlic said this change was based on the opinion of psychologists that one of the socialists would compare the number of goods and wishes.
'There are really sympathetic comments from anti-terrorism groups and mental firms working with us,' Carlic said.
This is a replacement of the importance of the population and actually focussing on the value of their intersection and their records.
He said that it was not considered a rival, but people would be expected to be more surprising to participate in this base.
Carlic steals that the jobs based on the face will be able to continue the same levels as before and the same inner identities they had previously approached.
Instagram, Australia, Canada, Brussels, New ealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland, he said that this test will not be done even beforehand in other countries.
As the owner of Instagram is in Mohnool, nothing has been pointed out when this test can be done or whether this change will be sustained.
'We have now received some initial comments from the public about this experience (in Instagram), but in this situation we are still learning and careful,' he said.
Speaking of the world's exploration, Carlic said that Australia has a very active 'working-directed' users in the book and Instagram.
We believe it is the best country to really get the best ideas about whether it is an excellent experience for people using our services or not.
Every man is blessed with thanks to his parents who have developed himself.
I don't know how much my parents have done to develop a child.
As much as they need to do all their necessary aids in their lives, it is the statutory that continues to be thankful even after their life.
For this, Pitthurgan has been established.
It will be mentioned in many names like Dharpanam, Pitthurkariya and Portuguese.
Thankfully, they will call it 'Shartha' because it is necessary to do it with a sympathy on the day of the last month.
The goddesses are thirty-thiruvananthapuram, the south-wide god Vasokal, and he is always the head of fifty-two ovals.'
The 'Thanbuladaar' that is said indicates the hidden perspective.
As the world of the ancestors is southward, the world they live will be described as 'thenbulam'.
Despite a number of days to surrender, it is necessary to pay a monthly amazement.
Some of them are supposed to be supposed to be in Tei and Audi Amavas.
If Pitthar does not pay any attention to it, then it will be very important to start it on the occasion of Mahalaya Amavasana.
At this time, the Island is to come to the earth on the basis of our ancestors.
During the dharpan, he will use potatoes, water, pindams, rice, bananas and food.
It is a statute that Pitthar will bring the gods to the ancestors.
The enlightenment is that the ancestors who came to see their children in the world will return to the Piturloga today.
These days, bathing on the shores of the pilgrimage, worshipping the fathers and enjoying them, enjoying the luxury of the family and enjoying livelihood.

This is the second time that Nancy is the son-in-law of the American parliament.
He was the only member of the second time in office, including the only female member in the upper segment of the American constitution.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Iran Chancellor Hassan Roohani met on Thursday in the UN meetings.
The meeting has special significance over Iran's confrontation with the US.
From this meeting, for other countries, including the US, India has been given a clear message that India will not rule any compromise on its own foreign policy.
The Prime Minister's Office has deviated the meeting of the two leaders.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravi Kumar said that bilateral cooperation and regional conditions were discussed between the two leaders.
With a view to strengthening relations with Iran and expanding India's relations with West Asia, Prime Minister Modi went to Iran's capital Tehran in May 2016.
At the same time, India and Iran signed nearly a dozen contracts, a major deal with the port of Sabahar.

In February 2018, Rohani attended India.
The first Iranian prince, who had been visiting India in a decade, received the pride.
During his visit, there were several agreements between the two sides.
Prime Minister Modi and US Chancellor Donald Tirum have met twice in the past few days.
In recent times, tensions between the US and Iran have increased since Iran's economic sanctions.

Later, these concessions were handed over to the military commander by Erelands company officials.
The Madras High Court questioned the Tamilnadu government why not provide a separate leaflet at state medical colleges for readers in state schools.
In the private medical colleges in Tamilnadu, 207 places are not filled in the outstanding outlets for foreign residents, which are provided to the colleges related to the administration's accommodation.
Tiren, a resident of the Kova, had been prosecuted in the Chennai High Court by regular militia.
The case came to an inquiry into the matter with judges Kribakaran and Velmurugan.
When V.B. Ramaan argues that the Indian medical council has accorded a case, a list will be sent to the college on the basis of 10 students at a place where the Indians have been incarcerated after three-standing interaction.
The list must be filled in the underworld of college terms.
But I don't know if the list was filled in the slaughter force.
On behalf of the Tamilnadu government, additional chief prosecutor Arvind Pandian will be sent to the college club on the list of empty spaces.
It's merit that you have to fill empty spaces.
But they don't know how colleges are filled.
The Supreme Court has not produced any order regarding this.
He, therefore, argued that this righteousness would be required to resume appropriate orders for the overseas residents to fill the outstanding outlets.
When Velmurugan argued at the petitioner's level, he said that 207 locations that were empty have been sold for higher numbers.
Why don't the intermediate judges, who go to private schools to school, want only state medical colleges to study, don't be able to provide a separate disposal of state medical colleges to those studying in state schools, to send a list on empty-handed sites
Here, the state doctors are paid less wages than my assistants, than the teachers.
We are unjustly contemplated for the doctors.
We intend to include 10 private medical colleges in Tamilnadu as opponents.
Students who were summed up at foreign-class accounts for Indians and their assessments have been ordered by these colleges to be declared by October 15.
A life sentence for brothers on the honour of Baloch, Pakistan's social media famous Guanteel Plochi.
Guanteel Floch, famous for his social media photographs, was murdered in July 2016.
In the 'Gauravak murder' at the highest level of the country in Analyze last Friday, Pakistani social media famous Kuwinda was convicted of slaughtering his brothers and life imprisonment.
He was attracted by the Western civilization, but a profoundly hateful Baloch, popular for his fascinating skulls in Pakistan, was slaughtered by the neck in the month of July.
His brother Muhammad Wasim was arrested.
'Yes, I have killed my sister,' he said to a journalist who spent a few days saying she was 'sufficiently provocative'.
In a long-standing decision, the court in the eastern city of Muldan declared that he had been sentenced to life imprisonment by accusations against his party.
'He will be released to the High Court in Asia,' he said.
Earlier, Faloch's mother Anwar said he believed that his son would be released.
"He's father.
She's my daughter, she's my son,' he said.
Speaking internationally to Baloch's death, one of the voices began to resume action against a woman-slaughtered 'honor killings' infectiously to redeem social controls of the unconstitutional community.
Women have been burnt, buried, slaughtered and necked in order to humiliate their family with crimes like selecting their husbands or blossoming their own husbands.
One of the close relatives ordinarily killed these killings.
According to Pakistan's uizas (financial money) and Diade (breaking) law, they can apologize to the relatives of the victims.
Three months after Baloch was murdered, the parliament enacted a new law by forceing the life sentence for the honour killings.
However, the judge's self-decided claim that a murder would be regarded as a honourable murder, leading to other reasons for the death of the killers and obtaining a reputation.
In the killing of Baloch, his parents initially insisted that their son should not be forgiven and released.
But they argued that they would lose their son and turn their minds and apologise to him.
However, due to international dissatisfaction over the killing, the Pakistani government took an unprecedented step to announce itself as a privilege with parents.
The skirmishes for the Pakistani cricket garments and the adventurous skirt dressing of the followers every day are some of the comfortable activities they know.
This led to his contempt and threats, but in a country where he was seen as a dramatic and political activity for women's domination to make himself idolaters like Kim Gartashian, including young people.
'Gaurava' is in the roots of the killings in tribal social controls, which are widely widespread throughout South Asia, although men may be affected, they swear to women's act.
Today we are losing the ground water a little bit.
Now we are beginning to feel the need for palm trees.
For this, Tamilnadu is now becoming popular with social enthusiastics and youth.
The work is being carried out in the form of 'Prabhakaran Revolutionary Seeds Movement' in Ananwas, the district of the district of the district, which has been faster than the year 2015.
Many Tamilnadu district youths are members of Puducherry, Tirchi, Selam and Thanjavur.
Everyone is studying in different works.
However, the youth of this organization are enthusiasticly engaged in various tasks such as planting trees, restricting water conditions and redemption of ancient historical sites.
Gaza is collecting seeds of palm seeds and sowing them in many places of Tamilnadu and providing free of cost to the needy.
I am familiar with the youth who coordinate Prabhakaran's revolutionary sowing movement.
Edison, one of them, shared with me about their work.
The west elephant that died sinfully
Speaking about this, animal health enthusiasts said, 'This was transformed into a brade jewel in 2004.
After that, more trains are being directed on this route.
Elephant deaths are also increasing since the increase in the number of trains.
This area is the way for elephants.
We took care of the railways that elephants were killed in the accident due to the rapid movement of the railways.
After that, the railways were ordered to move in this area at a low speed.
Due to this, the dangers also decreased.
Trains are now being run faster in the region.
In other areas, we are asking for a penalties.'
Speaking about this, the North-Eastern Railway officials said, "The railway station in the area is 15 km.
While passing this area, the railways were slowly ordered to be directed.
The order to move the railways slowly for 24 hours is in Amal.
Continuous tests are being conducted in the forest area.
Consults are also being taken to reduce the speed of the trains.'
A three-member committee has been formed to conduct research on the movement of trains in the area.
The damaged area was 4.5 degrees square.
He is being treated by Loco Pilot who directed the train.
Social enthusiastics have said that they have been stopped for the last one-and-a-half hours without giving the female feedback to the pregnant women in Tamilnadu.
Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy's reproduction program was launched in the Tamilnadu State Health Department in the form of poor pregnant women on behalf of the public welfare and family welfare department.
Within 12 weeks of pregnancy, a bank account of Rs 4,000 will be calculated to the village and urban earliests by recording the name of the project for reproductive funding, including the data card, bank account number.
After the completion of the 4th month, it will be paid 4,000 for the 2nd term.
After delivery at the state hospital, a total of 18,000 subsidies of Rs.2,000, after the completion of the 3rd month of delivery, 4,000 rupees for the period of vaccination to children, and 4,000 rupees for the period of vaccination.
Likewise, in the pregnancy, the nutrients including iron tonic, dry treatment, protein biscuits, ghee, albendosol pills, albendosol pills, grade pieces are provided.
The scheme was implemented in order to develop pregnant women with their child health.
The plan was very effective for mid-term and irregular pregnant women.
Over the past year, the reproductive subsidies offered to pregnant have been stopped without regular payment.
According to social enthusiastics, 'The 18,000 pharmaceutical subsidies paid to the pregnant women on behalf of women's livelihood and family welfare have not been provided for the past 13 months.
This has affected mother and child health care during delivery.
There has been a situation of spending money on child care.
While nutritious foodgrains are only provided, the bank accounts have not been granted assistance till date.
Asked by the Department of State Health officials, the Central Government has not yet provided the amount for the first detention to be granted.
After the central government's first detainee pays 2,000 rupees, the remaining 16 thousand rupees will be paid to the bank account.
It is, however, questionable whether the Tamilnadu government has registered the applications of pregnant women seeking reproduction assistance.
Hence, they have to take a state-wide deck to provide immediate reproductive subsidies for more than a year.'

Due to the rains in the square giri, devotees refused 30 minutes of trekking.
Devotees were allowed to climb the Chaturgi Sundermahalingam Temple for the last few days after the Bharavan Mahalaya Amavas.
After the forest department's inspection at 6:00 am yesterday morning, the demonstrators climbed and surrounded the cloud over 11:30 in the morning and rained.

"I was very filming when I was 25," he said.
I served as a researcher in PBC Scotland, saying that my employer could never enter the television because of my glasso superiority.
Before I was responsible at the Clasco office, I went to London to see all the television teams and the broadcast.
I wouldn't forget that in the morning, both Ann Timond and Mac Moris were interviewing the famous interview Davis.
I couldn't believe that I was in the same room as a very prominent man.
I realized that this is where I like to be.
Kelly, who started his life as a local daily newspaper in the eastern club in Scotland, became a Scotland correspondent of the AM television in 1984.
He started summarising events such as GMDV, IDV breakfast and Dafreck, and then started the morning event that he had received.
He has celebrated his 35th anniversary with a special event to recall his unforgettable claims and interviews.
He told the collector that he was a secret to television based on 'prostitution, enthusiasm' and 'prostitution' and 'You have to do necessary work.'
You must be honest and real.

imbabwe: Sievanga was afraid of getting stuck.
A senior government official said that Tunnan-Adviser Constantino Siwenga denied the opportunity to become a Chancellor at the time of the revolutionary culmination, fearing that it would be a fabrication for the military to seize the regime in November 2017.
Last week, imbabwe Indipendent said that during the Revolution, he and the army had been negotiated to accept the post of Chancellor.
An senior government official, however, told the social media that he could not refute this opportunity because of fear and really lost his position in the revolution, he could know the plans of Mugabe who used himself to demonstrate to the world leaders and the African Union (AU) leaders.
imbabwe's 37-year-old ruler was prepared to hand over power to Chivnga, but Chancellor Emerson confirmed that he was a senior government official of the office and ministry office that he was not from Nanga.
Officials said Mugabe had approached Sevenka by one of his ambassadors, who knew that he was losing power from his hand.
According to the senior government official, there were three individuals in the midst of the military bureaucracy and the hijacked former Chancellor.
Among the negotiators, Chancellor's spokesman, George Saramba, said Aaron Nebera and Roman Catholic Pishop Glaric Fidelis Munori were the then heads of the Central Intelligence Agency.
He was another member of the talks with imbabwe Defence Force (ISTF) commander idiana Gono Mugabe, former Governor of the imbabwe Reserve Bank, who was supposed to be a presidential candidate.
He describes Africa's identification after his death since his lifetime and demands the intervention of other African leaders, while attempting to dominate the African Union's recognition of military operations.
The Colombo (Mugabe) did not select the presidency of the CDF (Chavenga, the commander of the security forces).
'This was a very unbelievable attempt to cure the widespread hazardous environment, which was blaming a part of the hijacked prince's family,' the official (Jamwanda) wrote.
But there was little political climate, but the hijacked Chancellor believed that it would at least improve the situation in the diplomatic system.
Recall the promises of the commanders that the constitutional order would not be deteriorated or disrupted, and the situation would have confronted them with the standpoint of the African Union on revolutions.
The hijacked Chancellor (Mugabe) believed that the CDF would be involved in the trap, which would ensure the words of the commanders that they did not disturb the constitution.
Mugabe's (maximum) hope is that the African Union, which was very embarrassed to take it on the basis of its theoretical nature of revolutions, would have been demonstrating that it was necessary for military intervention.
The opportunity was calculated in such a way.
Officials said Mugabe had taken this action when he felt that the security forces were not prepared to save themselves.
The military warned him of the danger of being killed like Kadafi, he said Mugabe was urging to write Rajini's letter.
Military officials told him that civilians would not protect him from them if they were to attend his Floo Roop settlement.
At that time he had two wishes to defend his family and prove that the army was taking over.'
The CDF and the commanders were well aware of that.
The senior government official said that Isu Tiri Wemakwapa -Makwapa (we are none of us, i.e., military personnel), was told that we are not politicians or political rivals.
The military officers in the area do not have their intention to remove Mugabe by their staff in imbabwe, but the government officials say the military has explained that the 'griminals' surrounding him should be taken care of.
In contemplating to continue the Revolution and regime, the camp also tried to use the same war to recall Nagawa, which had been slaughtered for some time in South Africa.
Apart from negotiating with the military, Mugabe also called for assistance from the region.
South Africa - not only because of its economic and regional strength, but also the then Chancellor Jacob uma SADC - refused to intervene - but, as the army entered the house of Mugabe, cleared that the South African troops would come to Harare immediately.
'Independent and African leaders didn't want it,' the news agency said.

It looks beautiful, but it is one of the most transformed and ruthless cemeteries in our beaches.
Every hour, about 1560 kilometres of plastic is coming under our waterways, most of which are entering the port through rainy seasons.
'This port is very terrible,' Dr. Tafron said.
One-third of these wastes are coming through rain water streams.
However, 70 percent of the plasters inside the sea have reached the sea shore, the problem of the Sydney port is greater under a ice slope.
He and his militia personally describe the exit of Plastic in 500 every year, 'You can only know what is really there if you spend the time under the water,' Richard Nichols, the owner of the Manali Diu Centre.
They will be shocked if most people know what is in water.
Maximum... each of us sees half plastic bags.
The remaining 50 percent will be at least made by plastic.
It looks very beautiful when you look at the port, but people don't believe that all these plastic and clusters are from below its surface.
Ossen Protect deputy director and management director Germany Prince also said the local and tourists had only one way to help reduce the amount of plastic and pipelines that reach our waterways.
'It must start from the source,' he said.
We have to reduce the amount of plastic, especially refusal, and be very careful that the circulation within our neighborhoods is finally reaching the sea.
If we destroy the sea, we are going to destroy ourselves because 50 percent of the oxygen that breathe comes from the sea.
It snatches 30 percent of the carbon dioxide and food source.
But we can fix this port and bring it to its oldest position, it is very simple.
If we destroy the sea, we destroy ourselves.
A research on plastic and mental health published this month was a refreshing agency TOMRA, a part of its widespread effort to awaken the Australians about the deficit of environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of natural resources.
In a comment by 546 children between 12 and 18, 82 percent of the population was unconscious of plastic spending, and 25 percent accused the elderly of the problem of plastic being used once.
As 93 percent of the 551 parents who were asked to comment on the scale of Plastic to reach the ocean, the Plastic analysis showed that parents were very concerned about the matter.
Many of the analysis said we would like to do anything about plastic spending, but there was no difference in how it was.

Dasmanian television can be able to treat cancer .
Researchers have discovered a temperament that produces revolution in the treatment of patients that can lead to the cure of cancer in Dasmenian tables.
Some cancerous cells have found out how they hide themselves .
Researchers have found out that this process will also happen to Dasmanian dialects and humans .
It is believed that this discovery will give new methods of treatment to cancer patients .
What is common with Dasmanians and humans
Cancer cells that don't seem to be inspired.
Many other researchers, who came from Melbourne's Peter Mecculum Cancer Centre, have found out that many types of cancers have not been replaced by anti-infected treatment methods, which would help in creating revolution in their treatment.
The main part of the destructive Dasmanian television's future threatens to deteriorate the dangerous faces.
The study observed a group of proteins, BRC2, hiding themselves from the way that some cancer cells in the individuals and those organisms have hid themselves from the way they have not been able to act with a symptom of a warning of cancer in the anti-neuropathy region.
It could be a major challenge for the treatment of small lung cancer , neuroplastoma and Merkel cells .
'It is the greatest advantage of this program that we can be able to revert the process to the patients of resistance to the anti-neuropathic treatment system at some time,' he told the head of the Peter Mag Researcher Mark Dason AB firm.
The immune system can be recognized by reversing the aim of the existing treatments to activate the proteins, which are targeted, MH, and the cancer cells.
Professor Dason said, 'This is possible for people with lung cancer,' he said.
'This is one of the most common diseases around the world.
We can also be treated in a more specific way.
Researchers believe that this discovery can be finally used in the face bones of the Dasmanian device that prevents cancer cells from detecting the same way.
In fact, the same activity (in the men and the Dasmanian television cancer) is significant,' said Professor Dason.
Till now, it was very difficult to treat the cancer tumors in the Dasmenian diet.
But if the dosminian tablets can also be used by humans, it can be helpful in regulating the disease.'
Intellectualization of the Building Studies Agency to work with public humiliation on the climate.
The National Institute of Building (NIS) has announced publicly that it will be supposed to act on the soil climate that occurs after a severe rainy season.

The organisation has declared the general public that it will be intensely involved in the eruption of land, descending, demolition of lagging powers, trees and eruption of building walls.
According to these symptoms, the National Institute of Studies has declared that they are out of the areas.
Scientists have been stunned to roam around the greatest satellite.
Scientists are amazed at finding a very small star called Red Dwarf, which will challenge the current report on the creation of a leaflet.
The art form of Geje 3512B, the largest gas leaflet surrounding its supreme nutrient Red Dwarf, published on September 26, 2019.
Normally the stars will be greater than the largest lectures surrounding them.
In the event, however, the researchers said that the stars and globes have not had much differences on Thursday.
The star, i.e. 3512, is 12 percent in the amount of our sun, while the surrounding cluster will be at least half of the huge club of our survivor's family.
Carlos Morells, who headed the study published in the science journal, said, 'It is a surprising thing,' he said.
The discovery was surprising as the theoretical models of the low-scale stars like the Earth and the small neptunes are usually observing small lectures.
In this, we have found a small star roaming the largest gas gasoline like anxiety,' Morells said.
This leaflet, which was highly air-conditioned, was found using a telephone in the Caller Alto Analysis study in Spain.
It is surrounding its star on its long line of 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and low temperatures in the surface.
Geje 3512 is not only smaller than our sun, but only 35 percent larger than the disease, compared to a very large club.
They reflect less energy and are bluffer than the sun, and their surface temperature will be less cooler than 3800 (Digri) Kelvine (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit 3,527 Celcius).
That's why they are red,' Morells said.
While the star has the source of a second lecture, Morells said that the third lecture might have been driven away from the star family in the past, which explains the length of the globe like Viajan.
The lectures are also from the same edge of the gas and dust between the stars they roam around.
According to the principal model of creating lectures, the so-called 'maternal growth,' a substance is initially produced from the potholes in the neighbourhood, which leads to a climate from the geopolitical energy surrounding gas.
It is like an unstable geopolitical geopolitical system that can explain the opposite system.
'In this event, the Proto Plantery surrounding the low-year star may be slightly bigger and cooler than expected.'
This makes the layer unstable, causing some dense areas to appear.
They can grow up by these bulls, which creates a leaflet.
In Tripura, the order to produce a ban on sheep and sheep in the temples has become a major church.
The mother-in-law has stated in the court that her promise to Tripura was withdrawn when joining India in 1949.
The 1355 years and 184 princes signed an agreement with India on October 15, 1949.
The then Tripura ueen Kanchan Prabha Devi and India Governor General signed the deal.
The main part of the agreement is that the Tripura government will continue financial assistance for traditional worship for 14 temples, including the famous Tripura Sundari Temple.
It is common to sacrifice sheep at Tripura Sundari temple.
It is also helping state funds.
This should not be changed, the main factor of the joint agreement with India.
On the contrary, Subhas Patriji continued the public welfare case at the Tripura High Court that it was enjoying Hindus' minds to sacrifice sheep and sheep with state financial assistance.
Division bench judges Sanjay Karol and Aritham Lod, who have asked for this case, have imposed a stereotype that they should not sacrifice sheep at places in Tripura.
The court insisted that the state should not assist in the sacrifice of such sheep.
Moreover, the court has sent noties to all district magistrates and police observers to respond to the matter.
In addition, the temples should not be sacrificed except with slaughter and cattle, and the court has ordered the CCDV cameras to be checked in all the temples.
The Supreme Court is now supposed to appeal to this order of the Tripura High Court.
Indicating that Tripura's High Court has rejected its argument not to redeem the promise given by India when it is joining India in 1949, she stated that the mother-in-law has been appointed at the Supreme Court.

State family secrets: Absolutely amazing residents who travel frequently in the royal air.
As part of their state obligation, the royal family must take hundreds of visits around the world in their lifetime.
Generally, it is easy for the royal airplane - a separate flight to enhance the royal family members all over the world for important events and advance events.
It is not surprising to have personal privileges because of a private airplane.
With no longer needed to wait in the security lines and unrest for the number of bids, it appears that the royal family can take any companion they want - including some unexpected travelers.
According to Chenal 5 documentary recently released from the floods, there is no queen and younger people who travel frequently at the royal airplanes.
During the 'Rail air secrets' program, the former aeroplane who carried Rani's airplane revealed that many organisms would often be residents with family members.
'Some important royal family dogs, along with our principal royal family, may come to travelers at times,' said Pap Shelts.
It is not surprising that Rani, who was known for a deep buzz on the dogs of Carcus, has invited her lovely companions to travel with him.
Elizabeth Rani was a lover of four-length fossils from the age of the age, it is said that he had had more than 30 caricas ethnic dogs since his queen hair was scorched.
He is believed to have had five dogs like Mandi, Emma, Linet, Villo and Holly in 2007.
There were five cakers of Spanish types of dogs, including Pisto, Oxo, Flash, Spic and Spanish, and four descents - Carlie, Perry, Walkon and Candie.
Workers at the royal air will be uncomfortable.
Shelters added that the members of the staff's households could gather the dogs to Bulldar and see them hunting to spend.
I am glad to say there was no danger at all.
When he went to work, the incident also showed the surprising surprisingness of the well-known commodities to take Rani.

And it shall come to pass, that it shall be like the weight of two big elephants.
But he is not only a queen who is attracted to clothes.
It is said that the Cambridge monkeys had their own personal desires to carry their modern clothes - each of their clothes would be excluded.

The leader of the committee, Mr. Frank Davis, questioned the involvement of Davies and said he was unhappy with the insertion.
In an interview with GNA Sport, he said he had the doubt that the chairman of the committee would justify that he could be helped by the results of the study establishment.
The observation committee must have intermediate people from outside without contact with any member and be already unsuitable.
For instance, Mr. Davis has been treated as a prosecutor to write to them for 10 percent of the payment.
He is a well-known Olympic supporter.
For both of these reasons, he should not be allowed to continue in the Studies Committee,' he argued.

He is the younger son of Ponanumu, who is conducting a child health hospital in KK Nagar, Chennai.
Asoka Sikamani is very much interested in cricket before schooling.
At one point, he tried to be held in the Indian ball.
This is the reason why India Simonds Senivasan has been elected to the Tamilnadu Cricket Association without competing for leaders and executives.
If there was a competition, the son of Ponamundi, Ashok Sikamani Srinivasan would have given a duff to her daughter Rupa.
Ask Chikamani will be the deputy leader of the Tamilnadu Cricket Association and he will be quiet after he has been called peacefully on the peninson level.
A case has been filed to hand over Tamil inscription stairs to the Tamil archaeologists.
Madurai on Wednesday ordered the Chennai High Court Madurai to respond to the 27th Tamilnadu craftsmanship of the Central Information Technology (CHIS) to defend and renew the archaeological stories.
Mani Madurai's Mani Charan has been affected: In the state of Andhra Pradesh and Mysore, there is an inscription service under the Central Archaeology Department.
There are conservative rockets and historical halls in India.
The textbooks in which Tamil inscriptions are based on the science fulfilment of Tamil history.
Moreover, the Tamilnadu craftsmen have been documented.
In this case, when the inscription department office in Mysore shifted to a new building from the old building, the majority of the poor Tamil inscriptions were damaged.
The inscriptions there must be regularly preserved, editioned by books and monitoring the historical documents.
But the documents related to Tamilnadu, which were tied to Mysore, were not regularly protected.
The Tamils' history and tradition are unaware of the generations of the years.
So, Mysore said he had to order the Tamil craftsmanship statistics from the Department of Inscription to be handed over to the Legal Department from Tamilnadu.

One-and-a-half-definite demand for competition against Australia.
Jastein T.P. said, 'The time has come in the race against the Australian march that determines the Walls Unemployment in the world.'
The success against the Australian mobilisation will ensure the possibility of a fight with France or Argentina by making them the most possibly possibly possibly possessed of victory in T-B.
But for the 14th time in their 15 meetings, however, if the Australian garrison veils were nice, it would defraud the drive and the garrisons with the UK for the last eight seats.
'There is no hiding in this, the two teams succeed and try to take the first step in the part,' he said the Wells Front's neighbour.
Some of the decisions in the past were difficult, but in the past, a victory against them (Australia) was sweet.
I think they will be in a sharp idea about our waking up again, while we want to ensure another victory.
We know that it is going to be a major rival before it comes here.
Now we have come here, it's time to really show ability.
In history of the world, the Walls team has won only one victory against Australia, New ealand or South African clothing, which is the victory of the Australians in the third place 32 years ago.
Only 7 successes have been achieved in 41 attempts against three Southern Jambians under the overall leading trainer Warren Gateland.
In November last year, Wells stopped the 13-tenst contest against Australia, one of those who participated in the 9-6 victory in the Tokyo Stadium contest on Sunday.
Before the victory, he said, 'It is difficult to say it,' he added.
Those rivals were very difficult, perhaps... people could think there was some heartache, I don't know.
In the last race, we left around 15 points, so it would be harder to see the figures than really.'
In the wake of Wales's victory, the struggle for Typrus with Australia's renowned rows, Michael Hupper and David Bokka, would be important.
The 67-pronged dipping differed, he supposed to oppose these two soldiers in the previous multilateral, so he knows exactly what's going on.
'These seven are totally worldwide,' he said.
You always know that the competition would be difficult to fight with the world-wide financing wire.
Both of them are continually homeless in the world.
You know what kind of competition you are going to face.
One of the best households in the world to save the fleet is Pokak and Michael's slightest attack, which he has at the right time at the right place.
You have to challenge yourself with the world's leading soldiers rather than fighting with those who don't play well.
You would like to play against the best civilians, and you must be with the best labour when playing against these two soldiers.
I wouldn't say that the rivalry to be held on Sunday was ultimate, but this is our main rival in the world's clue.
The excitement of the army is a major part of it.
It will be difficult to woke you if you play specially and express a special activity.

Istandors Spilers: After the tremor of Vitni, Pen kisses the skull.
The surprising surprising virginity of Vitni Dean (Shona McCarthy) snatched away and joined her earliest, the tension between Calam Hive and Pen Midsel once again explodes in the Estates.
But will they both come about the relationship between them or the wrathful situation
With the help of Penin's life-saving call, he and Pen were gradually involved with the idea that he and Pen had been gradually involved in the help of the Baby Beyal, he recently told Penn that he was prepared to show his weak and soft side.
Still, Vidni is returning from a holiday in a special mood than he left.

The white palace is very terrible for the purpose of knowing how the posting is located in the foothills .
White House officials are desperate to decide on how to face the renewed effort of Democrats to take office on Thursday, one of whom knew about the situation that the entire terrible situation was coming over the last week because there was no solution to this new issue.
A person close to the White House said that the allegations of secret were swiftly affected by the hunter and his surroundings.
'There's no hope that there's nothing there,' he said.
White House officials are not sure what they do, there is no clear plan for the situation, but because the simple ways used by the hunter to avoid the churches are not useful in the past: 'It does not appear to be a matter of disappearance when the next news comes.'
Another person, who knew these suggestions, told the White House that the possibility of going to the state of uncontrollable is increasingly worried if the post-inquiries continue to be held.
While he was expected to increase pressure on the Chancellor every day during the post-public inquiry, he also expressed the same concern that he would 'encouraged' and would expect some surrounding the architects.
It provokes an unprecedented and unexpected resistance to the trend of the Tropy - both in the election year, to worry about the Chancellor and the political situation.
While confronting his presidential position unprecedented threats, Robert Muller's revival of the war he saw was capable of the Russian intelligence, he turned to a defence from the drama attack tank.
He reversed attention to the actions of the Democrats and the presidential candidate Joe Peden, who secretly issued a secret and attempted to lose his demands to help the Ukraine Chancellor to help in their political opponents.
But as many people in the White House experienced Muller Beney, the aides and advisers said that this process had begun to feel differently.
While being considered as a hunter, a journalist on Wednesday told a man about the situation that he was defeated by a press conference.
Fond of questioning about Russian intelligence, Trop appeared to have been unconscious to answer Ukraine's questions.
Some people have concluded the fact that the questionable telephone call between Trop and Ukraine Chancellor Volodimir Chelenski was not directly known - that it would reduce his credibility if they argued.
Moreover, as it is often happening, the prince intends to defend his true trustees that he has become confined to the end.
But one of the closest smugglers to the White House said that the architect's basic recognition points are already high and the recognition of the new ones will not be easily available for the post-election.
'In the past four months, there is no good in paying attention to the prince's post, especially if it breaks his legislative events and breaks the headlines.
Another arbitrator claims that he can help the prince in office, he is not fully aware of how his response would be.
Disturbed White House officials are looking for advisers to assist how to act in response to the dismissal.
As the attempts are still in the early stages, the person told the plans that it was more obvious about the attempts like the war chamber or how it would be.
The individual acknowledged that the obviously predictable report was to confront the public support against the publication of secret and the summary of the integrated legislative and intelligence wars was required to confront the speed of the publication of the Democrats.
An analyst said that foreign minister Mike Bambio and finance minister Steve Nuchin were not going to issue an indication of Ukraine's call for a tribunal - that there was no other way than to release the document for nearly 48 hours and that the long-term telephone was unconscious.
It is expected to be more pressured than Rabbert Muller's inquiries, who speaks only by his accusations, and a person who is expected to make a revenge for the post will be driven by Fitbul and former propaganda supervisor Gore Levandoski.
But for such an attempt, Levandoski said that he was not really supposed to be the leader.
'I have done everything I have to do for the past five years to support the employer and his plan, but I have not done any advice with the Chancellor about joining a team to counter the faulty post.'
J Seculo, who is an external prosecutor of the dramat from the Muller investigation, is also involved in the post-election attempts.
When IC News contacted his opinion, he said, 'We will deal with things at one time.'
While the Clinton post was posted, Mullar guided by Emmad Flood until the trial finally, the current legal advisor of the White House has no experience in the White House.
A sympathetic person told the White House's warfare that none of the officers were nearly to coordinate or build war rooms - but he acknowledged that the integrated and all-integrated replies would be necessary to advance political struggle.

While traveling to the Middle Grounds, there is also a possibility of discovering tasty food around the world through a variety of diets in the ship.
There are recent Asian food items in the ship's luxury, which can be obtained in the ordinary organisation by supplicating the traditional Italian diet in the new Italian crisp of Kiovani.
Other food items in the ship include Sabs Gril, American Steakhouse, Boleros Latin Phar, Schuner Phar and Jani Rockets Express.

'The fourth ship, xplorer of the discipline, was transformed by Wayzer in the neo-material effort of the Royal Amplified ships,' the surveillance ship director said.
In four years, this project, which has invested more than 1 billion in 10 ships, contains every part of the experience of the residents, provides a variety of synonymous synthetics and food and night life.
Davy News is blaming the Democrats for asking for 'Tramp's release films.
It is obvious that parliamentarian Davie News (R-Califf) has not been able to investigate the Chancellor Donald Trump.
On Thursday, he accused the Democrats of attempting to obtain tribunal films to protect him.
In the initial statement, News, chairman of the parliamentary intelligence committee, described the charge as trampling Ukraine's assistance to the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Peden and his son to investigate.
He previously stated that the Democrats wanted to see the architect's defensive photos, he said Ukraine's fraud was a 'strong shape' made by the left and their 'strategic assets.'
'The Democrats in the group held talks with those who thought they were from Ukraine to get the dramatic films,' News said.
People can justify why they are determined to dismiss the supremacists in the event of alienation of them in the same year.
When News finished his speech, Huffbost senior political expert Genefer Pentry decided to find out whether Democratic politicians want to make a deeper understanding of this matter.
So far, the Connectigate Representative Jim Haims (D) has responded, but we are doubtful that many of his colleagues will believe that he will be true.
Mediaite.com suspects the New Yens' comments on the patronage of the 'extraordinary and uncertain extraordinary details' found in the controversial Steel Documents.

Rajendran, the Chief Minister of Honey Medical College, contributed to a person in the holticket during the student gathering.
It is said that the student was involved on that basis.
It was stated in the college's first audience that the neighbour who had chosen participated in the gathering of analysts and students and Udhid Surya participated in the Galluri class.
But Udit Surya said he had directly participated in the ballot organisation and student gathering.
How did he join Udit Surya College with a holticket that has received a photo of a man who has been humiliated
Why did he not pay attention to the consolidation and student union
The questions arose.
While student Udhid Surya has been admitted to the medical college, it is now known in the hearing.
The films and films in the hall ticket are different.
The ballot given by student Udhid Surya is also different from the ballot given by Honey State Medical College chief Rajendran CBCIT officials.

The possible biochemical research can help in reducing the smoke output .
In recent years, the electric cars and the Tesla Semmy-tracks are fleeing to the headlines, as if the renewable energy is fleeing into the verandah:

Hydrocarbon fuel is produced from libid layouts such as food oil, animal supplements and canola oil.
Without any other bio-arms, it can be used in this technique to use decreasing oil in its production, which allows only 85 percent of the carbon publications to be reduced, and other factories to be used during this process.
This technique works to reflect hydrocarbons in petroleum based fuels.
'Our technology has been done in the first generation and the same hydrocarbons that are elementary in Desal Casolin,' Frenchler said.
As it provides a new dimension for the use of bio-arming, the previously built bio-arming techniques lose stability in low temperatures, which creates a serious problem for the high flying air.
'The problem in vast gas is like the unprecedented GATS-2 issue,' Frenchler said.
In fact, its value is less than diesel, but it needs more.
The Brusseler's observatory is now focusing on two choices to produce bio-arms for air.
In the first round, their hydrocarbon is a less dangerous approach to purification of biochemical fuels and inserting hydrogen.
The second choice is to stabilise fuel in low temperatures and continue to work in a segment-productive system.
'We can play some games with the chemicals in our reactor,' Frenchler said.
There are more risks.
Both the airlines and the Canada and the US military have invested more for renewable choices, and the Alberta University sub-construction firm Forge Hydrocarbons has been working to make it commercially.
'In the future, someone expects to pay a carbon tax on them.'
They are expecting a change.
Forge is currently conducting a test factory near Edmmanton's excavation management centre and recently received US 4 million investment from Lackheed Martin to help build a 25 million manufacturing plant in Sombra in Andario.
The plant is expected to produce fifteen million litres of bio-arms every year.
Frezler also states that the carbon publication will be estimated to be 85 percent decreasing, but the fact that the carbon publications are not very decreasing, such as the extraction of fuel and production.
"A technological man,"
Frenchler said it was possible to create and create a variety of chances of choices in the manner of taking out the outstanding decisions.
The High Court has decided yesterday to examine the basic rights petition by Chechu Shiafthin Mohammad Shafi, a man of genius and genetic illness of the Gurunakal Podhana hospital.
The petition is to be taken by a high court on January 24.
It is notable that the illegal observation of pregnancy was accustomed to the arrest and detention of the criminals under various charges, including unreasonably accumulating funds, and attacking Dr. Shabi basic human rights.
Between the Prime Minister's request for peace, the Porish Johnson's coalitions are consistently appealing to the Prime Minister's people to quietly consciously confront problems such as Las Angeles if the Frexid is withdrawn.
A senior cabinet minister said yesterday that the real decision was to change the second vote, there was a danger of 'deteriorating and mass upheaval' in the country.
The Prime Minister's senior coalition parties warned that Yuke would face unrest at home at the level of yellow flag strikes in France and the Las Angeles in the 1992s.
Mr. Janson insisted that he would 'suffocate anger' in the political language about this distress, but that I would not stop using the word 'socialism'.
While he called for peace, a cabinet minister told Times: 'We haven't seen Glads Johns [Manjal Cripple] fighting or Los Angeles riots [in 1992].
People did not think it was possible in this country because it was not happening earlier.
Now they have a model of yellow leaf fighting and modern phones to coordinate, and only two prominent leaders need to encourage the masses.
Following the release of four White Police Officers in the case of a black auto driver Rodney King, a riot broke out in Las Angeles in 1992.
In the beginning of this year, there was devastation and destruction in the streets of the city of Paris over six weeks by the French revolutionaries against the Gleet Johns-worn state.
If Britain failed to withdraw from the EU, the minister said, 'Mr. Janson was underneath that the hopes of our political establishment would be enhanced.'
'After 66 percent of us said that 30 million people might have joined the vote, 10 million people are still not satisfied,' the minister said.
Though 99 percent of them are neglected, yet 10,000 are indeed angry, they write to their parliamentary member and prevent it.
There is no greater need than that, thousands of people will soon be on the streets.
A senior cabinet minister added that if the second clause changed the decision of the first vote, there would be a danger of 'definite and public upheaval' in the country.
Mr. Janson has called for a general election to address the Frexid issue.
He is reportedly confronting the rebellion of the ministers who have to make a compromise agreement with the EU in return to reduce their fraccid demands.
The life sentence for his brothers who killed Pakistan's social media popularity 'Gaurav'.
Woman rights experts have said that most of the denounced justice is not being implemented, while the practices are being carried out at some time, the accused are freed from the custody of the killers and the case is to be crushed.
'When it takes a long time, people forget,' said Ferson Perry, who founded Pakistan's first Palestinian Research Department at a university, and had three years to resolve in the precise Baloch case.
Despite the fact that it is difficult to establish trusted figures, the Pakistan Human Rights Authority has faced at least 300 'honor killing' cases in 2018.
Many prosecutors say that the real number will be higher every year as the Honorary Violence Awareness Network estimates that one fifth of the world's 5,000 honour killings will take place in Pakistan.
The rainy season has created floods and confusion in many parts of India.
India's season has increased nearly a month, due to unconditional rains, there have been deaths due to dry buildings, and many crops have started crying.
Ordinarily, in early September, the monsoon will start declining in northern India, but the average rainfall in this month is 37 percent more than normal.
In the remaining few days, Indian window analysts say this would be the only season that has not been decreasing in the last few decades.
In many parts of the country, there has been undefinite rains yet, and the recent rains are the town of Pune, the western part of India, where the untimely rains on Wednesday and Thursday have caused devastation of many deaths and buildings.

It is not simply possible to rain at this time of the year.
'This burns my vegetables - eggs, beans, butterflies and tomatoes,' said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer from Pimdal in the state of Uttarakhand.
Since late, the sustainable season has increased the price of onion in Indian food due to the price of consumers.
Usually a kilogram of 20 rupees (23 pounds) is sold for 80 rupees (Sumar 1) in cities like onion, Delhi and Mumbai.
Festivals have also been threatened.
The next big festival, Dussehra, is to come on October 8, when Hindus will set up Karavanan's Thirumbavi, a romantic character, who laughs with great fun.
The burning of the queen reflects the benefits against the evil.
But if the climate continues, it can be a wind at the end if these climates are cooked.
How would it be environmentally useful for various facilities at a state hospital called the bus stop, free vehicle stop, public spending and the public meeting of political parties
This is the condition of the state hospital in Udangarai district of Uttar Pradesh.
This is an important state hospital for treatment of 1000 to 1200 patients per day.
There should be no more scarcity at the surroundings of the hospital, and there are many methods of pursuing the hospitals that cannot be ruined.
If they don't follow any surroundings, they are supposed to be sympathetic to the state hospital.
Public and private buses are being stopped before the hospital's entry.
While the bus stop is near the hospital, the entrance is closed before.
And the mourning of the sheep shall be dried up with a loud voice.
For the deficit, the bus driver's quote.
Private ambulances are also confused by the state hospital.
This shows a vehicle crisis at any time before the hospital.
Receipt of Tamilnadu is ready to face the north-eastern climate, Peter Management Minister R.B. Udayakumar said in Tirchi.
Minister R.B. Udayakumar, who came to participate in various events in Tirchi, told reporters.
The southwest is confronted with other states other than Tamilnadu.
In the north-eastern season, Tamilnadu continues for three months from October.
The low climate humidity that occurs on the sea level during the emergence of the climate is likely to surpass the beach.
The Tamilnadu is ready to face the north-eastern climate in the Nizamuni, considering the worst effects in the past.
It has been found that 4,393 locations are damaged.
In this, five-foot water-related areas have been brought to the most dangerous list.
There is a possibility of an inflammation in 12 coastal districts in the state.
In these districts, 121 special centres have been set up to secure civilians.
In addition, marriage halls, schools and communities in other districts have been instructed to be prepared.
For repayment work, Rs.148 crores has been allocated.
Moreover, the state-wide residue forces are ready in these districts.
A fisherman did not even die during the Gaja Building due to the precautionary action of the state of Tamilnadu.
On the contrary, the wall collapsed and the electricity swollen deaths occurred.
Full precautionary measures have been taken to prevent such deaths this year.
The rehabilitation and restructuring work continues to provide no relief to the rescue works.
Accordingly, an action has been taken to build houses with slaughter to 1.10 lakh people who lost their homes in the districts of Puducherry, Thanjavur, Pongal and Tribune.
So Minister Udayakumar said.
In the revision, the Murugan temple pond has been filled with a humidity for a few days.
There is Saravana lying pond in the area of climbing the mountains going to the Aravani Mountaineering Temple.
On this occasion, after the devotees took a sacred bath, walking through the mountains and worshipping the corner.
In addition, a three-day Deepa festival is held in the celebration of the year's adventurous festival.
In such a situation, during the adventurous function last month, the temple administration, voluntary and devotees were brought to the water through the tractor.

District Collector B. Ponnia has said that farmers can get more profits by selecting the rapid growing Telepia fish.
In his report on this, he said:
If fishing peasants in potholes choose gene-produced telepia fish, they will be able to grow faster than other fish.
In comparison to other fish, television fish can be increased in large numbers.
These are higher immune powers, which grow faster than other fish.
Moreover, this type of fish is more like the consumer.
Thus, farmers are asked to choose genetically advanced fish in their water harvests and enhance the benefits.
Telepia fish buffaloes are ready for sale throughout the year at the state fishing plant near the Third Dam.
They can be grown by the farmers.
The fishing peasants should roam around their fishhouses and create a protective shield and see the unprecedented colour in the nearby water conditions.
Fishermen in Kanjipur district have to register fishing in the Membatu camp and then develop fish in their own waters.
Moreover, the Fisheries Help Director's Office can also be recognized by the East Coast Road Nellanger in Kanjipur district or through a phone call by 04-24492719.
The underlying human bones have been set up to test DNA.
The Tamilnadu Archaeology Department, Madurai Kamaraj University and Harvard Medical School have signed a supramental agreement to conduct a TNA test for the ancient human bones being explored under Tamilnadu, under the Gonda and Adichalur bases.
The Chief Secretary of the Archaeology and Commissioner T. Udayachandran said: -
The Multiple Understanding Agreement will be signed by the Department of Archaeology, Madurai Kamaraj College and the David Reich Analysis of Harvard School.
We believe that more neighbouring human bones will be discovered in our future depths, underground and Adichnalur.
These models will be sent to the TNA study.
It is particularly clear what kind of genes were there in the human bones explored in Tamil Nadu.
The size of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and survival.
A new study shows that working with a large number of pesticides could be the cause of heart disease in the early hours.
More than three decades later, the situation was in a group of Japanese Americans in Hawaile.
Researchers found that in comparison to individuals who didn't work with pesticides, the most worried people had 45 percent of the danger of heart disease or neighbourhood.
The study stresses the significance of the use of individual security equipment and the maintenance of insecticides in medical responses and controlling simple cardiovascular dangerous factors,' the research sub-disciplinary doctor Peterius Rodrix said.
He was a senior medical officer at Hawai University in Manova.
These findings have emerged from figures received from more than 6,000 people from Ohu, who participated in the Guahini Honellu heart program.
As only men from the Japanese family participated, the observers said that these findings would not be suitable for women and others.
The insecticides are a long half-year-old, which can lead to a number of years of their lives and ill effects on health.
In the event, there were more and more effects within 10 years.
'After those people were over 34 years, there was no connection between the insecticides and neighbourhood in the work,' Rotrix said in a press release.
The other factors related to the age have been significant and there is a possibility of hiding potential contact between insecticides and heart diseases in early life.
Researchers found that there was no significant connection between the least slightest insecticides and neighbourhood.
Jelenski-Tramph phone call: Porochenko's opinion
This week, Washington was a manifest in politics following the acts of action against YS Chancellor Donald Tropy.
Lower experience in politics, Volodimir Selenski, would have wanted to avoid dragging into a political deterioration.
But now we know about lenski-tramp connections, is it a long-term impact on lenski
In the beginning of the telephone call, Trump told Celenschy that the YS is more than any other European countries, than Ukraine.
While the White House's telephone call is not a word, the German head and other European leaders are simply speaking of the sure plans - the German leader, Angela Merkel, describes the trample.
The drama is not acceptable to 100 percent, but it is considered to be a matter of replacement with Chelenzky, which claims to be 1000 percent.
Selensky added that French Chancellor McRon and Merkel did not do enough to help Ukraine.
The speech has made politicians, especially the opposition parties within Ukraine, public opinion in the social media.
Ukraine's former Chancellor, Petro Porochenko, commented on the European Union's aids 'not yet'.
Porochenko said in other dwellings was thankful to the assistance of the EU, including restrictions and economic aid, during the 'regional occupation'.
Ukraine politician Victoria Vaisiska said, 'How can we talk again to Germany and France'
The drama, which is obviously describing military aid, is not only about Joe Peden's son Hunter, but also inquire about Hague's TNC surveillance to elevate two things to Selensky, which indicates Ukraine's intervention in hacking the emails of Republicans during the 2016 election.
It doesn't know whether relations with Europe are obstacles or whether relations with French and German Chancellors will break.
I don't want to tell anyone wrong...
'We are thankful to all of us who helped us in the UN General Assembly in New York after the telephone naval lighting.'
Selenski is to meet Russia, Germany and French leaders at four meetings in Normandi in October.
A blind, quiet, suddenly smooth and grabbing the surrounding stars.
If such a blind and glowing nuclear turns into black, it is called 'Kuvasar'.
Scientists have seen the illumination of six such clusters at the Balomer telephone of the US.
It has been surprisingly surprising to the scientists that it has taken place in six months for thousands of years.
It is a matter of enhancement of many trees, which are inserting carbon dioxide in the air and releaseing oxygen.
But the 'bio-reactor' instrument, which has been created by the 'Hebrzeint Industries', involves multiple carbon-ti-oxide, one acre of trees inwards.
Increasing into the ice-bio-reactor like a cool batch, the carbon dioxide is the fascination of 'Chlorella Walcoris'.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi today spoke to the people of the country through the 'Man Ki Baath' radio program.
At the same time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his congratulations on other festivals including Navaratri and demanded that the 150th Gandhi Jayanti be specially used once to liberate the country from Plastic.
Modi speaks: smoking affects the growth of brain, harms health, so it should be avoided.
It has recently been banned because of these cigarettes that are harmful chemicals.
People are not too aware of this.
Young people must be away from these cigarettes.
E-cigarettes have made false ideas of not having any danger.
Hurricane of nicotine liquids in these cigarettes produces a kind of chemical smoke rather than ordinary cigarettes, which is harmful for health.
Kana won two ICAO awards.

This Defence Award is a recognition of the highest numbers of Africans in the air transport security preservation at the time of the enhanced enforcement rate of 89.89 percent.
This will follow the completion of the ICA on April 3, 2019, in accordance with the UN Air Traffic Organisation's Global Security Supervision Census Scheme.
On the ICAO's recommended standards and regulations at the airport and Kana airspace, this country was awarded a recognition for security.
The awards were set up in accordance with the first attempt that no ICAO was released.
Moreover, another 16 certificates and 17 certificates were given to the ICAO members who improved their focus and security conditions.
Siman Allati, general director of the Air Traffic Authority at Canada, Joseph Goffi Adda, attended Kana's ambassador to Canada, Nei Aikoi Phu and Ghana Airport Limited, management director Ya Waqwa.
In his speech, Olumuiwa Benaard Alu, head of the International Civil Aviation Agency, insisted on the need to continue the security of the member countries in the air transport sector.
'In the Puttack era, air transport care, security and stability must continue to be our main basic preferences.'
Mr. Atta said it was a great achievement for the country's efforts to finish hard work and hard work of this department for his share, awards.
He added, 'The air traffic has a lot of chances to change our lives,' he added, 'The air transport department is very much possible to improve the country's economy.
While there are social economic gains, but everything comes from attention and security, we have been able to achieve it.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a consultation meeting with the members of the Caribbean Social and Public Market (CARICOM) in the midst of a meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York yesterday.
During this meeting, Modi declared that 140 million would be granted to the Caribbean Social and Public Market Social Membrane plans for 14 million, and Solar would provide 150 million for renewable energy and climate change programs.
Prime Minister Modi also announced the establishment of the regional centers in Gaya's Georgetown and the regional training center in Philis.
Gerigam is a 20-dominated federation in Garibin, i.e. in the west islands.
They are united to create economic and political society and develop policies for the region and promote economic growth and business.
In an interview with the leaders of the West Islands, Prime Minister Modi said, 'I welcome your enthusiasm to participate in this meeting.
India is fighting against some of the major issues such as climate change and poverty.
Today's meeting collaborates with the Gericom countries to meet our needs and future expectations with mutual cooperation.
'I believe we're gonna make important recommendations from our pay today,' Prime Minister Mori said.
Caribbean islands are located in the US region.
Some of these islands are surrounded by the Caribbean Sea.
Some islands are surrounded by the Green Sea on one side and the North Atlantic Ocean on the other.
These islands are located in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the eastern part of the Middle America and the northern part of the South America.
There are about 700 islands.
These are the most neighbouring islands to the US, however, economically backward.
In these islands, many Indian dynasties live.
In such a situation, India has provided this financial assistance to the Greens.
 The FEMA leader is appointed by Tromp Peter Cainer - the White House.
In the US, on April 3, 2019, in Washington's Capital Hill, the Senate Financial Interior Security Council (FEMA), which witnesses the budget demand for FEMA's 2020 Fund, has been accompanied by the Federal Commissioner Better Cainer Bunny, who is responsible for the Central Consumer Management Agency (FEMA).
In a report, the White House reported that the US Chancellor Donald Trump had appointed Peter Cainer, head of the Central Emergency Chief (FEMA) on Thursday.
Cainer, deputy executive of the FEMA, is the head of the face, who supervises state measures for catastrophic and wild island disasters.
Since Brack Lang departed from office in March, the organisation has been unrecognised by the Senate Accountant.
Lang resigned on the decision of the Home Defence Department, which is responsible for the FIMA, that Lang used government vehicles in order to go to Washington and his home in North Carolina.
When Jeffrey Piard, another nominee for the work, was accused of being involved in a fight in Berlin during a search for his background, he retreated from the competition earlier this month.

Union Minister Financing Gadhari has said that he has not been successful in speaking to Tamilnadu and Karnataka on the issue of Kaveri.
The 34th graduation function of the University of Vietnam was held yesterday at Katbadi in Bellor district.
The Central Road Transport Minister, Financing Gadgari, participated as a special resident.
In the event, Garhri spoke: In Tutriotic, there is a plan to make electricity from the air and the sun force, and a plan for water immigration.
From the ports of Tutriotic, Cunella and Bharatif, we are reviewing the process of manufacturing electricity by air at low prices.
If this plan comes to light, one unit can produce electricity at a cost of 2.50 rupees.
The Andhra state has set up a plan of 6,000 crore rupees to prevent the dissolution of 3000 DMC water from Godavari.
But Tamilnadu and Karnataka have not been able to speak many times to implement the water harvesting schemes.
There will be no water problem between Tamilnadu and Garnadka if the Kaveri water stops mixing in the sea.
There has been no improvement in the Kaveri problem so far.
Gadgari said so.
After this, Gadkari participated in the slaughtering festivities for the rock groups launched in 13 states on Thursday evening.
When the Gadgari rolled, the Bajagavins called 'Barath Matha K.J.' as usual.
When Balir Thigha MB, who came there, demanded that the supporters of Kadir Anand be celebrated Periyar.
It was noticed that Gadkari flew from there with the restraint.
The Marijuana Waking Police shut down illegally on the San Capriyal Valley - CBS Los Angeles .
El Mande (CBSLA) - A illegal Marijuana hunting police shut down on the San Capriial Valley on Thursday.
The police obtained a weekend raid on the possibility of being sold to the illegal Marijun Web Bena, at around 4.37 in the afternoon, discovered and discovered the Bitten honey enriched sugarcane oil in large jackets at an office building in the 9600 block of Telster Avenue.
LD Christopher Keno, a policeman in El Mande, told the authorities to find out an instrument used by the web cartridges.
'This is a very dangerous process,' he said.
Geno, who served in the drunken area, said there was a possibility of smoking fire in the process of drilling oil for the use of veins.
'In a state of enrichment, the equivalent electricity that occurs in our clothes will make a firecracker in it and create an explosive threat.'
If there were many tribes and similar items, one would not explode one after the other, but the layer could completely burst into the explosion.
A Hasmad team was called to capture the illegal and hazardous substance, and to the empty office.
The value of the seizures and equipment was not immediately known.
Experts also said they had found out an illegal activity when they went to search for them through unnecessary information.
Inquiry officials are still trying to find out who is behind the illegal envelope operation.
Because the place was empty, they believed people could have set up the office there.
As the investigation continues, they wanted to ensure that no illegal envelopes are available to all, particularly after recent reports about enveloping.
'They don't know what they really want,' he said.
It can be mixed with other evil cereals.
This is very bad for our society and children, so we always warn that we should stay away from such activity.
In the first Elizabeth descending clothes are kept in the Hampton court palace .
It has been embroidered in an ecstasy bag full of plants, animals and buffaloes, with silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver silver slaughtered by the highest level.
Ellery Lenin, who is responsible for collecting clothes in the historical royal family palace, says only one.
A hundred years ago, he was tied to the wall of a small village Parish church, which he saw could be a dress away from the first Elizabeth cloth artificial.
Three years later, three years after watching the luxurious dress of altar used in a church in Beckton in Hyerfordshyer, the dressed garments of Elizabeth in the Hambdon court premises, near the same rooms wearing it 450 years ago, are to be exhibited next month.
The garments of the 16th century in the whole of the royal palace museum are the only significance of the exploration.
Though there were no sword testimonies that the cloth was worn by Elizabeth Rani at a time, the three-year research indicates that this cloth was forced to be part of the royal family cloth.
'The price of the cloth' is illegally distributed to the most amazing garments and the most eminent members of the state's family, and the high level of the embroidered plants and flowers' smuggling capacity, the higher layer of buffaloes and dogs, sweets, fishermans and a bear shows the high status of the previous privilege.
While this counsel was made, there could be a similar value for the Duter Mansion.
Moreover, in the 1950s, in the later part of the Elizabeth regime, his opponents did not accept such a smooth clothing as the other women in the state increased to compete with him.
It's a big deal, so many witnesses came and went to see it.
They were amazed at the time of seeing it, while leaving, they saw that it was always comfortable to see that it was one of the clothes of the royal family.
It cannot be considered that the second long life in the slaughterhouse was cut back to be the sepulchre of the darkest St. Faith Church in Beckton, which was unexpectedly found there.
He has been a very close village in Blanch Beri, who has served him throughout the long life of Elizabeth Rani, and has long been associated with local stories.
While the clothes were in the past of his death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth could have given it to the Periyar family or the Persian church before he died in 1603.
After more than 1000 hours of defence, more than 400 hours are to be portrayed in the very well-expensed altitude of Elizabeth's equivalent paintings, which was supposed to carry out an extraordinary shovel and fine shoe injections, which shows that he has worn a worries like this in the course of the observation by Hatfild House.
Liby Thamson, who headed the defence, said, 'When you work with accommodative clothes, there is really respect for those who created them,' said that most of its defence took place in the changed Greens in the Hampton tribunal plateau - the greatest place to put some of the unprecedented ceremonies of the Arabian.
I had great respect for those who created it when I saw an eastern and backward Embroidery.
I have never worked in such a luxurious drive.
Elizabeth's dispersed clothes are placed in the Hampton court palace on October 12.
In the NET election, a student of Udit Surya came to light the event of a honey medical college.
He was arrested with the family by the CPCI police.
Afterwards, students' size review works have been intensified in all medical colleges.
In such a situation, there was a difference between the old photographs of Jyotika and student Shiva Ramchandran in the BSG medical college and the present image.
This was followed by an inquiry into the medical college department.
In Chennai, medical college director Narayan Babu told reporters about this:
We complained on the 23rd day that the photographs of both students were a little distressed.
After this we set up a 5-member inquiry committee.
Two students and their parents were also questioned.
We compared our documents with their certificates, net-election hall tickets and identity cards.
At the conclusion of this research, it is certain that two students are not faulty.
Even though there is a slight difference in the films, such a problem arises.
So the Health Minister has ordered the first biometric process to be brought to the student next year.
The biometric and carcass records will be brought to Amal in the coming days.
Oppon is only the details of the students involved if they register a carcass at the time of application, selection and student gathering.
So no one will be furious about it.
After this, the students who were interrogated, Shiva Ramchandran and Jyotika, spoke to the reporters.
When Jyotika said, I was like a dual flame in the film I gave.
It was taken at school time.
Now I have stolen my hair.
So, it's not like that now.
They gathered me for all this.
Asked that the problem was now over when the hair was cut, there was nothing else.
According to Ramchandran, there is a difference between the size and the old film.
I had only one photo at that time.
It's old photography.
So there was confusion and the inquiry took place.
The Pondi Plastic Union has called for Prime Minister Modi to save livelihood of millions of workers.
In the news published by Shankaran and secretary V.K. Balu, he said: -
In India, plastic leaflets are collected and resettled on streets and pipelines.
Currently, all the plastic commodities blocked in some states across India can be re-circulated.
Blastic decays are already refined in India from 60 to 70 percent due to poor and unemployment deterioration.
Residual leaflets can be used in use.
Plastic Tar Road 2. Power generation 3. Petrol and Diesel can be used to use various types of plastic leaflets that make concrete rocks.
Once it is used to be used, the mainly supposed to be the Gerry bags are freely offered on the basis of the compelled civilian compelled to make the material baking in public markets.
All the water conditions seem to have been supplied by plastic gallons.
Because the carriages are densely dense, all other excavations other than plastic in the slaughtered calculations lead to waterways.
Unfortunately, only plastic floats up.
There are 40 thousand plastic manufacturing factories all over India.
Of these, 98 percent are small and small.
Thousands of shops selling plastic goods are like this.
There are 2 thousand companies exporting plastic goods.
About 50 lakh people, including both manufacturing and sales, are getting job opportunities.
Before selling 5 lakh crores, 50 thousand crores of income is being provided to the central-state states.
For plastic work, there is no environmental problem in its production or its commodities.
But undoubtedly, the environmental problem arises due to lack of proper awareness of the environmental health of the population.
So, on October 2, the Prime Minister is asking the staff to release announcements in order to protect the livelihood of a number of thousands of young and young people who are dependent on the industry, and to regularly handle plastic leaflets without blocking any plastic goods.
Thus, they said in the news.

The decision of a US military research has brought the Guantam network closer to a lesson.
Such a network provides unsuccessful security, defensive and timeless capabilities to the military in the usual network approaches.
Insprac University researchers saw a record of 50 kilometres of television bombing by using fiber optical cables in the midst of the financial and manufacture and supplies by the military research office of the surveillance camp, the centre of the specified bombing data of the Membad's Studies Study Studies Centre.
Behind is an interference between lumps like ubids.
If contacted between two cubids, one would be bored, the other would affect the decision to be blurred, even if the second cubid was at the top.
'This [50 kilometres] is far more procedural to start building networks between the two artists and cities of the city than possible,' his findings are the leading analysts at the Insurgents and the leading analysts at the Insurgent Globe, whose findings are published in the Nature General Guanton Infirmation.
In the middle of the cities, the bombing networks will be made up of the distances of the physician cubies, which are very far away, unconscious.
Researchers said there was no need for distributing this back to establish the bombing network.
'This is a major step leading to the possibility of a largely distributed background,' Sarah Cample, co-chairman of the monetary program, who supported the research.
After traveling through the fiber, the background level on the reverse is also higher than the necessity to meet the requirements of some of the most difficult cluster web sites.
In one of the iron furnaces, the research team started examining the calcium supplied.
While using laser cerebrums, researchers provoked a bombing position on iron, they provoked a fountain collected by the bombing data.
As a result, the cluttering positions of the nuclear and lumps were retreated.
It is a challenge to send Photon through fiber audit cables.
'Forton's wave of iron mixed with calcium is 854 nanometers, which is quickly snatched by the abdic fiber,' Lanyan said.
Her garrisons, therefore, first sent the light pieces to the unprecedented study published by a strong laser.
The Buddhist waver was transformed into a long distance journey - the current climate for the telecommunication - 1550 nanometers.
After that the researchers sent this photo to a 50-kilometer long fiber aptic cable.
Even after the transformation of the channel and the far-reaching journey, the nuclear and lucrative troops were still in the backstage.
These decisions provide a straight way to possibly possibly possibly possibly possibly possibly possess the lengthy network of long-term nuclear weapons.
The monetary researcher, Dr. Freightrick Fademi, also the deputy supervisor of the program, said that the majorly retreated storage networks would be very necessary for the military to use precise conditions, guidance and time.'
