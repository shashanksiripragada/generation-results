Its language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it ' s different .
On one side of Kutch , Sindh and Gujarat on the other side , therefore , both are mixed in language .
It is called ' kachchi ' .
Well it is  bid , it does not have its own script .
If you want to write a cotton , you have to write in the Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj only is the Anjar city where earthquakes have occurred many times and the entire city has collapsed .
The tomb of Jaisal - Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jessel Toral is very interesting .
If we return from that path from which we had come then we will have to take a whole month 's holiday and the school will open in Bombay .
So what to do  Now the fast buses of Gujarat will travel in the railway by saying to-ta .
The small train of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there a meter gauge and a small train will reach Ahmedabad and a big train from Ahmedabad will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry , considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan , is going through bad times these days .
Due to the global recession and increasing terrorist threats in South Asia the tourism business has reached deep distance .
With the point of view of tourism a lot of reduction has been recorded in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the major states of the country .
The latest data released by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the year 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent compared to the year 2008 .
According to the figures the number of national tourists is 9 . percent and the number of foreign tourists has decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008, a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came in Rajasthan, including two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 native and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists, while during 2009, a total of two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan.
These included two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 native and one lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists .
People associated with the tourism sector are very concerned about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana Holiday Mercury says that global recession and terrorist incidents have badly affected the tourism business .
We have not been able to develop a strong infrastructure of tourism here compared to other countries of Asia .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also declined by 3.29 percent in comparison to last year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists from Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism recent years have passed for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has decreased .
There was nothing new from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , havelis , forts , bawdia , forest everything is the same old one for tourists to reside .
In the tourism sector all governments talk of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time incidents of rape and molestation in Rajasthan along with foreign women tourists have also stained the image of this state at the international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in the state but it has remained confined to papers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited ( RTDC ) is an example of the success of the Rajasthan Government towards tourism .
The Government of Rajasthan formed RTDC in 1979 with the aim of promoting tourism and developing the infrastructure of tourism .
This corporation provides facilities of housing , food , transport , boating etc . to the tourists .
The Corporation has a total of 75 units .
In which 39 hotels , 22 models , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one traffic unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation remains thin for many years .
RTDC deficit was 185 lakhs in 2008 - 09 , estimated to be 632 lakhs in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years forty percent rooms of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with hotels other units of corporation are also making it a big loss .
Among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not get attraction towards this railway .
Despite reducing fare it could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years the interest of tourists towards Pushkar fair has also been seen less .
In this fair in 2007 - 08 where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC , this year this number decreased to 217 .
Among all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC has been that there is no dearth of the attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . royal trains .
This rail is constantly benefiting .
Last year RTDC received a profit of Rs 9 . 5 crore from this railway .
Due to this decline in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the worries of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If man wants to do something in his heart , he can create gold from soil .
Subrata Roy has made it clear by setting up a modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain range of Sahyadri of Maharashtra .
Seeing the dream he had seen , he glimpses in his eyes .
His happiness was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambay Valley .
Ambay Valley ' s work started and today Ambay Valley has managed to make its place as a better city .
In this city spread over more than 10 thousand acres only 9 per cent of the land hotels , houses and other facilities have been set up .
Trees , ponds , lakes , flowers and other facilities have been provided at 91 per cent of the land .
Many industrialists came forward to build their houses in this city , built for only millionaires and today around 800 families live in this city .
Initially industrialists and raisins bought their assignment here as holiday home but now they have made it their first home and Mumbai vows to work from here .
Behind Ambe Valley is Koyarigarh fort which gives beauty to this area .

At this place a Dussehra statue of Devi Durga has been found .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet stories and old stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still singing the glorious story of Arunachal .
The temple of Tameshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories a description of the glory of Tameshwari Devi is found .
During the time of Chetia kings in the north - eastern hills this deity was recognized far and wide .
The people of the tribe here used to worship Goddess .
The sacrifice of humans was also done here which was later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins are found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which are located in the middle of the Debang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the famous legends here this place is an old Vidarbha where once the king used to rule Bhishmak .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of the Lohit district .
The Digaru , Mishmi etc tribes here guide the travellers .
They themselves have great faith in this kunda .
Near Brahmkund itself is famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned pillars in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal , the pillars of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The remains of the ponds of bricks near Roing are still telling their story .
The ghats of bathing , standing stairs and the surroundings of another pond are surrounded by strong fort and the remains of the wide roads are still singing the silence of its ancient grand story even today .
From North Lakhimpur city of Upper Assam we reach ero for four hours through jeep .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place charms the hearts of the visitors .
This is the same charming place where the emeralds live .
Before the formation of the path of jeep it used to take many days to reach here .
On reaching here the scenes of high deodar tree , beautiful Preemroz , Wollet , wild curtain , strawberries and rasbari hypnotise the visitors .
Apple and potatoes are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometers .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the emergent people .
Emergency people have made it their heaven with their tireless hard work .
Here rice farming is very good .
This place is " rice reserve " .
Ten miles long , this plateau is an awakening example of the skill of their hard work and cultivation .
The necessity of irrigation is fulfilled by the Kali river .
The trees of pan put four moons in the beauty of this valley .
The eyes fall on the light redness emerging in the sky on the horizon between the ice-covered mountain range of the left hand .
It is very cold in the air .
In the environment along with kissing cold one also feels softness .
With the voice of garbage below the feet the layer of the wood spread on the floor of the wood is visible .
The atmosphere is humid and there is no more visible because of the shadow of the mist before sunrise .
Eyes stay on the redness of the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench lying in the balcony .
On touching hands the smooth layer of the pale rotates with the sound of a light kirch and the hand separates from the jerk with the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , settled amidst these hills covered with snow of Switzerland this is the first experience in the life of spending night in this small village .
This is my third trip to Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent geneba or around it .
The dense population settled in the valley on both sides of the thin Balkakti river is spread over a very high level on the light slopes .
This is the valley of Rone the main river of Switzerland on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The parallel highway of the Ron river and the rang carts on it have started to clear .
The journey of 300 kms from the car and half an hour from the car along with the parallel to the Geneva lake and half the Ron river coming from the east along with the Geneva lake named Montreu which is found in French .
Geneva city is situated at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake again goes towards the west after becoming a river .
There are mountain ranges of rice , alps on the right side of the lake .
By crossing a beautiful small town named Leuke -LRB- euk -RRB- we come on the hilly path towards the north except this highway from the exit of the left side .
Due to the slope of the mountain being south - facing , the sun of Aparahan is giving sunshine to all the panches .
The quantity of snow here is less than the valley - almost non equal .
As the height progresses , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite being accumulated with good ice on both the sides of the road due to clear sky and shining sun there is no special cold in the air .
By deciding about 20 kms journey on this moving hilly road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal -LRB- Thal -RRB- .
Style -LRB- halt -RRB- - There are large multi-storeyed bungalows made of slope roof , completely wood .
In the basement made up of the three - storeyed cement concrete , there are rooms to control the necessary services like electricity , water , loader along with parking of trains .
Walai is famous for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of grape liquor .
37  of the entire canton is cultivated by grapes .
In the villages settled on both the sides of the Rohn Valley the gardens of grapes give a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Taking to the bottom of grapes , roaming around them , taking rest at night in the villages there and taking into the utensils of grape liquor sports is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named Aigle there is a very big museum of grape liquor made in 12th century , to see which foreign tourists have to book arithmetic booking .
Once again , we pass through the same jungle .
Till three - four k . . on the way the mind becomes even more upset with the cheerful questions of the children .
Suddenly , dramatical and charming changes occur from scenes at a turn .
Just in front , on the slope above the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is seated .
On the flat slope above the village people are skiing in snow .
The dense forest of Goddess is spread up to the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the city are shining due to the direct sun rays .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also the same silence is spread .
From the top of the mountain to the valley , the kingdom of dust ice .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round around between that town .
The name of the town is Luckerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Lukarbad is approximately 1500 .
The number of tourists coming here can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments and styles with the capacity of 6900 beds , 28 hotels , camping sites of tents , 90 beds and 50 restaurants to stay here .
So far 65 gold of hot water has been found in Lukarbad .

On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
In the scorching sun the thick layer of snow is shining above the roof of the houses .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albanin village is one of the ' conserved places ' as the heritage of ' national importance ' in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to Sikkim taxis therefore there is no checking .
The journey is going on , the state is second , but the hill is the same , the trees are the same , the air is the same .
It is the moisture that sneaks all over the body .
In the rainy season , the sunlight is the same .
As soon as the plan for Darjeeling journey was confirmed , the first sight of Karsiang was spread .
Cursing is a small town of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sunshine forests .
Famous for excellent tea production .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then initially tea gardens welcome those who move towards themselves spreading smiles .
Going through the road in the middle of tea gardens hypnotises the heart in the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with forests , on the other side deep greenery .
Sometimes there were forests and sometimes tea gardens .
There was a kingdom of greenery all around .
Once I was stirred , see these natural forests or the tea plants planted by man .
Both of them were drawing towards themselves .
The beauty of the jungle was as beautiful as the tea garden .
If seen on the roads of the road then the creation looks marvellous .
The snake ' s swimming and swimming path was passing .
The time was also going on .
The forests and tea gardens were not past .
Sometimes small settlements are visible .
From a distance itself a mountain house , house etc . showed a lot of density .
It was Karsiyag .
Staying in one place here we made a program of roaming all day .
Therefore taking a car we got out on the journey of Karsyang .
First of all diar park .
A small garden surrounded by large forests .
There was climbing i . . to reach the deer park the car had to leave very below .
Despite the beauty of Karsiang , it has not yet been developed as a tourist spot .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite the absence of the road the pleasure of reaching the Deer Park surrounded by forests and climbing the path between the trees of sunglass was giving us courage .
The next place was the Eagle Craig .
This is a pavilion situated on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that in the times of the British lovers used to give life by jumping from here .
At present , it is equipped with a park and restaurant .
There is a stairs like dome here , on observing the entire city from the height of which a beautiful scene is seen .
In the tea garden around , women were busy breaking the tea leaves running on their backs .
There is a museum outside the city of Karsiang , but on that day we could not go there because it was more necessary to tour the untimely environment of tea gardens .
The next day Darjeeling was decided to roam .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was a great concern that how would we roam if it was raining .
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching Rock Garden we roamed enjoying the sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming .
On growing a little more below from here the Gangamaya surrounded by hills was found .
Here the shadow of the waterfalls between the rocks is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we found that the waterfalls in the empire of stones and rocks are charming here then the magnificent world of streams in Ganga Maya are decorated with stones .
Both of these places are sitting very below the hills of Darjeeling .
On rising up with the help of the car we saw the Tesia Loop in Darjeeling .
From here the entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of telescope .
The mood of the weather was so far quiet .
But as soon as we moved towards the Monastery , where did we come from , and began to glitter .
In the evening there was a plan to walk on the mallrode and shopping .
In Darjeeling journey the twin trains put four moons in the journey .
Travelling from Darjeeling to Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Here boating in Mirik lake and a little rest in the garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route where hand made sweaters of Nepalese artisans etc . are found .
There is also an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong , however , is a city of Darjeeling district , but its form is different .
Here not only the greenery of tea gardens but also the movement of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist places in Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegaon , which are full of forests and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to Darjeeling in the shade of cold , but the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here tied me with us .
My recent visit was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither foreign nor outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes travels towards itself , sometimes some special place , water ship , some royal train or a rose city like a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come to the forefront .
The place where I am going to talk is ready just about four and a half years ago , but the preparation with which this place has come there has actually turned into the jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who live there .
In my ears , my guide Ram Babu smells the words of Meena :  We could not even think that we could live in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff belong to this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not even get work in the heritage hotel .
Ram Babu , a resident of Ajabgarh , used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in this unique royal style in Amman Bagh .
He has dragged his speaking into a new color .
Sahiba ' is the estimation of Aman Bagh .
Nobody calls you there with English instruction .
Aman Bagh is actually a peaceful and comfortable tourist place .
There is also its history of that garden and the biggest thing is that it also introduces you to the surrounding areas .
How many of the people who spent holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have traveled to Bhangarh of the past  Why should I go far , even some of the people of Jaipur may have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night when Shabana Azmi called me from there , but I could not go .
It is a different matter that they themselves had gone straying and reached Bhangadh .
This time suddenly on the feast of my foreign guests I reached there , then it seemed as if those who want to spend a grand holiday in less time should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden left out of those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to stop hunting .
It was built in nineteen hundred twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of the Aman Bagh in the shadow of mountains and dense trees enhances you .
As soon as you come in the way you are welcomed , it seems as if attention has been given to divine peace here .
The mantra of Mangalachara is surpassed alive as well as the Mauli is built in Kalai .
We reached the slope in the evening , and we intended to set up a round about the garden .
My host Jackie , who was a carving , suddenly said , ' This is interesting .
All are inspired by palaces and palaces .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new , artistic , no wonder that Aman Bagh has received a recent award .
The manager fixed our programme for the morning .
First of all walking with Ram Babu and then jeep journey of Bhangarh .
We saw the fort of Ajbgarh on a narrow road on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
The dry lake was seen in which farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rain , but for the first time the tobacco cultivation was seen .
For J . K . , such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh from jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
These are millions of dollars invaluable moments .
The way to say goodbye to the Aman Bagh was also traditional , he departed from us by feeding jaggery and curd .
Now it was understood why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept to show tribe life .
Is it true
Of course , this is not one in many states and tourists also show a lot of interest in it .
These tours are usually prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying there , eating etc .
In this way attempts are made to explore such places where too much development has not happened and there has not been a special effect on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this there are also old tourist sites etc .
Besides , it is also paid attention to the surveillance of the trident cooking .
In fact , the purpose of such a tour is to make the tourists aware of the ways and traditions of living in that place .
Although it looks a little difficult to think , but such tourists are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Just the tour has its own joy .
Despite being with a lot of people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your feverit book a lot of time without distributing .
Yes , it is of course that along with giving less expensive and comfortable time these tourists definitely keep the demand of patience with you .
This is the reason why it is important to take care of some things to enjoy them , especially when you are watching some foreign destination through bus tour .
Search the best deal before taking tickets .
Students , senior people of Military , children etc get discount on them , then for two people also there is an arrangement of discount .
However , it is cheap to buy tickets in advance , therefore in the last moments it is better to do planning a little ahead .
Let them know about the round trip instead of the ticket .
They are cheap .
Rules are very strict about bags , therefore inquire about the size and weight of the goods .
It is not that you have to leave some of your goods on terminal or you have to pay extra fees .
Also , know the rules of compensation or loss of insurance from the tour company .
Carry on bags are right , take it .
Because they get fit in the rack over the seat .
Also keep in mind that you will have the responsibility of the goods while changing just during the tour .
From where you just have to take , reach there one hour before time .
During the bizarre season you should take special care of this .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the better seat option will be with you .
Keep in mind the confrontation while selecting the seat .
If there is a lot of shock in the last seat , then reading in the next seats is not conferable .
If you have to go to Lu again and again then take a corner seat and if you do not like to be more destructive then the window seat will be better for you .
Now it ' s a clever thing .
If you are both in the palm of the palm then sit on the corner seat and put your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus then planning will be successful .
If there is a facility of washroom in the bus then keep in mind this also while kissing the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make identity from the driver and conductor just .
This way you will get enough information from them .
Everyone is asked to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not leave your luggage in the seat because the buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever you stay , return back on time .
If you do not come on time , you can find a new passenger in your place and you have to wait for another bus on the terminal .

C cruise proves beneficial here .
In the first week of December Lui cruise from Kochi started India ' s only cruise for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very famous in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems Louis Cruise has now postponed its services , but they are expected to start again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a three-day cruise at the rate of at least 5850 rupees per person at the ship of Louis Cruise on MV aquarium .
That is , for three days the fare of one person less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are old , children below 15 years of age are totally free .
And what else is needed .
The fare of cruise includes tea - breakfast , food all .
The entertainment of every time together .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming around in big airplanes suddenly if a plane stands in front of you then you will feel like a toy .
But with 12 - 15 seats this is unquestionably excellent for touring Ooty Plain Maldives like Archipelago -LRB- Island group -RRB- .
When it rises in the air while running like a speed boat on the surface of the water , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not feel the flight of ordinary airplanes .
Every time your eyes remain strong below the window - watching the resort islands and coral islands in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
Everything looks so clear .
There are two only plane companies in Maldives .
Trace Maldives is one of these which has twenty C planes .
If you want you can roam around around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- for an hour or you can take the entire sea plane for your entire day -LRB- provided pocket is deep -RRB- .
If you go to any island beyond the Male Island then the journey of the sea plane will be necessary because this is the way of journey between different islands .
And that ' s a journey that might never mind ending .
C plane travels from 12 kilometers to 183 kilometers -LRB- in the best -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and golden shop of the capital in the Ahmadi market of Male .
All salesmen were listening to the speech given in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before by the President Mohammad Nasheed of Maldives .
In honesty , I did not see any Hindustani listening to the speeches of the nationalists or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of a magnificent creation of this earth , it was so serious .
Many people may have considered the meeting of the Maldives cabinet in October as a basket , but it seems that if the nature ' s cop snatched it from us , then the world would be very impressive .
Something like this is special in the beauty there .
In that small country , it is not so beautiful .
Returning to Jetty to go back from that journey of the market , when the eyes went in the water of the sea along with the road , then it was realized how much the people here understand the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that in the light of the lamppost the fish floating in the depths of several metres were visible with all its colors .
This was the part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can see a few centimeters in the sea or river water adjacent to a city of India , you will find yourself happy .
While returning to MV Equamirin , he was roaming around two hours in the evening spent in the lap .
Koral Rif -LRB- Muga rocks -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will get muga stones on stones on the tombs .
Shortly before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not believed that we were ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country , there was no security personnel far and wide .
Enjoying we were taking photographs of gardens and verandah just fifty metres away by increasing hands from the gate of his bungalow .
Can you think of the leader ' s house in India
It was also known that the nationalists sometimes reached two blocks ahead of their office while crossing the roads on foot .
Everything was about Maldives .
That is why I was awaiting the next day .
The day was going to be special .
A boat from the morning cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the base of the Trace Maldives while cutting the rope of the runway .
Last evening when Cruise was approaching Male , we immediately recognized the C plane passing from above .
The photographs that were seen .
But then it was not convinced that the next day it would get a chance to ride .
We were about to go to Rangali island a hundred and five km away from the C plane of Tros Maldives .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread over the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying up to a height of about thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a breathing flight with excitement and enthusiasm .
But on reaching Konarad resort of Hillton Hotels on Rangali Island it seems as if we have reached another world .
In a world which was nowhere outside the world .
Wasta was not even such that it was difficult to get out like beauty or joy .
Tour on Konarad can also be done on foot or by battery driven car .
While going from Jetty to the main island the view of life on both the sides of the bridge was marvellous .
Now we could not even facilitate ourselves from the nature around , that reached such a place , was unimaginable .
While descending in the water of the sea several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
The room was actually a dining room .
On every side we could see a unique kind of small fish , corals , snowcling and scuba diving .
The imagination of sitting on decorated tables there was very thrilling in itself .
The fare of seeing and lunch underwater coming to this island from Male to C plane is only 47 thousand rupees for a man .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to bury our passports in water .
But he knew it was not possible .
He returned with great hope that sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , the fate will come here .
He was planning to go out of Delhi for many days , but it was not possible for him to work .
Since childhood there was a hobby of life then thought why not go to gym carbot this time .
In 2006 after bikeping from Khardungla pass to Pegong Lake in Ladakh this was the second bike tour .
In the early hours of December 27 , we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the fog that came out of the jealousy roamed our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
The fog and the bad road in front .
Many times he felt that he fell now .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near Park , which we had already booked .
There was no special program on that day , even though we were cold we went to the coast of Kosi earlier .
After spending two - three hours there we got out of the Corbett Museum , which was very difficult near Dhangri Gate 2 kms away .
From there we went down to Ramnagar .
Returned late in the evening .
It was clear from Delhi that if you see the lion roaming free in the jungle then I kept watching the lion in the dream of the whole night .
I suddenly heard a tremendous thunderstorm between the darkness of the night , and after that the dogs who began to bear did not stop for two hours .
So it was suggested that Kaladhungi and Carbet fall roam first .
Kaladhungi is thirty kilometres away while carbot falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kaladhungi where some important things related to his personal life are kept .
Returning , we got twelve and a half hours .
Kaladhungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett settled in this garden .
On reaching the resort Safari Gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they have arranged for siteing in the number one site Bijrani there .
On asking number one it was told that there is more grassland and Tigers come to the same side to avoid cold during this time .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half hundred rupees to roam around for four hours .
We left for the jungle .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusks of elephants , whose long teeth were .
I made a lot of photography .
Meanwhile the guide started tracking the tiger .
The guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , some of which have died recently .
In many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was sorry to not see Tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind , Tiger ' s Fittoor was a rider .
Then I remembered the old friend of Haldwani .
I put him in such a phone .
I told him I had come to the carbot .
He asked if he saw the tiger or not .
His words were kissed like arrow .
I said , No .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us to take a ride inside .
