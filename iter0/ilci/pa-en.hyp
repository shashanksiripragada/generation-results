Its language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch is sindha and on the other side Gujarat therefore in language also there is a mixture of both .
It is called ' kachhi ' .
Although it is ' bold ' , its own script is not .
If you have to write a book then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj only is that Anjar city where many times earthquakes have come and all the city has been destroyed .
There is a tomb of Jasal - Toral near Anjar .
The story of Jessel Toral is very interesting .
If we return from that path from which we had come then we will have to take a holiday of more than one month and there we will open schools in Mumbai .
Then what should you do  Now you will travel in the train by telling the fast buses of Gujarat .
The small train of metroge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there a small train will reach Ahmedabad towards metre gauge and a big train from Ahmedabad to Broadge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main source of economy of Rajasthan is passing through bad times these days .
The tourism business has reached deep shocks due to increasing risk in business slowdown and South Asia .
From the point of view of tourism a lot of reduction has been recorded in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the major states of the country .
The recent figures of Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to the figures the number of national tourists has decreased by 9 . percent and the number of foreign tourists is 27 . 36 percent .
A total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came in Rajasthan in 2008 out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 Asian and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during the year 2009 a total of two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Out of these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 nations and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism sector are very concerned about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana Glade Mexican says that vivid slowdown and terrorist incidents have badly affected the business of tourism .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop a strong infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to the previous year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the help of tourism the recent years are the best passes for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2008 that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has decreased .
There is nothing new from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , havelis , forts , ponds , forests everything is the same oldest for tourists to stay .
In the tourism area all governments talk of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
The same foreign palaces along with tourists in Rajasthan in recent years incidents of blatant and horseback have also made the sixth of this state crying at the international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given the status of exciting tourism in the state but it has remained confined to only papers .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the functioning of Rajasthan government towards tourism .
With the aim of inviting tourism in Rajasthan and developing the infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed an artificial in 1979 AD .
This corporation provides facilities of housing , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are total 75 units of this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motals , eight cafeteria , three tourists , one transport unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation remains thin for many years .
The deficiency of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in the year 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years forty percent rooms of its hotels can not be filled .
Along with the hotels other units of the corporation are also making it a big loss .
Among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not become attractive towards this rail .
Despite lessening the fare they could not attract the tourists .
Similarly in recent years the interest of tourists towards the Pushkar fair has also been seen less .
In this fair in 2007 - 08 where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village made by ArtiDC , this number was reduced to 217 .
Among all this the thrilling thing for the artificiality is that there is no dearth of the attraction of tourists towards the palace on wheels i . . royal train .
This rail is continuously benefiting .
Last year with this rail the RTDC got a profit of nine and a half crore rupees .
Due to this declining fall in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the laggards of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the heart of man then he can produce gold from the soil .
Subarta Roy settled the modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain ranges of Sahadir of Maharashtra and proved it true .

From North Lakhimpur city of Upper Assam we reach zero for four hours through jeep .
This place is the main center of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotises the hearts of the visitors .
This is the same charming place where there are afflictions .
It takes several days to reach here before the road of the jeep becomes .
On reaching here the scenes of high deodar trees , beautiful premiroz , vollets , wild curtains , strawberries and race barriers hypnotise the visitors .
Apple and potatoes are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kms .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the afflicted people .
Due to its unforgettable hard work they have made it their heaven .
Here rice is a lot of agriculture .
This place is ' rice store ' .
Ten miles long this plateau is a living example of its ability to work and harvest .
The need for its irrigation is fulfilled from the Kali river .
The trees of Pine enhance the beauty of this valley four times .
Look at the light redness emerging in the sky on white in the middle of the rocks laden with the snow of the left hand .
Excellent cough is cold in wind .
There is also feeling of moisture along with cold suffocated in the environment .
With the sound of garbage below the legs one gets to see on the layer of cracks spread on the wooden floor .
There is negativeness in the environment and because of the blurredness before sunrise being shadow much is not visible .
The eyes remain on the redness of the east .
There is a feeling of sitting on the bench lying in the balcony .
On touching the hand the smooth layer of the palate rotates with the sound of the rash and the hand gets separated from falling from the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , settled amidst these hills covered with snow of Switzerland this is the first experience of spending night in this small village .
This is my third trip in Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent geneba or around it .
On both the sides of the thin Balkhandi river the dense population settled in the valley is spread to a great extent on the light slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland Ron valley on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
On the other side of the Rohn river the road and the vehicles shouting on it have started giving clear .
The journey of 300 kms and half an hour from the car , along with the parallel to the Jeneva lake and half the Rohn river coming from the eastern direction along with Montro Lake which is found in French -LRB- Lack Lames -RRB- .
Geneva city is situated at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake again goes towards the west after becoming a river .
On the right side there are mountain ranges of Dhaval , Gaganchubi alps on the side of the lake .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Leuk we come to the hilly path on the north leaving this highway from the left side .
Due to the slope of the mountain being south - east the sun of the mountain has been giving full sunshine to all the birds .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here .
As the height progresses , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite good cough ice gathering on both the sides of the road due to clear sky and shining sun there is no special cold in the air .
After completing a journey of about 20 kms on this circular hilly road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thail .
There are large multi-storeyed bungalows made of wood , covered roofs .
In the basement made from the cement concrete of this three storey bungalow there are rooms to control the necessary services like electricity , water , lodge etc . along with the parking of trains .
Walking in Switzerland is famous for the yield of grapes .
This wine is the main center of making wine of grapes .
37  of the entire cantonment field of grapes is produced on the ground .
In villages settled on both the sides of the Rohn Valley gardens of grapes give a unique joy to its beauty .
To take grape gardens , to roam around them , to rest at night in the villages there and to chew alcohol by taking them into the works of grape liquor is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named Aga there is a huge museum of grape liquor in a cart made in 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to book agricultural booking .
Once we again pass through the same jungle which was stretched out of Dawanal .
Till three - four k . . on the way the mind becomes even more upset with the cheerful questions of the children .
The dramatic and charming change comes from the scene at a turn .
Just in front , on the slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in snow on slopes from above the village .
On the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope a dense jungle of  Mak deodar ' is spread .
Deep snow is lying all around .
The roofs of the houses of the colony are sparkling because of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also the same silence is visible .
All around from the peak of the mountain to the valley the empire of hot snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big circle through that town .
The name of the town is Lukarbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Lukarbad is around 1500 .
The number of tourists coming here can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments with the capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants to stay for 1500 .

On reaching the village one feels a lot of hotness .
The thick layer of snow is sparkling on the roof of the houses in the open sun .
Albanin is the name of this village .
Albanin village is one of the safe places found in Switzerland as a heritage of national importance .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only be taxis of Sikkim therefore there is no checking .
The journey is going on , the state is second , but the mountain is the same , trees and plants are there , the air is the same .
The hot moisture on the whole body is the same .
There is a beautiful light in the rainy season .
The plan of Darjeeling journey is clear , first of all the decision of Darjeeling is taken .
Karsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Filled with tea gardens , complete with the jungles of sunshine .
Famous for the production of excellent tea .
If you move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then initially tea gardens welcome those who move towards themselves while spreading fun .
Leaning from a road in the middle of tea gardens hypnotises the heart in the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with forests , on the other hand Hagri is eaten .
Here sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens were visible .
There was a kingdom of greenery all around .
Once I got disturbed , see these natural forests or plants of tea planted by humans .
Both were drawing towards itself .
The beautiful jungles were as beautiful as the tea gardens spread far .
If seen on the road of the road then it appears very marvellous .
Like the walking of the snake , the narrow path was passing .
Time was also passing .
If we were not passing , then jungle and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are visible .
From a distance itself a hilly house was seen very densely .
This was Karsiyang .
Staying in one place here we made the work of roaming all day .
That is why taking a car we got out on a tour of Karsiyang .
First of all die park .
A small garden surrounded by large forests all around .
There was climbing up i . . to reach the deer park the vehicle had to be left very below .
Despite being amazed with the beauty of Karsiyang has not been able to develop in the form of a tourist spot .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite the absence of the road the feeling of reaching the deer park surrounded by forests and the joy of trekking amidst the smoke trees was giving us adventurous .
The next place was eagle crawling .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the times of the British lovers used to give life by snatching here .
Now , this is equipped with a park and restaurant .
There is a staircase here on the observation of the whole of the city at a height of which a beautiful scene is seen .
In the tea gardens nearby women were busy breaking the tea leaves running hands with a very loud speed on the back .
Carsiang is a museum outside the city , but that day we could not go there because it was more important to tour the unmatched environment of tea gardens .
The next day Darjeeling was fixed to roam .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but there was great concern with it that if such rains were happening then how would we roam .
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we roamed enjoying the sunshine .
This garden is a beautiful place enchanting with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
On growing a little more below from here the Gangamaya surrounded by mountains was found .
Here the magnificence of waterfalls amidst rocks is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we found that in the empire of rocks there are charming waterfalls in the empire of rocks then the magnificence of waterfalls in Ganga Maya is displayed with stones worldwide .
Both of these places are exhibited very below the hills of Darjeeling .
On waking up with the help of the car we saw a loop in Darjeeling .
From here the entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of telescope .
The mood of the weather was still clean .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , let us know where it was present and started shouting .
In the evening plan was made to roam around Malrod and shopping .
In the tour of Darjeeling two trains put four moons in the journey .
The journey of the tower from Darjeeling to Dhoom and Dhoom to Darjeeling is special attraction for the tourists .
Here boating in Mirik lake and short breaking in the garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where hand made sweaters of Nepalese artisans etc . are found .
There is also an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is such a city of Darjeeling district , but its form is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here but the transport of forests and waterfalls .
Among Kalimpong is the most popular tourist spot - Lolegaon , which is full of forests and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not imagine this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to Darjeeling , but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here tied me with us .
My recent little journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was not from abroad but from outside Rajasthan but from Jaipur very close .
Tourism is an interesting thing in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , then sometimes there is a special place , a ship of water or some royal train or a city like a rose city or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of this only one special attraction people go on pulling .
The place where I am going to talk is just prepared about four and a half years ago , but the preparation with which this place has come there has actually made it merge in the jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those living there .
In my ears the words of my guide Ram Babu Meena resonate , we could not even think before that we could stay in the jungle .
50 percent staff belongs to this area .
Suddenly I felt such local people could not even get work in the heritage hotel .
Azamgarh resident Ram Babu used to work in Jaipur before this and now in this unique royal style Amn garden .
He has shook his words in a new color .
Saheba ' is the estimate of an ammon garden .
Nobody here calls you with English words .
Aman garden is actually a tourist spot with ammon chain and all pleasant facilities .
That garden has its own history as well and the biggest thing is that it also makes you aware of the surrounding areas .
In the royal style of Rajasthan how many people would have toured Bhangarh of the past , why would you go away , even among the people of Jaipur , Kuchek probably spent the night in that area .
After the opening of the Amn garden big people of the country and abroad reach there .
I remember that night as well when Shabana Azmi had called me there suddenly but I could not go .
This thing is different that he had reached Bhangarh by wandering his way .
This time suddenly when I reached there on the advice of my foreign guest , then it felt that those people who want to spend a grand holiday in less time should definitely go to Amnag .
This garden is the only garden left out of those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to fight for hunting .
Its construction was done in the same , 100 .
Its old wall is the guard of those days .
The first glimpse of the ammon garden in the shadow of mountains and dense trees enjoys you .
As soon as you come in the way you are welcomed , it feels that attention has been given to divine peace here .
Along with Mauli dam in Kalai the mantra of Mangalacharan is done alive .
We had descended in the evening we intended to put a cycle of that garden .
Like my messenger who is doing right , Sahasa said , This is interesting .
All the havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
There is no artistic surprise on everything that the Amn garden has recently got architect .
Manager completed our program for the morning .
First of all walking with Ram Babu and then jeep journey of Bhangarh .
We saw the fort of Ajbagarh while walking on a street on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
Watched the dry lake in which how many agricultural was doing .
This year it was not rainy but for the first time we saw tobacco farming .
If for this then such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh from Jeep .
In the morning I had seen a traveller of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable moment of million dollars .
The way of telling a sacrifice of amalgamation was also traditional , by feeding jaggery and curd they promised us .
Now it was understood why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept to show tribul life .
Is it right
Of course this is not one other in many states and tourists also show sufficient interest in them .
This tour is usually prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this staying there , eating etc are also included .
This way an attempt is made to expose such places where there is not much development and there is no special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Along with this where old tourist sites etc are also present .
Besides this , attention is also paid to the survey of triditional cuisine .
Actually , the aim of such a tour has to be done by the ways and traditions of staying in that place .
Although it seems a little difficult to think , but such tours actually are interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Just the tour has its own joy .
With this despite being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can take a lot of time without distracting your future book .
Yes , it is so important that along with giving less expensive and comfortable time these tours definitely keep the demand of dreams from you .
This is the reason why it is important to take care of some things to enjoy them , especially when you are watching any foreign destination through bus tour .
Find best deal before taking tickets .
Students , senior people of Military , children etc get discount on them , whereas for two people also there is an arrangement of shoe .
However , it is cheap to buy tickets in advance , therefore in the last moment it is better to make a bus tour in the last moment that you plan a little ahead .
Instead of twelve tickets , know about the round trip .
It is cheap .
Regulations about bags are extremely hard , hence ask about the size and weight of the goods .
There should not be any such thing that you have to leave some of your goods on the terminal or you have to pay extra percentage .
Also know the rules of insurance or compensation of loss from the tour company .
Cari on bags are right , let us go .
Because they get stuck in the rack above the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus during tour you will have the responsibility of the goods .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the Big season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the best seat operation will be with you .
Keep in mind the computer while choosing the seat .
If you feel more lying on the back seat , then reading on the next seat is not impressive .
If you have to go to Lu again and again , then take a corner seat and if you do not like to get a lot of distress then the seat with the window will be better for you .
Now talk of a smile .
If you are in the fracture of both the arms then sit on the corner seat first and put your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus , then planing will remain .
If there is facility of vasroom in the bus , then keep in mind this thing as well as while chewing the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make identity with bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get enough information from them .
Everyone is asked to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat because on its disappearance the buses do not take its responsibility .
Wherever you stay , return back on time .
If you do not come on time then you can find a new tourist in your place and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .
It is said that if we did not see Rome in Europe then we did not see anything .

The idols built here are marvellous and so impossible that it seems as if it will now be spoken .

The main attractions of Rome are its fountains .
Here approximately the buildings are such in which magnificent fountains are made .
The most famous fountain here is ' Tarevi Fountain ' .

It is believed that by doing this this fault is definitely fulfilled .

Located in Panchim the capital of Goa , Ginger Hotel makes the journey of western coast excellent .
On the roads of Goa while enjoying cycling , river cruise , cold sea winds and world famous Goan dishes , Ginger Hotel located here is an excellent option .
If you see in today 's list then for Maldives the cheapest per person return fee is 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stay in Malay then even then hotels can be found in a little less fare but if you go to some nearby island to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will become small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial here only .
In the first week of December the Lui cruise from Kochi started the single cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Lui cruise is a European company and is very famous in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some difficulties the Lui cruise has now established its services , but since October it is expected to be sweet again .
You can go to Maldives for a three-day cruise at least 5850 rupees per person at the ship of Lui cruise at Emvi Aquarium .
That is , for three days the fare of one person less than 18 thousand rupees .
If there are two elders then children below 15 years of age are completely free .
What else is needed .
The fare of the cruise includes tea - breakfast , food all .
The entertainment of every time is collected .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy entertainments , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - From Plain Raid to Anderwater lunch .
While roaming around in big airplanes suddenly if a single plane stands in front of you then you will feel like adventure .
But this town with 12 - 15 seats is unsuccessfully excellent for touring archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- like Ooty Plane Maldives .
While running like a speed boat on the surface of water it emerges in the air , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not feel the flight of ordinary airplanes .
Every time your eyes keep watching below , seeing the reservoir islands and coral islands in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
How clean everything is visible .
There are two Plain companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of them , near which there are twenty - two planes .
If you want you can roam around a thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- for an hour or complete -LRB- if you want -RRB- then you can take the plan on rent for your whole day -LRB- if you are full of pockets -RRB- .
Although if you go to any island beyond the Male island then the journey of Plains would be necessary because this is the way of journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey that you may never do the mind of its end .
Sea Plen travels from 12 kilometers to 183 kilometers -LRB- in Uttam Mavilavaru -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest Antique and Sovenier shop of the capital in the Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
All the cellsmen were listening very carefully to the treasures given in the world climate conference in Copenhagen one day before the President of Maldives Muhammad Nashid .
If you say honestly then no Indian has seen the feelings of president or prime minister so carefully .
But when there is a question of the existence of an unprecedented creation of this earth , then so much seriousness was indeed uncomfortable .
Many people may have considered the seat made inside the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but on going to Maldives it seems that if the nature ' s anger is lost with it then the world will become so nice .
Something like this is special in the beauty there .
In that small country you do not feel so beautiful .
Returning from that journey of the market towards the jetty to go to the cruise , when the sight went to the water of the sea along with the Burbans serpent then it was felt as far as the people here understand the price of this beauty .
Water was so clear that fish floating in many metres deep below in the light of the lumppost were clearly visible with all its colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can also see some centimetres clearly in the sea or river water connected to any city of India then you will feel yourself dry .
While returning to MV aquarium we were roaming in the brain for two hours in the evening spent in the lap .
Coral Riff -LRB- marsh rocks -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will find peacock rocks on stones on graves .
Just a while before listening to President Nashid we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not believed that we were ahead of the best accommodation of any country , there was no security personnel far and wide .
With fun we were pulling the photographs of gardens and wooden trees just fifty metres away by increasing the hand from the door of its bungalow .
You can think like this in India about the house of such a leader .
It was also known that at times the President reaches his office while crossing the road on foot .
Every thing about Maldives was astonishing .
That is why I was waiting for the next day ' s Wesberry .
It seems that that day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat from the cruise brought us an airport Island .
From there we reached the base of Trans Maldives by cutting the rock of the runway .
Last evening when the cruise was approaching Male then we were walking from above immediately recognized the plane .
The pictures of such pictures which had been seen .
But then it was not known that the next day there would be a chance to ride in it .
We were going to go to Rangali island a hundred five kilometres away from Trans Maldiveson ' s Plain .
Watching hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from Plain to the height of approximately thousand metres was marvellous .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a flight to stop breathing with thrill and excitement .
But on reaching the Connaught Resort of Hillton Hotels on Rangali Island we felt as if we reached another world .
In such a world , which had no interest in any outside world .
The acquaintance was also not so much that it was difficult to get out like beauty or valuation there .
Tour can also be done on foot or from the battery-driven vehicle .
While going from Jetty to the main island the view of life on both the sides of the bridge was unique .
Now we could not even facilitate ourselves from the nature around , that reached such a place , was black .
While descending in the water of the sea several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all the sides we could see a variety of small - big fishes , corals , snow climbing and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating sitting on decorated tables was very thrilling in itself .
The fare of seeing and lunch of the underwater on coming to this island from Male to Sea Plain is only 47 thousand rupees for a man .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to give flow to our passport water .
But we knew , it was not possible .
Further , sometimes , sometimes , on some fold , you will definitely take ' takdira ' mathematics with great mind .
We were planning to go out of Delhi for many days but due to the arrangement of evening it was not possible .
Since childhood when Wildlife was drenched then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 after biking till Pagong Lake ahead of Khardungla pass in Laddakh this was the second bike tour .
On the morning of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the joy with which the corner had come out turned our ropeway .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
From the top the fog and the bad road ahead .
Many times it felt that now fell .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at eight in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett National Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dakuli near the park , whose booking we had already done .
On that day there was no special program but despite being cold we went to tour the coast of Kosi earlier .
After spending two - three hours there the Corbett museum came out , which was near Dhangdi Gate two kms away very difficult .
From there we moved to Ramnagar below .
While returning very evening took place .
If you see the lion roaming around in the jungle then I kept watching the lion in the dream all night .
In the middle of the depths of the night suddenly I heard a loud noise and after that when the dogs started screaming then they did not quiet for two hours .
Therefore the suggestion of first visiting Kaladungi and Corbett fall came .
Kaladungi is thirty k . . away while Corbett falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi where some special things related to their personal life are kept .
Returning and turning , we went to 12 .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett settled in this village itself .
On reaching the resort the journey was waiting for us .
It has been told that they have arranged for sighting in the number one site of the place .
On asking about number one it was told that there is more grassland and tigers come to that place to escape from cold during this time .
On reaching Bijarani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half hundred rupees for four hours .
We became deserted for the forest inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two twisted elephants , which had long teeth .
I roamed and photographed .
In the middle the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide told that there are around 150 tigers in the park , some of which have died recently .
In many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but without seeing the tiger I was depressed .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind the tiger ' s fiber was on a ride .
That is why I remembered my old friend of Haldwani .
I brought him the same phone .
I told him that I have come to Corbett .
He asked whether the tiger was seen or not .
His words were kissed like a thirteen .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us to take a journey inside .
During the journey it was discovered that due to the hydroelectricity near the park the animals often get injured or die by strangling with vehicles .
