Its language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch is Sindh and on the other side in the form of Gujarat also there is a mix of both in the language .
It is called ' kachchi ' .
Although this is ' bold language ' , it is not its own script .
If you want to write a cotton then you will have to write it in Gujarati script .
Bhuj is the city of Anjar itself where many times earthquakes have occurred and the entire city has collapsed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal - Toral .
The thing of jealousy is very entertaining .
If Maghari comes through the same way through which the road has come then we will have to take a full one month 's holiday and there the school will start in Mumbai .
Then what to do  Now travel through the train by making a Ramram of the buses of Gujarat .
The small rail of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and the big rail of bradge from Ahmedabad will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main source of the economy of Rajasthan is going through bad condition these days .
Due to global slowdown and the danger of increasing tendency of South Asia the tourism business has become a serious blow .
From the point of view of tourism a special deficiency has been registered in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan counted among the major states of the country .
According to a recent survey done by the Rajasthan government the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in 2009 has decreased more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to studies the number of national tourists has decreased by 9 . percent and foreign tourists by 27 . 36 percent .
In Rajasthan in 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 26 thousand 564 tourists came out out of which two crore 88 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas in 2009 a total of two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 thousand tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 619 country and one lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism sector are very concerned about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Hollyde Makers during Rajput , says that world mood and dreadful events have adversely affected the business of tourism .
Compared to other countries of Asia we could not even develop the strong base base of tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has decreased by 3 . 29 percent last year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism the last few years of Rajasthan has proved to be good .
This is the first time since 2002 when the number of tourists in Rajasthan has come down .
There is no such thing happening from the point of view of tourism .
Desert -LRB- desert -RRB- , havelis , forts , barren forests are all old .
In the tourism area all governments do big things about rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism but nothing is done in this regard .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get less facilities .
At the same time , taking out a blasphemy and blasphemy on foreign women tourists has brought this state to an international level .
Rajasthan government had already given the status of industry to tourism in this state very long time but it remained limited to papers only .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government in regard to tourism is Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
The Rajasthan government established RTDC in 1979 in order to increase tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the basic form of tourism .
This institute provides facilities like shelter , food , transport , boating etc . to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 departments of this institute .
In which 29 hotels , 22 models , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one transplant factor and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but for some years the situation of this institution has also worsened .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 is 185 lakh which is likely to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The situation of hotels of this college is that in the last five years forty percent of its hotels have not even been filled .
Along with hotels other factors of the institute are also harming it .
The main among these is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists have not been able to attract this train .
Even after reducing fare it can not attract tourists .
In the same way in recent years there has been a queue among tourists about the Pushkar fair .
In 2007 - 08 the tourist village built by RTDC in this fair where 398 foreign tourists had stayed , this year despite the dearth of this number it is 217 .
It was a matter of satisfaction with the RTDC that there was no dearth in the attraction of tourists for Palace on Wheels i . . royal trains .
This fire is proved to be beneficial .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees from this train .
With this slowness coming in the tourism sector in Rajasthan it is natural to have an atmosphere of anxiety in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the mind of man then he can remove gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has made it clear by establishing the modern city Ambo Valley in the range of Sahyadri mountains of Maharashtra .
The dream he had seen is enjoying in his eyes seeing progressing day by day .
His joy was also visible during the private airport inauguration of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has been successful in building its place in the form of a unique city .
In this city spread over more than 10 thousand acres there are only 9 percent hotels , houses and other facilities on the ground .
91 percent of the land has been provided with trees , ponds , ponds , carpets and other facilities .
Many industrialists came forward to make their homes in this city made for only crores of people and today around 800 families are living in this city .
Initially industrialists and women bought their Asia here in the form of holiday home but now they have made it their home and do it here in Mumbai for work .
Behind the Ambe Valley itself is Koirigarh fort which gives beauty to this complex .
The ruins of Likawali in the western Siang district are very important .
While excavating the remains of a large temple are found .
On the pillars of stones of this temple the work of the wooden work of the idols of Kamal and the goddesses is done which is mostly in a fragmented state .
Malini Than is an important place of this very part .
At this place a Dussehra statue of Durga Devi is engraved .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many stories and ancient stories are popular among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still in the glory of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and ancient legends the description of the month of the goddess Tameshwari is fulfilled .
During the days of Chetia kings this goddess was considered far and wide in the north - eastern hill .
The people of the people here used to worship the goddess .
The sacrifice of humans was also given here which was later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other remains of Arunachal are found in the Lohit district .
These are called the remains of Bhishmak Nagar which are located in the middle of the Debang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the verses popular here this place is ancient Vidarbha itself , where at one time the king used to rule Bhishmak .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of the Lohit district .
Digru , Mishmi etc . tribes here guide the tourists .
These people themselves have a great faith in this pond .
The famous Parashuram Kund is near Brahmkund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned remains in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the remains of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also historically important .
The remains of the lakes of Vitas near Roing are still telling their point of view .
The ghats of bathing , being surrounded by pure stairs and the remains of the wide and narrow roads around each other are still singing the grandeur of its ancient grand virgin stories .
We reach ero in four hours through jeep from North Lakhimpur city of Upper Assam .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this pleasant mountainous place attracts the hearts of the tourists .
This is the same charming place where people of the adventurous community live .
Before the formation of the road of the jeep it took several days to reach here .
On reaching here the views of tall cedar trees , beautiful preymoz , vollets , wild curtains , strawberries and rasbaris enjoy the tourists .
Apple and alubkhara are produced a lot here .
There is a valley spread over 26 kms at a height of approximately 1524 metres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the adventurous people .
Due to its untiring hard work people have made it their heaven .
There was a lot of rice farming here .
This place is a silver utensil .
Ten miles long this is a living example of the privilege of the pursuit of the plains and the synonym of the field .
The need for the synthesis of black rivers is fulfilled .
The trees of Pine increase the beauty of this valley .
The vision falls on the light redness coming from the sky on the tremors of the ice - covered mountain ranges of the left hand .
There is a lot of cold in the air .
Along with the cold touching in the environment one also feels wetness .
Due to the noise of garbage below the legs the layer of leaves sitting on the wooden floor is visible .
There is humidity in the atmosphere and because of the presence of sunlight before sunrise there was nothing more visible .
The sight remains blooming on the eastern redness .
The desire to sit in the balcony lying buncher .
As soon as the hands are touched the light layer of the snow rotates with a light sound and the hands get scattered in the moment the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience in the life of spending night in this small village settled amidst these mountains covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third journey in Swiss .
Before this spent a lot of time Jeneba or around it .
On both the sides of the upper Balkhati river the thick settlement settled in the valley is spread to a great extent on the light slope .
This is the main river Roney valley of Switzerland on both sides of which many small towns are settled .
The parallel highway of the Ron river and the vehicles running on it are clearly visible .
The journey of 300 kms and half an hour from Karni , along with the sanctum sanctorum of Geneva lake and half the Rohn river coming from eastern direction is found in the name of Montreux which is called Lec Lemon in French .
Geneva city is located 100 kms long and 10 kms wide on the western end of this lake .
From there the lake again turns towards the west after becoming a river .
On the right side there are dhaval , alps mountain ranges across the lake .
On crossing a beautiful small town named Leuke we come on the northern hilly road leaving this highway .
Due to the slope of the mountain being south - east the sun of the evening is giving a lot of light to all the eyes .
The quantity of snow from the valley is less here - almost not just with it .
As the height progresses , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite the accumulation of good snow on both the sides of the road due to clean sky and shining sun there is no special coldness in the air .
After deciding about 20 kms journey on this roaming hilly juice in half an hour we reached a small village named Thel .
Shail -LRB- Chalet -RRB- - There are large and big multi-storey bungalows made of wood .
There are rooms to control the necessary services like parking collaborative wages of cars , water , landlords made of cement concrete of this three storied bungalow .
Valaya is famous for grape farming in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making grapes .
37  of the entire Cantonment field of grapes occurs on the land .
In the villages settled on both the sides of the Rohn Valley grapes gardens give a unique glimpse of its beauty .
To take care of the grapes , to roam around them , to comfort the night in the villages there and to swim in the fields of grapes and to swim in the fields of grapes are the integral parts of the tourism business here .
In a small town named Aigle there is a very big museum of wine made of grape in a small fort built in 12th century , which foreign tourists have to register an agreement .
Once again we go through the same jungle from Dawanal .
Till three - four k . . the mind was more distressed with the singing questions of children throughout the road .
Simultaneously dramatic and charming changes come from the scene on a move .
Just in front , on the left side of the road on the upper slope of the deep valley a beautiful cluster of houses is built .
People are skiing in snow on the flat slope situated in the upper part of the village .
From the skiing slope to the peak of the mountain dense forests of deodar are spread .
Crooked snow has fallen all around .
The roofs of the houses of the village are shining because of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also the same calmness is spread .
All around from the peak of the mountain till the valley is the kingdom of dust ice .
Within the next five minutes you reach a huge goal chakra -LRB- Round RDF aboot -RRB- between that town .
The name of the town is Lukeerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Lukarbad is around 1500 .
Tourists coming here can estimate the number of creeders and healthy people from this point that there are 1700 roads and shells with the capacity of 6900 beds , 28 hotels for staying 1500 , camping site of tents , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants .

On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
In the lush green sun the large layer of snow is shining on the roof of the houses .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albanin village is one of the places obtained from the conservation of ' national heritage ' in Switzerland .
It was said in Darjeeling that Sikkim can go only taxis of Sikkim therefore checking does not happen .
The journey is going on , the state is second , but the mountain is the same , the trees are the same , the bright wind is the same .
It is the same wetness that blows up all the body .
In monsoon season fitness is the same .
On the completion of the plan of Darjeeling journey first it was decided to take a glimpse of Karsiyang .
Karsiyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Complete with tea gardens , full of dust forests .
Excellent tea is famous for production .
If we go ahead towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then the tea gardens spread in the beginning welcome the tourists coming to us laughing .
The road going through tea gardens attracts the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with forests , on the other side deep green valleys .
Here sometimes forests and sometimes tea gardens were visible .
There was a kingdom of greenery all around .
Once I saw these natural forests that see the plants of tea planted by humans .
Both were attracting towards us .
The more beautiful jungles were the tea gardens spread far and wide .
On seeing the road on the way the creation looks magnificent .
The circular and circular road like snake walking was moving ahead .
Time was also going .
If you do not finish then that jungle and tea garden .
Sometimes small villages were visible .
From a distance itself a hill looked very dense from houses and houses etc .
It happens to be karsiyang .
Staying in one place here we made a program to roam all day .
This is why taking a car we got out of the tour of Karsang .
First of all diar park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
The climb is upward i . . to reach the deer park one has to leave the vehicle very low .
Even though Karsiyang is full of beauty now has not been developed - famous in the form of tourism .
Whereas the city is very good and clean and beautiful .
The joy of reaching the Deer Park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the road through the dust trees was giving us adventure .
The next place was eagle crawl .
On the other side of this city is a point situated at a height .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that during the times of the British lovers used to give life by jumping from here .
At present there is a park and restaurant here .
There is a jean-like dome here after observing the entire city from the height of which a beautiful view is made .
In the tea garden nearby women were swimming in tea leaves running hands with a very fast hand by putting a hat on their backs .
There is a museum outside the city of Karsiyang but on that day we could not go there because it was more necessary to roam around in the environment of tea gardens .
The next day touring of Darjeeling is fixed .
It was a thrilling experience in itself but it was greater concern than this that if such rains were going on then how would we turn around
But the coincidence was very good that on reaching the Rock Garden we roamed enjoying the sunshine .
This park is a very attractive place with stones , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The road to reach here is even more beautiful than this .
On going a little more below from here we met the Gangamaya surrounded by mountains .
Here the beauty of the waterfalls situated in the middle of the rock is worth seeing .
In the Rock Garden we found that waterfalls are very beautiful in the kingdom of stones and stones here while the magnificent world of waterfalls in Ganga Maa is conserved with stones .
Both these places are sitting very low in the middle of the mountains of Darjeeling .
Waking up with the help of the car we saw Batasia lup in Darjeeling .
From here the entire mountain and city of Darjeeling can be seen on the basis of the telescope .
The fog of the weather was still clean .
But as we went towards Monastery do not know the fog came out and started spooning .
In the evening plans for roaming and shopping have been made .
Toys in the tour of Darjeeling increase the charm in the journey of fire .
The journey from Darjeeling to Ghum and Dhum to Darjeeling is special attraction for tourists .
Here in Mirik lakes boating and lunch in the park .
On the same way tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where Nepali artisans get scattered sweaters etc . from hand .
There is also an arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is like a city of Darjeeling district but its form - color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here but there is abundance of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Lave and Lolegaon , which is full of forest waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to Darjeeling in the shadow of winters but tea gardens spread from Siligudi to Darjeeling kept me with us .
My present journey was very attractive and thrilling .
This journey was neither of foreign countries nor outside Rajasthan but is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an attractive subject in itself in which sometimes the journey attracts itself , sometimes some special place , ship of water or some royal train or some city like a rose city or lake palace of Udaipur .
People get attracted due to some special attraction .
The place where I am talking has been prepared just about four and a half years ago , but the preparation with which this place has come there he actually made the welfare of the forest .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
In my ears my guide roams the word of Ram Babu Mina . Sahiba can not even think before that that we can stay in the jungle .
50 percent staff is in this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people could not even work in the heritage hotel .
The residents of Ajbagadh used to work in Jaipur before Ram Babu and now in the Aman Bagh of this unique royal style .
He brought his words to a new color .
Sahiba ' is the estimation of aman garden .
Nobody speaks to you with English advertisement there .
Aman Bagh is actually a picnic spot with aman chain and all comfortable picnic spot .
That garden has its own history as well and the biggest thing is that it also introduces itself to the surrounding region .
In the royal style of Rajasthan many of those who spend holidays have traveled to Bhangadh of the past , some of the residents of Jaipur may have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of the Aman Bagh many big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember that night as well when Shabana today told me there from my mind but I could not go .
This thing is different that he had reached Bhangadh by stealing himself .
This time when I suddenly reached the co-operation of reaching our foreigners then it felt that if people want to spend a good holiday in less time then they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden in those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to hunt .
Its construction was done in one and a half bids .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of the Aman Bagh in the shadow of mountains and dense trees attracts you .
Just as you come in the way you are welcomed , it feels as if you have been given attention to divine peace here .
Together with the construction of architecture in Mangat the mantra of Manglacharya is made alive .
We reached the evening and decided to kill that garden once again .
My master Jackie , who is a carving , said easily , is very attractive .
All the havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . no wonder that Aman Bagh has got architecture even today .
The manager fixed our program for the morning .
First of all walked with Ram Babu and then jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajbagadh on which the rays of the sun were spreading gradually .
We saw a dry lake in which farmers were making fields .
This year there was no rain but first time we saw the production of tobacco .
For Jackie such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
Just in the morning I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in mind .
This is an unforgettable moment of  .
The way to get rid of the aman garden was also traditional , by eating jaggery and curd they gave us relief .
Now it was remembered that why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are kept to see the life of the community .
Is this right
Undoubtedly and not only this happens in many states and tourists also show special interest in it .
This tour is generally prepared for the period of four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are made at different places .
It also includes staying there , food etc .
This way there is an attempt to find such a place where there is not much development and there is no special impact of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
That is why where old tourist places etc are also present .
Apart from this , even after all the trident cuisines attention is given .
Actually , for such a tour the tourists had to know the way and tradition of living in that place .
Although this idea looks a little difficult , but such tours are actually attractive and give a different kind of experience .
Just tour has its own joy .
With this you can enjoy roaming alone despite being with many people .
Not only this in this journey you can give more time to not obstruct your favorite book .
Yes , it is important that along with giving less expensive and comfortable time these tours definitely keep you more than patience .
This is the reason why it is important to keep in mind some things to enjoy them , mainly when you are watching some foreign destination with the help of bus tour .
Find best deal before taking tickets .
Students , senior people , girls and girls get suits on them , but for two people there is also arrangement of suiting .
However , it is cheap to buy a fire ticket , so at the last moment it is better to do the plan a little faster than just touring .
Instead of tower ticket get information about round trips .
These are cheap .
Rules regarding bags are specially hard , so think about the shape and weight of the goods .
Never happen that you will have to leave some of your things on terminal or you will have to pay more fees .
Also know the rules of diagnosis or losses from the tour company .
Carry on bags are appropriate , walk on .
Because they sit together in the rock above this seat .
Also keep in mind that the responsibility of the goods changing just during tour is yourself .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the prevailing season you should pay special attention to this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will have the best seat option .
Keep in mind whether it is pleasant while selecting the seat .
If the stairs sit more on the back seat , then reading on the next stairs is not conferable .
If you have to go to the management house continuously then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like much obstruction then the window seat will be better for you .
Now the thing of one fourth .
If you are both in the opinion of nausea then first sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other seat .
If there is no crowd in bus then the plan will be successful .
If there is a facility of washroom in the bus , then keep in mind this thing while selecting the seat because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make an identity of bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
Everyone is told to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat because they do not take the responsibility of sitting on forgetting .
Where to stay , return back on time .
If you do not come on time then your place may be available to another person and you will have to wait for the bus .

After that if you stay in the merchants even then you can get hotels at a little less fare but if you go to any nearby island to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then you will find a little bit smaller .
C cruise proves to be beneficial .
In the first week of December Lui cruise from Kochi started the only cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very famous in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some difficulties Louis Cruise has now established its service , but it is likely to start again from October .
You can go to Maldives for a three-day cruise at the rate of at least 5850 rupees per person at the ship of Louis Cruise MV Equarine .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if there are two elders then complete free for the child below the age of 15 years .
What else should be done .
The fare of cruise includes tea - breakfast , food all .
Every time with entertainment .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , movement available in Maldives with the help of your sweetness - from C . Plain Ridge to Anderwater lunch .
If you suddenly stand up in front of you while roaming around in big airplanes then you will feel like playing .
But with 12 - 15 stairs this TV over aircraft is unquestionably excellent for visiting Maldivesarkhan Island .
While running like speed finger from the surface of water he never knows that he emerges in the air .
In the entire journey we do not feel the journey of normal aircraft .
Your eyes are constantly moving below the window keeping in mind the various shadowed blue water of Maldives , the resort islands and the transport islands .
Everything looks so clean .
There are only two sea planes companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of these companies where there are 20 planes .
If you want you can travel for about 4 thousand rupees -LRB- every -RRB- for an hour or you can take the entire aircraft on your own -LRB- only filled with lapse -RRB- .
If we go to a different island from Malai Island then the journey of sea plane is necessary because this is the only way to travel on various islands .
And this is such a journey that we will not have the desire to finish .
The sea plane travels from 12 kilometers to 183 kilometers -LRB- north to Mavilawaru -RRB- on Maldives Island .
We were in the most ancient and golden shop of the capital in Ahmedabadi market of Malay .
All the sales of Maldives President Mohammad Nasid was listening carefully to the statements given in the world climate combination of Copenhagen one day earlier .
If you want to say authenticly then I have not seen any Indian listening to the address of the president or the president so carefully .
But when the question of the existence of a supernatural object on this earth came then so much seriousness was social .
Many people may have understood the sittings taken in water by the cabinet of Maldives in October , but on going to Maldives it seems that if it is covered with nature ' s wrath then it will be world valley .
This is something special in the beauty there .
In that small country so much beauty is not included .
If we return to the monkey to go back to the cruise by that journey of the market then if our eyes go to the water of the sea then it feels as if the people here do how much of beauty .
Water was so clean that in the light of the lamppost the fish swimming on the bottom looks with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which is completely connected to the city .
If you can see clearly for some centimetres in the water of the sea or river near any city of India then you will consider yourself intoxicating .
While returning from MV uamrin , the evening spent in the goods used to roam in the mind for two hours .
Stone -LRB- mung stone -RRB- is the life here .
So much that you will also find mung stones on the stones of the carpet .
After listening to the speeches of President Nasid we were standing for some time with their official residence .
It seemed as if we are standing in the shelter of a superior handicraft of the country and no protector is at far away .
We were enjoyingly taking pictures of just fifty metres long garden and rocks by handing them inside the gates of their bungalows .
Can we think of such a situation in the house of a leader of India
It also came to know that the president sometimes after walking on foot he reached his office two houses ahead .
Every thing about the context of Maldives was encouraging .
That is why I wanted to wait for the next day .
It seemed as if that day was going to be special .
In the morning a name from Cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we roamed around the runway on the base of Trans Maldiveson .
Last evening when the cruise was approaching the merchant then we immediately recognized the aircraft going above .
They had seen so many photographs .
But then it was not imagined that the next day there would be a chance to roam from them .
We had to go to Rangali island a hundred five kilometres away from the sea plane of Tros Maldives .
The sea plane flying at a height of approximately thousand metres is unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and transport islands spread over the sea of Maldives .
Such beauty of water is not available anywhere else .
The flight of thrilling and exciting breathing is such .
But on reaching Konarad resort of Hillton Hotel on Rangali island it feels as if we have reached a different world .
In such a situation which has no relation with any outside world .
There was no such relation that it was not possible to get out of beauty and comfort like there .
The journey of Konark can also be done on foot or also by a batteryched car .
While passing from port to the main island the view of water on both the sides of the bridge is unique .
At present we can see how to separate ourselves from the surrounding nature then we reached such a place which was impossible .
While descending in water below Sumudra from the stairs to several metres below we went into such a room of glass which was in water .
Our room was always a dining room .
Everywhere we could see a unique type of small fish , cattle , snorkelling and scuba diving cats .
The imagination of eating sitting on tables there was totally thrilling .
The cost of one person to see this island from Malay to sea plane and take lunch in the water is 47 thousand rupees .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to leave our father in water .
But it is known that it is not possible .
Heavy mind turned back with this hope that sometimes the intoxicants will be brought back to this place .
For many days it was deciding to go away from Delhi but because of the busyness of the work he was not able to embrace .
Since childhood there was interest in wild life then thought that at this time do not give birth to Jim Corbett .
In 2006 this was the second bike journey after biking till Pegong lake near Khardungla .
On 27th afternoon we got out of Delhi to Jim Corbett but the enthusiasm in which we had come out was blown up with our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
Smoke from the top and bad road ahead .
Many people felt that now we fell .
How to reach Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 200 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was decomposed near the park which we had already registered .
There was no special program that day we went to visit the shore of the first Kosi even after winter .
After spending two - three hours there we went to see the Corbett museum near Dhangdi Gate at two kilometers .
From there we went out to visit Ramnagar below .
There was a lot of evening while returning .
While coming out of Delhi we decided that lion walking openly in the jungle definitely saw that I was seen only lion in the dream of the whole night .
In the darkness of the night I heard a sudden duration and after that the dog began to sneeze like that which did not stop for two hours .
Earlier Kaldhungi and Corbett waterfalls were worth seeing .
Kalatungi is thirty kilometres long while carbonate fall is on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kalatungi where some important things related to his personal life are kept .
Till the return there was a half past twelve .
Kaltungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett settled in this village itself .
On reaching the resort Safari Jipsi was waiting for us .
It has been said that they have arranged for sites in a number of sites there .
On asking about one number it was said that greenery is more there and tigers come to the same place to escape from cold .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half rupees for four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
We saw two turtle elephants inside who had long teeth .
I made a lot of photography .
During this time the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide said that there are approximately 150 tigers in the park , some of which have died .
In some places we also saw the symptoms of their claws but because of not seeing the tiger I was disappointed .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
My head was full of lions .
Then I remembered my friend of Haldani .
I photographed him like this .
I told him that I had come to the carbonate .
He thought that the tiger had not seen .
That word of it is pinched like a monkey .
I said , No .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone told us that you take a ride to go inside .
