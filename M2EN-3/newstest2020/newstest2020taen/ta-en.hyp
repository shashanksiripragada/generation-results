Islamic organisations objected to the 2003 Archaeological Department's statement during yesterday's argument.
Commenting on this, the judges said, 'If there is any objection to the report of the television department, you might have raised it in the Allahabad High Court.
There you will get relief according to the law.
We will not allow it to be raised here.'

There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.
However, it is not just a compliment that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have provided a new evolution and a clear ideal for revolutionary movements and thereby Indian politics.
We can still see that there is an idea among the people that the revolutionaries are mere catastrophes and are unconcerned about human lives.
The era of Bhagat Singh makes us feel their humanity, sensitivity and capability.
The name of Bhagat Singh became widespread in India only after the assembly bombing in April 1929.
He made his debut in Tamilnadu in 1930.
But within a year of his debut, his fame has spread to every corner of Tamilnadu.
This is the most surprising news in history, including Gandhiji, that the name of any leader born in the north has not spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short time.
The reason for this is the father Periyar.
The week after Bhagat Singh was killed, an editorial appeared in the Republican Week magazine entitled Bhagat Singh.
The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's characteristics and presented some comments on the political situation of the day.
Some sections from the headquarters: -
'Indeed, we can say that if he decides that he is the right way in fulfilling his policies with a deliberate decisive determination of the whole of his policies, and if he decides, he will definitely have to do what he has done, and if he doesn't do so, he can't say he's a healthy man.
So now we will call him a real man.
Indeed, it is our strong experience that Bhagat Singh's policy is to be really important for India.
If Mr. Bhagat Singh is not hanged and is not surviving, there would not have been any proof of such popularity.
And we will say that if Bhagat Singh had not been executed, Gandhiji would still have been embraced.
Why was Bhagat Singh supposed to have died due to sickness and sickness due to sickness, the mother had to give her life more useful to show the path of real equality and peace to the people of the world.
We appreciate Bhagat Singh's heart, voice, handwriting saying that ordinarily no one else can reach"
'Father Periyar ji's remark in a Republican magazine.

I don't know if he took another child to the police station.
His mother, Kirkland, who agreed to release the identity of the girl Gaya Roll, told the media about this, 'My daughter-in-law, who is suffering from the sleeping problem, is embarrassed on time by the consequences of medicines used for it.
I was very surprised when I told him he was arrested, saying it would be difficult for a six-year-old child to understand and explain.

Vikram Lane's landing plains between the two faces Simbe Lies N and Mancenas C have been captured in a very modern way.

When the evening was dark, the films were shot.
It is learnt that Vikram Lander was fighting hard on the ground.
But Vikram Lander could not find a precise place to land.
LROCR PITER will again cross South Pole on 14th of next month.
Since the light is good at that time, there is a lot of chance for Vikram Lander to get caught in the film," said Sathyaraj.

The Government of India is going to reduce the financing of IITs in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Karakpur, Kanpur, Rurgi and Guwahati.
The Central Government has increased the fees to collect the funds from the students to deal with the deduction of funds.
Further, the Ministry has advised the companies to undertake developmental works, borrow loans from banks and obtain funds from corporates, keeping in view the sums of construction done by the technical educational institutions.
Since the BJP came to power, it has prevented the ordinary people from accessing education, reduced the funds for primary education in the budget in 2015, followed by a subsequent slashing of funds for education during a financial statement.
Subsequently, big business has been continuing to start educational institutions to facilitate greater access to private educational institutions.
In such a scenario, the new academic policy has enforced various regulations to ensure that the academic institutions are funded by private institutions without giving any importance to the educational institutions.
Through this, the Government of India has been pushing the country's rich future back to centuries as an illiterate nation by simply facilitating access to basic education to higher education.

Does the BJP take over caste politics in Tamilnadu
In Tamilnadu, it is said that if one cannot keep the puri and the tamarind away, then caste politics is finally taken into the hands of the BJP.
For the first time, when Modi was the Prime Minister, he was in a position to leave the tomb in Tamil Nadu.
After this, for the second time i.e., during the end of the elections, Ambi said, "You don't know what to do.
But the 5 contestants were able to cover the soil.
Though the BJP is all over the country, there is a wave of opposition in Tamilnadu.
This is above all the three languages, Kashmir, Hindi imposition and the same country.
Because of all this, we are still in a dilemma.
That's why BJP chief Sema is in a dilemma against the Tamilnadu BJP executives, which is why it is said to be difficult to nominate even the state leadership.
Though it is on one side, the BJP is planning to root out the BJP in Tamilnadu in any way in the coming assembly elections.
It is learnt that the BJP leadership has come to an end through the direct field report and the intelligence report.
Accordingly, whether it is the Mahamukthi or the DMK or the Dravida Party, the idea of not giving enough importance to the people of the Nadar community, to the Vanniyar community and to the people of Devendra clan is also there.
It is also said that Dravida's parties are in anguish.
The BJP has taken this trick and started implementing it.
We have decided to honour the glory of the society, or to give importance to it.
Saundararajan's appointment as the governor of Telangana was one such thing.
Likewise, the BJP government is reportedly giving importance to the top ranking states in ISRO.
It is true that if the BJP works in a way to honour every race, it will be a matter of pride and happiness for the people of the ethnicity.
Moreover, one thing that doesn't matter is that the caste politics will conceal the BJP.
At the same time, even though Tamilnadu is already narrowing up in caste politics, it is not known whether the BJP's activity will be like adding more oil to the burning fire.
It is true that if the caste is boiling and the flame starts to boil, the slightest flame in Tamilnadu will boil in the same fire
