Bosnians protest at the Croatian Atomic Disaster Plant
Croatia, a neighbour of Bosnia, gathered in northwest Bosnia on Friday to protest against saving a part of the waste from a single nuclear reactor in the region near a river famous for its border and natural beauty with Bosnia.
Demonstrators in the Bosnia Town Novicret urged Croatia to abandon plans to save the old military settlement in Tkoska Kora, and pledged to fight the plan.
The waste of the KRSCO reactor will be placed at the site.
The Bosnians who came with the banners of 'I need a healthy future' and 'Stop-Una River We Need' said that nuclear wastes would jeopardize 250,000 people living in the area.
We have to say no.
This was stated by Mr. Miroslav Tarelzaka, President of Novi Great Municipal Corporation.
We must fight to defend our lifestyle and our Unna.
Croatia owns this plant in Slovenia in the 1980s.
Officials of both countries will meet next week to discuss additional waste storage sites.
Croatia's national HRD television announced on Friday that whether Croatia would facilitate self-saving or pay for Slovenia's savings and save its share has not yet been decided.
Croatian Environment Minister Domislav Goric told the broadcaster that Croatia had a problem with removing institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and was seeking a comprehensive solution.
Activists, officials and residents from all corners of Bosnia, having different species, urged Croatia to choose another area near the nuclear plant.
"Why was Tkoska Kora chosen in Bosnia, leaving all parts of Croatia"

This narrates the story of Beden Howbert, who wants to be the US president, but he wants his school student to head the house.
Ryan Murph, who produced the American Harter Story and Glee, will act in the film featuring Weyneth Paultro, Ben Blot and Lucy Bodton.
Manchhasen's bi-proxy, a story tells a story about the condition of a person who acts as a physical or mental disorder even though he is really good.
There is a variety of ways to pretend that the person himself is not healthy.
However, Manchhasen's fibre fracture, in particular, is pretending that a person you take care of is unhealthy.
It is also known as 'produced' or 'provoked health deprivation' and classified as 'child atrocities'.
It is a rare situation involving the exaggeration of symptoms or the appearance of symptoms that a parent appears to be unhealthy.
What are the symptoms of Manchhasen's bag fracture
The symptoms may change one another, but the NHS says it is necessary to be aware of the following conditions.
Keeping your child healthy and unhealthy medical experts in mind.
Exaggeration or lying about symptoms.
Changing decisions to show that the child is not healthy, for example, adding glucose in urine samples to show that they have diabetes.
Promoting symptoms of disability, for example giving them unnecessary medicines or other products.
Can we see Manchhasen's fibre froxy more
It is difficult to understand the extent to which this situation has spread since it has not been said excessively.

Nigeria: Police raided Kaduna School and evacuated 300 children
The Kaduna state police officials raided the school, Imamu Ahmad bin Hambal, a school in Maiduban uma, located in Rikasa, the Iqabi local government area of Kaduna.
The police accused the children of being held in an unhuman environment, which was denied by the school.
Introducing himself as Sehu, one of the teachers in the school said: 'They say it is not true because all the children are here with the consent of their parents.
Parents signed a form before the children were admitted to school.
Parents are usually fed to their children every day and they are aware of their condition.
We were surprised when the police came and removed the children before shutting down the school and the food for the children brought by the parents of the children.
This is unjust because our parents have to testify to us that their children are kept in bad condition as the police say.
Abdur Raghuman, former Commissioner of Police, said that he had not complained about how children were being looked after.
Children have learnt nothing other than Kuran.
However, when Jacob Chabo said that the children will be re-inducted to their parents after they have been handed over to the state government.
They have been placed in an unhuman environment in the name of uran teaching.
Many of them have spots on their backs showing their fall.
So we are inquiring at school to know who is the owner of the school."

S A Chandrasekhar, his father and director, said that if Vijay alone is so much opposition, he means he grows up.
The audio release of 'Pikil' took place recently in Chennai.
Vijay said, "Who is blaming the truck drivers and the banner printers without knowing who is blaming him for the loss of lives due to road accidents," said Vijay.
There are strong protests on Vijay's behalf.
At the same time, people's justice chief Kamal Hassan has supported Vijay's speech.
In this context, Vijay's father SA Chandrasekhar was on a flight from Chennai to Tuticorin to attend a function at Nagar Temple in Kanyakumari district today.
There the press asked him questions about his criticisms.
Subashree died in an accident when a banner fell on a bike on the road.
Everyone talks about this incident.
Vijay spoke about one thing that everyone spoke about.
The court itself has asked the question why they have not arrested those involved in Subashree's case.
But Vijay did not know why the ministers and the AIADMK were protesting.
If Vijay gets so much opposition, it means he grows up.
If you talk, will you be so resistant, will you
If Vijay speaks, it means he grows up.
When Vijay watched the dais, the press questioned whether he would come to politics.
'I don't know anything like that,' said S A Chandrasekhar.
We asked the extremists about this.
'There is no alternative to the fact that the fall of Subhasree Banner is unfortunate.
But why did Vijay and Pigil wait till the music release function
The fan who cut out for a film starring Vijay fell down from the top and died.
That video also went off.
But he should have said no cutouts for his films at that time," says angrily.
For the past few days, a message has been spreading in Wattsup, entitled 'Dogs need alarm'.
The dog was told to inform the parents of the kids if their nails were scratched.
A video added that a dog was not told to his parents that the rabies virus had caused more than 90 percent damage to a young man.
The kid who is being treated at the hospital has a roaring scene like a dog.
We asked the cattle doctor, Ananthapathamanaban, if the vegetarians act like a dog and if the information that is spreading in Vatspappa is true.
A dog infected with rabies virus will surely damage the virus.
But if the nails of the dog swell in the body then the rabies will not spread.
Perhaps the nail of the dog affected by the rabies is buried in the nails.
If there is wound and injury in the body of the stripped man, the dog that has been hit by the rabies can also spread the disease.
Therefore, it is better for dogs to get vaccination at home as a precautionary measure.
We are also vaccinating once a year because dogs have to be treated.

Then he tied the child on a tree and made a sexual assault.
After the arrest, in a short span of time, a search order was issued in a house, and officials seized a number of items over the investigation.
The individual confessed to another three charges of deceiving and sexually assaulting another woman between August 2016 and April 2017.

I will injure you with tears.

PoP Warns Technical Experts to Use Artificial Intelligence for Common Good
Pope Francis on Friday warned technicians, envoys and financiers that the competitive evaluation of public good should be combined with the competitiveness for creating artificial intelligence and other forms of digital advancements, otherwise it would pose a threat to growing social inequality.
Pope addressed a client meeting with philosophers, academicians and propagators to bring together government envoys and facial and Google representatives.
The remaining participants were academicians and Catholic hierarchy, entitled Common Good in Digital Era.
The three-day gathering is the latest evidence that the customer wants a place in the discussion on the opportunities and dangers of artificial intelligence.
The discussion included the future of work at a growing level of technological advances and machinery dependence on the warfare and the decisions made by the social media agencies after the Christian massacre in New ealand and the video of the assassination.
Addressing the gathering, he appreciated the potential for technological advancement by noting that the machines at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution were protecting personnel from dangerous and sustainable jobs.
But depending on robotics only on profits, he warned, would pose a danger of human reputation to work.
He warned that if technology progresses due to transparent inequality, it will not make real and honest progress.
If the so-called technological advancement of mankind is an enemy to public interest, it will lead to the unfortunate recession of barbarism as the law.
The organisers said that they wanted to explore the expertise of the participants to explore the possibility of future consultations for the Catholic Church on technical matters.
Real Madrid borrowed Martin's accommodation and attracted his fans.
Martin Odagardin's aid split the mouth for Mikeel's first call.
This year, the Real Madrid team, which will not beat any domestic competition, went to the top in the La Lica Games following a 2-0 victory with the Osauna team.
However, despite the pre-Ceason turbulence, and the open rapprochement with Wellswearer Kareth Bale, its manager Jindin Jiden was under tremendous pressure, even though La Lica did not lose a single contest in this season.
The pressure surpassed the Paris-Saint German (PSG) team in the Champions League.
But the Jinnet Jiden and Real Madrid teams have some real talent, some of whom are present in the French plans, not some.
Vincies Junior is now in the fray as a star of real-madrid team.
Martin Odaigard, another Norwegian young man who was lended to the Real Socidad team, however, is making frenzy with the fascinating aid that La Lega made during a competition.
While playing for the Real Socidad team against the Allowance team, Martin's help split up the first call of the Real Socidad team, which won 3-0 in its own film.
After having a right-wing bunker, the opponent deceived a man and snatched a ball and snatched a bunch of frustrated bunkers and helped his colleagues get a goal.
William Jose's second goal and special player Orezpal's third goal, won by the Beneldy shoot this time, won a simple victory for the Imanol team, and Manu Garcia, the Alavs team's intermediary, was expelled for five minutes before the fighting was over.
Martin Odgard joined the Real Madrid team in 2015 at the age of just 16, but could not meet the expectations.
Now the 20-year-old Norwegian youth appears to be playing well in a way.

Women Industrialist Jennifer Arguria recommended to Boris Police Monitoring System
The Independent Office for Police Behavior now estimates whether the prime minister should be tried for criminal offences committed in government office while he was Mayor of London.
The Greater London Authority (GLA) surveillance officer has recorded a case relating to conduct on the charge that Ms. Arguri was given priority by her association with the Prime Minister.
When there is a news that a criminal offence is likely to be committed, there is a matter of conduct, it said.
It does not mean that this has been proven in any way.
Now the IOPC will consider whether the matter should be investigated.
The matter has now been recommended to IOBC, which deals with complaints against police in the UK and Wales.
At that time, it was recommended to the Monitoring Bodies as Shri Janson was in the rank of Police and Criminal Commissioner.
Mr. Johnson denied any misunderstanding about her friendship with Mrs. Argurien.
While insisting that they have been guilty of wrongdoing, he had earlier requested the Legislature of London to give details of his association with Smt.
This was followed by a statement by the Sunday Times that Ms. Argury, a immigrant American from London seven years ago, was given 126,000 from public funds and was allowed on concessions in three overseas travels under his leadership, while Mr. Janson was mayor.
Thereafter, the government has revised the decision to grant 100,000 subsidies to Ms. Argury's company Hacker House.
It faces difficult questions regarding pre-monetary verification procedures.
Digital Minister Mat Warman said that his Department has taken up the necessary procedures and the company had a British telephone number.
The calls, however, are reported to have been transferred to an existing California office, Smt. Arguri, 34.
Prime Minister's Friendship with Women Businessperson, "Everyone knows the secret"
The move by the GLA, which recommends the Prime Minister to the Free Office for Police Behavior, has provoked NE 10.
This is a politically provoked attack and at the time of the Conservative Party convention, a senior government news source said, "Open Politics".
The Surveillance Officer said there was no evidence of any accusations and no opportunity was given to the Prime Minister to respond to the surveillance officer before a report was issued on Friday night.
The public and the media will be well aware that this was obviously woven with political intent.
Johnson's close association with the California Industry with the tourism development agency of London was first told by Standard today.
Former officials of London Partners (LB) agents recalled how Ms. Arguri's firms had given Ms. Arguri's place to Ms.
At McMiller's death, one third accused of drug addiction.
Los Angeles (AB) - Last year, a third person was arrested and charged with drug abuse involving rapper mag miller.
In September last year, the court records reveal that Stephen Walter was suspected of selling pills of oxygodon stained in Miller's fenton, which were accidentally sustained in Cocaine, alcohol and Fenton, which caused thousands of lives in the United States.
Walter was accused of selling pills to Miller, another man named Cameroon Petty.
The court documents published Tuesday claim that Walter had received drugs from Walter since August.
Earlier this week, Ryan Rewis, arrested at Lake Hawasu City in Arizona, has been accused of acting as a 'Runner' carrying pills to the coach.
None of them were directly charged with Miller's death, nor did they appeal.
Walter, who was released on surveillance in a drug case in 2005, has already been ordered to enjoy a five-month jail term for breach of the terms of his release.
The lawyers dealing with the case, who first revealed Thursday's famous website, TMEST, told Walter that Walter would be in jail until the trial was over, because Walter had the potential to escape abroad.
There was no immediate response to the telephone message sent to his lawyer.
On September 4, the box was charged in the Federal Court and his lawyer refused to comment.
Miller's replies to his stress and his explicit talk of drug use, which has made some of the biggest people in Hip-Hope fans.
Malcolm James Mayors McCarmick, a real-named Pittsburgh hometown, had a two-year relationship with singer Haryana Grand, which culminated in early 2018.
After his death, the singer shared a favourite video of him on his Instagram page, reciting the song "Tang You Next" with a warm reference to him.
Miller's death was one of the deaths of musicians associated with the use of Opioid in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, who was a kidnapper in a group of 3 Dorce Towns, died in 2016, his body was Fentane and Hydrocodon.
The article has been amended to show that Walter's first name is not Steven, but Stephen.
Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has said that it is sufficient to take 650 grams of paracetamol tablet for those suffering from dengue fever and there is no need to take it seriously.
This indifferent speech by the Chief Minister has created a lot of controversy in the state.
So far, more than 1000 people have been treated with dengue fever in Uttarakhand.
Opposition parties, including Congress, have been accusing the government of not taking proper precautionary measures.
In this context, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand said that the government has taken sufficient precautionary measures to reduce the damage.
If he had come and asked for good, it would have been okay if he had come, and he had also given a suggestion.
Instead of 500 grams of paracetamol pills, he said that the dengue fever would flee if rested.
He said that health officials were saying that those suffering from dengue fever should not take medicines on their own and come to regular treatment.
The same chief minister had stated a few months ago that breathing would improve when air was flowing from cows.
The 9 year old Nigerian boy has created more than 30 cell phones .
The 9-year-old boy is using the Scratch 2 Free Documentary App to create an eyebrow game.
Scratch 2 allows use of sports, animations and stories online or offline.
So far, he has used it to create more than 30 cell phone games.
The boy has made it impossible to disappear in the game.
The player gets one point every time he takes a wowl from his hiding place.
I learnt in a boot camp how to create a game.
Now, while fighting me, I am very active in creating sports, said the hungry CNN.
In March, his father joined him in a five-day boot camp for children between 5 and 15.
The Camp, organised by Codefest International, provided an opportunity for children like Pasheel to access emerging technologies such as Robotics and Bodyguard Truth.
His father, Passil Okbara Senier, says he used to play a lot of mobile games in a hungry age.
When he was 4 years old I bought a tablet for him because he was always picking up phones to play.
He played Candidrash and the Temple Run too much," his father told CNN.
But after his father had planned to spend all the time in sports, he was very hungry at the age of seven.
"On that day, as usual, he was playing on his tablet like a peacock, so I was angry," says his father.
I told him with a lot of passion that you have always been playing and others have thought of creating a sport to play your game.
I was angry when I said it, but I don't know that he took it seriously.
Since then, he was very hungry in learning how to create sports, so his parents bought him a leaflet and taught him how to create sports.
The hungry that a scientist wants in the future is named after what his game is about.
One of his games is the Maskedo Mash at the Google Blair store.
Africa has the largest number of youngsters in the world and when it comes to innovation, people like hunger in the continent are at the forefront.
Two of the 12-year-old Nigerian boys were recently praised for making plans for robos to do their homework.
In May, all the women high school teams from Cana, Team Akropat, created a roadmap for loading robot coaches and won the 2019 Robofest tournament.
While major technological institutions such as Google and Myrosoft are increasingly investing in Africa, hunger and his colleagues are emerging as future targets.
Former President of North Carolina Republican Party is going to acknowledge the offence for lying in the bribery trial
According to court documents filed Friday, the former president of the Republican Party of Carolina would admit to the court that he had lied to Federal officials conducting bribes over key political donors.
The Federal Court files that Rabin Hayes is going to admit the offence next Wednesday.
Hayes said that Hayes knew that he had made untrue reports to the FBI agents who had conducted a bribe investigation in 2018 in a document based on the fact that Hayes' lawyer had signed as part of the Criminal Confession Agreement.
The Criminal Confession Agreement has been sealed and does not in fact indicate which charges he acknowledges.
He was initially charged with charges of conspiracies, bribery and unrealistic information.
Prosecutors accused Hayes, a former parliamentarian, of his involvement in the state's principal insurance regulator's election campaign, and in return, a special privileged insurance officer's plan.
Two of the officials, Greg Lindberg and his colleagues, have been accused of attempting to bribe the state insurance commissioner Mike Cache.
Lindberg is a founder of Insurance and Investment, one of the state's leading political donors in recent years, who has donated more than 5 million to state and federal candidates since 2016.
He also donated to the Democrats, although he was pursuing Republican policies and its politicians.
His lawyer did not respond to the email sent on Friday asking for comments.
Cairns Davis, a lawyer for Hayes, did not respond to further comments on Friday.
The court documents filed on Friday indicate that Hayes had lied to the FBI agents in August 2018 that he had never spoken to Kashi about the staff in the state insurance sector.
But Hayes actually spoke to the Insurance Commissioner about Lindberg's demand for replacement of employees within the regulatory body.
Prosecutors said that Hayes had helped when Lindberg asked for a meeting with Gaze and Hayes had consulted the Regulator directly about the bribe.
The accusation issued in April accused Lindberg of seeking special concessions to his insurance industry, and that he had up to 2 million for the re-election campaign in Kacheh in 2020.
The accusation is that there was also a demand for replacement of a reviewing officer of Lindberg's company.
Casey Federal, a Republican, told Federal intelligence officers about attempts to bribe, and helped them to prosecute.
There is no charge against him.
During a conversation between Lindberg and Gaze, a Lindberg ally told Hayes to send 250,000 to Gaze's re-election campaign.
Hayes initially denied that such a large amount would be noticed, but was accused of cutting criticism at the end of the conversation.
The accusation is that Hayes said, "Whatever you all want, we will do it."
Yes, let me do this to him.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office did not respond to further information on the Criminal Confession Agreement.
Face to hide the number of aspirations in a test attempt to improve the health of the beneficiaries
As the world's first test drive to improve the well-being of the beneficiaries, some facilitators can no longer see the aspirations, replications and video concepts of others.
On the contrary, following such a trial by Instagram in Australia in July, these options will be personal and only recordable.
The trial of Mohunuli, which will begin on Friday, will also begin in Australia.
The transformation was based on the views of psychologists that health research and aspirations are comparable to each other in the society, said Australian Focal Policy Director Mia Karlick.
"There are really positive ideas from many of our anti-cruel groups and mental health institutions," said Carlyck.
This is to eliminate the significance of the numbers, and to pay attention to the calculations of desires or reactions in reality, to focus on the quality of their intervention and the quality of their registration.
He said that without considering this as a competition, people are expected to feel more comfortable in sharing on this platform.
Carlic asserted that Musk-based industries would continue to achieve the same parameters as before and the same perspectives they had previously approached.
Instagram cannot be predicted in other countries as well as in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New ealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
Nothing has been pointed out when the test will be completed or whether the change will be made permanent, as it is in the Muhunto, the owner of Instagram.
We have just received some initial comments from the public about this experience (in Instagram), but we are still learning and taking care of it, he added.
Carlyck said Australia has the most active technological beneficiaries in the face and instagram, when it comes to being the world's testing ground.
We believe that this will be the best country to really get better ideas about whether it will be a valuable experience for the people who use our services.
Every individual is grateful to his parents who have nurtured him.
The sacrifice made by the parents to raise a child is not enough.
As much as it is necessary for them to do all the help they need in their lives, similarly after their lives, this thanksgiving must continue.
For that, Piturgarh was set up.
This is mentioned in a number of names - Darvana, Pitharkarya and Purvagatan.
With gratitude, they will call it 'serious' because it is necessary to do it with difficulty (forgotten carefully) on the day of the last month.
Thiruvalluvar, the goddess of the South, Vrindokkal, the head of the five-six ombals," says Thirukkural.
The so-called 'South Pulithar' refers to the hidden perspective.
Since the world of ancestors is in the south, they call the living world 'South Blue.'
Though it takes several days to depart, it is necessary to depart from the new moon every month.
Some are singing and dancing only in new moons.
Perhaps, if Pitthur has not made any attempt till now, it is very special if it starts on the eve of the Mahalaya Amavas.
This is the time when our ancestors are coming to Earth as a whole.
During the course, sesame, water, pint, rice, banana and food will be used.
Sastra says Pithura will bring the angels to the forefront.
The ancestors who came to see their children on the planet again to return to the world today.
This day it will help to bathe on the shores of Tirthankaras, to worship Pitthur, to guide them to their ways, to live in wealth and live a life of life.
Who is Nancy Pelosi, who has set a deadline for US President Trump
This is the second time that Nancy took office as the speaker of the US parliament.
He has the distinction of being the only member to be elected as the Speaker, the only woman in the top rank of the US Constitution.

The Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and the President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, met on Thursday during the United Nations Meetings.
The meeting has special significance in view of Iran's conflict with the US.
From this meeting, a clear message has been given to other countries, including the US, that India will not compromise on its own foreign policy.
The Prime Minister's Office tweeted about the meeting between the two leaders.
Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Ravish Kumar said that bilateral cooperation and regional situation were discussed between the two leaders.
Prime Minister Modi visited the Iranian capital of Tehran in May 2016 aimed at strengthening relations with Iran and enhancing Indias relations with West Asia.
When India and Iran signed nearly a dozen agreements, the development of the Chabahar port was an important agreement.
Subsequently, India, Iran and Afghanistan signed a Trilateral Agreement between the three countries for transportation of goods through ports.
Rouhani visited India in February 2018.
He was the first Iranian President to visit India in a decade.
During his visit, several agreements were signed between the two sides.
Prime Minister Modi and US President Donald Trump have met twice in the last few days.
Tensions between the US and Iran have escalated since Iran has recently been under US sanctions.
The US has imposed sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program.
India has also stopped importing petroleum products from Iran because of US sanctions.
After Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Iran was India's third largest oil supplier.
Despite the compromise, India did not reconcile meeting with the President of Iran.
Concessions from Sri Lanka Airlines to the three Services.
At the behest of Chief of the Army Staff, Lt Gen Savendra Silva, the National Airlines has provided the Sri Lanka Airlines with free transport of five kilograms of goods to the expatriates.
Mr Jayant Abesinghe, Regional Manager, Sri Lanka Airlines, Mr. Deepal Fallekoda, Regional Manager, Sri Lanka and India, Mr. Chamar Hetyarachchi, State Travel Manager and Business Executive, called on the Army Chief, Lt Gen Savendra Silva at the Army Headquarters yesterday afternoon.
During the meeting, Airlines officials discussed matters related to concessions with the army commander.
The concession will be made available to the military on personal vacations, training, conventions and seminars while travelling abroad.
In view of the essential components and requirements required for carrying 30 kg free of cost to foreign courses, Lt Gen Savendra Silva had issued the request to Sri Lanka Airlines in August 2019 to enhance free concessions.
The Sri Lanka Airlines provides free transport of goods from 30th July to 5th July, 2019 to all the militias undertaking training in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, China, India, Pakistan and other South Asian countries.
During the meeting, the Chief of the Army Staff expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the officers for their cooperation with the Sri Lanka Airlines.

The Government of Tamil Nadu has asked the Government of Tamil Nadu why there should not be any reservation in government medical colleges for those who are studying in government schools.
The Private Medical Colleges in Tamil Nadu have not filled up 207 seats for Overseas Indians and have been awarded to the respective colleges as Administrative Acquisition Sites.
Diran from Coimbatore had filed a case in the Chennai High Court for a proper consultation of these places.
The case came to the hearing at a session comprising judges Kribakaran and Velmurugan.
P. Raman, appearing for the Indian Medical Council (IMC), argued that after three stages of consultation, NRIs will be sent to the respective colleges on the basis of 10 students for one place in case of evacuation.
The list should be filled under the relevant provisions of the College.
But I don't know if the list was filled in the battalion.
When Additional Chief Prosecutor Arvind Pandian argues on behalf of the Government of Tamil Nadu, the list of vacancies will be sent to the respective colleges.
The vacancies must be filled with merit.
But I don't know how colleges are filling up.
The Supreme Court has issued no order in this regard.
He therefore argued that the Judiciary order should be issued to the NRIs for filling up the Consolidated Areas.
Welmurugan, a lawyer who appeared on the petitioner's side, said that 207 vacancies were sold for higher quantity to those who were less marked.
The intermediate judges, those who go to private schools for school and seek government medical colleges only for medical courses, why not provide special reservation to government medical colleges for those who are studying in government schools, if they send a list of vacancies only then why should they not check on the basis of which the filling sheet has been filled up
Here government doctors are paid lesser wages than my assistants than teachers.
This is an injustice to doctors.
We have directed 10 separate medical colleges in Tamil Nadu to be contesting from this case.
They directed that NRIs should submit their marks by the 15th of October, 2019 as a report by the students enrolled in Consolidated Areas.
Life sentence for brothers in the honour of Guantil Baloch, Pakistan's social media figure
Guantil Paloch, popularly known for his social media photographs, was murdered in July 2016.
Last Friday, Pakistan's social media celebrity was found guilty of murdering his brother and sentenced to life imprisonment in the country's high-ranking 'honorous murder'.
Fascinated by Western civilization, but deeply disgusted with women, Baloch, popular for his glamourous selfies in Pakistan, was strangled to death in the month of July.
His brother Mohammad Wasim was arrested.
A few days later, he told a press conference that he had no sorry for what he had done. Yes, I have killed my sister and that sister's behavior was very provocative.
In a long-awaited ruling, his lawyer Sardar Mohammad told AFP that the court in the eastern city of Muldan had convicted his client for life imprisonment.
He said he will be released to the High Court in Gaudin Asia.
Earlier, Anwar Mai, the mother of Baloch, told the AFP that she believed her son would be released.
"He's innocent.
She's my daughter, she's my son.'
The calls for action against the infection of one woman - usually murdered - the horrific killings - were resumed in the wake of the international talk of the killing of Baloch and the violation of social control of the spiritual society.
Women have been burnt, shot, slaughtered and strangled to disgrace their families because of the crimes like choosing their husbands or slaughtering their daughters.
The murders were usually carried out by a close relative.
Under Pakistan's uisas (Black Money) and Diyath (Revenge) Act, they may apologize to the relatives of the victims.
Three months after the assassination of Faloch, the Parliament passed a new legislation enforcing life imprisonment for honourable killings.
However, the judge's own decision was whether a murder would be regarded as a honourable murder, so that the killers could be pardoned for another reason for the murder.
In Baloch's murder, his parents initially insisted that their son should not be forgiven and released.
But he was convinced that he would lose his son and that he had to change his mind and forgive him.
However, due to international disgust over the killing, the Pakistani government took a rare step with parents to declare itself a weekly, making progress in the case.
The dressing of Pakistan's cricket team and the glamourous Scarlet dress on Lover's Day are some of the most well-known ploys.
This led to his denunciation and threats, but it was a brave and political activity for women's empowerment to be treated as images of Kim Cartacian, in a country where they looked completely new, including younger communities.
The roots of the killings of Gaurav are under tribal social control, which are widespread throughout South Asia and males may be affected, but they dictate the behaviour of women.
Today we have lost some of the ground water.
And that is why we are beginning to feel the need of palm trees.
The Pani Sowing Festival is now being popularised by social enthusiasts and youth across Tamil Nadu.
The Prabhakaran Revolutionary Seeds Movement in Annawas, a district in Thiruvananthapuram, has been active since 2015.
Tamil Nadu, Trichy, Salem and Thanjavur are members of several districts.
Everyone has studied and worked in different ways.
Yet, the youth of this organisation is eagerly engaged in various activities like tree plantation, water rejuvenation, preservation and restoration of ancient historical sites due to the concern on this soil.
Khaja has been searching for palm seeds and sowing them at various locations in Tamil Nadu and providing them free of cost to the needy.
I am familiar with the youth who coordinate the Prabhakaran Revolutionary Seeds Movement.
Edison, one of them, shared with me about their work.
The West Bengal Elephant, who died in distress
Speaking about this, animal welfare activists said, 'In 2004, this was changed to Brad Gazzaga.
Thereafter, more trains are being operated on this route.
Elephant casualties have increased since the number of trains increased.
This region is the route of elephants.
Railways have taken note of the fact that trains are being operated at a rapid pace and elephants have lost their lives due to accidents.
Subsequently, trains were ordered to operate at low speed in this area.
As a result, accidents have also come down.
Now the trains are being run faster in this area again.
We are calling for setting up punitive measures in another area.'
Speaking about this, North Eastern Regional Railway officials said it is about 15 kms in the desert.
It has been ordered to run trains slowly while crossing the area.
The mandate is to run trains slowly for 24 hours.
Continuous research is underway in the forestry.
Consultations are also underway to reduce the speed of trains.'
A 3-member team has been constituted to review the operation of trains in the area.
The accident was 4.5 degrees curve.
He is being treated with a logo bullet injury.
In Tamilnadu, social enthusiasts have reported that the male maternity benefits have been stopped for the past year without paying them.
Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy Maternity Assistance Programme was launched by the Ministry of Health Family Welfare, Government of Tamil Nadu for the benefit of poor pregnant women.
Within 12 weeks of pregnancy, 4,000 bank accounts will be credited to rural and urban nurses after obtaining a BIMI number by furnishing details of Aadhaar Card and Bank Account Number.
After that, 4 thousand rupees will be given as the second instalment before the completion of the 4th month.
A total of 18,000 subsidies have been disbursed to the Government Hospital for the 3rd pregnancy, 4th pregnancy vaccination period, 4th pre-mature vaccine period, 4th pre-mature vaccination period, 2nd pre-ninth month after the completion of 9 months.
Likewise, nutritious nutrients containing iron tonic, dry ginger, protein biscuit, ghee, albendosol pills, kadar pieces are provided to improve the physical fitness of women during pregnancy.
The scheme has been implemented to nurture pregnant women and their children with health.
The scheme was very useful for the Middle and Poor pregnant women.
Over the last one year, maternity benefits to pregnant women have been stalled without proper dispensation.
In this regard, social activists said, 'Over the last 13 months, 18,000 maternity benefits, which were given to pregnant women by the Department of Public Welfare and Family Welfare, have not been paid.
This has affected the safety of maternal and child health during pregnancy.
Borrowing and spending on child maintenance has increased.
While only nutritional consignments have been disbursed, the subsidy has not been transferred to the bank accounts till date.
In this regard, the first instalment to be paid by the Government of India has not yet been paid to the public health authorities.
The Finance Minister said that after the first instalment of Rs 2,000, the remaining Rs 16,000 will be credited to the bank accounts of the Government of India.
However, it is said that the Government of Tamil Nadu has regularly registered applications for maternity benefits.
Therefore, the government has to take the current date of payment of maternity benefits which have not been paid for more than a year.'

While the summit will last just three weeks for the summit of European leaders, there is growing fear among top officials around the prime minister that the time for major concessions is declining.
Ministers revolted against Boris Johnson for slashing his fractured demands and negotiating a compromise with the EU.
While Brucells termed Mr. Janson's alternative arrangements as "irrelevant", the talks on a new customs system replaced by Irish Baxtop have been stalled.
Senior ministers avoiding EU power prokers led by Angela Merkel of Germany will give the Tory chief who is ready to fight a three-year duration on Baxtop.
The Sun speaks, three different cabinet ministers are preparing to oppose him after the Tories Annual Convention to be held in Manchester next week.

A minister said, "Time for abolishing the Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday that ended the parliament's postponement," adding, "Now, for the 31st of October, we have only one way of entering into an agreement.
We can never get the number downstairs and they are against us.

We can't fight everywhere.

Sir John Major accused Boris of not giving importance to the talks.
In a tragic conversation, former Tory leader said: "The Prime Minister tells us that he wants to make an agreement with Europe.
But we couldn't see how to build an agreement with Brucells.
On the contrary, we see a bullock-cutting in Scotland, analyzing eggs in Wales and arguing with the public on the streets - an election campaign will appear to all the world as it is already in full swing.'
The Prime Minister's Spokesperson acknowledged, Nobody can imagine anything, we have to go farther to reach the agreement.
When there is no agreement, the Pen Act, which enforces delay of three months, is seriously underestimating our negotiating position, said the spokesman.
There is no doubt that it prevents our negotiations, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues continue to strive to make progress due to the legislation, he added.

The Freedom Party is not prepared to proceed with a program of foolproof purpose and purpose.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was not prepared to launch a program that questiones the future of its members in order to harm the policies and intentions of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) during the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) district conference today afternoon.
Moreover, the president said that while the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had suffered a setback on various occasions in history, the party did not face destruction by its people's actions.
Anyone who claims that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party is weakened cannot accept it, and any candidate who sits in the presidential seat in the forthcoming presidential election requires the support of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as the deciding force of the future president.
The President said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party's aim was to seize parliamentary power in 2020, through the creation of a government that is more powerful than to choose an unauthorized president in the future.
The president said it was the aim of the new government to build a nation that was not bowed down to foreign powers, without corruption, without corruption, democracy and independence, to take the country on the new path that was destructive by corrupt elites.

Speaking on the basis of a letter to the UPFF general secretary, the President said that he had taken steps to remove Pradhar from the post and appointed Mahinda Rajapakse as prime minister and that he had no problem with their inability to deal with matters of responsibility, and that today Mahinda Rajapakse was the leader of the opposition and that members of the PA were sitting in parliament.

imbabwe: Sivanga Fears Confusion
A senior government official said that former President Robert Mugabe refused to offer the opportunity to become president at the peak of the Revolution, which he feared was a trap for imposing himself to empower the military to seize power in November 2017.
Mugabe told the imbabwe Independent last week to accept the post of chancellor after talks between himself and the military during the Revolution.
A senior government official told the social media, however, that Sivenga did not deny this opportunity due to fear and was able to understand Mugabe's plans to demonstrate that he had actually lost his position in the revolution to world leaders and AU leaders.
imbabwe's 37-year-old ruler was prepared to hand over power to Sweden, but Jamwanda 2, a tweet, confirmed by government officials that President Emerson was a senior government official at the office of the Presidential Office and the cabinet office that Nangakwa had no power.
Government officials said Mugabe approached Sivenga by one of his envoys, who realized that he was suppressing power from his hands.
According to the senior government official, there were three persons in the mediation between the head of the military authority and the late chancellor.
The negotiators included President's spokesman George Saramba, Aaron Nebera, the then chairman of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Roman Catholic Fischer Fidelis Moonori.
imbabwe was another negotiator after being personally dispatched by former Governor of the imbabwe Reserve Bank, Gdian Cono Mugabe, to offer an opportunity for the post of President of imbabwe Defence Force (ISTF).
He was described as Africa's identification after his surviving career and sought the intervention of other African leaders, while attempting to waste the recognition of the African Union for military operations.
The then CDF (General of Defence Forces, Sivenga), was not elected to the post of chancellor.
The officer (Jamwanda) wrote, It was a desperate attempt to correct the rapidly developed situation and tired part of the late President's family.
But there was a slightly political manoeuvre, the late chancellor hoped that it would at least rectify the diplomatic situation.
Recalling the promise of the generals that the constitution will not undermine or undermine the order, this shift would have confronted them with the standpoint of the African Union on the revolutions.
The late chancellor (Mugabe) believed that he would get into the trap of the CDF (Sivenga) and thereby confirm the words of the generals that the constitution was not undermined.
Mugabe's (minimum) belief is that the African Union, which had been far more confused about how to take it on the basis of its theoretical approach to the revolutions throughout the atmosphere, would have called it a revolution without any other means and would have been convinced that it was necessary for military intervention.
The opportunity was given accordingly.
When Mugabe recognised that the security forces were not prepared to defend themselves, the authorities claimed that Mugabe had undertaken the operation.
They said Mugabe was insisted on writing a resignation letter because the military warned him that he was at risk of being killed like Gadafi.
Army chiefs told him that if civilians marched to his Flu Rupee residence, he would not be protected from them.
At that time, he had two desires to defend his family and prove that the army was occupying power.'
The then CDF and the generals really understood the idea.
The senior government official said that through a powerful parable - Visu Tiri vemakapa-makwapa (we are not supposed to be, i.e., soldiers), we were not politicians or political competitors.
Government officials say that through their men in imbabwe, military leaders in the area have not been able to eliminate Mugabe, but the military has informed them that they should take care of the 'criminals' around him.
Considering the pursuit of revolution and regime, Mugabe sought to use the same strategy to deceive Nangakwa, who had been sheltered in South Africa for a while.
Apart from negotiating with the military, Mugabe also sought assistance from the region.
South Africa - not only because of its economic and regional strength - but also because it was then president Jacob uma SADC, but, as it continued to intimidate, made it clear that if the military had entered Mugabe's house, the South African forces would immediately reach Harray.
The news source told Independent that it did not happen because the new and African leaders did not like it.

China needs strong leadership, otherwise a 'shock' policy memorandum.
China did not need a strong and united leadership of the Communist Party, in a policy memo published on Friday to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.
A White Report stated that the party's leadership was responsible for the success of the country since the communist occupation 70 years ago.
The largest in China, its national conditions are complex and its administrative difficulties are rarely seen.
In the absence of a united and strong leadership, China will head towards partition, crush and bring a disaster to the world.'
As in 1989, Chinese officials have long justified the need for national stability to suppress and suppress the problems, as they suppressed pro-democratic protesters.
e Jinping, the powerful leader who will preside over the anniversary celebrations of the world's second largest economy on Tuesday, has further strengthened the party's rule and has contained those who could challenge his power since assuming office in late 2012.
The Military Modernization Programme under the supervision of GST has created tension in the region.
China does not expect to export its model of development or import any other foreign model, the policy mentions that the country's appeal is not merely peace, it is not a 'disturbance'.
The Chinese genetics dominate the world or invade others.
China is being intimidated by the great powers of the modern times, and the impact of war and turmoil has profoundly retreated, and China will never experience its hardships.
China is celebrating this year's celebrations in the face of falling economy and anti-government demonstrations in the Chinese region of Hong Kong, as it is colliding with the US in a tough trade war.
The memo stated that the country would never 'leave' China's interests, and would not compromise its security and sovereignty.
"The threats of trade war and the increased taxes are not suitable to resolve the issue," it stated, on commercial issues with Washington.
China is a maturing economy with a holistic industrial system, a comprehensive industrial bond, a broad market and strong economic power.
The memo added, "The trade wars will never weaken this."
China is confident that it will be able to overcome difficulties and turn barriers into lessons and create a new world.
It added that the US must wisely look at China's progress as China does not have the desire to challenge the US or alternative to the US.
China cannot be controlled by the US, and there is no possibility of China's growth being interrupted.
The detention and suppression of other countries will not strengthen the US to take domestic issues abroad.

Kagamgun, who had been for 4 years intimidating his brother at the gunpoint, was arrested.
Annie is to be considered like a mother.
But there is a coward who thinks of him at Gurugram near Delhi.
The incident took place in Bajkera area of Gurugram.
She was married 9 years ago.
There are 2 children.
Near the house is the house of one of the brothers of the woman's husband.
The woman's husband goes to work in the morning and returns home only in the evening.
At this interval, the Kagamgaman is regularly coming to Nisaka's house.
At one point he showed and intimidated the gun with him, and raped the woman.
When he said this, he threatened to kill children and husband.
Just a few days ago, the husband of that girl got to know about it.
He was shocked to call the police control room and explained.

Tourist places have become very polluted and video shows .
The Sydney port, which has invested 21.9 billion annually to the Australian economy, is a major contributor to the Sydney tourism sector, surrounded by Oberoa House, Circular ueen, Luna Bars and a symbolic port bridge.
But underneath that bridge is a rotten fact.
Sydney's famous port is one of the most polluted waterways in the country, where every year 15 Olympic swimming pools get polluted.
This alarming statistic is that this place, which attracts tourists more, makes it one of our most dirty places.
According to a new video titled Sydney Port and Below, cigarette pieces, plastic bags and bottles, disappearing footwear and clothing and dead animals are filled in water surrounding Australia's most famous city.
But plastic plays an important role in blocking our waterways.
Catherine Taffron, Assistant Director of the Sydney Port Research Programme, said, I call this a confusion.
It looks beautiful, but it is one of the most varied and dirty debris on our beaches.
Each hour, about 1560 kilograms of plastics are on our waterways, most of them are coming to the port through rainwater drains.
"The port is in a very bad condition following some of the heavy rains," said Dr. Dafran.
One-third of these filth comes from rainwater drip.
But as 70 percent of the plastics inside the sea reaches the sea bed, the Sydney port's problem is as big as a iceberg under the surface.
Richard Nicholas, owner of the Mannly Divine Centre, says that he and his team personally take 500 kg of plastic out every year and say, "You can only know what is really there if you go underwater and spend time."
Perhaps most people will be shocked to know about it (what is inside the water).
Mostly... half of everything we find is plastic bags.
The remaining 50 will be made of plastic at least.
When you look at the port it looks very beautiful, but people dont believe that all these plastics and garbage are available from below its surface.
Germany Brother, Vice-Corporate and Managing Director, Ocean Protect, said that local and tourist are the only ways to reduce the level of plastic and garbage that reaches our waterways.
It must begin with the original, he added.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use and recycle it effectively and be more aware that it reaches the sea at the end of our drive.
If we ruin the sea, we will destroy ourselves because 50 percent of the oxygen we breathe out of the sea.
It sucks 30 percent of carbon dioxide and food resources.
But we can fix this port and bring it to its oldest position, it is very easy.
If we destroy the sea, we destroy ourselves.
This video, funded by TOMRA, a recycling company, as part of its broader effort to sensitize Australians about environmental protection and reducing the impact of consumption of natural beverages, is in line with a study on plastic and mental health released this month.
A poll conducted by 546 children between the ages of 12 and 18 showed that 82 percent of plastic waste was disappointed and 25 percent accused adults of a single use plastic problem.
While 93 percent of the 551 parents of the opposite 551 asked were concerned about the level of plastics reaching the ocean, the study also showed that the parents had a fourth of the most worrying issue.
We want to do something about plastic waste, but some of the researchers said that we don't know how to make a difference, it creates an environmental disturbance.

Dasmanian television can guide cancer treatment .
Researchers have discovered a turning point in the treatment of patients that can guide cancer treatment.
Medical researchers have found out how some cancer cells hide themselves .
Researchers have discovered that the same process is taking place with Dasmanian televisions and humans .
This discovery is expected to give new methods of treatment to cancer patients .
What's common with Dasmanian television and humans
Non-visual cancer cells.
Researchers, including those from Melbourne's Peter McCallum Cancer Centre, have discovered that some types of cancers have not responded to the anti-cancer treatment system and have helped bring about a revolution in their treatment.
It might be the key factor in rectifying the dangerous facets that threaten the future of the destructive Dasmanian television.
This study, consisting of a group of proteins called PRC2, concealed themselves and discovered the way in which some of the cancer cells in humans and the organisms could hide themselves, preventing a warning signal from attacking cancer.
This could be one of the biggest challenges in the treatment of small lung cancer, neuroplastoma and mercel cells.
Peter Mac Researcher Mark Dasson told AAB, "The biggest benefit of this programme is that in some cases we can make it possible for the patients who are opposed to the immune system to revert the process.
Cancer cells can be diagnosed by changing the aim of existing treatments to activate indicator proteins called MHH.
Prof. Dasson said, It is possible for neural cancer patients to have long term benefits.
This is one of the most common diseases in the world.
We can treat it even better.
Researchers believe that this discovery can be ultimately used in the facial tubes of Dasmanian television, which prevent cancer cell detection in a similar way.
Accurately, the same process (including humans and in Dasmanian Davy Cancer) is remarkable, said Professor Dasson.
Till now, it was very difficult to treat the tumors of Dasmanian television.
But if humans can use medicines in Dasmanian television, it can help in controlling this disease.
The Building Research Organisation (BRO) advises the general public to deal with the degradation of soil.
The National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) has announced to the general public that it should work cautiously with regard to the degradation of soil after heavy rains.

The Organisation has also informed the public about the eruption of land degradation, shaky electric poles, trees and building walls.
The National Stage Research Organisation (NSO) has also announced the withdrawal of such symptoms.
Scientists are confused about roaming around a very small planet.
Scientists are surprised by the fact that a massive planet like Thursday surrounds a small star called Red Dwarf, discovering a solar family 30 light years away from the Earth, thus challenging the present perception of planetary formation.
GJ3512B is an art format around its smallest nutritional star Red Dwarf, released on September 26, 2019.
Usually the stars will be bigger than the huge planets that surround them.
But in the event, researchers said Thursday that the star and the globe were not very different.
The star, GJ 3512, will be 12 of our sunset, while the climax around it will be at least half of the colossal weight of our solar household on Thursday.
Presiding over the research published in the scientific magazine, Carlos Morrells, an aeronautician at the Cadolonia Space Research Institute, Space Sciences Institute, Spain, said, Yes, this is a surprising thing.
The discovery was surprising when fewer stars, such as Earth and Small Neptunes, usually possessed small planets as models of principle.
In this, we have discovered a small star roaming around the huge gas planet Thursday," said Morales.
The planet, which was largely airborne as on Thursday, was discovered using a telescope at the Keller Altox Laboratory in Spain.
It circulates its star in its long circumnavigation path for 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and low temperatures on the surface.
GJ3512 is not only smaller than our Sun, but also about 35 bigger than Thursday, which is somewhat comparable to a massive scale.
They demonstrate less energy than the sun, and their surface temperature is slightly cooler for Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit 3,527 degrees).
That's why they're red,' Morales said.
Morales said that while the star had the source of a second planet roaming around, the third planet might have emerged from the star's family in the past, it demonstrates the length of the planet like Thursday.
The planets emerge from the same layer of gas and dust in the layers that make their rotating star.
In the beginning, a substance is produced from the solid pieces of the layer, which is called the 'Main Growth Model', which leads to an emission from the gas surrounding the vein.
An unsustainable geography model can be defined as an opposite system.
In this event, the protoplanetary layer around the young star might be slightly bigger and colder than expected, said Morales.
This makes the layer unstable, thereby producing some dense areas.
With these heaps, they can grow until they get scattered, thereby creating a planet.
In Tripura, the order issued by the High Court of Tripura prohibiting the sacrifice of goats and chickens has become a matter of great controversy.
In 1949, the state government told the court that Tripura's promise to join India was breached.
The 1355-year-old Tripura, 184 Kings, signed an agreement with India on October 15, 1949.
The Agreement was signed by the then Tripura Maharani Kanchan Prabha Devi and Governor General of India.
The main feature of the Agreement is the continuation of the financial assistance provided by the Tripura Government for traditional worship of 14 temples, including the famous Tripura Sundari Temple.
It is usual to offer flocks at the Tripura Sundari temple.
The government is also providing financial assistance for this.
This should not be transformed as a key component of the Connectivity Agreement with India.
Against this, Subhas Bhatrji, a Tripura High Court judged the Hindus' minds of killing goats and chickens with the help of government funding, proceeded with a public welfare case.
The Division Bench judges Sanjay Karol and Arithum Loth, who examined the case, shrugged off the chickens at religious places in Tripura.
The court also ordered that the government should not assist in the poultry sacrifices.
The court has also issued notices to all district magistrates and police observers to respond to the matter.
The court also ordered that temples should not be sacrificed except for sheep and chickens, and CCTV cameras should be installed and monitored in all the temples.
Presently, the State Government is going to appeal to the Supreme Court against this order of the High Court of Tripura.
The State Government in the Supreme Court has stated that the Tripura High Court has rejected its plea not to breach its promise to join India in 1949.

Tele-serviceman blames Methambetamin for giving bean dip to his colleague
Medina-Hernantes from Marian County Sheriff's office has been accused of giving a co-serviceman Methambedam's tip to him.
The crimes imposed on Albani's 38-year-old Kazandra Eni Medina-Hernandes - Methambetamin's contribution and the inclusion of a prohibited substance by another person - both are B-Clause crimes.
Accusations have emerged at the Triftway Palace shop in Jefferson on September 9.
The 27-year-old colleague of the suspect told his assistants that he had seen Medina-Hernandes Bean tip when he went to the lunch for lunch, and had asked them to read something, which was possible because of the confession received by OregonLive.com.
The victim told the investigating officers that he had never dressed before and said, 'The taste of a few strings was different, but he didn't think of it.'
When the lady returned to work, she had a belly and her legs slid.
When he went to the local hospital, Albani Democratic-Herald reported that he was determined to have Methambetamin in the bean tip.
Another Triftware worker, Medina-Hernandes, said that he had told the victim that he had narcotics in his diet, while the third employee said that a suspect was wrongly placed at the bean tip and sent him a microphone.
The surveillance camera obtained from the telescope is reported to have turned back to the Medina-Hernandes camera, carrying something from her bra, following Microway and bending down.
It is said he wiped his nose and walked to a table and put a bean tip on a small paper plate.
The police said the object from his brass appeared to have been on the layer.
According to the Aragon Statesmen, Sharif's officials said there was no reason to believe that any client was supplied with unclean food.
Medina-Hernandes is held in Marian County at 52,000 Jamin.
The Smoking Conne said Felan had been convicted for his previous assault, trail, identification and theft of Methambedam, and for his possession of a blocked weapon.

State Family Secrets: Release of Surprising Guests Frequently Passing on Royal Aircraft
As part of their government's duty, the royal family should take hundreds of journeys around the world in their lifetime.
Regular simplification of this is the Royal Aircraft and a separate aircraft carried by the royal family across the globe for important events and foremost events.
Personal privileges are not surprising because of the flight alone.
It appears that the royal family can carry any guest they want - including some unexpected passengers - with the lack of fitness in the number of bags and long security queues.
According to the recently released Channel 5 Documentary, there is no ueen and Prince Philip among those travelling frequently on Royal Aircraft.
During the Rail Air Secrets programme, he said that many animals would often come as guests with ex-servicemen and family flying the ueen's plane.
Some important royal family dogs, along with our important royal family travellers, may come from time to time as travellers, said Bob Shields.
It is not surprising that the queen, known for her deep affection for the dogs of Cargyz, also invited her dear friends to travel with her.
It is said that Elizabeth Rani had loved four legends since his young age, and had more than 30 cargus dogs since the queen was hooked.
He is believed to have five cargus dogs - Mandi, Emma, Lynet, Villo and Hollly - in 2007.
They included five cockers of spaniel dogs - Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spic and Spain, and four dashand-cargy dogs - Cider, Perry, Valkan and Candy.
Employees in the Royal Aircraft will have unresolved work.
Sheelds added that before the dogs boarded the plane, the workers' household members could be seen carrying dogs to the grasshoppers and insisting on them to go.
I am glad to say that there was never an accident.
The event also showcased the shocking measure of the goods that the queen was carrying while working.
According to the address, during his 44,000 miles of Commonwealth tour in 1953, the ueen's assets reached 12 tonnes.
It is almost equal to the weight of two big elephants.
Nevertheless, the queen was not only attracted to clothes.
Cambridge Gomes reportedly had so many personal interests in carrying their modern clothes - there is a rumour that each of his clothes would be allotted a seat.
Former Alabama MP Jack Edwards died at the age of 91

Edwards stated in his family statement: "I want my children to be adopted in a developing country by adopting cultured habits, generally accepted and pursuing efforts to solve the problems of the country.
The Governor of Alabama, Kai Ivy, said that Edwards had worked with the highest honesty of his province and the country.
In his honour, he said the flags will be flagged off in a semi-flying hole in the capital of Alabama.
He is the image of a real public servant and the highest politician of Alabama.
Our state has lost one of the best politicians,' IV said in a statement.

Michel Obama's Instagram Registration Lauds Megan Market as A Provocation
In his Instagram record on Thursday, Sassex praised the princess for being a thought-provoking leader for breaking the doors and for making our world better.
The prince and Prince Harry, who are accompanying his son Archie Harrison Mountbatten and Windsor to South Africa for a State Visit, attended a youth reception this week and met with the President of the Obama Foundation.
In his reply, the wife of the former President expressed her heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Sachex Princess Sussex-royal, who is a leader of thought-provoking discontinuation of the waves, who is making our world better for this.
"Whatever our Obama meeting with trustees or what women around the world are helping them get education, Obama added, he is an inspiration for many, as well as a photograph with trustees," he added.
Megan had interviewed Obama for the British Voke magazine, while the former 'Soots' guest was an editionary.
In their open speech, the former president's wife spoke of motherhood and how it changed herself.
"It was a wonderful thing to allow," Obama said in the interview.
Mother taught me that it was my duty at times to give them a place to discover and to allow them to grow as they wish.
I do not want them to come at that age, I do not think, but who are within them.
Knowing the difficulty of being a world-wide healer, Obama gave the prince some suggestions in an interview on household care.
You may feel the pressure that you feel within you and from others at times, he added.
Therefore, my big suggestion is that take some time and do not urgently urgently do anything.
In the first few months of the White House, I was most of the time worried about my daughters getting a special start in the school and ensuring that they get new friends.
I believe that it was right and good too.

Engineer Punyaraj, Mary, Aruna, Preeti, Rasheetha, Sophia, Joyal, Kalaikelvi, Ezhilvargan and Arivuboni spoke.
It is very important to remember Periyar, who is known as Periyar World, even though he lives across the continent and thanks to his father Periyar.
Ruby Manokaran from Nagerhole was announced as the candidate of the DMK-Congress alliance in the by-elections to be held in Nanguneri assembly constituency in Tamil Nadu.
In this context, H Vasanthkumar, Kanyakumari Lok Sabha MP, arrived in Tuticorin today to launch a campaign in the neighbouring areas of Nanguneri assembly constituency.
Continuing to meet reporters at the airport, he said, "Many DMK and Congress volunteers have expressed their desire to compete in the Nanguneri constituency.
Some had even said that they would file their nomination independently.
They might have said it in an interesting manner.
However, no one will stand alone and compete.
Everyone will work together.
The Central Government cannot accomplish any scheme under Sagarmala project in Kanyakumari district.
Environment and Natural Resources should be preserved in Kumari district, the smallest district in the area.
Therefore, it is impossible to build a new port inside the sea in Kumari.'
Despite complaints related to behaviour , Trump Hotel has a liquor license .
The Washington Drump International Board rejected the demand for a revision of its liquor licence due to the behaviour of the owner of Washington (AP) - the local trump international hotel.
The organisation dismissed the complaint on Wednesday, as a majority of three ministers, two concluding judges and two Rabis lived in the province or had no property in the province.
This is the second time the Washington Post claims that the complainants are demanding the cancellation of the hotel's liquor licence under the provincial legislation that the applicants must be 'good conduct'.
Referring to the charges of the attack and the fraudulent methods, President Donald Trump said that he violated the law in the initial version of last summer.
The licence was already granted, so it was disqualified.
The second complaint was filed after the licence was renewed.
The seats for NRIs which are not filled up in private medical colleges in Tamil Nadu are not filled up by 207 seats, which are being distributed to the respective colleges as administrative allocation spaces.
Diran from Coimbatore had filed a case in the Chennai High Court through a formal consultation.
The case came again to the hearing at a session comprising judges Kribakaran and Vel Murugan.
The lawyer appearing for the Indian Medical Council said, 'After the third schedule, if there are vacancies, a list of 10 students will be sent to one place.
But I don't know if it was filled on the basis of that list.'
Subsequently, the Government of Tamil Nadu has issued a suitable order regarding filling of allotment seats for NRIs.
The lawyer appearing on the petitioner's side alleged that '207 locations have been sold to those with low marks for a higher amount.'
There is a report that the corrupt Cleveland police have been branded as bad.
The corrupt police have been branded by the analysts as the bad police in Britain.
A report estimated that the Cleveland police were incapable of all matters.
Analyst Fil Komle of HM-in Constable said that the Cleveland Police is particularly deteriorating.
New appeals are now being made to dissolve the force, which has seen five chief guards in six years.
The report says it fails in attempts to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect victims.
There is a significant deterioration after our previous study," said Fil Komle, a HM-in Constable analyst.
Chief Guard Mike Wheel left in January in response to his 'sharp' but unpublished charges of conduct.
Assistant Chief Guard Adrian Roberts was sacked following the arrest on suspicion of the worst behavior.
Last year, deputy analyst Simon Harwood appeared before the committee for wrong behaviour for preparing for sexual intercourse.
He left the army.
Ben Hochen, Tory Mayor of Des Valley, commented: 'This is an official proof of the dissolution of this force.
Now it's time for the Home Ministry to intervene.'
Principal Guardian Richard Louis said, Progress has been made and I am fully responsible for guiding change.
Nancy Pelosi: William Bar has become a 'Pokkiri' and inquiries should be conducted without interruption.
You never know where we're going next.
I think we are now engaged in covering up the cover-up, and it may take some time to investigate," said Pelosi in an interview with CNN on Capital Hill.
They will follow the truths and the time to discover that truth, but they will do the work they are doing, he added.
This week's White House copied a letter to Ukraine President Volodimir Selensky asking him to examine a 2020 candidate and Fiden's son.
The telephone copies of the telephone call told Selenski that Bar and his personal attorney Rudy Guliani had requested him to act in this regard.
Trump denied that he had done nothing wrong with the system.
CNN reported Thursday that the Justice Department was the first to warn the National Defence Prosecutors of his complaint, which issued a secret report on the nature of the trump on Ukraine just a week before formally recommending.
After receiving the complaint as a recommendation from intelligence agencies, the judiciary decided that campaign funds were not required to be criminally investigated for Trump's phone call.
When asked if the bar should be testified, Pelosi said on Friday that the intelligence committee would decide on whom to call as a witness.
He further said that he believes that look has become foolproof.
He has been like that for a long time now.
Pelosi noted that Drump had spoken about his attorney general at the invitation of the Ukraine chief in July and said that because of this, he had mentioned all these things.
He is keen to take the decisions regarding how the complaint will be handled.
Pelosi said he was very concerned about the information of the secret man, who attacked them as spies on Thursday, saying that the spies were treated differently at that time.
The President said that it was a breach of responsibility, and I think it was dangerous.
In showing the mistakes in our government - those who reveal secrets have an important role to play, he said, "This statement made by the President about those who may have given information to the secret makes the honesty of the government gravely suspicious."
On Tuesday, Pelosi made a historical attempt to declare a formal deposition inquiry into allegations that he sought to pressure a foreign leader for political profit.
The telephone call was inserted in a complaint issued to the public on Thursday, a man who secretly accused Trump of misusing his authority in the 2020 elections.
He accused the White House attorneys of secretly sending copies of telephone calls to officials in cabinet status from a computer that stores them and places them in a private forum for secret information.
Christian Pentagon: Crystal Palace Strikeer faces a drift hurdle due to the speed.
Fremier League, popularly known as Christian Pentech, has been able to drive two times in two months.
On January 20, the 28-year-old Christal Balls Striker admitted that he had gone to his Pentley at 80pm at 50pm at A3 in Richmand, Southwest London.
He joined the country of Belgium and then in March, at Patna in Southwest London, at a speed of more than double speed of 40 miles and at a speed of 89 miles, it was recorded in the Speed Surveillance Camera.
Sirray, Bentech from Kingston, did not visit the Lavender Hill Criminal Court this morning.
He acknowledged the two offences at the beginning of July, under a single judicial procedure that the judge would judge minor offences separately.
Ghana: Kofi Manu expresses concern over the organisation of the committee.
Mr. Kofi Manu, a Football Administrator and SCONDY Hazakas Officer, expressed concern over the forthcoming Ghana Football Association (GFA) poll schedule.
The chairman of the committee, Mr. Frank Daves, questioned the inclusion and said he was not happy that the inclusion was made.
In an interview with the GNA Sport, he said that he suspects that the chairman of the committee will be justified as the results of the review process may benefit him.
The research team must have neutral individuals from outside without contact with any member and must be unprofitable.
For instance, Mr. Davies was signed as a lawyer for writing to Osai Vagu Paulmar over the fee of 10 percent.
He is a well-known Olympic supporter.
Because of his gains, he should not be allowed to continue in the study committee for these two reasons, he added.
Mr. Manu, a director of the Olympics, told Mr. Fred Bopo that if he appeared before the team, he would be unwilling because of the contact with the club and suggested that if Mr. Palmer appeared before the committee, there would be discrimination and discrimination.
After assuming office at a function held at the GFA Secretariat in Agra on Thursday, 19th September, the members of the committee are expected to commence their first work yesterday and conclude on October 4.
The Committee will be headed by Mr. Frank Davis, Corporate Adviser and Legislator Ms. Marian Barner and Imanuel Dharwa.
Reginald Laurya, and Shri Richard Apokevi, Sports Administrator and Lawmaker will be among the other members.
While Rupa Gurunath was elected president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, it is said that the son of former DMK minister Ponny's son had also tried for that post.
Various reforms are being carried out in the Cricket Board of India and State Cricket Associations as per the recommendation of the Lota Committee.
The recommendations of the Lota Committee include that one of the cricket associations cannot continue in office for more than two times and those above 70 years cannot come to power.
Accordingly, those already in office in the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association were unable to come to power.
There was an ecosystem for selection of new ones.
Ashok Sikamani, son of former DMK minister Ponmudi, reportedly moved vegetarians to take over as president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, but it was reported that India had defeated the effort by cements Srinivasan.
Asok Sigamani took over as vice president without any other means.
He is the younger son of Ponny, who runs the Children's Welfare Hospital in KK Nagar.
Ashok Sikamani has been keen on cricket since schooling.
At one point he tried to be part of the Indian team.
Currently, Indian Cements Srinivasan is the reason for selection of Chairpersons and Administrators for the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association.
If it had been a contest, Ashok Sikhamani Srinivasan's daughter would have given a duff to Rupa to take over as president.
He was calm after Srinivasan had spoken of peace that Ashok Sikhamani would be the vice president of the Tamilnadu Cricket Association.
A case has been filed against the Tamil archaeological department of Tamil Nadu for handing over the Tamil archaeological courses to Mysore.
The Chennai High Court on Wednesday ordered Madurai to reply to the Central Litigation Department regarding the steps taken for preservation and renewal of archaeological symbols from 27 Tamilnadu films.
Mani Maran from Madurai filed the petition: Industrial Department is under the control of Central Archaeological Department at Mysore, Thiruvananthapuram.
Ancient rockets and historical aspirations of India are being preserved there.
The inner syllabus of the Tamil version is a source of scientific confirmation of the history of Tamils.
Further, the text of the text of Tamilnadu texts (ink coffee) has been documented.
Thus, when the office of the Electronics Department in Mysore was shifted from the old building to the new building, most of the old Tamil versions were damaged.
The e-professional scripts and historical documents should be properly preserved and published as books.
But the Tamilnadu documentations that had been veiled in Mysore were not properly preserved.
Thus, the history and heritage of Tamils remain unaware of the future generations.
Thus, Mysore has asked for the direction of handing over the courses of Tamil works to the Tholley Line Department of Tamil Nadu.
On Wednesday, Visa came to Rani to attend the session comprising Sivagyanam and R Tarani.
At that time, the judges postponed the case on October 22, after ordering the Central Legal Department to respond to the renewed activities and to protect the daughters and ancient symbols from Tamilnadu.
Urges Diversity to Competition Against Australia
Justin Turkey says, "It's time to show talent in the fight against the Australian team that determines the fate of the Wales team in the world.
The victory against the Australian march will make them the most prospective wear in the T-B, asserting the possibility of emptiness with France or Argentina.
But if the Australian team wins the Wales team for the 14th time in their last 15 meetings, it will push Turkey and the ranks into a collision with the UK team for the last eight seats.
"There is nothing hidden in this, the two teams will win and try to take the first position in the unit," said the Wales team para-serviceman Tipurich.
In the past, some decisions were difficult, but in the past autumn a victory against them (Australia) was sweet.
I think they will be seriously thinking of winning us again, while at the same time we want to ensure another victory.
We know that this is going to be an important competition before coming here.
Now we have come here and it is time to actually show talent.
The Wales team has won only one victory against Australia, New ealand or South African contingents in world cup history, winning Australians at the Third World Cup 32 years ago.
Overall, under Chief Trainee Warren Gateland, only 7 out of 41 attempts have been made against three southern heroes.
Wales blocked a series of defeats against Australia last November in the 13-test contest, one of the many who participated in the Tokyo Stadium on Sunday, which survived the 9-6 victory.
Asked whether there was a mental obstacle before that victory, it is difficult to say that, he added.
Those competitions were very difficult, perhaps... people might think there was some kind of obstacle, I don't know.
We left nearly 15 points in the last contest, so when we look at the points, it looks more difficult than actually.
To win Wales, the Tiruch struggle with Australia's renowned twins, Michael Hooper and David Bocca, will be vital.
He knows exactly what is going to happen because of the 67-time dancing of Tipurich, who has opposed these two soldiers in the previous competitions.
These seven are totally global heroes, he added.
You are always aware that competition will be difficult when it comes to collision with global rankings.
Both of them continue to be the best in the world.
You are aware of the kind of competition you are going to face.
One of the best heroes in the world to save the bunker is Bokak and Michael, a slightly assaulted drummer, who has the knowledge of Ragbi at the right place at the right time.
You have to challenge yourself by fighting with the best soldiers in the world rather than fighting with the batsmen who do not play properly.
You would like to play against the best of the brave, and when you play against these two soldiers you should be extremely stunned.
I can't say that Sunday's competition is the final, but it's an important competition for us in this world cup.
The momentum of the team is an important part of it.
It will be difficult for you to conquer if you continue to play and perform well.
Seawater Level Increased Danger to Submerge in Chennai Sea
The Central Government Committee on Climate Change (CBCC) has warned that four Indian coastal towns Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Chennai are at risk of submergence.
The IBCC has released a Survey on Climate Change of INDIA.
It will melt rapidly at the end of this century and enhance the ocean water supply.
It is likely to cause severe sea submergence in four cities Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Chennai.
At the same time, many parts of North India will face severe water shortage.
The sea level is growing faster than before.
This will affect the world's 1. 4 billion people in 2100 years.
At the Indian level, there are not only 4 coastal cities but also 45 port cities worldwide, upto 50 cm above sea level, and there is a danger of floods.
With this risk increasing every year, nails and small islands on the low coastline are in serious danger.
Moreover, without urgent action to mitigate global warming, sea heat will increase and marine lifestyle destruction.
Ocean food will disappear worldwide.
Cyclone Symbols are also expected to grow in a big way.
The sea temperature has doubled from 1982 to 2016.
Thus, the Survey points out.
Esteinters Spylers: Ben kisses Kallam after Witten's shock
Tensions between Calam Hyve (Tony Glay) and Ben Midchelle will once again explode in Estenters, as the shock by Witney Dean throws away the vacuum and returns to his lover.
But would they both be distressed about their relationship or an angry situation
Since Ben helped save Pen's life, he and Ben were gradually handling matters, although he helped save Ben's life, he recently told Ben that he was sweet enough to see his weak and soft side.
Tonight, Witney returns from a very spectacular vacation rather than when he left.
It is obvious that Waford's departure from Waford following his tragic marriage and the man who is going to be his husband had deceived him.
When he comes home, his mind joins footsteps.
But very soon, a fact he reveals deteriorates the innermost evil.
J. Mitchell (Jami Parthwick) is concerned about his resumption of uin Wick Pope due to bad behaviour.
After being drunk and emotional, Callam goes to Penn and blames him for everything he has done.
Ben calms down, accepts and comforts his callous anger, and kisses him long ago, turns Kallam's despair into an uncontrollable emotion.
But then what will they go towards
The pair will try to go to the titting next week, but Ben's intense thinking about its previous relationships is a threat to destruct all that the hero is trying to do.
But after demonstrating to his father, he is determined to fight for something he wants and he has a new self-confidence.
The kiss is scheduled to take place at the BBC on September 27 at 8.30.
'Full fear' is the difficulty of the White House to find out what the deposition stands at.
White House officials are desperate to decide on Thursday how to counter the renewed efforts of the Democrats for a seizure, explaining the situation in the past week that there is no solution to the new problem.
A person close to the White House said that the accusations of the secretariat could seriously affect the president and his surroundings, so it looks like an increase in 'criminal, inconvenience and anxiety' in the West.
There is an unbelievable situation, he added.
As the White House officials are undefinitely unaware of what to do, there is no open plan for the situation, but because the usual methods used by the chancellor in the past to avoid disputes are of no use: 'It doesn't seem like a thing to disappear when the next news comes.'
Another person who came to know about the suggestions said that the White House has been stunned and the chances of going to an uncontrollable position are increasingly anguishing if the President retaliates in the wake of the seizure.
While the pressure on the chancellor is expected to increase every day during the detention hearing, he will be more emotional and others around the chancellor expressed the same concern.
It provokes concern that Trump's behaviour could become more unpredictable and unexpectedly counteractive - both in the election year as well as in the president and politics.
Confronted with an unprecedented threat to his presidency, Robert Muller has revived his strategies that he was capable of exploring Russia and turned himself from the drumstyle offensive.
He turned his attention to the activities of the Democrats and presidential candidate Joe Pidene and sought to discredit his demand for helping the Ukrainian president investigate his political opponents through a conservative denial of confidence.
But as many in the White House have experienced Muller's intelligence, aiders and advisers said that this time it has started to feel differently.
As the name of the President is considered to be strong, one told a press conference on Wednesday that he had made a foolproof look.
Happy with Russian intelligence questions, they said that Drump appeared to be inconsistent with answering questions about Ukraine.
Some people seized upon the fact that the secret publisher was not directly aware of the problematic telephone calls between Drump and Ukraine President Volodimir Selenski - arguing that this would reduce his credibility, some of the president's allies believe that the damage could be reduced.
Moreover, the fact that the chancellor is under siege, as often happens, provokes his faithful to defend him.
A negotiator close to the White House, however, said that the president's basic recognition points were already far above and that new recognition would not be easily available for the dismissal.
"There is no use in focusing on the President's departure in the next four months, particularly if it breaks his legislative programmes and becomes a headline.
Those arguing that the seizure could help the chancellor are not fully aware of how his response would be.
Concerned White House officials have been looking for advisors to help in retaliation for the posting.
While efforts are still in the initial stages, the person said that the effort like the war room is either lucrative or clearer about the form in which it is.
The individual said that there was a clear endorsement of the need for coordinated legislative and information strategies to counter the public support against the publication of the covert report and the publication of the report, in response to the pace of the Democrats' seizure efforts.
As Foreign Minister Mike Bombio and Finance Minister Steve Nuchin noted that they would not issue a reference to Trump's call to the Ukraine President - after 48 hours there was no other way than to release the document, said one who knew that the long-term perspective was blatant.
Robert Muller, who only spoke through his accusations, is expected to be more pressure now than during the trial of Miller, a man who is expected to be involved in creating a response to the seizure, known as Tromp's Bull and former campaign manager Core Levantosky.
But for such an attempt, Levandosky told News that it was not true that he was presiding over.
I have done everything I could to do for the last five years to support the officer and his plans, but I have not consulted the President about joining a team to oppose the forgery attempt, he said.
J. Sekulo, who is Tromp's foreign lawyer from Mullah's trial, is also unconnected with the seizure efforts.
When NPC News spoke about his remarks, Czechlo said, We will deal with sufficient issues.
As Mullah, who worked during the Clinton seizure and until the end of the trial, guided by Emmad Flot, the White House's current legal adviser has no such experience, the lawyer who has experienced the seizure hearing is not present in the White House.
A person familiar with the White House's strategy said that there was no one near the level of integrating all or building wartime rooms - but he acknowledged that the integrated, universal response and the need to carry forward the political struggle.
Department of Personnel, Public Grievances Pensions (DPG) has issued a Weather Report this morning.
Rainfall at most places with heavy to very heavy falls at isolated places very likely over north coastal areas of the country.
Rainfall at 75 Million Metric Tonnes (MMT) is likely to be recorded at some places in Sabragamuwa, Central and Hypothecation.
In the eastern province, it is likely to receive some rainfall in the morning beyond the coastline.
89 Million Renewals of Royal Caribbean Esplorer of the Cheese Vessel
Explorer of the Seas, a part of the Royal Karibian International Family, is scheduled to visit Buddha this summer with a new look.
After blind renewal of 110 million (89 million), the vessel has enjoyed worldwide food production and family fun.
This summer, the Explorer Ship stands at some of the finest ports in Italy and Greece, and the Mediterranean Sea gives Europe the taste.
However, once the adventures on the ground are over, it guarantees a memorable experience in the sea.
This explorer's new  110m or nearly 89,00,000 restructuring has transformed the ship into one of the best ways to get out with the family.
Internal technologies, with the help of a modern surf stimulator, can be seen on the ship either on the Internet or on the outside theatre, enjoying the weather and making a family-friendly film.
However, the most modern feature of all these compositions is the combination of the Bodyguard, which provides an opportunity to visit the ocean visuals as inside the inner rooms.
For those who want to be in water, the swimming pool with imagination has the fun of sports with the features of the Caribbean Retirement Hostel.
The island-style gates and day-beds around allow the swimming pool to rest in the sunlight while there are two modern waterfalls for the adventure lovers in the ship.
Applicable to all age groups, the vessel has a wide range of operations to spend time on board.
The adventure ocean for children provides an opportunity to remember young people from the family, while a separate place for the fifteen has a designed sports and musical section designed for over 12 years.
If that is not enough, the entire family can participate in the ship's Studio B with God in the dark laser memo, which is also used as a ring of snow.
While travelling to the Mediterranean, the guests have the opportunity to discover tasty foods across the globe through the vast diversity of the vessel.
Recent Asian food varieties are available in the ship's Ilsumi restaurants, and Giovanni's Buddhist Buddhist eating traditional Italian meals in New Italy Kichen will enable us to obtain a surplus meal in the ordinary system.
Other shipyards will include Saps Crill American Steakhouse, Poleros Latin Bar, Schunner Bar and Jani Rockets Express.
The ship is scheduled to commence from Rome in May 2020 with selections of 7-9 Night Travel.
As the second European ship of the Royal Caribbean, it will join the Alwar of the Cheese, which has recently changed its mouthpiece.
In preparation of 58 days, after the huge amount of 165 million was spent, pre-registered guests were given bonuses to spend 300 in the ship.
The fourth vessel, the Explorer of the Cheese, has been replaced by a volume of modernization of the Royal Amplified Vessels.
The project, which has invested more than 1 billion in 10 ships over four years, has every aspect of the guest experience and provides diverse adventures and foods and night life experiences with a variety of unlimited features.
Devin News blames Democrats for asking for 'Nirvana Films of Trump'
It is obvious that President Donald Trump's interrogation was not over by Congressman David News (R-Calif).
On Thursday, he accused the Democrats of attempting to get the president's naked pictures to defend him.
News, chairman of the congressional Intelligence Committee, made the charge in the preliminary report of accusations made by Joe Piten, the Democratic presidential candidate and his son, who secretly accused him of trembling Ukraine's help to investigate.
Previously the Democrats wanted to see the President's naked photographs, he said the Ukraine fraud was a "fraud image" created by the left and their "made assets.
"The Democrats in this group held talks with those who thought they were from Ukraine to get the naked pictures of Trump," News said.
People can justify why they are determined to dismiss the chancellor in one year.
After News concluded his speech, HalfPost's senior political correspondent, Jennifer Pentry, decided to find out whether Democratic politicians wanted to know the matter in depth.
So far, only Connecticut representative Jim Hymes (D) has responded, but we are suspected that many of his colleagues will believe that his word is true.
Mediaite.com skeptically suggests that News refers to the comments on dressing and unsubstantiated additional details found in the controversial steel documents.
It is a compilation of charges against the former British spy, Christopher Steel, which he claims in a hotel room in Moscow that it is possible to have 'sex workers' involved in 'water sprinkling'.
There has been a stir since the statement made by Rajendran, Chief Minister of the Deni Medical College, to the CPCID police from the vote of Udith Surya, a student who has been arrested for fraud in the NEET examination.
Dr. Venkatesan belongs to Dandiarpet in Chennai.
He is a doctor at Stanley Hospital in Chennai.
A complaint arose that his son Udit Suryah had acted in the NEET exams and made a fraud.
CPCID police arrested Udith Surya and his father, Dr. Venkatesan.
The investigation revealed that Udith's father Venkatesan paid Rs 20 lakhs and made a selection for another student and fraudulently admitted his son to the medical college.
After this, Udith Surya and his father appeared in court and were imprisoned.
In this case, the CPCID police conducted an investigation with Rajendran, the Chief Minister of the Government Medical College, Deni regarding the NEET examination.
There is a difference between his explanation and his confession to the CPCID police.
This was stated by the Chief Minister of Theni Medical College Rajendran in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
It is reportedly on the basis of which the student was recruited.
It was stated by the Chief Minister of the College that NEET has participated in the enrolment and admission of students and Udith Surya has participated only in the admission in the classroom.
Udith Surya, however, said that he had himself participated directly in the polling and student enrollment.
How did Udith Surya get into the college with a holticket with a photo of a man who has done a romantic job
Why did you fail to look into consultation and student admission
uestions are raised.
It is now revealed in the investigation that Udith Surya, a student, has given his photo-cum-book self-subscribed list at the Medical College.
The photographs and the pictures in the hall ticket are different.
The confession made by the student, Udith Surya and the confession made to the Chief Minister of the State Medical College, Rajendran, CBCID officials is different.
The CBCID police have therefore started investigations with top officials.
Only after the results are released will the memories be removed.
Who knows who's connected.
Sarath Pawar said that he would appear before the enforcement department in the Cooperative Bank abuse case tomorrow and said he would not bow to the Central Government.
Government Treasury suffered a loss of Rs. 25,000 crore due to mischief in the cooperative bank of Maharashtra in 2007.
The loss is reported to have been caused due to lending to sugar mills and hundreds of mills in violation of the Rules.
Last month, Mumbai police had filed a case against senior nationalist Congress leader, former deputy chief minister-minister Ajith Pawar and 70 people on the order of the Mumbai High Court.
This includes political leaders, former executives and officials of the cooperative bank.
In a sudden turn in the case, the enforcement authorities have filed a case against Ajith Pawar and Nationalist Congress leader Sarath Pawar, based on the case filed by the police.
Sarath Pawar was a former Chief Minister of Maratiya and a Congress-led government minister in the middle.
In the wake of the elections to the Marathi legislature on 21st October, the enforcement sector has created a stir.
In this context, Sarath Pawar, the nationalist Congress leader in Mumbai, gave an interview to reporters.
Thanks to the enforcement department for joining me in this case even though I am not a member of the concerned cooperative bank or a decision making company.
I don't have to be surprised at this action.
I am mostly out of Mumbai for the legislative election campaign.
Therefore, the Implementation Department should not misunderstand me that I am a hiding person.
I am going to the Implementation Office on Friday (Tomorrow).
And I will provide them with the information they want.
It is their right to investigate the case.
I believe in the constitution.
Therefore, I will extend full cooperation to the investigation.
Marathiam follows the ideology of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
We don't know how to bow before the Delhi High Court.
Marathi chief minister Devendra Patnavis has denied accusations of political involvement in the matter.
In this context, he said:
The court had directed the police to prosecute the case and the enforcement department would investigate the case in case of a fraud of up to Rs 100 crore.
The case has been taken up by the Implementation Department in this regard.
It is wrong to say that this action has been taken for political reasons.
Renewable feasible biofuel research can help reduce smoking publications
In recent years, electric cars and desla semi-trekkers have been switched over to headlines, it looks like flying away from the renewable energy boundaries:
However, a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that will pave the way for renewable biofuels to be used as air fuels.
Dr. David Fresler, a professor of agricultural, life and environmental sciences at Alberta University, started the project in 2003.
His laboratory is developing hydrocarbon fuels from liquid wastes such as food oil, animal residue and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology will enable the use of quality oil in its production, which will reduce carbon emissions by about 85 per cent rather than petrol based fuels and allow waste from other factories to be used during this process.
This technology is being used to replicate hydrocarbons in petroleum based fuels.
Our technology in the first generation is creating the same hydrocarbons in diesel casulin, said Fresler.
This provides a new dimension to the use of biofuels, where previously developed biofuel technologies lose stability in low temperatures, which creates a serious problem for a highly flying plane.
The problem of aviation fuel is like a GATH-2 problem that cannot be avoided, said Fresler.
In fact, its value is less than diesel, but it needs more.
The laboratory of Brussels is now focusing on two choices to produce biofuels for the aircraft.
In the first decade, their hydrocarbons are a less risky approach to refine biofuels and intercept hydrogen.
The second choice is to stabilize fuel even in low temperatures and continue working on a partially-made lexicon.
In the second choice, Fresler said, We can play some games with our reactor chemistry.
There's more danger.
Forge Hydrocarbons, a sub-producer at Alberta University, is working commercially for renewable selection, both by airlines and by Canada and the US military.
He said someone expects to impose carbon tax on them in future.
They are expecting an alternative.
Forge is currently operating a testing plant near Edmondon's Waste Management Center and recently received US4 million investment from Lockheed Martin to help build a 25 million manufacturing plant in Sompra, Undario.
The plant is expected to produce 19 million litres of biofuel every year.
Though the carbon dioxide is proposed to be reduced by 85 percent, Bresler notes that fuel transportation and manufacturing are the reasons for the lack of carbon dioxide.
As a technology driven person,
Fresler said the choices were to be made and the choices were to create a variety of opportunities.
The High Court yesterday decided to examine the basic litigation petition filed by Seku Shihafdeen Mohammad Shabi, a physician for maternity and female illness at Kurunakal Pothana Hospital.
The petition will be accepted by the High Court on January 24.
It is to be noted that Dr. Shabi has filed a basic human rights petition challenging the criminal investigations that had been arrested and detained under various charges including illegal contraception surgeries, irregular collection of funds, etc.
In the midst of the Prime Minister's appeal for peace, Prime Minister Johnson's allies are calling for peace following a warning that Britain could face disturbances such as Los Angeles, if the fracture was withdrawn.
A senior Cabinet Minister said last night that the actual decision to change the second referendum is likely to cause a serious and mass uprising in the country.
The prime minister's senior coalition parties warned that the UK was confronted with internal unrest at home in the scale of the French yellow-shirt protests over economic inequalities and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Shri Janson stressed on the need to mitigate anger in the political language about the irritating conflict but I will not stop using the word "change".
Despite his appeal for peace, a cabinet minister told Times: 'We have never seen the Glass Johns [yellow shirt] struggle in this country or the Los Angeles riots [in 1992].
People didn't think that this was possible in this country because it didn't happen before.
Now they have a model of the yellow shirt struggle and modern telephones to coordinate it, and only two prominent leaders are required to inspire people.
In 1992, a riot broke out in Los Angeles following the release of four white police officers in the case of black auto driver Rotney King.
Earlier this year, the streets of Paris were catastrophic and devastated by French revolutionaries against the well-eyed yellow shirts - the government worn by Claude Johns.
Mr. Janson cautioned that if Britain fails to withdraw from the EU, the hopes of our political establishment will be greatly enhanced.
If 66 of us say that 30 million people might have joined the referendum, 10 million people are still unsatisfactory, the Minister said.
Though 99 percent of them neglected, another 100,000 are really angry, they write to their parliamentarians and prevent them.
There is no greater need than that, and thousands of people will soon be on the streets.
The second referendum on the outcome of the first referendum will pose a serious and people-to-people uprising in the country.
Mr. Johnson called for a general election to resolve the fractured issue.
He is reportedly confronted with the insurgency of ministers to cut its frequent demands and replace it with a compromise agreement with the European Union.
Life sentence for his brother who murdered Pakistan's social media figure Gaurav
Female litigants say that justice is not largely denounced, and the procedures are sometimes framed, and the accused killers are released on bail and the cases are suppressed.
Farzan Perry, a woman rights fighter and founder of Pakistan's first gender research department at a university, said, It took three years to find a solution even in the most important Baloch case.
While rights groups say it is difficult to establish credible data, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has faced at least 300 cases of horrific killings in 2018.
According to a number of lawyers, the real figure will be higher as the pride-based violence awareness network estimates that one fifth of the world's 5,000 honoured killings will take place in Pakistan every year.
Sustainable Monsoons have caused flooding and confusion in many parts of India
India's monsoon season has increased by nearly a month and this unprecedented rainfall has resulted in loss of lives due to falling buildings and many crops have started rotting.
Normally, monsoon depression in North India will start in early September, but the average rainfall this month is 37 more than usual.
Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) reports that if the same situation continues in the remaining few days, this will be the lowest rainfall in the last few decades.
Rainfall is still unprecedented in many parts of the country, which is the western town of Pune in India, where unprecedented rains on Wednesday and Thursday have caused many deaths and devastation due to collapse of buildings.
There was a flood in the houses and people walked on the streets in large quantities of water, and usually such scenes are seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Rainfall at most places with heavy falls at isolated places very likely over Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad.
Continuous rains have caused severe damage to households in the north of Uttarakhand.
This monsoon has started in a time bound manner.
In many places, there was a shortage of water, and farmers were prepared to look forward to drought.
Thus, the farmers do not want to continue the monsoon.
During this period of the year it is not usual to shower so much rains.
Prakash Mehra, a small farmer from Bhimtal in Uttarakhand, said, It is polluting my vegetables - Cauliflower, Beans, Potato and Tomato.
Starting late and continuing monsoon has resulted in rising prices for consumers and the prices of onion which is an essential commodity in Indian food have risen.
Usually, one kilogram (23 pounds) is sold for 80 rupees (approx. 1) in cities like Onion, Delhi and Mumbai.
Festivals are also at risk.
The next big festival, Dussehra, is scheduled to arrive on October 8, when the Hindus will set up the atrocity of Ramayana, who laughs brutally with a big moustache.
Burning night marks the victory of good against evil.
But if these atrocities are being evacuated, and if the monsoon continues, the night may win.
What kind of situation would it be if a government hospital uses various facilities such as a bus stop, a free truck stop, a public house and a public meeting of political parties
It is in the state of Uttankarai Government Hospital in the district of Chitrakoot.
It is an important government hospital for treatment of 1000 to 1200 patients per day.
There should not be too much noise in the surroundings of the hospitals, nor should there be any regulations to be followed in hospitals where there is no defect.
Unfortunately, the surrounding people don't follow any of these things.
Public and private buses are being halted before the entrance to the hospital.
Though the bus stop is near the hospital, the entrance gate is already closed.
The sound of the speeches is sounding.
Bus drivers call out for a deficit.
Private ambulances have also asylum at the entrance of the state hospital.
This leads to the congestion of the vehicle at any time before the hospital.
Shri R P Udayakumar, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Revenue and Disaster Management said that Tamil Nadu is on the verge of combating North East Monsoon.
Shri R P Udayakumar addressed a press conference to attend various events in Trichy.
Southwest Monsoon Rainfall (SWM) is expected to take place in other states except Tamil Nadu.
The North Eastern Monsoon will continue for three months starting from October in Tamil Nadu.
It is very likely to cross the coast in the wake of the low depression prevailing over the sea during the rainy season.
Tamil Nadu is poised to face the north-eastern monsoon in the near future due to the cyclone effects of the past.
4,393 locations are at risk of being damaged.
5 feet of water conservation has been brought on the most dangerous list.
Thunderstorm accompanied with squall likely at isolated places over the State.
121 Centres of Excellence have been set up to protect the population of these districts.
Besides, in other districts, marital halls, schools and community halls have been advised to be kept ready.
1,148 crore has been earmarked for rescue operations.
State Disaster Response Forces are also ready in these districts.
Due to the precautionary measures of the Government of Tamil Nadu, no fisherman died during the Gaja cyclone.
On the contrary, the wall collapsed and electric casualties occurred.
Adequate precautionary measures have been taken to prevent such casualties this year.
Rehabilitation and restructuring are continuing to provide relief without being confined to rescue operations.
10 lakh people who have lost their homes in the districts of Thiruvananthapuram, Thanjavur, Tirunelveli and Tirunelveli affected by the Gaja cyclone.
This was stated by Shri Udaya Kumar, Minister of State (Independent Charge).
The Kurukshetra Temple pond is filled with water because of the heavy rains of some days in Tirupati.
There is a Saravana lying pool in the mountainous stairs leading to the Tirthani Murugan Mountain Temple.
The devotees will take a holy dip in the plains and walk through the mountains and follow the original.
Besides, the audio curriculum is being organised every year for three days.
Thus, water was brought by tractors on behalf of temple management, volunteers and devotees due to lack of water in Trikutham during the audience function held last month.
Then, the Tepe Festival took place.
In this context, due to heavy rains in the city of Tutruni, water is being filled in the entire Saravana Phoyag lake and now surplus water is coming out.
Four years later, Trikulam is now full.
District Collector Pa P. Ponnaiah has said that by selecting the fast-growing Delapia fishes, farmers can make a lot of profit.
In a press release, he said:
Farmers fishing in farm huts select the genetically enhanced Delapia fish so that they can grow faster than other fishes and get more profit.
In comparison to other fish, Delapia fish can be harvested and grown in a very small area.
Disease resistance is high, which grows faster than other fishes.
Moreover, consumers are more liked by this kind of fish.
Therefore, farmers are requested to select and nurture genetically improved fish in their farm breeds.
The Delapia Fisheries are ready to sell their fish farms throughout the year in government fish farming near Kochi Dam.
They can be bought and cultivated by farmers.
The farmers who feed these fishes will have to make their fish farms a safe fence surrounding them and for some reason they will not be able to spread to nearby water bodies.
Fisheries should be registered at the development camp in Kancheepuram district and fisheries should be cultivated in their farms only after that.
Further details can be obtained from the office of Assistant Director of Fisheries (ADF) at the address of East Coast Road Neelangar in Kancheepuram district or through telephone 044-2492719.
A tripartite MoU has been signed for DNA testing of human bones found below.
The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Madurai Kamaraj University and Harvard Medical School (HMC) have signed a three-pronged MoU in collaboration with the Department of Archaeology, Tamilnadu, Madurai, Kamaraj University and Harvard Medical School, Tamil Nadu for conducting DNA testing of ancient human bones extracted from below Tamil Nadu.
Udayachandran, Principal Secretary and Commissioner, Archaeological Survey said:
A tripartite MoU will be signed in collaboration with the Department of Archaeology, Madurai Kamaraj University and David Reach Laboratory, Harvard School.
We hope that in our future analysis, we will discover more ancient human bones in Kondaik, Below and Adhikaran.
These samples will be sent to the TNA study.
This is primarily a reflection of the type of gene in the human bones excavated in Tamil Nadu.
The size of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and paralysis.
According to a new study, working with high-scale pesticides could be a cause of heart disease in the past.
This was the case with a group of Japanese Americans in Hawaii, which had been pursued for more than three decades.
Researchers found that in comparison to individuals who didn't work with pesticides, the most vulnerable persons were at 45 percent higher risk of heart disease or paralysis.
The study emphasizes the importance of using the individual protective apparatus when it comes to pesticides as a professional and documentation of pesticides due to work and the importance of controlling the risk factors of routine heart disease, said Dr. Peteris Rodricks.
He is an old medical professor at Hawaii University in Manova.
These innovations have emerged from the data obtained from more than 6,000 persons from Ohu, who participated in the Guavakini Honalulu Heart programme.
As only men from Japanese families participated, these discoveries did not apply to women and others.
Since pesticides have a long length of life, they may have adverse effects on health after many years.
The event showed maximum damage within 10 years of its existence.
"After 34 years of pursuit of those individuals, there was no link between pesticides and heart diseases," Rodricks said in a press release.
Due to the importance of other age-related factors, it is possible to hide possible linkages between pesticides and heart diseases that occur in lifetime.
Researchers discovered that there was no significant link between heart disease or paralysis involving at least one moderate amount of pesticides.
Jelanski-Trumphone Call: Borochenco's comments
Washington became politically furious this week after US Chancellor Donald Trop began sweeping measures.
Volodimir Selensky, less experience in politics, would have preferred to avoid being dragged into a political fraud.
But what we have known so far about Selensky-Trumsky has long-term implications for Selensky
At the beginning of the telephone call, Trump tells Selensky that the US is doing more to Ukraine than any other European country.
Though the White House's telephone call has no word, the German leader and other European leaders have simply spoken out without introducing concrete plans - suggests a trump on German leader Angela Merkel.
Drump does not accept 100 percent, but is considered to be problematic in response to Selensky's claim to accept 1000 percent.
Selensky added that French President Macron and Merkel did not work enough to help Ukraine.
The discussion has led politicians, particularly the opposition parties within Ukraine, to publish comments in the social media.
Ukraine's former president, Petro Frochenco, commented in Twitter that the EU's aid was 'not yet'.
Frozenko said he was grateful for the EU's assistance, including obstacles and economic aid during the 'Russian occupation' in Frozenko and other tweets.
Ukraine politician Victoria Voiceska said, 'How can we talk to Germany and France again' Others expressed concern.
Tromp, who is indirectly referring to military aid, is seeking to investigate not only Hunter's son, but also the hacked TNC server, but also two things from Selensky, indicating that Ukraine's involvement in hacking Republican emails during the 2016 election.
Whether this would prevent relations with Europe or break the ties with the French and German chancellors.
I don't want to misrepresent anyone...
Following a telephone copies, Celesky said at the UN General Assembly in New York, We thank all of us for helping us.
Celensky will meet with Russia, Germany and France leaders at the four meetings of Normandy in October.
A quiet black hole suddenly spurns and enjoys the stars passing by.
If a black hole turns into a shining atom, it is called 'Guvasar'.
Scientists have seen the sparkling of such six Guwas in the Palomar far-flung US.
Scientists are also surprised that it has taken place within six months, which must have been done for thousands of years.
In order to grow a lot of trees, they insert carbon dioxide in the air and release oxygen.
But the 'Iyos', a 'bio-reactor' device produced by the 'Highergeant Industries,' involves a multiple carbon dioxide than the carbon dioxide that covers 1 acre of trees.
Carbon dioxide involves developing into a bio-reactor like a refrigerator, a facie called 'Ella Valcaris'.

Police Closure of Illegal Marijuwana Wapping in San Capriol Valley CPS Los Angeles
El Mande (CPSLA) - Police closed an illegal marijuana neighbourhood in the San Capriol Valley on Thursday.
The police raided the warrant on suspicion of selling an illegal neck pen at around 4.37 p.m. and discovered and dismantled Peuten honey oil-enriched Ganja oil in large jackets at an office building in the 9600 block of Telstar Avenue.
LT.Christopher Cano, El Mande police, said the authorities had found a machine that used to opt for nets and cartridges.
Cano said, This is a very dangerous process.
Cano, who worked in the narcotics sector, said that there is a possibility of burning fire in the wastewater process for use in neem products.
As it is enriched, the normal energy produced in our garments will create firepower and cause an explosion, he added.
If there are many jackets and such materials, one after another, and not an ordinary fire, the layer may be completely broken into the blast.
A Hasmat group was called to the empty office to seize the illegal and risky material.
The value of the captured goods and equipment is not known immediately.
The detective experts said that they had detected illegal activity when they received an anonymous information from them.
Investigators are still attempting to find out who is behind the illegal shipping operation.
They said they believed that the place was empty, and the person who was responsible for it could have set up the office.
As the trial continues, they expressed their willingness to ensure that illegal shipping goods are not available to all, particularly in the wake of recent information on shipping.
They don't even know whether they really get what they want," said Cano.
It can be mixed with other bad chemicals.
It is very bad for our society and children, so we always warn them to stay away from these activities.
First Elizabeth lost clothes to be screened at Hampton Court Palace
It was wrapped with the finest champellet butter, wrapped with silver twigs, and embroidered in a fine baggage of plants, animals and potatoes.
It only tells Ellery Lynnn, who is responsible for garment collection in historical royal family palaces.
Hanging on the wall of a small rural Parish church that was placed 100 years ago, the grey cloth he saw could only be a garment from the first Elizabeth cupboard.
Three years after Lynn coincided with the luxurious dress used as aldar cloth in a church in Hierfortusseur, Elizabeth's discontinued dress will be screened next month at the Hampton Court Complex near the same rooms where the queen could wear it 450 years ago.
The significance of the discovery is that the 16th century garment is still the same throughout the state garment.
While there were no sword testimonies that the dress was once worn by Elizabeth ueen, the research for three years strengthens the opinion of experts that the dress would have been a part of the royal family cloth.
The price of woollen cloth is extraordinaryly extraordinary, allotted to the senior members of the royal family, and the high quality of embroidered plants and flowers, extraordinary deer and dogs, butterflies, fishermen and a bear shows the highest status of the previous owner.
During its formation, the Council may have had equal values for the Duter Mansion.
Moreover, in the late 1950s, as other women in the House increasingly compete with him, his opponents would not accept such a fair dress.
It's a big deal, so many fellow commentators came and looked at it.
They were surprised when they saw it, and when they left, they saw it always satisfying to see one of the royal family's clothes.
With the second longevity in the garment, it was recurred to dress up the altar of the dark St. Faith Church in Bakton, which was unexpectedly found.
Bakton is the home village of Blanch Bari, who served him for the long life of Elizabeth ueen, and has long been associated with the textiles sector with Beri.
Although the dress came from the post-death period in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth must have given it to the family or the Parish church in memory of the Planch before he died in 1603.
After more than 1000 hours of preservation, the altar fabric, which was spent with exquisitely soaked silk and fine harvest injections, will be screened after the most famous 'Reinpo Portrait' in the contemporary paintings of Elizabeth, showcasing his wearing of such a council, which was awarded the Hatfield House portal during the exhibition.
Liby Thomson, who presided over the defence, said, "When you work with historical dresses, the builders really have respect." Most of its defence took place in the transformed cow slabs of the Hampton Court grounds - a huge space to place some of the valuable walls of the wall.
I was deeply honoured by the earlier and the later embroidery.
I have never worked in such a rich dress.
Elizabeth's lost clothes will be screened at the Hampton Court Palace on October 12.
In the NEET exam, the incident came to light when Udith Surya, a student of the Honey Medical College.
Subsequently, he was arrested by the CPCID police with his family.
This has resulted in intensified scrutiny of students in all medical colleges.
It was at this stage that the old photograph of Jyotika and student Siva Ramachandran of PSG Medical College in Coimbatore showed a difference in the present form.
This was followed by an inquiry by the Department of Medical College.
Narayana Babu, Director of Medical College, Chennai, spoke to the press here today:
On 23rd, we received a complaint that the photographs of both the students were a little different.
We then set up a five-member inquiry committee.
We interrogated both the students and their parents.
We compare our documents with their certificates, NEET exam hall tickets and ID cards.
As a result of this study, both the students are determined not to be bogus.
Even if there is a slight difference in photographs, this kind of problem arises.
Therefore, the Health Minister has directed that the biometric process be enrolled in the students from next year.
Biometric and garage registration will be implemented in the coming days.
Details of the students concerned are open only if they register for applications, examinations and admission of students.
So no one can cheat on this.
Siva Ramachandran and Jyotika, the students who were interrogated, spoke jointly to the press.
Jyotika said, "I looked like I put a double jacket in my photo.
It was taken in school.
Now I have refined my hair.
So, it's not like that now.
They have brought me to check for this.
He said that cutting off his hair has become a problem, and there is nothing else.
Ramachandran said that the image that is now available is different from the old photograph.
I had only one photo at that time.
It's an old photo.
This led to confusion and trial.
The Pandi Plastic Association has urged Prime Minister Modi to save livelihood of millions of workers.
In a press release issued by Shankaran and Secretary V. K.
In India, plastic waste is collected and recycled in the streets and in the dustbins.
Currently, all blocked plastic products in some states across India can be recycled.
India has already recycled 60 to 70 plastic waste due to poverty and unemployment.
The remaining waste can also be used in a useful manner.
Plastic Dhar Road 2. Production of electricity 3. Petrol, Diesel manufacturing 4. Concrete stone manufacturing and plastic waste can be used in various ways.
Once used, grocery bags, which are considered vital for throwing and throwing goods, have to be made free of charge in the name of civilizational obligation to buy goods at public shops.
Plastic carriage bags in all the water bodies seem to be immense.
As the carriage bags are densely enriched, all other wastes go to the water bedside the plastic in the water bodies.
Unfortunately, plastic only floats up.
There are 40,000 plastic manufacturing units across India.
Out of this, 98 is of small and marginal nature.
There are tens of thousands of shops that buy and sell plastic goods.
There are 2,000 exporters of plastic goods.
About 50 lakh people are employed in both manufacturing and sales.
5 lakh crore and Rs. 50,000 crore has been disbursed to the Central and State Governments.
There is no environmental problem for the plastic industry, whether it is produced or used for its products.
Unfortunately, however, the environmental problem is due to lack of awareness about environmental health for the public.
Therefore, on October 2, the Prime Minister urged the staff to make announcements regarding the creation of plastic waste systematically and constructively by putting strict restrictions on any plastic product, and saving livelihoods of thousands of small and medium entrepreneurs and millions of workers dependent on them.
This was stated in the press.

Mexico hijacker causes one-third of US drugs.
In a short span of time, CBS News saw a meeting in the morning for drugs in the west of Chicago.
Brian McNide, who is under Drug Employment Administration (DEA), showed the light of day.
Approximately 800 people died in Chicago last year due to excessive consumption of drugs.
McNide said that about 90 of drugs in Chicago are from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the nemasio servates that are narrowly known as L Menchso.
Matthew Tonahawk, Principal Agent, DEA, Mexico, said that he was the first open priority of the DEA and the State Legal Enforcement Department in the USA.
The prize money for El Menchsow is up to 10 million.
He has helped find dozens of L machinery drug laboratories in the jungle.
At least one-third of the drugs that enter the US through the sea and land are responsible for Elmencho's hijacker, Jellisco, Nuyva Generasian, or CJNC.
According to the judiciary, the hijacker has kidnapped 'tonne account' Koken, Methambetamine and Herain buried in the Penton.
El Mencheso's head has been announced with a 10 million prize.
He lived in California 30 years ago, where he was arrested on drug charges and finally deported to Mexico.
That's where he started a terrible abduction.
He has enormous weapons, RBGs and 50 bulk weapons.
He had his own self-sufficient groups on his basis, said Donahag.
Since the shooting of Mexico's military helicopter and the killing of six people, El Menchso defends his empire without punishment, until this summer was overwhelmed by many.
Thousands of people have died in recent years due to the violence of smugglers.
According to Mexico government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
Mexico drugs captured in Chicago are highly poisonous and cannot be handled without a security shield.
In the laboratory, the hijackers are stamped in the Cocaine Backs.
More than one-third of them can be seen in the label of El Menchso.
"He's the reason for sending a real killer to innocent women and children," said Donhak.
Therefore, Donhak said that if a child dies, it is a great opportunity for those medicines to come out of the LMSO system.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died of drug consumption.
Union Minister Jitendra Singh has said that those who do not take pride in calling Prime Minister Modi as Indias father should not call themselves Indians.
Everyone knows that the BJP leaders have been misrepresenting Gandhi and Iron.
Just hours before the Hoodi Modi incident in Houston, USA, Union Minister Amitsha claimed that the Pakistani occupation was a cause for Kashmir.
A few days ago, many others including Pragya Tagore were praising Gandhi and praising Kotsey.
At the "Howdy Modi" event in Houston, Prime Minister Modi reiterated his support for US President Trump as President.
In return, US President Trump has praised Modi.
In his address, he said that there were strong divisions in Hindi ya, and as the father of this country, he had unified those divisions.
Usually, when Gandhiji was the father of India, it made many people shocked.
Congress senior leader Anand Sharma said, "Prime Minister Modi is using the Howdy Modi show to campaign for Trump.
This is a very wrong thing.
It is also wrong that Gandhiji's replies to him as India's father.'
Union Minister of State Jitendra Singh said, "US President Trump has praised our Prime Minister as India's father.
Some protested.
Those who do not take pride in calling Prime Minister Modi the father of India should not call themselves Indians.'
The relevance of the Bandong principles is complicated by global multilateral mechanisms.
Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Ariasinghe pointed out the relevance of the Pundung principles to the ministerial meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in New York because the global multilateral systems were complicated.
Speaking by Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Ariasinghe:
Foreign Secretary Ariasinghe underscored the relevance of the banding principles as global multilateral mechanisms were complicated.
Speaking at the Level Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in New York on September 26, 2019, in the backdrop of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary of State Ravinath Ariyasinghe underlined the compliance of the Bandong principles while the global multilateral mechanisms were in trouble.
It is a moral obligation to voice the concerns of the Southern world, particularly the developing smaller countries, as the non-aligned movement consists of 55 percent of the world's population.
Sri Lanka reaffirmed its commitment to the efforts of the Non-Aligned Movement to meet current global challenges that violate national boundaries such as conflicts, displacement, climate change and infectious diseases.
Unconventional security threats such as climate change are emerging not only as a economic and social challenge, but also as a security threat affecting societies and countries due to humanitarian disasters.
While welcoming the UN General Secretarys Climate Action Summit held at the UN Headquarters on September 23, 2019, Secretary Ariasinghe expressed deep concern over the negative impacts of climate change in island countries like Sri Lanka.
The Secretary of State expressed confidence that the COP25 in Chile would enhance efforts to counter climate change by fulfilling the obligations laid down in the Paris Agreement.
Secretary of State Aryasinghe said that Sri Lanka is at the forefront of countering all forms of racism, hatred and violent extremism and there is a need to pay attention to the new threats demonstrated by the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka.
Noting that such a global threat threat threatens the security of all nations, it is imperative that a nation cannot handle it alone, but joint efforts are necessary and called upon the Non-Aligned Movement to contribute in a constructive and coordinated manner to this global security threat.
While Sri Lanka believes in an independent society ensuring freedom of speech, the Foreign Secretary pointed out that the threat of abuse of hate speech, Internet and social media platforms should be aware.
The theme of the Ministerial Meeting was 'Sustaining the principles of sovereignty and political liberty as a means of maintaining international peace and security and fostering relations and cooperation between the countries'.
Sri Lanka is the Coordinator of the 1955 Pundang Conference and the Founder of the Non-Aligned Movement.
For the past six decades, the group has been steadily progressing, with its membership now exceeding 120 members of the United Nations, two-thirds of its membership.

In Tamil Nadu, former chief minister Jayalalithaa announced the 'Amma Cement' scheme at a very low price, aimed at improving the livelihood of the poor.
A cement of 190 rupees is being sold.
Aadhar Card, Family Card, Housing Building Map Accredited and Accredited Building Map or Certificate of Accreditation of Grameen Administrative Officer shall be handed over to the Responsibilities of Mother Cement in the Consumer Markets of Tamil Nadu.
The number of cements that we buy, the 'TD' has to be linked to the application.
Cement coats will be distributed within a week after the 'TD' is enrolled on the Internet.
This is the practice.
It is not used properly in many places.
There are complaints throughout Tamilnadu that the misdeeds of the officials have received the money and the sale of their mother's cement sheets in the black market.
Beneficiaries are also trying to avoid wavering and buy cement covers very soon.

The Sri Lankan government has welcomed the proposal to reapprove the evening island in public interest.
Media Statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs in this regard is as follows:
Foreign Secretary Ariasinghe welcomed the proposal for the re-approval of the evening.
Foreign Secretary Rawanath Ariyasinghe welcomed the proposal for re-approval of the evening island in the welfare family last Thursday and reiterated Sri Lanka's full support for utilising the rapid pace already used to allow Gambia to allow full participation of the island in the Commonwealth Heads of Government Summit 2020 to be held in Rwanda.
One of the pages of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly was the apology by the Union Minister of State for Public Welfare and United Nations, Wimpleton Prabhu Ahmed, at a meeting of the Public Health Ministers in New York on September 26, 2019.
'It is heartening to note that Sri Lanka has enjoyed strong bilateral relations with the island, which is a close neighbour and one of the South Asian countries, and has shown its intention to rejoin public interest, one of the major initiatives undertaken by the new administration of the island in the past year.'
In particular, a comprehensive evaluation work carried out by the Secretary of PWD in the evening of January 2019 led to a smooth resolution and pointed out that any hurdles against its re-entry should be regarded as merely deficiencies affecting all countries from time to time.
He insisted that further obstacles should not be placed on their way to less incentives.
The Secretary of State (Independent Charge) was present on Friday, 27th September, 2019 at 77 (G77) State Ministers Meeting in New York.
It was noted that G77 stands unique in calling for global actions to meet various requirements of countries in specific circumstances such as grievance regimes, land-ridden developing countries and developing small island countries.
These problems adversely affect economic and social development and affect their ability to achieve sustainable development goals.
The organisation must act as a collective voice to demand greater international assistance and support for the vulnerable and marginalized countries, particularly for financial and skill development.
In a statement released during the Asian Cooperation Dialogue of the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministers Meeting as the Co-Prime Minister of the Post on Scientific, Technological and Innovation, Secretary of State for External Affairs, Arisinghe said that Asian Cooperation Dialogue is a key driver of sustainable socio-cultural and economic growth in the field of circuits.
The central level of Asian cooperation in enhancing economic competitiveness in the region is helping Asian countries compete equitablely in the world market.

Ronald Lee Haskell: A man who killed his ex-wife's family in Texas was punished.
Ronald Lee Haskell was punished for killing four of his five children, Stephen and Kethi Stay, during the spring of 39 and 2014.
On July 9, 2019, he entered the house of his wife, Melani Haskell, to know where she was separated.
There he was, but his sister Keth Stay and his family were there.
Harris County Sharif officials claimed that Stephen Stephen Stay, 39, Kethi Stey, two boys 33, 13 and 4, and two girls 9 and 7, were killed while shooting with a hoskel rifle.
Only one member of that family survived the 15-year-old cassette.
Officials noted that he was seriously injured when he was fully cured after a while.
The mediators on Thursday unanimously rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's claim that he had been buried.
The court was postponed until Monday for punishment.
Guantum Web Site closes to the Truth: Science Dale
The end of a US military research has brought the Guantam Website closer to one step.
Such a web site will provide the Army with unprecedented security, detection and time-bound capabilities in the usual network approaches.
The Centre for Distributed Guantam Data Distributed by the Military Research Laboratory of Defence Skill Development of the US Army saw the Inspructure University researchers performing a record of 50 kilometres of Guantam Bridge using fiber-optic cables between the Department of Military Research (DMR), the laboratory's Military Research Office (FRI).
The latter is a link that can be formed between quantum steel materials such as cubets.
If the connection between the two Cubids is measured, the other will affect the measurement of the measurement, even if the second is in the very tip of Kyubid.
"This [50 kilometres] is a practical distance for the measurement of two more linked orders and the setting up of inter-city guantum networks," said the research scholar at Inspructure University and the principal analysts of the project, whose discovery has been published in the Nechar Journal uantum Infermation.
The inter-city uantum networks are made up of the remote channels of the Buddhist Cubids, which, though far away, will be very difficult.
Researchers said that this lag is necessary for setting up a quantum portal.
Sara Camble, Joint-Military Programme Coordinator of the Armed Forces Programme which supports the research, said, It is a major step forward to make a big distributed lag.
After traveling through fiber, the level of recession at the other end and the very difficult quantum network usage is higher than the requirements for certain purposes.
The research team began experimenting by approaching a calcium trapped in a trap.
Using the laser curtains, the researchers triggered a quantum stagnation on the Empire, while triggering an exposure to a potato collected by quantum data.
As a result, the quantum levels of those atoms and lights were retreating.
It is a challenge to send photan via fiber optic cables.
Lynne said, Calcium is blossoming with 854 nanometers, which are soon sucked by optical fiber.
Thus, his team first sent the lights through an optimistic staircase illuminated by a strong laser.
The current television radio network of 1550 nano metres has been favourable for long distance travel.
After that, the researchers dispatched the potato through a 50 kilometre long fiber-optic cable.
Their measurements showed that nuclear and optical portions were still lagging, even after the changes in the channel and the long-range journey.
These decisions provide a direct roadmap for enabling long-range networks of calcium utilisation, as high-level 'Kadika' can be accommodated in collaboration with cubit.
Military researcher Dr. Fredrick Fademi, who is also the Deputy Manager of the project, said that the Army needs a large range of relaxed clock networks, accurate conditions, guidance and time use.
