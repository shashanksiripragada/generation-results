You are misleading the courts.
Your presentation showed that only 4-7 farmers had to face obstacles, but a large number of farmers were brought to book here.
The Advocate Ananda Yagna, on behalf of the farmers, had cited that for the most expensive projects of the country worth more than Rs. 1 lakh 10 thousand crore related to more than one state, the central government has not responded for more than 3 months, it does not comply with the guideline of the company.
The central government is trying to ensure that the case does not go ahead in the High Courts without responding.
Since the Centre or the State Government does not have any strong savings on land acquisition, the farmers are being supplied by the collector as a last weapon.
Blackmail is being made to confiscate land as new conditional lands.
The same amount of money is being paid if the land is not acquired.
The Central Government is not responding to the Supreme Court's order dated August 10th.
As a result, the farmers will go back to the Supreme Court tomorrow and ask for their compliance.

At the international level, China tries to make UAN an international currency with dollars at euro, yen and pound levels.
Looking at the prospect of an economic ban on the US side, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making this deal in rupee and rubble.
International DASK: India and Russia have agreed on the S-400 Defence Missile System today between the United States Banning Champions.
Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation, will be seen signing the MoU with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
With the approval of the S-400 Deal, US Dollars for payment of the deal are in the process of extracting the route between the two countries.
The sources claim that India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making this deal in rupee and rubble in view of the prospect of an economic ban on the US side.
USA imposed ban on China's deal
It is remarkable that in September, Russia deleted the S-400 missile with China.
After the deal, US President Donald Trump decided to ban China.
The ban almost made it impossible for China to purchase missiles using US dollars.
However, in the last few years, China has sought to raise its currency UAN as an international currency compared to dollars.
After this initiative, China has been consistently trying to make UN an international currency equivalent to Euro, Yen and Pounds, including dollars.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserve of US dollars in international trade.
China wants to make UN an international posture
USA may impose Countering American Advertising through Securities - CATSA on this Mega Defence Deal of USD 5 billion.
Last month, the US had imposed a ban on buying an S-400 missile system on China.
India and Russia have embarked upon establishing an alternate mechanism for this deal.
Earlier, the US ban on INS Chakra's repair deal from Russia had resulted in an estimated US2 billion deal between India and Russia.
The Economic Analyst claims that to come out of such a scenario, India should use the RuPayo-Rouble Exchange as an international currency.
It is remarkable that all defence deals made by India with Russia have been done through dollars so far.
Why became America's Cuttack Act
In August, President Donald Trump, in view of the Russian Modern Defence Missile System, approved the Cuttack Act to prevent Russia from acting against US interests internationally.
It is remarkable that the US law has been enacted keeping in view the Russian activities.
These include attacks on Ukraine from Russia in 2014, capturing Crimia, participation in the Syrian House War and the 2016 US Presidential Election.
Then suddenly came forward thousands of years old secrets

Truth comes out in Postmortem Report of Birds

In such a scenario, people themselves have been told how to save them.
The police said that the windows with more reflections and windowscreens can be stopped from staging them.

Was it a jerk to read the title
How can the Sanskrit language of Sultan Mohammad Ghazni of Ghazni, the contemporary and common Indian of Somnath Temple, be Sanskrit
In fact, it has become clear from the research done by Delhi University's historian Professor Shanta Pandey that Ghazni's Rajbhasha was Sanskrit.
While Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for their service to the culture, Sanskrit was only a folklore that was the language of so-called high-ranking Brahmins.
The Pandit Gulam Dastragir Sethdar of Mumbai was remembered.
The 87-year-old scholars who spoke in simple Sanskrit as well as a rickshaw driver are still giving a final shape to the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Koran before publication.
The word sacred uran is Sanskrit from his point of view.
u van meaning the sound of the beloved on earth.
Not only this, he is one of the greatest Sanskrit scholars of the country who have studied in Solapur school.
However, while leading a simple life, Panditji does not seek to interpret himself as a Sanskrit pundit in America or other countries for his marketing.
The Prince of Thailand is a Sanskrit pundit.
Sanskrit is accurately taught there.
Eager to learn Sanskrit from America has to go to Bon University in Germany.
Besides the Banaras Hindu University in India most of the universities have also written the epics of Sanskrit PHD which are also written in the language of that state .
In Gujarat, Sanskrit education is being imparted only in Gujarati, but it should be remembered that education in Takshila and Nalanda universities was imparted through Sanskrit medium.
Sanskrit propaganda in Afghan, Prof. Shanta Pandey has said that Ghazni's Sultan language was not only Sanskrit but it has also noted that his money coins were also engraved in Sanskrit.
Panini, a resident of Shalapur, Afghanistan, has also noted the verses of the Koran in Sanskrit on the "Mohammad Suratan" and the creator of the Sanskrit version.
Pandit Nehru has said that in the philosophy of 'Marru Hind', a vast exhibition has come down from Sanskrit in the strength of Sanskrit language and from Afghan and Pathanas in the Shakti Shakti.
Today everyone acknowledges that not only Indian languages but Indo-European languages have also come from Sanskrit.
It is even more surprising that Dr. Ambedkar, the Chief Creator of the Constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and some other members of the Muslim and South Indian Legislatures proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
On September 13, 1949, the Constituent Assembly of English against Hindi discussed the national language and among those who proposed the national language to Sanskrit, the Deputy Foreign Minister, Dr. B.
Considering the discussion of that day and the report published earlier in the National Herald of September 11, 1949, Sanskrit language is estimated to be sanskrit.
Even today we have not been able to decide any national language.
22 Indian languages including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu have a place in our Constitution as Rajbhasha (Official Language), National Language (National Language).
According to the Census 2011, only 24,821 people of the country have been maternal languages. We have placed Sanskrit in a position like a tumor of spectacles.
Vadapradhan Nehru, Honble Prime Minister of Sanskrit, spoke at the Constituent Assembly also with great regard for Sanskrit.
The Sanskrit version of his scriptures narrates the significance that Sanskrit has been attached to by the scholars of the world: Sir Williams Johns, in the midst of 1874, said, "How ancient the Sanskrit language is, God knows, the construction of it is magnificent.
It is full of Greek languages, more widespread than Latin and more disciplined than both.
Nehru remarks: "I do not know how culture has been a dead language for so many years, that is, how it has become a folklore.
Today, as a Sanskrit language prayer or as a Parliamentarian, the language of taking oath has been the language of a member like Union Minister Smriti Irani.
We need to preserve the years of Sanskrit and revive it and make it a folklore.
If the dead language of Israel can be revived, Sanskrit is still a living language.
It is only if a serious effort is made to make it a folklore or a serious attempt is made to make it a folklore.
