Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
In particular, it is not just that Indian community participates in it.
Now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social movements there also celebrate Deepawali with full fervor and enthusiasm.
In a way, they can say that India is the only country there.
Friends, there is a feeling of attraction for festival tourism in the world.
There are many possibilities of festival tourism in this .
We have to demonstrate how our efforts should be, whatever festivals like Holi, Deepavali, Onam, Pongal and Bihu.
In our country, there are several festivals in every state and every region, in which people from other countries take more country.
Therefore, the role of Indians living abroad is very important in broadening the festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided in the last Mann Ki Baat that we will do something different on this Diwali.
We all had said on this Diwali that we will celebrate India's women's energy and its achievements that we will pay our respects to the people of India, didn't we
In a few days, stories that have inspired innumerable stories in the social media have begun to emerge.
Ramesh Ji, a millionaire of the congress, has said that his mother is his power in the Namo App.
In the year of 1990, when my father was in time, my mother accepted the gold of five children.
Today we have five brothers sitting in good work.
My greetings to your mother, Ramesh Ji.
Next, Geetika Swami ji, who is very keen on Twitter, has said that Major Khushboo Kanwar is the sage of India.
As far as Kavita Tiwari is concerned, it is her daughter who is the mother of India who gives her strength.
It is a matter of great pride for the mother that her daughter makes a beautiful painting.
He also has good marks in the legal entrance examination called CLAT.
People are sharing such collective information.
You must study, see, get inspired and share something in your neighbourhood just like those present in it. On this occasion, I salute all these shrines of India.
We know that he had laid the foundation for this thing in the 17th century.
My dear countrymen, this year on November 12, the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Dev ji is spread not only in India but all over the world.
In many countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters live, who are fully dedicated to the upliftment of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I cannot forget that I went to Venkuar and Gurudwara in Tehran.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji shared many things about him but for this many parts of Mann Ki Baat will be fully required.
Nanakdeva ji considered service above all.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji considered the service of selflessness as invaluable.
He made a strong voice against social evils such as evil.
The message of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji spread to every corner of the world.
He was one of those who traveled in large numbers during his tenure.
He went to many places, wherever he went, through his simplicity and devotion he would make everyones hearts victorious.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had undertaken several important religious tours which are known as Udaasi.
He carried messages of harmony and equality from the North to the South, from the East to the West, in all directions, to the people of all regions, to the sovereign and the holy people.
It is believed that the famous shrine of Assam, Shankardev ji, was also inspired by him.
He undertook a pilgrimage to the holy land of Haridwar.
It is said that Sri Guru Nanak Devji had stayed in Gurubagh Gurudwara , a holy place in Kashi .
He has also visited pilgrimage places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has travelled to Sri Lanka in the south.
During his visit to Bihar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the water scarcity there.
It reminds all of us that a famous place called Guru Nanak Jira Saheb is in Bihar, which was dedicated to him.
During a period Guru Nanak ji travelled north, Kashmir and neighbouring areas.
This led to a strong link between the Sikh religions and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji went to Tibet and the people there accepted him as a Guru.
He is also bowed to Uzbekistan during his visit to Dalhousie.
As part of his pilgrimage, he has visited a large number of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He was in the hearts of millions and millions of people who followed his teachings with full involvement and followed them even today.
Just a few days ago, the government ambassadors from around 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar.
They visited the Golden uadrilateral and all this happened on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
It was on this day that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron man of India, was born, who was the son of one who connected the country.
Sardar Patel had a wonderful ability to integrate people, while the disagreements were capable of bringing harmony.
He's actually the Man of Detail, desirable to see the nucleus.
Besides, he has expertise in organisational activities.
He has the art of formulating schemes and formulating strategies.
While reading about Sardar ji's work, we can see how strong his planning was.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country have come to attend the Congress conference in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All arrangements for the conference were imposed on Sardar ji.
He used this opportunity to improve the city's drinking water network.
He ensured that no one should have water scarcity.
He contacted the farmers and appealed to them to make rockets.
At the same time, a substantial increase in Khadi sales was also confirmed.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constituent Assembly.
He was an important worker in determining basic rights, and there was no place for any inequality on the basis of caste and creed.
Friends, As the country's first Home Minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji had succeeded in the unifying of the symposiums, in a big way, in the books of history, in a remarkable effort to penetrate gold.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, we talk about his contribution to certain areas of integration of the country.
As soon as Sardar Patel received this message, he immediately stepped into serious action without delaying a moment.
Under his command, the thunderstorm was immediately flew and dumped into the enemy's evil desire to capture the Lakshadweeps.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked his brothers and sisters to ensure that all necessary assistance is provided for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is playing an important role in India's progress.
This is an attractive tourist spot.
I am confident that all of you will visit its beautiful islands and beaches.
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity was dedicated to the nation and the world to commemorate Sardar Saheb on 31st October, 2018.
This is not the world's largest statue.
This is a two-storey statue at a height above the statue of the independent goddess of America.
Every Indian is proud of the world's tallest statue.
Every Indians head is filled with pride.
I am glad that more than 26 lakh tourists have visited the Statue of Unity in just one year.
That is, every day 8500 people have visited the pride of the Statue of Unity.
It is evident that Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel has faith and dedication in the hearts of these people.
Now there are several attractive centres like Sapathikalli garden, Betam garden, Wildlife Sanctuary, Child Nutrition Park, Unity Nursery etc. so that the economy of that area has improved and people are getting new opportunities for employment.
Friends, for all the states and for the tourism sector, this statue of unity can become a study.
Within a year, we all are witnesses of how a place can become a world-famous tourist destination.
There are people of our country and those who come from abroad.
Traffic, logistics, guides and environmental friendly organisations are developing one after the other.
I also urge you people to take out your priceless time and visit the Statue of Unity
But at the same time, I once again insist that every Indian traveling with his family should visit at least 15 places in India and stay there at night.
Friends, you are aware that we are observing the country's unity day from 2014 to 31st October.
This day gives us the message of saving our nations unity, integrity and security at all costs.
On 31st October, the Run for Unity is being organised every year like every year.
This will include all sections of the society and all sections of the society.
In this context, the drive is being carried out not only for the physical, but also for the good, for India's unity and for India's new heights.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel had connected the country with the help of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a cordiality in our lives and in a diverse country like India, we have to add strength to this mantra of unity at every stage, at every stage and at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very constructive and conscious to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look around, we will find many examples of those who are working sustainably to promote mutual harmony.
But, in many cases, the effort of society, its contribution, disappears quickly from the memorial.
Friends, I clearly remember that in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court had given its verdict on the issue of Ramjanmabhoomi.
But after the verdict on the land of Ramajan, the then state, political parties, social organisations, representatives of society, all religions, sages and nobles made a very modest and neutral comment.
This is an attempt to reduce the pressure on the environment.
Those days, those moments remind us of our duty.
This is an example of how much unity is the country's strength.
Even the Gods who have enjoyed the fruits, they are 125 crore Indians.
But a comfortable experience is also an interesting experience.
I heard that why not share it with you.
Just imagine... the world's tallest battlefield, where the temperature is 50-60 degrees below the ground.
There is only some nominal gas in the air.
In such a devastating situation, living in the midst of so many challenges is not less than any mighty act.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only guarding the borders but also running a clean Siachen movement.
I express my gratitude to the people of our country for this wonderful obligation of the Indian Army.
It is difficult to find anything in the severe winter there.
In such a scenario, analysis of dustbins and arrangements are all important things.
There is such an ecosystem that it is the life of rare animals like ice and rare animals like iPex and brown bears.
My dear countrymen, celebrations are a new era of awareness in the lives of all of us.
Moreover, Deepawali, particularly in every family, is almost likely to buy something new and bring something from the market.
I had once said we should try to buy local goods.
If we get the required things in our village then what is the need to go to the regional level
If one thing is available at the regional level then what is the need to go to the district level
The more we try to buy locally available goods, Gandhi will automatically blossom into an enormous opportunity of 150.
I reiterate my request to buy something from our weavers, weavers, weavers, weavers and weavers.
Apart from conveying the best wishes of Deepawali, I challenge that we will become local buyers.
Through this, we have to show how important we can contribute to realising the dreams of Gandhi Ji.
Once again I convey my best wishes for this Deepawali.
We burn a variety of butterflies on Deepawali.
However, sometimes our carelessness leads to fire.
Wound is causing.
Therefore, I urge you to protect yourselves and celebrate your festivals.
My best wishes to Deepawali.
Thank you very much.
He is always ready to express his happiness and express his support for our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated the valour of the Barakram Parv.
We were reminded of the accurate attack in 2016, and our soldiers gave a strong response to the tacit war that was waged in a guise of extremism against our nation.
Our soldiers had organised exhibitions at different places in the country to showcase our strengths to the citizens of the country, especially to the youth.
How deserving we are, how our soldiers are protecting our countrymen by putting their lives at stake
One day like Barakram Mountain reminds the youngsters of the rich heritage of our soldiers.
It also inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in an event in Jodhpur, the brave land of Rajasthan.
It has now been decided that those who are trying to contribute to the peace and development environment of our country, our soldiers will give them a strong response.
India has always committed itself to maintaining peace and commitment.
In both the world wars of the twentieth century, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace, even if we had nothing to do with those wars.
This is also a valiant act in the direction of peace carried out by our armed forces.
Over the years, our brave soldiers have played a crucial role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, things related to heaven will always be different.
In this way, it is not surprising that the Indian Air Force has drawn the attention of every citizen of the country by displaying their strength in the sky.
They have given us a sense of security.
On the occasion of the Independence Day celebrations, one of the most eager and eager peoples aspirations for the parade is the aerial adventure in which our air warriors will showcase their strength along with their distraught activities.
We are celebrating Air Force Day on 8th October.
In 1932, our Air Force, which started a small scale with six aircraftmen and 19 Air Force personnel, today is one of the most adventurous and powerful Air Forces of the 21st century.
I convey my best wishes to all the Air Force personnel and their families who are serving the nation from the bottom of my heart.
In 1947, when Pakistanis launched an unprecedented attack, our air warriors decided to rescue Sri Lanka from the attackers and landed the Indian military's weapons and weapons of war on the battlefield at the right time.
In 1965, the Air Force retaliated strongly against the enemies.
Who would be ignorant of the Bangladesh Freedom Struggle of 1971
In the Tiger Hill area, where the enemies were hiding, every night, they were bombed and covered with dust.
Be it rescue and relief operations or disaster management, the country is grateful to the Air Force for the meritorious work done by our Air Force personnel.
Their emotions are marvelous in tackling all disasters like storms, cyclones, floods and forest fires and helping the countrymen.
The Air Force has set an example in gender equality in the country and has opened the doors of each of their departments for women.
I had announced this thing from the Red Fort on 15th August this year that women are joining the Air Force and with short term duties are being converted into permanent work.
We can proudly say that not only the male power but also the role of women power is increasing in the Indian Army's armed forces.
Women are powerful, but now they are becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, in the past, an officer from the navy has been facing the struggle of Abhilash Tomy, Life Sawa.
The entire country was concerned about how to save Tommy.
You know that Abhilash Tomy is an extremely adventurous officer.
He was the first Indian to travel in a small boat without any modern technology and personally undertake a world tour.
For the past 80 days, he had been on the move to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the southern part of the Indian Ocean, without reducing his pace at sea.
He is a wonderful example of adventure, devotion and might, and a few days ago, when I had brought the aspiration out of the sea, I had telephonic conversations with him.
I've already met Tommy.
I pray for the excellent health of Abhilash Tomy, his courage, his valour, his dedication, his determination to fight will certainly inspire our youth.
My dear countrymen, every child of the country is aware of the importance of our nation on 2nd October.
There is another feature of this year on 2nd October.
Since now, we are organising several events across the world on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji for years.
Gandhijis ideas have inspired the entire world.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about one more important work of my dear brothers and sisters.
In 1941, Gandhiji started writing some thoughts on the Constructive Programme.
Later, in 1945, when the freedom struggle was intensified, he prepared a copies of those ideas.
He put forward his views on a wide range of topics such as safeguarding the rights of farmers, villages and workers, cleanliness and the spread of education.
This is also called Gandhi Charter.
Everyone has enjoyed it in the most exclusive form of his personality.
He gave every human being a sense of greatness and importance to the country.
His biggest contribution to the freedom struggle was the transformation of this into a mass struggle.
In the freedom struggle, by accepting the challenges of Gandhiji, all sections of the society came forward and took part in it.
And what the corners say, I give you a gas rope, whenever you feel skeptical, whenever you feel skeptical, keep this criterion. Look at the man who is poorer and weaker, remember his face, listen to your mind, ask yourself what kind of work you are doing, then see how much benefit will be to that man.
Will this brighten his life and future
My dear countrymen, Gandhiji's carpet is equally important even today.
Today, the growing middle class people in the country, their growing economic power, their purchasing power...
Whether we go to buy something or not, can we recall the mother in time
Could you remember the coffin of the sister
Whose face is funny
If you buy, who will get the benefit directly or indirectly
My happiness will strengthen if the poorest of the poor gets a profit.
Remember this mantra of Gandhiji, in the days to come, when we all buy something, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, when we buy every item, our countrymen, especially those who have made their sweat to make it, those who have invested their money, those who have sown their capabilities, those who have sown their capabilities, all of them should get some benefit.
He might have been unaware of how this would happen but this happened and India got independence.
This small task of mine can contribute to the economic development of my country, to the economic empowerment of the poor, to the power of fighting against poverty.
But today, this is the true patriotism, and I believe that this will be the Karyanjali that we will provide to the corners.
He would say that all these threads are soaked with great difficulty, and every thread of them should be used.
And there was a serpent among the nations, and a serpent, and a small serpent in every corner of the mankind.
We are going to celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri along with the blessed brothers two days later.
His slogan Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is a symbol of his stature.
As a result of his selfless commitment towards the nation, in less than a year and a half, he was able to provide a mantra for the country's soldiers and farmers to scale new heights of success.
Millions of people joined this movement and I got an opportunity to serve the cleanliness drive with the children of Ahmedabad in Delhi.
The foundation for the school was the respected Baba Saheb.
All the types of people from all over the country participated in this service on the 15th.
Organisations have also contributed very enthusiastically.
School children, college students, National Cadet Corps, National Cadet Corps (NCC), youth organisations, media groups, corporates etc.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all those who want cleanliness for their contribution.
Let's hear a telephone call.
But if you had not been able to telephonically telephone the way it became a boon for you after the construction of toilets then the focus of the people associated with this movement would not have been attained.
I express my gratitude to you in a special way.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a success story not only in our country but also in the world and everyone is talking about it.
This time India is organising the world's largest cleanliness summit in history.
In the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, Health Ministers and Sectoral Experts from all over the world share their experiments and experiences on cleanliness.
The closing ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October this year to mark the commencement of 150th Birth Anniversary of Mother India.
There are numerous clauses to protect the fundamental rights of the poor in the Constitution provided by Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Inspired by that vision, NHRC was established on 12th October, 1993.
The Commission is scheduled to complete 25 years of its existence in a few days.
The Commission is not only protecting human rights but also enhancing human dignity.
The leader of our hearts, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, has said that human rights are not a separate principle for all of us.
The Symbol of our National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) enshrines the principle of 'Sarve Bhawantu Sukinah' from the Vedic period.
The Commission has created widespread awareness on human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
This 25-year visit has created a hopeful and confident environment for the countrymen.
It provides a healthy society with confidence in better democratic values.
Today, in addition to the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions are also functioning.
As a society, we need to understand and embrace the importance of human rights, which is the source of progress for all and for all.
My dear countrymen, in October, the birth centenary of Jai Prakash Narayan ji and Rajmata Vijayraje Scindia ji will begin.
Let us remember these great personalities who have inspired us all.
I will talk about it in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat on 31st October, but today if I want to mention about it then on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar ji, on 31st October, the movement for unity is being organised in every small town of India, in parts and villages.
This year we have to make efforts to organize this movement for unity in our villages, regions, cities and metropolitan cities.
The race for unity is the best way to think of Sardar ji better because he worked for the unity of the nation throughout his life.
I urge you all to strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society and every unit of the country through the drive for unity on 31st October, which will be a great tribute to him.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, the entire country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion.
Raksha Bandhan is a shower of love and belief among his brothers and sisters.
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries.
Several special stories associated with the Raksha Bandhan, the Raksha Bandhan, the ropeway of the Raksha Bandhan, the ropes of faith for the people of two different regions or religions, are filled in the history of the country.
A few days later, the Genmastami festival is going to come up.
The elephants, horses, palanquins - Jai Kanhaiyalal ki and Govinda-Kovinda - are sounding in the atmosphere.
Happy feelings of Sri Krishna's devotion are the same.
Our youth will be making preparations for Dahi-Handi in many parts of the country, especially in the state of Maharashtra.
My best wishes for Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami for all the countrymen.
Thank you, sister Sinmaiah, for putting forth a good thing.
Friends, Besides Raksha Bandhan, we are celebrating the festival of 'Shiravana Purnami' on the occasion of 'Shiravana Purnami'.
I convey my best wishes to all those who have dedicated their lives to further improve this great treasure and bring it to the common man.
Every language has a special significance.
Tamil language is the oldest language in the world. Everyone in India is proud
Similarly, it is a matter of pride for all of us Indians that from the Vedas to the present, the Sanskrit language has contributed immensely to the spread of wisdom.
The Gyanak Kalanji, which is connected to every sphere of life, is enshrined in the Sanskrit language and its literature.
Whether it is science, technology, agriculture, healthcare, astronomy, architecture, architecture, management, economy or environment...
You all will be happy to know that even today, the villagers of Battur district of Shimoga district of Karnataka are using Samskrit as a litigation.
Thousands of phrases, 200 entries viz. prefix, 22 phrases i. e.
Therefore any hot feeling or thing can be described precisely .
We always remember Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji.
We celebrate his birthday as Teachers Day throughout the country.
I convey my best wishes to all teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day.
At the same time, I convey my best wishes to science, education and the dedication of teachers to the students.
My dear countrymen, this monsoon brings expectations to our hardworking farmers.
Natural conditions have caused more rainfall than other places.
We all have seen how bad the lives of people have been affected due to the severe floods in Kerala.
Though we cannot fully compensate for their sadness, yet I am confident that 125 crore Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with you at this sad moment.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity should recover quickly.
Everyone decides how to reduce the sufferings of the people of Kerala and how to share their sorrows.
We are well aware that the soldiers were the heroes of the rescue operations in Kerala.
They have left no effort to save the civilians in the floods.
Air Force, Navy, Ground Force, Border Security Force, Central Industries, Defence Force and Expedition have played a major role in this movement.
In particular, at this time, I would like to mention the hard work of the Suras of the National Disaster Management Force (NDRF).
Yesterday, the festival of Onam was celebrated, this festival should give strength to the country, particularly to Kerala, and they should rise quickly from the impact of this disaster and all of us should urge that the development journey of Kerala should be expedited.
Once again, I assure the people of Kerala and all those affected by disasters across the country that the entire country is with you and helps you in this difficult time.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at the suggestions for Mann Ki Baat.
I had to see the subject about which the countrymen have written a lot - it is our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Keerthi of Ghaziabad, Swati Vatsa from Soniba, Praveen, brother of Kerala, Dr.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and MyGov have urged me to talk about the diversity of Atal ji's life, such as Swapn Bannerji, Akhilesh Pandey from Kadihar in Bihar.
On the 16th of August, the nation and the world saddened by the news of Atal ji's time.
He quit the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, he has been away from radical politics for the past decade.
He did not appear in the news, he stayed away from public life.
Though the New Year is a big gap, the country and the world have seen that this decade has not created any gap in the minds of the common Indians since the 16th of August.
The love, suffering and sorrow that Atal ji had forgotten in the country, showcasing his immense uniqueness.
Over the past few days, the greatest dimensions of Atal ji have emerged before the nation.
People recall and recall him as a great Parliamentarian, a sensible writer, a great speaker and a people-friendly Prime Minister.
The country will always be grateful to Atal Ji for bringing good governance into the mainstream.
But today, I would like to mention another dimension of Atal ji's broad personality, I would like to touch upon it and the benefits of Atal ji's political culture, his efforts to transform it and his organisational efforts to build it will be extremely beneficial in the coming days.
It's sure.
India will always be grateful for the 91st Constitutional Amendment in 2003.
This transformation has led to two significant changes in Indian politics.
First of all, the number of Ministers in the States should be only 15 of the total number of MPs.
Secondly, according to the anti-party legislation, he increased the size of one-third of the previous members to two-thirds of the membership.
At the same time, a clear protocol was enacted to ensure the resignation of members of the party's invaders.
Over the years, there has been a political culture of forming large-scale cabinets in India, and these big cabinets were set up not to share the work but to retain the political leaders.
Atal ji changed this situation.
Because of his work, money and expenditure were saved.
Performance was also improved.
This was possible only by a prophet like Atal ji, and a healthy tradition began to preserve in our political culture.
Atal ji is a real patriot.
During his tenure, it was changed at the time he submitted the budget.
Previously, the budget was submitted by the British at 5 p.m.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the presentation time from 5pm to 11pm.
Similarly, you are watching the discussions about holding elections in the country and the central government and the state governments at the same time.
On this occasion, when we take a pledge to realize his dream of a fulfilled and progressive India, I pay tributes to Atal ji on behalf of all of us.
When there is talk of parliament, it is spoken about mutilation, shouting and postponement, but if something goes well, it doesn't matter much.
A few days ago, the Monsoon Session of Parliament was concluded.
You will be pleased to know that the Lok Sabhas vision was 118 and Rajya Sabhas vision was 74.
Crossing party differences, all MPs tried to make the Monsoon Session more effective, resulting in the passage of 21 bills in the Lok Sabha and 14 bills in the Rajya Sabha.
The Monsoon Session of the two Houses will always be remembered for social justice and youth welfare.
Several important legislations for the benefit of the youth and the backward classes were passed during the session.
This process will be helpful in achieving the goal of social justice.
The amendment to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was also passed.
The Act will further protect the interests of the underprivileged and tribal communities.
Moreover there shall be confidence in the minds of the oppressed, which shall prevent the atrocities of the guilty.
No civil society can tolerate injustice against women's power.
The nation is not ready to tolerate the perpetrators of sexual assault
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill leading to a severe punishment.
You might have read a court in Mandsor in Madhya Pradesh just a few days ago that you had tried the case within two months and convicted two offenders who had committed a sexual assault on the girl.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh completed the trial in just five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have promptly passed judgments in such cases.
The Act will be a milestone in preventing crimes against women and girls.
When we move ahead for the welfare of the nation, we can transform the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived.
This time, during the rainy season, all of them have together set a special model.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
Today, the attention of millions and millions of our countrymen has been on the Asian Games in arda.
Every morning, the first time in the news papers, on television, on social media is that which Indian soldier has won the medal.
Asian Games are going on now.
I would like to congratulate all sportspersons who have won medals for the country.
I also extend my warm greetings to the sportspersons who are participating in the upcoming competition.
Indias sportspersons, especially in the field of fire fighting and wrestling, have made outstanding achievements, but our sportspersons are also receiving medals in such unprecedented fields as Wushu competition and boat competition.
These are not mere medals - testimony to the beliefs and dreams of Indian sportspersons...
This is a very positive sign that our women are among the growing number of medal winners for the country.
The medal winners include youngsters under 15-16 years of age.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day.
We all have seen the construction of houses and buildings with bricks but can you imagine that about 1200 years ago, a large mountain, a single rocky single mountain, a very special, broad and marvellous temple, has been carved out of imagination, but this temple is the Kailasanath temple in Ellora, Maharashtra.
India has been a land engineering experimental platform.
Several engineers have emerged in India, they have achieved unimaginable things and have given examples of miracles in the engineering world.
Even today lakhs of farmers and the common people are benefiting from the Krishnaraj Sagar Dam which he created across the River Periyar.
He has been a venerator in these parts of the country and the nation has given him respectful respect.
In his memory, we celebrate 15th September as Engineers' Day.
The engineers of our country have placed a brand in the entire world by moving forward on the path shown by him.
When we talk about the wonders of the engineering world, we recall an incident in 2001 when a terrible earthquake struck Kutch in Gujarat.
When I was working there as a self-sufficient servant, I got the opportunity to visit a village where I had to meet an adult who crossed the age of 100.
He was laughing at me and calling it a park in my house Par-Kutch.
He added that this house has seen three earthquakes in my house.
I have also met three earthquakes.
I understand them at the same house.
But there will be no impact anywhere.
Centuries ago, the engineers of that period had constructed buildings according to the regional environment and how it was possible for the people to live safely.
When we observe Engineers' Day today, we must think for the future.
The world is suffering from natural calamities.
We will continue to meet in Mann Ki Baat, we will continue to speak openly, we will take the nation forward through our hearts, we will remain united.
With this feeling, my best wishes to you all.
Thank you.
We'll meet again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
The vastness and diversity of India, but sometimes it shows its discrimination.
But why should we criticize the rain
As a result, nature sometimes expresses its anger.
Therefore, it is our responsibility to be natural lovers, to preserve nature and to preserve nature so that there can be a deterioration in the treasures of nature itself.
A natural disaster that took place a few days ago attracted the attention of the entire world and embraced humanity.
It usually takes a few hours to enter the cave.
But the fate of that day was different.
After walking a long distance inside the cave , suddenly due to the melting of the cave water stopped in the gates of the cave .
Their way out was blocked.
They stayed in the cave for 18 days, not two days, on a small rock in the cave, because there was no way out.
You can imagine the circumstances in which those youngsters would have to spend every moment while facing death in front of their eyes.
On the one hand, they were trapped on the other, on the other hand, the entire human society was united, expressing the humanity of God.
People from all over the world were praying to bring these children out safely.
It is not that there will be no pain for the parents, nor will tears grow in the eyes of the mother.
The whole world was amazed at the fact that the boys were not able to lose their hopes while they showed so many adventures and chests in a dark cave full of water beyond such difficult situations.
This incident makes us feel that when humanity stands united, miracles take place.
But we need to work tirelessly towards the goal of being peaceful and steadfast.
Just a few days ago, the beloved poet of our country, Neeraj ji, left us alone.
He has a specialty - faith, self-confidence and compassion.
The months of July-August are the most important months for the farmers and for all the youth.
Because these months are the peak seasons of their colleges.
Millions of youngsters like Sathya come out of school and join colleges.
If the months of February-March are for examinations, question papers and answer papers, then the months of April-May are pleasant on vacations and the results are deciding the direction to travel in life, which profession should be done.
It is an important period in July that the youth's focus shifts from questions to cut-off marks.
Students leave their homes and go to the students' hotel.
Students get out of the umbrella of their parents and join the umbrella of the professors.
I firmly believe that my young friends will be very enthusiastic about starting a college life.
This is the first time that you leave your home and leave your village and leave a safe environment and start driving yourself.
For the first time, so many youngsters have left their homes and have come out to create a new direction for their lives.
Many students would have joined their colleges and some would have joined.
Whatever I want to tell you, be calm, enjoy your inner feelings in life, there is no doubt that books are essential, it is important to study, while on the other hand you should also have the nature of looking for new things.
There is a unique value for old friends.
Young friends are very valuable, while choosing, adapting and maintaining friendship is a very intelligent step.
You can learn some new things, some new skills, some new languages...
My best wishes to all the youngsters who have started a new dance.
While talking about the college season, it was learnt that Asharam Chaudhary, a student from a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh, had overcome the difficult challenges of life.
He has qualified for the first time in the medical examination of Jodhpur AIIMS.
His father works as a sanitation worker and manages his family.
I convey my best wishes to him for his success.
How many such students from poor families have been able to overcome the worst conditions because of their untiring efforts and perseverance.
Their accomplishments inspire us that Kushi's father from Nagpur is a student in a school bus, Karthik's father Karthik from Haryana is a police officer and Ramesh Sahu's father from Jharkhand works at Red Fort, while the student Ramesh is also selling sports at the festival.
Likewise, Anushka Banda, a disabled girl from Kutka, was suffering from spinal muscular atrophy...
All of them, with the help of psychology, with the help of beliefs, with the help of mindset, and with the help of obstacles, were the achievements of returning to the world.
If we look around, we will find many such examples.
And something good happens in some corner of the country fills my heart with energy and gives me momentum
When I talk about such youth then I am taking into consideration the issue of Neeraj ji, this is the meaning of life.
Behold the poems of Neeraj ji I would like to hear the songs of the earth in the sky. I would like to invite you all to light. I would like to remove the cruelty of the man with flowers.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes went on a news and two youngsters had realised Modi's dream.
While studying at length, it has come to light that today our youngsters are trying to transform the lives of the common man by using technology intelligently and constructively.
I was interacting with Indian youth in the city of San Jose, which is once known as the technology hub.
I had appealed to them to take time to think about how they can use their skills for India.
I had made an appeal to my countrymen on how to use knowledge and talent to flee abroad.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji, took up this challenge and took up a new initiative.
Using their professional skills, Joshi Ji and Rajneesh ji together created the SmartGaon App and Wise Village App.
This App connects the villagers to the world and enables them to access any information and information on their mobile phones.
Rae Bareli's Dwadakpur residents, the head of Panchayat, the District Judge and the District Collector created awareness on the use of this App.
If you look at this event carefully then we should consider that these youngsters are living in the United States and living in the midst of lifestyle and ideals that they have left India several years ago but they have educated their village, they have understood the challenges and have emotionally associated themselves with their village.
This is the reason why the requirements of the village have been well understood and they have been able to work accordingly.
It is natural for every Indian to have a thirst with their village and their roots to achieve something for their motherland.
But sometimes because of the compulsions, distances and circumstances, this feeling is slightly faded and if some fire is kept in it then this feeling is immediately grabbing it and pulling them towards the past days.
Bandarpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days before the audience, Varkari i. e.
This journey is called Vari and lakhs of devotees participate in it.
Gyaneshwar Swamis and Dukaram Swamis are singing and singing words and lyrics and walking towards Bandarpur.
Pilgrims come there to visit God when they are called Vitopa or Pandurangan.
Vittor is the defender of the interests of the poor, the deniers and the victims.
Devotees from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are filled with pain and devotion.
Going to the Vitoba Temple in Bunderpur, its glory, beauty and spiritual joy are all extremely rare experiences.
I would like to appeal to the people of Mann Ki Baat that if you get the opportunity then once you enjoy the Bandarpur Wari.
Innumerable great personalities like Gyaneshwar Swami, Namadeva, Eknath, Ramadas Swami, Durgaram Swami are still guiding the common people of Maharashtra.
The legacy of these great men is inspiring every corner of India while they are giving strength to fight against superstitions.
Whether it is the lyrics of Parud songs, we get great news about the importance of affinity, harmony, love and brotherhood.
Just as the great heritage of the great saints who made their offerings at the feet of the Lord was in our country, so were the great men who laid down their lives on the thresholds of Mother India.
Such a great man is Lokmanya Tilak, who has placed a seal on the minds of many Indians.
While we celebrate 23rd July as the birth anniversary of Tilak, we observe his commemoration on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak is full of courage and self-confidence.
He was filled with the power and innovation that directly pointed to the mistakes of the British rulers.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was greatly enthralled by the Lokamanites.
On the 1st of August, 1920, when Lokmanya Tilak ji passed away, he was determined to build a memorial.
When Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected the Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, he immediately chose Victoria Garden, named after the ueen of UK, to set up a monument of Lokmanya Tilak.
In fact, the British were obsessed with this, so the governor refused to allow it.
Interestingly, while addressing the inaugural function, Gandhiji said that after Sardar Patel assumed office, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got a good man but has also got a chest, that is why the statue of Tilakji is being constructed.
My dear countrymen, the special feature of this shrine is that this shrine is rarely seen in which he is sitting in the chair, and the shrine is engraved on it as my birthright.
I am sharing with you about the period of our years by the British.
Because of the efforts made by Lokmanya Tilak, there has been a tradition of celebrating the social festival.
Our ancient traditions and our brave heroes of history are still very inspiring in our younger generation.
Today, in almost all the streets of many cities, we can see the tables of worshipping the heroes.
I want every city to have exclusive competitions on the occasion of Eco-friendly Ganapathy Festival in which awards should be given and widespread publicity should be made on MyGov, Narendra Modi App and environment friendly Ganesh Ganesh Ganesh Gangetic events.
I will surely take your views to the people.
Every Indian should have goodwill and the benefits of development.
This will create a New India.
On the 23rd of July, 50 years after the birth of Tilak, another son of Mother India was born.
He dedicated his life to the nation for breathing a free air.
I am talking about Chandrasekhar Azad Ji.
Any young man in India will be inspired by these inspiring words: "Revolution is in our hearts, we will see the power of the enemies, these poems have been a source of inspiration for many youngsters like Ashfaqullah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azad's vision and independence had inspired many youngsters.
Asad ji risked his life, but did not bow to the foreign rule.
I had a great deal to visit the village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh, Alirajpur.
Once again I convey my heartfelt condolences to these two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak and Chandrasekhar Azad.
Hima Das, India's hero and farmer's daughter, has won a gold medal in the 400 meter race in the world-class championships held in Finland a few days ago.
Ekta Bayan, another woman from the country, has written to my letter via email from Indonesia and is now preparing for the Asian Games.
"It is a moment of great pride in the life of one of the heroes that I am proud to be holding the Tricolour on the world stage," Ekta said in his Electricity.
Ekta, we all are proud of you.
You are proud of the country.
In Tunisia, Grand Prix, a world-class champion for Persons with Disabilities, won Ekta Gold and Bronze in 2018.
His achievement is that he has transformed the challenge of disability into a means of success.
Because of the road accident in 2003, Ekta Bayan's lower organs of his body were inactive, but he did not lose his chest, strengthened himself and achieved a number of goals.
Another handicapped person, Yogesh Kaduniya, who has won a Gold in Berlin Championships - Grand Break, has won a Gold in Berlin, and Sundar Singh Gurjar ji has won a Gold in Berlin Championships.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to Ekta Bayan ji, Yogesh Kaduniya ji and Sunder Singh ji for their self-confidence and unwavering sacrifice.
You have to move further, play more, shout fun.
My dear countrymen, several events and celebrations of history are in full swing in August but due to the weather sometimes diseases also take place at home.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to you all for your good health and for this month of August and for the centuries-long celebrations.
Once again, we will definitely meet in Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, a historic cricket match took place in Bangalore.
You all must have understood that I mention the taste competition between India and Afghanistan.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that this is the first international test for Afghanistan and the historic test of Afghanistan has happened with India.
Afghan President Ashraf Kani ji also tagged me and said, The people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I express my gratitude to our Indian friends for creating a platform for our sportspersons to showcase their talents.
Rashid is a representative of the special features of Afghanistan.
This dance will be an unforgettable one for all.
I consider it special because it is the first play, on one hand it is worth remembering but for another reason.
The Indian team has shown an unprecedented image throughout the world.
We can understand the nature of sportspersons from this event.
This shows that sports is a wonderful way to connect the world and showcase the skills and talents of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I am confident that in the coming days, we will play with each other in the spirit of sports and development.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, when we celebrated the 4th International Yoga Day, the entire world was connected with it.
I am told that for the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic programme of Yoga has been organised in which women have made a large number of seats.
At the highest peaks in Ladakh, Indian and Chinese soldiers were jointly trained in Yoga.
Some of the soldiers were also trained in the submarine.
Likewise, some soldiers used to study Yoga on the snowy peaks of Siachen.
Our soldiers of the Air Force, in the middle, performed Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth and surprised everyone.
The point to be noted is that they did not do this to sit on the plane, but did it floating in the sky.
Yoga has been conducted everywhere in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and sports grounds.
A scene of Ahmedabad touched the heart.
There were about 750 differently abled brothers and sisters in one place, and together they got the world over with Yoga.
Without any restrictions on caste, religion and geography, Yoga has done the job of connecting all the people of the world and we have lived for centuries with the feeling that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam and the whole world is united.
Moreover, people will make it a part of their lives.
We are reminded of the doctors in times of distress
But on this day we celebrate the services, dedication and achievements of doctors, I express my gratitude to them.
The doctors of our country have placed their seals all over the world because of their capabilities.
While the medical industry is skilled and hardworking, our doctors are known for solving complex medical problems.
India is a land of enriched historical heritage that has not been a day or month of historical events.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th.
You know why Kabirdasar visited Maghar.
Prince Kabir Das had stressed on social unity, peace and brotherhood through his poetic forms of Sakhis and Dohas.
This was his objective.
We can see this goal in his works and it is equally inspiring in today's world.
Listen to her Doha - Kabir Soyi Peer Hai, Jo Jane Bar Peer, Jo Bhara Peer Na Janahi, So Ka Peer Peer.
Kabir Dasar stressed on social harmony.
In another Doha, what he says is...
For where there is grief and blackness, there is sin.
He is also known as Jadi Napucho Sadhu Ki and Pooch Legie Gyan.
Neither ask you of the saints what is their goal: ask them wisdom.
His appeal to the people is to accept and respect the people through their wisdom, beyond casteism.
His comments have been affecting centuries and even today.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji will say that the service done to the poor and the needy is a service to God.
Wherever he goes, there is a lot of social gains.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had introduced the cooking system of Langar.
550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to participate in this with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
India's freedom struggle was far-reaching, widespread, deep and full of sacrifices.
There is another history associated with Punjab.
The Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 2019 is going to take 100 years, which is a matter of shame for humanity.
My dear countrymen, Raman Kumar ji from Rohini, Delhi and Dr.
Raman ji, first of all, I express my gratitude to you.
I am very enthusiastic about your interest in India's growth.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji on 23rd June.
In 1937, Dr.
Only a few people would know that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had spoken in Bengali at the convocation ceremony of Kolkata University at the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Ji.
This is the first time that the British had addressed the Bangla language convocation at Kolkata University during their reign.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industrial Minister of India and in fact, he had laid the foundation for Indias industrial development and had laid the foundation for a strong foundation then it was not surprising.
In the first industrial policy of Independent India, which came out in 1948, an unprecedented seal of his thoughts and vision was unfolded.
Dr.
Mukherjees dream is to make India self-reliant and self-reliant in every sector.
He said that while India is nurturing big industries, it should also focus on medium and small scale industries, industries, weaving and slum industries.
During the period from 1948 to 1950, he created the Board of Artisans, Board of Agricultural Affairs, Board of Agricultural Affairs, Board of Agricultural Costs and Board of Rural Industries to provide financial and institutional avenues for holistic development of MSMEs.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Jis contribution.
He was a stalwart of the development of West Bengal.
As a result of his understanding, intellectual and constructive work, a large part of Bengal was saved and part of India.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video bridge.
There was an opportunity to go beyond the files and directly get to know about the changes in life.
While knowing about an ordinary man... his simple words, his language of experience, his events gave him an annual turn.
Women from far-flung villages are providing pension to passport services to senior citizens in villages through Public Service Centre.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister has collected sita fruits and is selling ice cream.
Like the Ajan Prakash of Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters of the country are performing pharmaceuticals and are going to nearby villages to provide cheaper medicines.
Schoolchildren from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa have been working on important topics such as waste management in their schooling labs.
Throughout this programme, even more than the success of the government, I was able to see and live the things about the success of the common man, the power of the country, the power of the dreams of a New India and the capability of a New India.
On the contrary, there are some people in the society - unless they talk about disappointment, unless they are unaware of inability, unless they incite distrust, unless they seek a path of unity and not a path of diversity.
In such a scenario, when we talk about the events in our lives with the common man, with new hopes and new zeal, I don't consider this as a tribute to the government.
The story of a small girl from a remote village becomes a source of inspiration for 125 crore countrymen.
I am grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people were connected through this video bridge programme and you have given me the task of giving me new energy.
I once again want to express my gratitude to all of you.
I have always seen that if we look around, somewhere or some good thing will definitely appear in our eyes.
There are people who understand good.
We can also draw the fragrance of good things.
In the past, one thing attracted my attention and it was a wonderful combination.
On the one hand there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand there are agricultural brothers and sisters associated with agriculture.
The farmers connected themselves with the schemes and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Experts and engineers trained the farmers through this charity to learn new techniques of farming, how to do organic farming and how to cultivate crops along with one barley in the fields.
Today they are not only cultivating vegetables but also selling their vegetables through this charity and selling them at affordable prices.
In another way, I am happy that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, engineers and technicians leave their circles and join the farmers and connect themselves with the villages to work together with fields and crops.
Friends
Your youth is truly enthusiastic to any young man.
Other youngsters of the country will definitely visit their portal and take care of their work and they will also get inspired about how they can work in different fields of society in their respective areas.
A dream for all of our countrymen and a nation is the same tax.
If anyone has to appreciate the implementation of the same tax revision system, then I would like to congratulate the states as I am.
So far, 27 GST meetings have been held, people with diverse political views, people from different states participated and states with different priorities participated.
Before the implementation, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax is being changed.
The victory for the GST currencies is a celebration of currency operations.
As a result, checkpoints have come to an end, freight traffic is going on at a rapid pace, thus saving time and making substantial profits in the goods sector.
Perhaps the world's largest tax reform.
Normally, such a massive reform, such a great nation, as such a large population, was thought to take 5 to 7 years to maintain it completely.
And as such, it has been a big success and it has been achieved by 125 crore countrymen.
My best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Hello.
Once again I have got the opportunity to meet you all through Mann Ki Baat.
I am sure that a team of six women commanders of the Indian Navy has been on a sea trip for months.
They have travelled across many oceans and many seas and crossed about 22,000 seas.
This has happened for the first time in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet these women gems and listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate them for their excellent work in the field of adventure, naval pride and the country's significance, especially for proving that the women of India do not belong to anybody in the world.
Who does not know the adventurous feelings
For centuries, the peak of the Everest has been a challenge to humanity and the sufficient ones have been facing this challenge.
On 16th May, a group of five tribal students from an Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, including Manisha Turuve, Pramesh Ale, Umanand Matvi, Kavidas Kathmode and Vikas Soyam, climbed to the highest peak in the world.
The students of Ashram School started their training in August 2017 at Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youngsters were selected under the training programme of Shaurya Mission
In accordance with the name, they have made the nation proud at the peak of the Everest.
I heartily congratulate the people of Chandrapur and my young friends.
Accordingly, a 16-year-old girl from India, Shivangi singer from Nepal, has reached the peak of Everest.
Many congratulations to Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj ji and his daughter Diya will join the first fathers and daughters of India who touched the Everest.
It is not that some young people are climbing the Everest height.
On May 19, Sangeeta Behl ji was more than 50 years old and climbed the Everest Summit.
Some of the climbers on the Everest peak have shown that they have ability and emotion.
In the past, a team of Border Police Forces (BPGs) climbed to the Everest Summit under Swachh Ganga Abhiyan and under the Clean Ganga Mission, but when they landed, they also brought the garbage dumps in their hands.
While this is a matter of commendation, this activity highlights the vision of the environment for cleanliness.
For years, people have climbed the Everest summit and many of them have succeeded.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the brave soldiers, especially women.
My dear countrymen, especially my dear young friends, I didn't even imagine that when I had talked about Fit India two months ago, there would be so many responses to it.
I didn't even think that all sections of the society would support it.
When I talk about Fit India, I acknowledge that the more we are sportspersons, the more the country will be involved in sports.
In the social media, people are sharing fitness challenges, i.e. physical challenges, tagging each other and challenging each other.
Today everyone is coming together with this mission called Fit India.
Whether they are filmmakers, sportspersons, the common man of the country, soldiers, school teachers, India is also committed everywhere.
I believe that such a challenge helps us to keep ourselves intact and inspire others to make ourselves fit.
Savi Yadav, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that sports played on the streets were part of every child's life and they are close today.
In particular, these sports were an excellent part of the summer holidays.
At dusk, after dinner, children will play for hours without any concern or concern
Some of these games were played by the entire family.
From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, these games were part of the childhood.
Yes, they may have been called by different names in different places.
So-called in part 7stones, for instance, the game is known by many names Lahouri, Bittu, Satolia, Tigori and Sadodia.
We can see unity in these sports in the background of the diversity of our country.
The same sports is known in different names at different places.
I am from Gujarat and I know about a game called Somal-Isto.
It is played on a 8 x 8 square vessel with a bundle or a mattress.
This was played in almost all the states.
In Karnataka, they call it 'Saukhabara' and 'Atu' in Madhya Pradesh which is called 'Baghitakali' in Kerala, 'Sampal in Maharashtra', 'Tamil Nadu' and 'Sangpo' in Rajasthan.
I don't know anything in every state but after playing, I came to know that we have played this thing too.
Are there any of us who don't dancing with kickbacks and gulls
It is known by various names in different parts of the country .
In Andhra Pradesh, it is called Kotibilla or Karabilla and in Odisha it is called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Vitthalu.
When everyone winds, when everyone plays, we can express the unique characteristics that we have.
You can see that many children are bitter, but when they play, they become very fond of them.
They themselves express themselves, they seem to be very deep, and there is a hidden childhood in them.
Determining the goals, how to achieve the psychology, how to create a team spirit and how to help each other.
I can see that our traditional sports are now being used in training programmes related to business management, to improve overall personality and to develop mutual skills.
Children to the elderly, when everyone plays together, they ask for a generation gap, it disappears in vain.
At the same time we are able to understand our culture and traditions.
Several sports provide awareness about society and environment.
Animation films can be produced, played on the streets and in the potholes, and they will see, play and grow these games for our new generation.
My dear countrymen, India is officially organising World Environment Day Celebrations on June 5th.
This time the theme is Beat Plastic Pollution (BEAT PLASTIC POLUTION).
I urge you all to understand the importance of this theme and make a decision to avoid using polythene and low quality plastic and to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on nature, on wildlife and on our health.
Enter the World Environment Day wed-india-2018, where many suggestions have been made in a very interesting manner - see, know and try to adopt them in your everyday life.
When there is extreme heat, when there is flood, when there is no rain, when there is unbearable cold, everybody becomes an expert, they talk about global warming, climate change, etc.
Over the past few weeks, we have seen dust and strong winds blowing in many parts of the country and also heavy rainfall. This is not a natural season.
This has led to the loss of lives.
All these are the main consequences of climate change
Our culture and our traditions have not taught us to fight with nature.
We must live in harmony with nature and live in harmony with nature.
Gandhiji had put forward this thing in every step of his life.
We will make arrangements for the maintenance of trees not only by stopping them but by growing up and growing them.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
The world has repeatedly enjoyed the message of Yoga and harmonious society for unity.
Yoga is a psychologist and it always protects us like a father.
For example, it is a feeling that it is like a mother to a child and mental peace becomes our lasting friend.
By constantly learning Yoga, the poetry is our children, kindness is our sister, psychology is our brother, the earth is our bed and wisdom is our hunger.
If so many qualities are one's comrades, then the yogi wins victory over all kinds of fears.
Once again I invite all the countrymen to take forward the Yoga tradition and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is 27th May, the commemoration of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India.
I salute Panditji.
In May this year, it is related to someone else, he is the brave chakra.
In 1857, during the same month of May, our countrymen showed their strength against the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and peasants fought against injustice and expressed their resolve.
The sad fact is that for a long time, what happened in 1857 was either a riot or a soldier's riot.
In fact, it is not merely an underestimation of that event but an attempt to humiliate our self-respect and self-respect.
Veer Savarkar wrote that in 1857, it was not just a riot, it was the first war of independence.
In collaboration with Savarkar, many freedom fighters celebrated its 50th anniversary in India House, London.
He is an expert in handling both weapons and weapons.
We generally know Veer Savarkar for his bravery and his struggle against British imperialism
But apart from all this, he has always strengthened the amazing poet, social reformer and unity.
I remember that Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had said about Chavarkar ji.
He was an understanding poet and a brave revolutionary.
I convey my best wishes for the bright future of our women's aspirations and aspirations.
If you are determined to achieve something then you will be able to achieve success by crossing all hurdles.
It is a story of some people who have dedicated themselves to realising the dreams of others, who live in the slums of Cuttack, Odisha.
Prakash Rao is theirs.
You will be surprised to know that a simple man who sells tea today is bringing the lamp of education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He provides all facilities like education, health and food to all the children coming to school.
I congratulate Prakash Rao Ji for his tireless work, his vision and for giving a new direction to the lives of the poor children.
He has removed the darkness in their lives.
Who knows not the scripture of Damaso Maa Jyotirgamya
But if a person who did it, he would have done it.
His life is an ideal for all of us, for society and for the entire country.
There may be such incidents of inspiration around you.
And they shall wait a few more days for the visit of Bachhandra.
I am confident that everybody will celebrate this occasion with great enthusiasm, and on this occasion children will receive a specially good Eagle Prize.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th to 15th April, 2018.
71 countries of the world including India participated in the event.
You can imagine what kind of atmosphere is there when thousands of sportspersons from all over the world are participating.
If there is an atmosphere of enthusiasm, expectation, inspiration, aspirations and aspirations that should be achieved then can there be any person who has no effect on it
..India has achieved an unprecedented achievement.
Whether it is a matter of pride for the soldiers to win medals, it is a matter of pride for the entire nation and for all the people of the country.
Encouragement and motivation thrive.
We are all united with the same feelings.
I have no words to express this feeling.
But I want to share with you what these sportspersons have told me.
If I say it is a matter of fact, many things have happened for the first time.
This time, all the Indian Wrestlers who participated in the Commonwealth Games have won medals.
Manika Bhadra has won medals in all her stakeholders.
This is the first Indian woman to win a gold medal in the Table Tennis Single Window.
India got the largest gold shooting competition.
India's only Para Power Lifter won a medal at the Sachin Chaudhary Commonwealth Games.
Moreover, if the competitions were special, the majority of the winners were women.
Whether it was a skull, a gun, a weightlift, a gunshot or a gunshot, the women's boyfriends played very well and showcased their skills.
The final contest of the Football will be held between Indias two heroes Saina Nehwal and B.
V.
Sindhu was accompanied.
I was asking you to join Fit India and come to the leadership.
I am very happy that people have joined this movement with great enthusiasm.
Many have written letters expressing their support for this and shared important issues related to their commitment to social media and Fit India information.
Sasikanth Ponsley shared the film he took in a swimming pool and wrote, My body is my weapon, water is my isolation, swimming is my world.
Do you know what Ruma Devnath has written I feel happy and healthy after walking in the morning
As far as I am concerned, sex is mixed with smiles and when we are happy, we have to smoke.
After seeing all this, it is good for many of our fames to inspire our youth in the most interesting ways for Fit India.
Akshay Kumar, a film star, has given a video on Twitter.
His other video has also become more popular, in which he can see playing with the people.
Many youngsters are connecting themselves with Fit India initiatives and sharing their experiences.
Your city, your village, your area, your school, your college, all the elderly, men and women should make efforts to connect with Yoga.
You might have been thinking about how to enjoy holidays and where to go.
I invite you to do a new job today
I can see several youngsters spending their time in learning something new.
The significance of summer training is increasing, the youth are also engaged in searching for this thing, and training is a new experience.
Outside the four walls, one gets the experience of living in a new dimension by passing through writing and forecasting.
My young friends, I urge you to do a special training.
The three Ministries of the Government of India - Department of Sports, Department of Human Resource Development, Ministry of Drinking Water, Government of India - have jointly organised the Swachh Bharat Summer Training 2018.
You should go to MyGov website and register yourself to participate in Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I am confident that our youth will further take this movement for cleanliness.
Send yourselves to you, and send your photos, and make yourselves seem good to you.
Come on
To gain a new experience, let us create an opportunity to learn during this holiday.
Just a few days ago, the youth of Delhi used to present a thing about some of them in the Good News India, who are serving the poor children with education.
These youngsters have started a massive campaign to educate the street children of Delhi and children living in slums.
This innovative activity began with the begging on the streets or the condition of children engaged in retail work.
Beginning with 15 children in the slums near Gita Colony in Delhi, this mission is connecting 2000 children to 12 places in the capital today.
Young people, teachers and people associated with this movement have been working for them in their daily schedule for two hours and have been trying their best to bring about a change in society.
Brothers and sisters, similarly, some farmers of the hills of Uttarakhand have become an inspiration for the farmers across the country.
Their coordinated efforts have not only enriched their position but also enriched the future of their region.
Bageshwar in Uttarakhand, particularly Minerals, Keerry Vegetables, Makachsolam and Parli are being cultivated.
Being a hilly area, the farmers did not get the right price for this
They set up a cooperative system in Munnar village where the factory was built to prepare the biscuits.
Looking at the psychology of the farmers, the administration has also linked it with the National Rural Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are being added not only to about 50 Anganwadi centres of Bhageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani.
Due to the hard work of the farmers, the income of this organisation has not only reached 10-15 lakh rupees every year but it has also created employment for more than 900 families.
Everyone talks about it but don't we have a duty
Didn't we feel that water conservation is the responsibility of society
It must be the responsibility of every individual.
How can we save every drop of water during the rainy season
For centuries, our ancestors have beautified this.
They have given priority to the importance of every drop of water.
They have discovered new methods and learnt how to save every drop of water.
If any of you had the opportunity to visit Tamil Nadu, you might have noticed that some of the temples there have been big books related to dietary system, water conservation and drought management.
In Mannarkovil, Cheranmadevi, Mandiravatti and Puducherry, a large number of monuments are found.
Don't forget that even today, a lot of stairs are known as tourist destinations, which are the living examples of our ancestors for the water conservation movement.
Attalaj in Gujarat and Rani Kee Vav in Patan have been declared as the world heritage sites of UN Education, Science and Cultural Organisation.
In the months of April, May, June and July, we get an excellent opportunity to save rainwater, and the more we are prepared beforehand, the more we get the benefits.
The budgetary allocation for MGREGS is being spent on water conservation and water management.
In the last three years, everyone has been making their own efforts towards water conservation and water management.
On an average, about 32,000 crore rupees have been spent on water conservation and water management across the MGREGS every year.
In 2017-18, about 55 of the total outlay of Rs. 64,000 crore has been spent on water conservation and water management.
In the last three years, nearly 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted from such water conservation and water management.
Seven thousand people working under this scheme have worked hard in seventy days to revive the River Kutte Perur in Kerala.
Rivers of Ganga and Yamunotri, but in some areas of Uttar Pradesh, for example, two rivers called Sasur and Kadheri in Fatehpur district have dried up.
The District Administration faced a huge challenge of land and water conservation activities under the MGREGS.
With the help of the people of about 40-45 villages, these dried sasur and katri rivers were revived.
Have you ever seen the blessings of cattle, birds, peasants, agriculture and villages
The months of May, June and July are coming and we will also take up some responsibilities for water conservation and water management and we will also default some of the schemes and we will achieve something.
My dear countrymen, before the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I have news from all sides, letters and phone calls.

This is an opportunity to reflect on the message and teachings given by Ambassador Mohammed Nabis.
The lesson we learn from his life is to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a man asked the messenger that it was very important to do anything in Islam.
The Ambassador said, It is to provide food to the poor and needy, whether we know or not, to be harmonious to all.
Mohammad Nabies believed in wisdom and compassion.
The Ambassador Mohammad Nabi has said that if something is more than your requirement, you give it to the needy man, so in the month of Ramzan, the donor has been given greater importance.
People donate money to the poor during this holy month.
According to the prophet Mohammed Nabis, no man is rich because of his pure soul, but because of the wealth that is with him.
Lord Buddha is an inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Baba Saheb empowered crores of people on the edge of the Constitution, the victims, the deceitful and the oppressed.
For compassion, there can be no better example than this.
Mercy was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha in wipe out the sufferings of the people.

That day is also a Buddha Purnima.
On May 11, 1998, India carried out a nuclear test at Pokran, Rajasthan, on its western border.

That day, in the history of India, was the day when the power of our forces was engraved in golden signatures.
Bhagwan Buddha showed that the power of Andratama is essential for peace.
Similarly, if we are strong as a nation today, we can be calm with all of us.
That day we have demonstrated to the world that India is capable of achieving new goals and summits every day under a strong leadership and a land of great scientists.
We can see the new joy and new joy of taking forward the journey that Atal ji had started before us.
My dear countrymen, once again we will be able to connect with Mann Ki Baat and we will talk about many more things.
Mann Ki Baat March, 2018
Today is the day of Ram Navami.

During the last days, on 26th January, when all the leaders of ASEAN organisations came here, they brought the Council of Cultural Affairs with them.

Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, this time, like every system, all your letters, emails, telephone messages and comments have been received in a big way.
You have heard about the introduction of Samskrit lessons online on MyGov by KomalDaker, I have read it.
Besides being a member of the Forecasting Department, it is also a pleasure to see your attraction towards samaskrit.

You all, the youngsters, can join hands in the mission of a healthy India.
The French President had visited Kashi during his visit to the country during the last few days and the sights of the visit were all touching and impressive.
Now I request you to lock them up, re-doubt them and bring them to your friends.
Anaka, Jayesh from Chennai, many more children and Exam Warriors have sent me their thoughts on gratitude cards in the background of my book.
I would like to tell Anaka, Jayesh and all the children that after seeing your letters, all the fatigue of that day disappeared like a dense snow.
So many letters, so many telephone calls and comments that I could read, and so many of the things I could hear are in my heart.
I would have to tell you about them for months.
This time most of the letters have been written by the children and they have been written about the examinations.
They are sharing their holidays.
They have expressed concern about the water for animals and birds in the summer.
Letters have been received from the farmer brothers and sisters regarding the functioning of farmers throughout the country regarding agriculture.
Some citizens have had constructive suggestions on water conservation.
Over the years, our festivals, our culture and our traditions are being tolerated.
It means that Mann Ki Baat changes according to the climate and the truth is that the voice of Mann Ki Baat has changed the climate of life of many.
Why not change
In these things, in your experiences, in these examples of yours, this zeal, so much energy, so much harmony and the thirst for doing something good for the nation is reflected.
These have the potential to transform the environment of the entire nation.
When I got the opportunity to read your letters, I came to know how Ahmed Ali, a rickshaw driver from the Karimganj district of Assam, had constructed 9 schools for studying poor children with the help of his intense desire.
13 years ago, due to lack of proper treatment, the sister of Calcutta's taxi driver Saidul Laskar died.
He had pledged to set up a hospital in his own mind so that no poor person could die due to lack of treatment.
To achieve this goal, Saidul sold jokes at his house and collected money voluntarily.
Many travellers travelling on his taxi gave a heartfelt donation.
An engineer sister donated her first month's wage.
In this way, after 12 years of collection of funds, Saddle Luskar's brave attempts resulted in
Today, due to his hard work and hard work, a hospital with 30 beds is being prepared in Punari village near Kolkata.
Such encouraging instincts are introducing and identifying my country.
Today, while pronouncing the name of India with great respect, the unparalleled work of Mother India's wealth is embodied after that.
Today, this belief has emerged in the minds of the youth, of the women, of the backward, of the poor, of the middle class.
We can move forward, our country can progress.
A self-confident and constructive environment is being created with aspirations and aspirations.
This self-confidence, this positive feeling will fulfil our dream of a New India.
My dear countrymen, the coming months will be extremely important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why a lot of letters have come to agriculture.
This time, when I look at the video of discussions with the farmers on the Kisan Channel for the farmers of Doordarshan, I feel that every farmer should associate himself with the DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan, see and implement the benefits shown there in his fields.
Whether it is Gandhiji or Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji or Lohia Ji or Chaudhary Charan Singh or Chaudhary Devi Lal Ji, all agriculture and farmers have been regarded as an important part of the country's economy and public life.
Likewise, Lal Bahadur Sastry used to talk about the importance of trees, plants, plants and special agricultural system.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia has said that there should be greater public awareness in ensuring better income for our farmers, better irrigation facilities and increasing the production of food and milk.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Saran Singh urged farmers to use new technologies and innovate.
I had visited the Agricultural Development Festival in Delhi recently.
Interacting with farmer brothers and sisters and scientists there, I have had a comfortable experience in knowing, understanding and knowing about the innovations related to agriculture.
But the thing that had a great impact on me was Meghalaya and the hard work of the farmers there.
This low-lying area has done a great job.
Our farmers from Meghalaya have achieved the record in 2015-16 as compared to the last five years.
If the goal is determined, if the motivation is filled, if the motivation is deep, then it can be achieved and achieved.
Today, technology is also playing a key role in the labour of the farmers, which is causing considerable strength to the agricultural producers.
Brothers and sisters, in this year's budget, a massive resolution has been taken to provide a fair price to the farmers.
Besides, the work on agricultural marketing reforms in the country has been going on thrice in order to ensure fair price for the produce of the farmers.
Efforts are being made to link the regional markets in the village, the gross sales markets and the world market.
APMC and e-NAM platforms will be coordinated while developing the necessary infrastructure for 22,000 rural markets across the country so that farmers do not have to go too far to sell their produce.
In a way, this kind of system is being developed from the land to any other market of the country.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
How should the nation celebrate this festival
Besides, 125 crore Indians shoulder to shoulder and shoulder shoulder to shoulder to shoulder with our souls.

Can we develop new ways
I appeal to all of you to share your views on this through MyGov.
What could be the symbol of 'Gandhi 150'
What can be the slogan
Write to me your comments on these things.
Today, in the health sector, the entire country has gone beyond the usual approach.
All health related services in the country were previously in charge of the Ministry of Health but now all the departments and ministries - be it the Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Chemicals Fertilizers, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs or the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments - are working together for a healthy India and there is no greater pressure on preventive health along with low cost health.
Disease prevention health is not only affordable but also very simple.
The more aware we are about disease prevention health the more it benefits the individual, the family and the society.
Cleanliness is the first requirement for a healthy life.
We all have pledged to become a nation as a result of which healthcare has doubled to about 80 in the last four years.
Besides, work is being done in detail in the direction of setting up of Healthcare Centres across the country.
Yoga has created its identity across the world with a new energy in the form of preventive healthcare.
Yoga assures both physical and health.
This is the result of the hard work of all of us and today Yoga has become a mass movement and it has become a place in every household.
There are fewer than 100 days left for the upcoming International Yoga Day on 21st June.
In the last three International Yoga Days, people have participated enthusiastically in all parts of the country and around the world.
This time we will also ensure that we will also inspire Yoga, Family and Friends.
It should be further popularised by adopting new interesting methods, including children, young people and senior citizens.
Moreover, television and electronics from all over the country are offering various programmes related to Yoga throughout the year
But can we create awareness about Yoga as a movement from now onwards to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yogi.
However, some people have converted me into a Yoga practitioner through their creativity and I have produced three-fold videos like Yoga Pilla.
Efforts are being made to ensure that healthcare is accessible to all and prices are cheaper and easier for the goods.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country and more than 800 medicines have been received at affordable prices.
Moreover, new centres are being opened.
I would like to appeal to the people of Mann Ki Baat to bring information about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras to the needy.
This will be a great service to them.
Heart stent prices for cardiovascular patients have been reduced by 85 percent.
The cost of knee transplant surgery has also been reduced by 50-70.

By 2025, the country has set a target of getting rid of TB.
Today, Make in India and Make in India are working successfully in the country
On that day, Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt of India as an industrialist and his vision inspires all of us today.
Today, India is emerging as a bright spot in the world economy and FDI inflows into the worlds largest.
Throughout the world, India has emerged as a centre for investment, innovation and development.
Baba Saheb had firm faith in self-determination.
He did not want any man to spend his time in poverty.
Moreover, he did not think that their poverty would be averted if something shared with the poor.
Today, Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India initiatives, innovators and entrepreneurs from our younger generation have been created.
Today, a historic effort is being made regarding the waterways and ports of the country.
New ports are being developed on different coasts of India and infrastructure is being strengthened in old ports.
Most of the discussions in the 40s were around the Second World War, the emerging Cold War and the partition of the country.
During that period, Dr. Ambedkar had on the one hand laid the foundation of Team Indias spirit.
He spoke of the importance of federalism, and emphasized the need for Centre-State Governments to work together for the progress of the nation.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of Competitive Federalism - Competitive Federalism - Competitive Federalism - beyond all aspects of governance, cooperative federalism
The most important thing is that Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is an ideal for crores of people like me from the backward classes.
He has shown to all of us that there is no need to be born in a big family or in a Seeman family to move forward. He has shown that there is no need to be born in a big family.
But the painting of New India is completely different.
I would like to appeal to you that you should participate in this movement with enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, there are several festivals coming in the next few days like Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi.
It is a day to commemorate the Jayanti of Lord Mahavira, his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavira who gave us the message of non-violence will inspire us.
Greetings to everyone on Mahavir Jayanti.
Whenever there is talk of Easter, Isunath's inspirational teachings will always be remembered and the messages he has given to humanity are peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion.
Baisakhi Festival is being celebrated in Punjab and West India in April
On the same day, Jute Sheetal and Sathuvaain in Bihar, Bihu in Assam, Boila Bisa in West Bengal are celebrated with joy and hustle-bustle.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat Feb 2018
Today, I will start Mann Ki Baat with a telephone call.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions about science and some have written letters.
Even though the colour of the sea is blue, because of our daily experience, we all know that there is no colour for water.
Have we ever thought, whether it be a river, or a sea, why are you colored
The same question arose in the minds of a young man in the 1920s.
This was the question that created a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about modern science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose was given to famous microscopes, which is known as Boson.
A few days ago, I had participated in the launch of the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence (WAI) in Mumbai.
It is very interesting to know about the miracles being done in the field of science.
This artificial intelligence is instrumental in producing robots, balls and specific functioning machines.
Today, through machine machines, your intelligence is being made even more intense.
This technology can make the lives of the poor and the poor better.
In this programme related to Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientists to think about how this artificial intelligence can be helpful in making the lives of differently abled brothers and sisters easier.
Can artificial intelligence further understand the nature of disasters
Can we help farmers in their crops
Can this artificial intelligence facilitate the delivery of health services and help in diagnosing diseases through modern methods
A few days ago, I had gone with the Israeli Prime Minister to inaugurate the I Create Project in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There was a young man who had developed a digital device
If those who cannot speak, write what they want to talk through this instrument, then the instrument converts it into a voice, and it does as much as one talks to another, he added.
I believe that we can use artificial intelligence in such ways.
Science and technology have neutral values.
There is no self-esteem for this.
Any machine will work as we like.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered Lytt Bulbyck, suffered a failure in many of his tests.
Once asked about this, he said, I have discovered ten thousand methods of how I cannot produce light bulbs.
That is, Edison has turned his defeats into a force.
Today, I am in Auroville, the land of Maharishi Aravind, not only is it a matter of accident but also for me.
As a revolutionary, he was a challenge to British imperialism, fought against them, and raised many questions against their rule.
As a great sage, he questioned every angle of life.
He also discovered the answers and paved the way for humanity.
Knowing the truth, the sense of repeated questions is very important.
This is also the true conception in the background of the discovery of scientists.
Why, why, don't you live until you know the answers to such questions.
I convey my best wishes to our scientists and all those associated with science on National Science Day.
Rabindra Singh from Pune has written about Occupational Safety in the NarendraModi App.
Defence standards in factories and construction sites in our country are not so good.
The Prime Minister in his Mann Ki Baat address on the occasion of National Safety Day on 4th March, 2019 has called upon the people to spread awareness about security.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important - one being careful and the other being ready.
Safety is of two types, one is important in times of disaster and the other is essential in day to day life.
If we are not aware of safety in our daily lives and are not safe then it is difficult to achieve this situation in times of disasters.
Across this, these words often have nothing to do with our lives.
When we see natural calamities, most of the sufferings are the result of our mistake.
If we are awake then we follow the necessary rules and regulations then we can save our lives and save our society from the greatest problems.
Sometimes we may have seen many statements related to security in our workplaces, but we must have seen that they are not following the correct course.
I urge those municipalities who have fire brigade to conduct mock exercises in schools once a week or once a month.
There are many natural calamities in this country, including the chemical and industrial related disasters that we have experienced.
Today, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) is leading the nation on disaster management issues.
Self Help Groups (SHGs) have been trained in flood affected and cyclone hazardous districts.
Till 2-3 years ago, thousands of lives were being lost due to the heat wave.
Subsequently, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) organised training workshops on prevention of the heat wave and carried out a mass awareness campaign.
It was a good result of everyone's participation.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat waves has come down to nearly 220 from expected.
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can be safe.
We have to become a society with caution against danger.
We have been on a flight several times, and within the plane, the Air Force provides defence tips at the commencement of the journey.
Well, was there an information system
This is our experience in every sphere of life.
My dear countrymen, this time the budget has focused on wealth from waste to waste and energy generation in villages through natural gas under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The initiatives taken for this have been named as GOBAR-Dhan-Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources i. e.
The objective of the Gobar-Dhan Action Plan is to clean the villages, transform livestock juice, crop residue, fertilizer and natural gas, thereby enriching wealth and energy.
Some European countries and China use animal fodder and bio-waste to produce energy
But India is not fully functioning in this sector.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen Yojana, we are moving forward in this direction.
It has been decided to enhance the production of natural energy through animal waste, agricultural waste and kitchen waste.
Under the Gobardhan Yojana, in rural India, farmers, sisters and brothers should be encouraged and they should not only see garbage and waste but also look at them as wealthy enrichment.
There will be new employment opportunities in waste collection, transportation and natural gas sales.
An online trading base will also be set up to smoothly implement the Gobar-Dhan scheme, which will connect the farmers with the buyers and facilitate the right price for the crop residue of the farmers.
My dear countrymen, we have heard about all kinds of festivals such as music festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
But a special effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh - the first garbage festival of the state was organized here.
Raipur's inspiration was inspired and other districts also organized garbage festivals for their share.
Everyone shared innovative ideas related to cleanliness in their angle, discussed, organised poems.
There was an atmosphere like a festival that was centred on cleanliness.
This is a wonderful thing that the schoolchildren have played a very enthusiastic role in it.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the government administration for organising this festival in a very innovative manner on the importance of waste management and cleanliness.
Every year we celebrate 8th March as International Womens Day.
Several programmes are being organized in our country and around the world on this occasion.
The Nari Shakti Puraskar is being conferred on the women who have done exemplary work in various fields during the past.
Today, the country is moving in the direction of women-led advancement, beyond the status of women's progress.
I am reminded of Swami Vivekananda's voice on this occasion.
Today, it is our duty to ensure that the contribution of women in every field of socio-economic conditions is equal.
Today, our women power is expressing self-confidence and self-confidence in their actions.
Where women are empowered and all the development and partners of the country, it is our dream of a New India.
In just 20 days from 26th January this year, these women have constructed one lakh seventy thousand toilets and set an example, including about one lakh women committees.
In the lives of the common man, women from Jharkhand have shown that women power is capable of transforming it into the nature of the masses by strengthening the cleanliness drive and cleanliness culture.
Brothers and sisters, I was aware of the fact that in the three villages of Elephanta Island, how much they were happy that we got electricity after 70 years of independence.
Despite being such an important tourist destination, it surprised me that even near Mumbai, for so many years after independence, electricity had not reached there.
For 70 years, the three villages of Elephanta Island - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Senthbandar - had departed from the lives of people immersed in darkness and were brightened.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and people there.
What else can be the time that brings joy and joy to the lives of the people of our country, that brings joy to their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, just a few days ago we celebrated Shivaratri festival.
In March, it is the green boiling fields, the beauty of the flourishing crops and the flourishing features of the mind.
At the same time, the Holi Pundick this month is also closer to all of us.
On 2nd March, the festival of Holi will be celebrated with great enthusiasm across the country.
The importance of the colours on the festival of Holi is as important as Holika burning because on this day we burn all the evils in the fire.
This is a remarkable time for forgetting all differences, taking part in each other's happiness and forging unity and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, Prakash Tripathi ji has written a long letter in the Narendra Modi App and I have been very urging you to talk about all the things in it.
Kalpana Chawla ji passed away on 1st February.
Although they are not with us today due to the accident in Colombia space, they have inspired youngsters from all over the world.
In this context, I express my gratitude to Shri Prakash ji for introducing his letter on the passing away of Shri Kalpana Chawla ji.
It is a matter of great sorrow for all of us that we have lost Kalpana Chawla at such a young age but they have left the message that there is no limit to women power in the whole world, especially for thousands of women of India.
It is a matter of great pleasure that today in India women are making rapid strides in every field and they are sustaining the pride of the nation.
Since ancient times, respect for women in our country, respect for them in the society and their contribution has made the entire world surprising.
This is an extension of the importance given to women in our society.
That's why they themselves have given the status of women power in our society
It reflects the wisdom, devotion, devotion, the governance system of Ahilyabai Holkar, the valour of Rani Lakshmibai, and the wisdom of Aka Mahadevi and Meerabai, and the valour of Rani Lakshmibai, which has always inspired us and has brought pride to the country's dignity.
Prakash Tripathi ji has given many more examples.
Our Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the Indian Navy, led by Vartika Joshi, has conveyed its condolences to the fact that Sukoi had flew into the sky on 30th and had a world-class visit to the Indian Navy at INSV TARINI.
Three brave women Bhavna Khand, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become fighter drives and are undergoing training to operate Sukoy 30.
You're absolutely right.
Today, women are not only moving forward in all sectors but also leading them.
Today, for the first time in many fields, women power is being realized and it has been setting up a milestone.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, met a group of extraordinary women who were the first to achieve in their respective fields.
These women achievers of the country, the first female captain of the merchants, the first female driver of the passenger train, the first female firefighter, the first woman bus driver who reached Antarctica, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Antarctica, have made extraordinary achievements by destroying the conservative threads of our women and society.
They have demonstrated that a new path can be built across all barriers and difficulties with the help of hard work, zeal and responsibilities.
On this path they are not only from their time but also from the generations to come.
They have filled a new zeal and a new inspiration.
A book has also been written about these women achievers and the first women who have come here to know about these women powers throughout the country and to get inspiration through their lives.
This book is available today in the NarendraModi App in the form of e-book.
Today, the contribution of women's energy is reflected in the positive changes that are taking place in the country and the society.
Today, while we are talking about women empowerment, I would like to mention about a railway station.
You can imagine what could be the link between a railway station, womens empowerment.
All the employees of Madunga Railway Station in Mumbai are women.
This time, after the Republican Festival Parade, many people on Twitter and other social web sites are particularly concerned about the bicycle section of the Border Police Force.
They understood adventures, and this testimony surprised the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-respect.
Today, our women power is leading.
It is becoming self-sufficient.
The wonderful work done by our tribal women of Chattisgarh has given me a new example.
When we talk about tribal women, there is a definite sight in everyone's minds, where there are forests, roads and women carrying heavy weight on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chattisgarh have created a new vision before the country.
The Dundewada area of Chattisgarh is a part of Maoist extremists.
The Maoists - violence, repression, bombs, guns and bullets - have created a horrific situation here.
Tribal women are becoming self-sufficient in such a horrific situation by running battery rickshaws.
Besides, environmental protection is also being strengthened.
I also compliment the government administration that has been present here that they have contributed immensely in the backdrop of the success of these women, from funding to training.
Abandonment of the prosecuted, adaptation of changes in what is required.
Over the centuries, there have been individual and social efforts in the country against social degradation and degradation.
A few days ago, a tasty initiative was undertaken in Bihar.
In order to root out social evils, a human chain of more than 13,000 km was organized in Bihar.
The movement inspired awareness about the evils of child marriage and dowry atrocities.
All the people of the state decided to fight against the atrocities and child marriage.
Children, adults, enthusiastic and inspiring youth, mothers and sisters came forward and joined themselves in this movement.
From the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna to the border of the state, this human chain has grown steadily.
If the people of all sections of the society get the benefits of real progress then our society should get rid of these evils.
Together we all will make such evils disappear from society
Let us build a New India, a strong and powerful India.
For the past few years, people have been writing and telling me about this thing.
I too have seen a lot of videos and social media about the beneficiaries of this scheme.
I am convinced that he had got darshan and he had got the idea of getting it for others.
The objective behind this scheme is to make healthcare affordable and encouraging ease of living.
Pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals etc.
The use of medicines, especially those used by the common man, is economically beneficial to the senior citizens, thereby increasing the savings.
The generic medicines that are being purchased here, that is, the same type of medicines are in accordance with WHO standards.
This is why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today, the central government has established more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras across the country.
Through this, medicines are available at affordable prices and entrepreneurship has created new opportunities for employment for individuals.
Affordable medicines, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana and AMRUT stores of hospitals are available.
The only aim behind all these is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country so that we can build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Mangesh ji from Maharashtra is sharing a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
That photo attracted me very much.
A grandson, along with his grandfather, participated in the 'Clean the Morana River' movement.
Citizens of Akola carried out the work of cleaning the Morna River in connection with this Swachh Bharat Mission.
Though the Morna River may have been a river flowing for 12 months, it has now become a climate.
The other thing that is sad is that the river is full of turtles and water turtles.
I was told that the Swachhta Mission was launched on 20th January, 2018 and this movement will continue every Saturday morning till the river Morna completes its cleanliness.
This shows that if a person decides to make an effort, there is nothing that cannot be achieved by him.
Peoples movement can also bring about big changes.
I congratulate the people of Akola, its district and municipal administration, all the citizens who have participated in the Jan Andolan and my heartfelt congratulations for these efforts and your efforts will inspire other citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, exchange of views on the Padma Awards being conferred on the President on this occasion.
Newspapers and television are attracted to it.
But it is a matter of great pride for you people that we have a lot of pride and we have a lot of pride in getting awards and recognitions without any recommendations.
Now it is not necessary that a person should be popular to be honoured, but his actions are identified as his own.
He has been manufacturing sports products from garbage for 40 years, thereby providing scientific temper to children.
His efforts have been to ensure that children do scientific experiments with useless products
For this, he has gone to 3000 schools across the country to screen and promote video films made in 18 languages.
Look at what a wonderful life, great dedication
Similar is the life of Sitava couple in Karnataka.
There is no point in calling him 'Goddess empowered women'.
He from Belgaum has contributed immensely in transforming the lives of countless women over the last 30 years.
From the age of seven, he dedicated himself as a god and spent his entire life for the welfare of the gods and goddesses.
Not only this, he has also worked for the welfare of the underprivileged women.
You might have heard about Bajju Shyam from Madhya Pradesh, who was born in a very poor tribal family.
Though he did simple work for his life, he had an immense country on traditional tribal artwork.
This is the reason why he is respected not only in India but all over the world today.
His paintings have been displayed in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, UK and Italy.
He has been honored with the Padma Shri award and has been recognized as an efficient recognition of the talent of Bajju Shyam, who has renowned India abroad.
You will be surprised to know that the life of the tribal lady of Kerala Lakshmikutty is very comfortable.
Lakshmikutty works as a teacher in the Kalaar area, and even today he lives in dense forests and tribal settlements in a slum dressed by palms.
He has mastered the production of snake charmers after snake bite.
Lakshmi ji is continuously serving society through her herbal medical knowledge.
He has been recognized and awarded the Padma Shri award for his contribution to society.
Today, I would like to mention one more thing that the 75-year-old Subhasini Mistri ji of West Bengal has been selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistri ji washed utensils in many households to build a hospital and sold vegetables.
Today, the hospital produced by his hard work is providing free treatment to thousands of poor people.
Sometimes we should take such people to schools and colleges and share their experiences.
The society has to make some effort beyond all the awards.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
On the same day, Gandhiji returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the inseparable bond between India and Indians all over the world.
This year we had organised an event for NRIs in which members of Parliament from all over the world who have migrated from India and mayors were invited.
In many countries like Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and the United States, the Indian diaspora have been mayors and parliamentarians.
Some of them have been branded in many fields like Internet security, Ayurveda, Music, Poetry, Climate Change, Indian Literature and are making a mark for themselves.
Some people have constructed gurudwaras while some have constructed mosques, they have brought about some kind of improvement in the country wherever we are.
I express my gratitude to the European Federation for recognising the excellent work done by NRIs and for their remarkable work to reach out to people across the globe.
Even in today's era, we are seeing at every stage how true the teachings of the ancestor are.
If we decide to go with the help of a brother, what can we pay a greater tribute to him
My dear countrymen, I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to all of you for the year 2018.
Throughout the year, we have shared many things.
The exchange of letters, ideas and ideas for Mann Ki Baat has always been giving me a new energy.
After a few hours, the year will change, but our shareholding will continue as usual.
In the coming year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
My best wishes to you all for the year 2018.
Just a few days ago, on December 25, people from all over the world celebrated Christmas as a festival.
We can also see the essence of service mentality in the village.
This shows us the significance of service mentality.
In our country, we talk about the unpleasant activity that is, there will be no expectation of reflection in such an activity.
Seva Paramo i. e.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.
The extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji's courage and sacrifice is a source of inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji gave the teachings of great values of life and he lived his entire life on the basis of those values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji, a poet, a philosopher, a great soldier, worked to inspire people through all these contributions.
He waged a war against oppression and injustice.
In this struggle, he lost many things in personal life.
But he never gave up his mind for unhappiness.
Every moment of his life, he gave the message of love, sacrifice and peace
Have you seen such an enormous specialty
I had the privilege to participate in the 350th Birth Anniversary Celebrations of Guru Gobind Singh ji at Patna Sahib earlier this year.
Come, let us all learn from the great teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji and from his passionate life and strive to improve our lives.
Those who were born in the year 2000 or after that i. e.
In the democratic system of India, I welcome the voters of the 21st century and the voters of New India.
I convey my best wishes to these youngsters and I request you all to go and register yourselves as voters.
All over India, as voters of the 21st century, is gathering for you.
The vote is a major impact instrument to bring about a positive change in the lives of millions.
You will not be empowered to vote.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk about the youngsters who are 18-25 years old, who are full of dedication and zeal.
I consider them NEW INDIA YOUTH i. e.
I am confident that the dream of a New India will be fulfilled by the talent and capabilities of our brave youth.
When we talk about a New India, then a New India should be free from the evils of casteism, religiousism, radicalism and corruption.
We must be free from dirt and poverty.
Everyone should get equal opportunities in New India and everyones aspirations and aspirations should be fulfilled.
Peace, unity and harmony in a New India should be our guiding forces.
My new Indian youth, come forward and explore how to build a New India.
Young people between the ages of 18 and 25 can sit together and exchange ideas about a New India.
How can we contemplate our resolutions before 2022
Can we consider the dream of our freedom fighters to build India
Gandhiji transformed the freedom struggle into a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is to create a mass movement to create the highest India of the 21st century and this is a peoples movement for progress.
How to achieve success through depression
Today, a lot of new opportunities are being created before the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youngsters are coming forward and are witnessing success.
My dear countrymen, in the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had talked about the importance of positivity and constructive thinking.
There is a case in English - Pessimism leads to weekness, optimism to power.
Share the positive moments of 2017 and we will welcome the 2018 year in a constructive atmosphere.
I am glad that a large number of people have given positive answers to social media platforms, MyGov website and the Narendra Modi App.
Positive India hashtag has also made lakhs of homes, which has reached more than 150 crore people.
In a way, this spread of honesty has spread from India to the whole world.
The incoming homes and answers are truly concentrated.
It was a pleasant experience for me.
Some of the countrymen have mentioned some of the events that took place this year, which had a positive impact on their minds.
Some are sharing their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live on Face One from Mayurvihar, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
She wanted to study.
I needed loans for this thing, I got it very easily and my daughter was able to pursue studies.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vade.
I'm staying in a boat.
My husband had made an accident case of paying one rupee a month.
Unfortunately, he lost his life.
We are aware of the worst situation that happened to us at that time.
We got immense benefits due to the help of the government and we were able to take a little nap.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
Our BHINNAR was constructed through Backward Village from 2017 onwards.
Because of this, our roads have become very good and our business has started to grow.
My name is Dipansu Ahuja and I live in Saddganj in Shaharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish.
Due to lack of water in our area, we have been dependent on the drainage system of the army for the past 40 years.
Now a drinking water pipe has been constructed for us alone.
This is our biggest achievement in 2017.
There is a positive change in the lives of a large number of people due to the multiplicity of actions being carried out in their respective positions.
In fact, this is the New India and this is what we are building together.
Come, with these little joys, let us come to New Year, start a New Year, from Positive India to Progressive India - let us take a firm stride towards a Creative India.
When we all talk about creative ideas, it seems to me that we should share one thing.
I have heard about the story of Ajjum Bashir Khan Katk, who was the best excellence in the State Civil Services Examinations of Kashmir.
He has emerged from the hostages of terrorism and collision and has been an excellent leader in the state's serving examination.
You will be surprised to know that in 1990 terrorists had burnt his ancestral house.
While extremism and violence were over, his family was forced to leave their forefathers.
He has never forgotten faith.
He had laid a path for himself - it was the path of serving people.
He emerged beyond adverse conditions and finished his own story.
Today, he is an inspiration for not only Jammu and Kashmir but also for all India.
Whatever the situation may be, Ajanje has demonstrated that through constructive actions, the disappointing clouds can be dissolved and dissolved.
Last week, some women from Jammu and Kashmir got the opportunity to meet.
The moments I spent with those women inspired me, this is the strength of the country, these are my young wealth, these are the future of my country.
Every year millions of devotees come to this world famous temple to receive the blessings of Iyappan.
But the Sabarimala temple is an example of how to convert cleanliness into a culture, how to find a way to solve the problem and how to make peoples participation powerful.
B.
Vijayan, a police officer, launched an Action Plan called Punnyam Park Van, under which he launched the Swachhta Abhiyan to create awareness about cleanliness.
This Punnyam Park Van Dhan has been developed in Sabarimala and has become a part of the journey of every pilgrims.
There, along with the hardships, the resolutions related to cleanliness are also accompanied.
My dear countrymen, on the 2nd of October, 2014, on the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we all took a resolution and the unfinished task of our mothers is a Swachh Bharat, a Mass- Free India.
He spent his entire life in this work and tried his best.
On 150th Birth Anniversary of Mother, we had decided that we will dedicate to her the India of her dreams, a Swachh Bharat and we will contribute in that direction.
Efforts are being made in a big way across the country towards cleanliness.
There is a widespread transformation in the rural and urban areas with the help of people-to-people.
To measure the quality of sanitation achieved in urban areas, the worlds largest survey, titled Swachh Survekshan 2018, is scheduled to be conducted from January 4 to March 10, 2018.
More than 40 crore people will be covered in more than 4000 cities.
In this survey, innovative initiatives such as Open Defecation Free (ODF) in cities, collection of waste, transportation of waste, processing of scientific waste, capacity building and innovative drives for cleanliness, and peoples participation in this work will be an integral part of this survey.
According to this survey, different groups will go to cities to conduct surveys.
They will get answers from the citizens by talking to them.
They will examine the use of Swachh App and the development of various service centres.
It will also be considered whether all the organisations have been set up by the cities to make the cleanliness of the city a habit of the people.
Cleanliness should not be implemented by the government alone.
Every citizen and citizen organisation has a big role in this thing.
On the basis of this survey, if the quality of the cities is determined, if the population in your city is more than one lakh, if there is a national level and if there is less than one lakh population then it will be given a regional level.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I want to share one thing with you through this programme.
And it has been brought to my notice that if an Islamic woman wants to undertake Haj pilgrimage then she cannot go without 'Mahram' or her male guardian.
When I first heard about it, how can it be
Why did this discrimination emerge
Over the years, injustice has been committed to Islamic women, but there has been no discussion.
Such a rule does not exist in many Islamic countries.
But India's Islamic women have been denied this right.
I am glad that our government has focused on it.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken necessary steps to end the 70-year-old tradition and has removed this restriction.
I am glad that today, even without a male guardian of Islamic women, I am glad that 1300 Islamic women have applied for Haj without menstrual guardians and women from different parts of the country have expressed interest in Haj pilgrimage from Kerala to North India.
The Ministry of Minority Affairs has been instructed to ensure that all the women who have applied for Haj alone are allowed to undertake Haj pilgrimage.
I am confident that the journey of India's development is progressing due to the strength and wisdom of our women. This is my commitment.
Our sustained endeavour should be to ensure that there is equal rights and opportunities for men and women, and that is why they will progress on the path of development equivalent to men.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic day for all of us.
However, the upcoming 26th January, 2018 will be specially remembered.
India is also going to be the chief guest of the 10 ASEAN leaders at the Republic Day celebrations this year.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering.
This has never happened in the history of India.
In 2017, ASEAN has made it better for both India and for India.
ASEAN concluded its 50-year term and in 2017, Indias partnership with ASEAN reached 25 years.
It is a matter of pride for all of us that on 26th January these great leaders of the 10 countries of the world will be present here.
It is rare that there will be no pundits on a day or so.
Now all of us have celebrated the Christmas Festival and the next year is going to be born.
May the coming New Year bring immense joy, comfort and satisfaction to all.
Let us all move ahead with a new temperament, new zeal, new inspiration, new resolve and progress with the nation.
Makar Sankranti will be celebrated this month on the occasion of sunrise in January.
This is a time associated with nature.
In fact, every festival of ours is somehow connected with nature but in our diverse culture, it is a habit of celebrating this wonderful event of nature in different ways.
If the pleasure of Lohri increases in Punjab and Northern states, it is expected that there will be Kutchi and Thil Sankranti in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
Sankranth in Rajasthan, Mag-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu all these have their own specialty and have a unique significance for this.
All these festivals are celebrated between 13th and 17th January.
Though these are nominally different, their underlying philosophy is something that is linked to nature and agriculture.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my countrymen on these festivals.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thanks a lot, my dear countrymen.
We will meet again in 2018.
Mann Ki Baat September, 2019
There is a doubt that there will not be any Indian who does not respect him or respects him.
He was more senior than us at the age and was a witness at various stages of the country and at different times.
This is a great learning experience not only for our new generation but also for all of us. You are a big ideologue for all of us. Even after you have achieved so many achievements in your life, you have always been primarily giving priority to the development and serving of your parents.
I've got a good feeling.
I really don't want to give you any trouble.
Because, I know how funny you are, I'm gonna see how many jobs you have.
Moti ji: Yeah.
Moti ji: Because of your love, we are very happy.
Moti ji: I have been grateful to you for your continued devotion to me.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all on my beloved birthday.
MOTHI JI: When I came to Mumbai this time, I wanted to talk to you.
We will celebrate Navratri Mahotsav, Karba, Durga Pooja, Dasra, Deepawali, Baiya Duj, Satpuja innumerable festivals.
In many cities, the start-ups of many NGOs and youth are engaged in this work.
They coordinate the households of the people, sweets and food items, they search for the needy and bring them to them, they do this without any publicity.
This time, in this season of festivals, will we drive away the darkness in the light of full awareness, devotion and devotion
The smile on the faces of many poor families will double your joy in festivals, your faces will be brighter, your lights will be brighter, your Diwali will be even more brighter.
My dear brothers and sisters, on the eve of Deepawali, the shrines are welcomed at home to provide many labours and accomplishments.
Traditionally, we welcome Thirumas.
Would we welcome Thirumas in a new way this time
In our culture, we worship women in the form of shrines because women are considered to be beneficial for the sake of fulfillment.
Can we organize programmes this time in our society, in our villages, in cities and in our cities to honour women
We can organise public events and we will have a lot of achievements in our country, in our families, in our society, in our country by their hard work and hard work.
Can we organise programmes to honour and respect these shrines of India on this Diwali
Women who have done extraordinary work may be amongst us.
Some people may have tried to create awareness about cleanliness and health, some may have been engaged in some social service such as doctors, engineers, educators and educating poor children.
As a lawyer, he may have been trying to fight for justice.
Our society should identify such women and take pride in them.
Just as we have driven a mission of selfie with our daughters all over the world, similarly, we will speed up the movement called Bharat Kee Laxmi.
Inspiring the people of India means ensuring the accomplished life of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had mentioned earlier about Mann Ki Baat and it is a great benefit to me that I get the opportunity to interact with a lot of strangers.
Over the past days, Alina Tayang, a student in remote Arunachal Pradesh, wrote to me an interesting letter.
I belong to the Roing area of Arunachal Pradesh.
This time, when my results came, some people asked me whether you were reading the book by the Exam Board.
I said I never read that book.
But after returning home, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times.
After that, my experience was very sweet.
My boys and girls, thanks for writing the letter.
And I thank you very much for telling me the grievances thereon while studying.
I'll obey your order.
What is your experience in your daily life
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend and student Alina Thayang from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you would be aware of the uninterrupted events of the Prime Minister of the country through the newspapers and TV and you would be discussing about the lack of satisfaction.
This time, Medvede's speech, which came to the second in the final race as much as was spoken of in the US Open Championship, was also a few words.
I also heard a speech on social web sites and then watched the dance.
For 23 years, Danny Medvedev's simplicity and talent were capable of all.
If there were others at this time, he would have been sad and disappointed, but he did not have any rhythm on his face, but through his words he made smiles in the thoughts and customs of all.
His speech was welcomed by the audience.
In the same shape, the enthusiasm of the lord and the discipline of the victor had made the hearts of the lord.
If you say that you have not heard of Danny Medvede's speech so far, I especially ask the youngsters, please go and see.
There is a lot to learn from all stakeholders and from all age groups.
These moments are beyond the success failure and there is no point in success failure.
Life succeeds and our vegetarianism tells us this thing in a very special way.
The thoughts of our ancestors are really surprising.
Mani Kanchana Samyoga: Janayathi Loksya Losan Ananda. If a person has the capacity and duties together, he cannot win the heart of any person.
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of the world.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, I am going to say this thing for your direct benefit.
But in the beginning, if we stay awake and stop them, then it can be very safe.
I want to bear this feeling in mind, especially to the younger community.
All of you are aware that tobacco addiction is extremely harmful to the health and it becomes very difficult to eliminate that habit.
Tobacco users are more prone to diseases like cancer , diabetes and blood pressure .
It affects the growth of the brain more by its practice in the childhood .
But today, I have come here to share a new topic with you.
You know, now there is a ban on e-cigarettes in India.
E-cigarette is a kind of electronic device that is different from the normal cigarette.
A type of chemical smoke is produced by shining the liquid substance containing nicotine in the e cigarettes, through which nicotine is inserted.
We all are well aware of the dangers of ordinary cigarettes, but the misinterpretation of E cigarettes has been widespread.
That means there is no danger to this E cigarette.
Like other cigarettes, it should not have foul smell, so they mix a smelling vapor.
We must have seen in our neighborhood that if a father smokes in a house then he wants his children not to get used to smoking like himself.
His effort will be to ensure that nobody in the family smokes.
He is aware of the harm caused to the body by smoking and tobacco use.
Anyone who smokes knowingly, is well aware of this.
But this is not the case with e cigarettes.
There is not so much awareness about E cigarettes.
They are not fully aware of the danger, so sometimes E cigarettes quietly enter the house.
In fact, e-cigarettes have mixed a number of harmful vinegars, which would have a bad effect on the health.
If someone in the neighbourhood smokes, its smell will betray us.
This is because the dreams of every family should not be trampled on their feet.
Abstain from the habit of smoking, and do not take any wrong thoughts about e-cigarettes in your mind.
Come, let us together create a healthy India.
Yeah, you don't remember Fit India.
Fit India means that it is not sufficient to go to Jim for two hours in the morning.
There is a need to avoid such things.
I am sure you will not feel bitter what I say, but it will definitely happen to you.
They did not live for themselves, but dedicated themselves to others.
Such a gentleman is to be honoured in the city of Vadigan on October 13.
Sister Mary Tresia, on her 50-year-old low life, has been an example for the welfare of humanity throughout the world.
He had a great deal of involvement in the field of social service and education.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world today that while we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi Ji, 130 crore countrymen are committed to liberating themselves from the crumbling crumbs.
In the direction of environmental protection, India is leading the world in a way and today the vision of all the countries is on India.
I am fully confident that all of you will participate in the campaign to release yourself from the simultaneous usage of 2nd October.
In many places, people are contributing to this mission in their own ways.
However, the youth of our country has started a very wonderful movement.
When I noticed him about his work, I phoned him and tried to find out about his new test.
For the first time, when I heard this thing about plogging, it became new to me.
Perhaps this word may be of great use in foreign countries.
Hello Ributhman, Namaskar, I am Narendra Modi.
My best wishes to you.
If 130 crore countrymen had taken a step in this direction then India would move forward by placing 130 crore feet in the direction of getting rid of the consumption of wealth once used.
Ributhman, once again, thank you for my blessings.
And I congratulate you and your team for such a new imagination.
Tengue.
My dear countrymen, the country and the world are working in the preparation of the 2nd October, but we want to move on the path of Gandhijis 150th.
We want to transform our lives by bringing about a change in the mindset of patriotism.
I would like to remind you of something beforehand.
I will talk about it in detail in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat but today, just a short while ago, why don't you have a chance to prepare for it
You all remember that 31st October marks the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Thousands of people in all schools and colleges, boys and elders, we have to drive for unity in millions and millions of villages of India.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August I had spoken from the ramparts of the Red Fort and I had asked you to visit some 15 places in India by 2022.
There should be at least 15 places, if possible, one or the other, to set up programmes to stay there.
Once again I urge you people to visit some 15 places in India, please visit some of the 15 places when holidays come on the occasion of Deepavali.
And all this has happened because of your cooperation, especially because we understand the importance of tourism.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to you all for the various festivals in a diverse India.
Just a few days back, I got the opportunity to interact with young friends from Karnataka.
The Times team's newspaper 'Vijay Karnataka' published a magazine on the children, in which they asked the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
In that journal they published some selected letters.
When I read those letters, they were good for me.
Keerthi Hecta from Northern Karnataka appreciated the Digital India and Smart City programme, while addressing the necessity of transforming our education system, the Prime Minister said that in today's era, children do not have a country on classroom education and they are keen to know about nature.
If we give information about nature to the children then they are likely to be rich in natural security in the future.
Reeda Nataf, a child from Lakshameshwara, has written that she is the daughter of a soldier, who is proud of her.
If you are the daughter of a soldier, it is not surprising that you are proud that what Irfan Bag from Kalpurgi has written is that his school is 5 kilometres from his village.
My countrymen, I am glad that a newspaper has taken this kind of initiative and I have got the opportunity to read these letters.
For me, this was a favourable experience.
My dear countrymen, today 2611.
Our Constitution Day is 26th November.
The Constitution of India was adopted in the Constituent Assembly on this day in 1949.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a memorable day for all the members of the Constitution.
They have been trying hard for three years to wipe out the Constitution of India.
Those who read these discussions will be well aware of their dedication to the nation in those discussions.
Do you know how hard they would have worked for the passage of a Constitution for our nation full of diversity
They did so with understanding and vision, while the country was freed from slavery.
It is the duty of all of us to build a New India with the light of this Constitution and with the clear thoughts of those who have given the Constitution.
Our Constitution is very vast.
There is no element of life that has not been found in it, nor is there any matter of nature.
It is the duty of all of us to follow the Constitution without even a single letter.
Be it citizens or rulers, we have to move forward by understanding the spirit of the Constitution.
The objective of the Constitution is to ensure that no one has any role to play.
Today, on the day of the Constitution, it is natural to remember Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Ji.
Seventeen different groups were formed to discuss the important aspects of the Constituent Assembly.
The draft committee is one of the most important groups.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the draft Constitution.
He was enjoying an important role.
Today, we are experiencing the pride of enacting the Constitution of India, in its framework Babasaheb Ambedkar jis impressive leadership has been sealed.
He ensured that the interests of all sections of the society are attained.
On the 6th of December, on his death anniversary, we will remember and pay tribute to him as usual.
It may be recalled that Baba Saheb was a part of making the nation self-reliant and powerful.
On 15th December, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was immortal.
Ayidya Sardar Patel ji had done an extraordinary work in bringing the nation together and transforming it from being the son of a farmer to an Iron Man.
Sardar ji was also a member of the Constitution.
He was a member of the Advisory Council of Fundamental Rights, Minorities and Tribals.
Even though our Constitution Day is 2611, how can this country forget 2611 that happened 9 years ago
The nation remembers and pays homage to the brave citizens, the police, the security forces and the survivors.
This country will never forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism is spread all over the world today, something happens every day, it takes place in a terrible form.
We have been suffering from extremism for the past 40 years.
Our innocent people have lost thousands of lives.
But a few years ago, when India talked about terrorism in the world stage, when it was a matter of extremism, many people in the world did not take it seriously but today when terrorism touches the doors of the country, the world governments see terrorism as a big challenge.
This is aimed at destroying humanitarian forces.
Therefore, not only India but all the humanitarian forces of the world must unite and defeat terrorism.
It is the land of birth of Lord Buddha, Bhagwan Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Gandhi Ji that has provided this land to the world for non-violence and love.
Terrorism and terrorism are engaged in a terrible effort to weaken and dismantle our society.
Therefore, it is the need of the hour to be conscious of humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, we all are going to celebrate Navy Day on 4th December.
The Indian Navy protects our coastal areas.
I convey my best wishes to all those associated with the Navy.
You all are aware that our culture has emerged on the banks of the river.
Whether it is the River Sindhu or the River Ganga or the Yamuna or the Saraswati or our rivers, oceans, economy and warfare are both important.
This is our gateway to the entire world.
In the expansion of the Christian empire, their navy had a huge portion of making it economically massive.
The navy invasions of the colonies and many examples of analysis are still present in union literature.
The vast majority of the world's navy had long since allowed women in war.
But about 800-900 years ago, a large number of women have played an important role in the navy of the police personnel.
Women were also involved in war.
The Church regime had technological technologies related to shipbuilding.
When we talk about the navy, can't we talk about the openness of President Sivaji Maharaj and his navy
Sivaji Maharaj was dominated by the ocean-rich coasts of Konkan.
Several forts associated with the empire of Sivaji Maharaj, Sindhu Durga, Murud Janjeera, Swarna Durga were situated on the seashore or were encompassed by the sea.
The responsibility for the security of these fortresses is that of the Maratha army.
The Marathi navy consisted of large ships and small ships.
His navy was capable of attacking or defending any enemy.
Can't you talk about Kanoji Angre after talking about the Maratha Navy
He carried the Maratha navy to a new height, setting up Maratha naval bases in many places.
Sumitra immediately engaged in rescue operations, rescued many fishermen and rescued them from drowning and handed them over to Bangladesh.
During the floods in Sri Lanka in May this year, three ships of our navy immediately arrived there and exhorted the government and the people of that country.
In June, when the Papua New Guinea Government sent an emergency message to us, our navy helped protect the fishermen from their fishing boats.
Our navy has always been proud of the country whether it is providing medical assistance to Fiji or providing immediate relief and humanitarian assistance in times of distress to neighbouring countries.
We Indians have always brought respect and pride to our security forces, be it the ground forces, our navy or the air force, the courage, courage, courage, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers, they deserve the blessings of every citizen.
The 125 crore countrymen live in a comfortable life because of the soldiers who sacrificed their youth for the country.
Every year on December 7, we observe the Flag Day of the Armed Forces.
Throughout this week, they will flag off everyone as small and big.
The mission will be initiated to evaluate the soldiers in the country.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flags of our soldiers.
This fund is being spent on the welfare and rehabilitation of the families of the martyrs of the war by the welfare of the injured.
You ksb. to know about a variety of methods for economic partnership.
Come, let us use this opportunity to enhance the morale of our soldiers.
We will also contribute to their well-being.
My dear countrymen, 5th December is World Soil Health Day.
I would like to tell our farmer brothers and sisters a few things.
All the food we eat is connected to this soil.
In a way, the entire food market is connected to the soil.
Just imagine, what if this rich soil that is required to be produced is not present in this world
Tree plants do not grow, how can human life be possible
How to generate micro-organisms
The peasants of this country are giving a lot of importance to the two things of devotion to soil and preservation of it scientifically.
It is a matter of pride for all of us that our peasants of the country are associated with traditions while they are in the country and are in the midst of modern science.
When I visited the Marunj area of Dohu village in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh, I heard about the farmers there.
The farmers here have been using chemical fertilizers in the past and the soil health has been affected.
As the collections were declining, income slowly and gradually the productivity of kerosene was declining.
In 2016-17, the yield of Winter crops increased by 3-4 times per acre and the income from each acre increased by 4-6 thousand rupees.
Besides this, there was also improvement in the quality of soil.
Due to low fertilizer consumption, economic savings were also generated.
It gave me immense pleasure, my farmer brothers and sisters have come forward to implement the suggestions given to them in the Soil Health Card.
If we want to focus on the treasure, first we have to take care of the geography and if we take care of the geography then this geography should take care of us.
Our farmers across the country have more than 10 crore soil health cards so that they can properly understand their land and sow them.
We bow down to Earth but have you ever imagined how much impact it will have on her by putting urea like fertilizers on her
It has been proved in all kinds of scientific methods that excessive urea affects the Earth.
How can a farmer bear tolerant when he is a landlord
It is compulsory to revive this parental relationship once again.
Can we assure that our farmers, the sons of our land, the sons of our soil, will complete 75 years of independence in 2022 and will reduce the urea used by them by half
We all have started experiencing global warming and climate change.
There was a time when cold poetry started before Diwali.
But even in such circumstances, there are some examples of the consequences that have always been awakened.
Dushar, an 8-year-old disabled person from Madhya Pradesh, has tried to keep his villagers open defecation free from defecation.
This 8-year-old boy cannot speak, but he took his weapon to stumble.
He arose early in the morning at 5:00 in the morning, and went to the house of his village, and inquired about them, and made them aware through signs that they should not defecate in the open.
Because of this boy who went to 30-40 houses every day and taught him about cleanliness, he left the village of Kumhari open defecation free.
In order to promote cleanliness, this young man is engaged in the task of inspiring evil.
This shows that there is no age for cleanliness and there is no limit to it.
Whether it is small or large, whether it is women or men or women, cleanliness is essential for everyone, everyone needs to contribute to cleanliness.
You must be aware that our disabled sportspersons have won 4 medals at the Rio Olympic Games and have become a champion at the T-20 World Cricket Championships for the blind.
Various competitions are going on throughout the country.
During the past, 17th National Paralysis Competition was organised in Udaipur.
Our young brothers and sisters with disabilities from different parts of the country participated in this and expressed their skills.
One of them is the 19-year-old Jigar Ducker from Gujarat who does not have muscles in 80 of his body but look at his adventure, psychology and hard work.
As a result of this talent, he will now be trained at the Centre of Excellences (CEE) in Gandhinagar, Gujarat as one of the 32 Para Swimmers selected for 20-20 Paralympics by Sports Commission of India.
I salute the younger Jigar Ducker and extend my warm greetings.
Today special attention is being paid to Accessibility and Opportunity for Persons with Disabilities.
A few days later, Eid-e-Milat-Un-Nabi will be celebrated.
It was this day that the prophet Hazrat Mohamed Saheb was born.
(To telephone call) Mr. Prime Minister, I am Neerja Singh from Kanpur.
I request you all to share with us ten of the best things that you have said in Mann Ki Baat throughout this year.
Whether there are elders in our villages or not, they always forget the sorrow and do not forget the happiness.
We look at the passage of the year, we look at the passage of the ideas, we take the decisions and we sweep the plans for the next year.
We are once again trying to remind the media of the interesting events of the past year.
This includes a constructive thing and a negative thing.
But in 2018, when we take our feet, do we not remember the best things, do we not remember them
I would like to suggest to all of you - if you share 5-10 positive things that you have heard, seen and experienced then you will not feel good.
Can you contribute to this
Can we share five positive experiences in our lives this time
We invite all of you to welcome the year 2018 in a comfortable atmosphere, be it a photograph, be it a movie or be it a small video.
We will recall the events that inspire others.
We will bring good things to mind and create a better environment.
Good things give us the strength to do good things.
We will combine the strength and impact of this joint drive.
In my next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely try to bring the things that have come to your Positive India to the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, next month, in Mann Ki Baat, I will once again come amongst you.
There will be an opportunity to exchange a number of things.
It is one of the festivals celebrated with multiple appointments and regulations on the auspicious day of Deepawali celebrated after six days.
Traditional appointments are observed in every aspect of what should be eaten and what should be worn.
The significance of cleanliness in our lives is also bound up with this festival.
The entire house is cleaned before the Chhath Puja and everyone joins the cleanliness drive of rivers, lakes, ponds, worship places and holy places.
Sun worship or Sat-pooja is a celebration of preservation of environment, prevention and regulation.
The emotion of destruction of jealousy lies in the background of this tradition that requires wisdom and this evil character can be a major obstacle in the path of progress.
It is natural that this great heritage of India is a matter of pride for all.
My dear countrymen, the voice of Mann Ki Baat is appreciated and criticised.
Let us take the example of handlooms and handlooms.
Asked how much sales have been made in just one shop, one feels happy and cheerful.
Approximately 680 growth has been registered in Gadhi Prize sales on Diwali.
There is an increase of about 90 percent of the total sales of Gadi and Handicrafts.
This shows that today the youth, the elderly, the women and all the older people are dressed in garments and handlooms.
I can imagine how much it will benefit the wealthy families, the poor families and the families of the handlooms.
Narendramodi Apple Rajan Bhat ji has written to the security forces to share my Deepawali experience and tell you how they celebrate Diwali.
You must have celebrated Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
For me, this time too, Deepavali has brought great experience.
Once again, we had the privilege of celebrating Diwali with our fearless security forces on the border.
This time it was an unforgettable experience to have Deepavali with the security forces located in the Gurez area of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our security forces are protecting the country by facing so many difficult and difficult situations on the borders and I salute all the security forces from all the people of the country for their struggle, dedication and sacrifice.
Whenever we get the opportunity, whenever we get the opportunity, we should know the experiences of our security forces and listen to their adventures.
Many of us are unaware that our security forces are engaged not only in our borders but also in many important tasks to maintain peace throughout the world.
They are proud of India as a peacekeeper of the Nation all over the world.
For us, we are following the principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, a family all over the world.
India has always been pushing for women's equality.
Obviously, this can be seen as a small change in the paralysis, but it shows the minuteness.
As far as ICAI is concerned, it is Indias biggest contribution in various fields.
India has always contributed positively to the UN peacekeeping operations.
Until August 2017, Indian soldiers have served in about 50 operations across the world in 71 peacekeeping operations.
The operations have been carried out in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan across the globe.
In Congo and South Sudan, the Indian Army has provided treatment to more than 2,000 patients through medical services.
Only a few people know that India is the first country in Liberia to send the first woman police force through the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission.
This activity of India is a matter of concentration for all the countries of the world.
Since then, all the countries have started sending their women guards.
It is a matter of pride for all that Indias contribution is not only on peacekeeping activity but also on training those who are engaged in the peacekeeping work of about 85 countries.
From this land of Gandhiji and Gautama Buddha, our immense peacekeepers have brought the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peacekeeping is not an easy task.
Our security forces have to go to difficult places.
I have to live among different people.
We have to understand a variety of circumstances and different cultures.
We have to change ourselves in accordance with regional requirements and environments.
When you look at him, the hearts of all the countrymen are filled with pride and Paramveer Chakra won the award.
In 1989, he was appointed Force Commander for his operations in Namibia, 72, and dedicated his services to ensuring Namibia's independence.
India has always been the ambassador of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name 'Nivedita'.
Nivedita means a fully dedicated person.
He dedicated himself in accordance with his name in the following period.
Yesterday is the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
He was deeply impressed by Swami Vivekananda and dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was mentally affected by the injustice done by the British regime.
The British did not only slave our country but they were trying to keep us mentally slaves.
Keeping our culture dirty, the work of creating a sense of humiliation in our minds continues.
Sister Nivedita re-established the honour of Indian culture.
He raised the nation's awareness and worked towards bringing people together.
He went to various countries of the world and raised his voice against the wrong propaganda of Sanatan Dharma and Philosophy.
Subramania Bharathi, a renowned nationalist and Tamil poet, has spoken of the revolutionary poetry of Innovation, the New Year Prince and their equilibrium.
It is also said that the inspiration for this poem has been received from her sister Nivedita.
Sister Nivedita has also helped the great scientist Jagdishchandra Bose.
He has collaborated through his articles and conferences to publish and propagate Bose's analysis.
Accomplishment of spirituality and science is one of the most beautiful features of India.
Sister Nivedita and scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose are special examples of this.
In 1899, there was a serious Black Disease in Kolkata, in which thousands of people died.
Sister Nivedita started the work of cleaning the canals and streets without any consideration for her health.
He may have lived well, but he continued to serve the poor.
He was inspired by his sacrifice and began to contribute to the service of the people.
He taught the lessons of the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is very surprising to hear that children are also suffering from diabetes.
Previously, such diseases are called piracy, which means that such diseases are prosperous and can only come for those living in a healthy life.
Such diseases were rarely seen among the youth.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today, we know that these diseases are not a lifestyle.
One of the main reasons for suffering from such diseases at a young age is the decline in physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in food habits.
It is also very important for the society and the family to focus on these things.
If you look at these things then you will feel that there is no need to do anything unusually.
We have to make it a habit of changing our old habits and doing small things properly.
Children should become aware of the habit of playing in open grounds.
If possible, the elders of the family can join these children in sports.
Children can be habituated to climbing stairs instead of using liftfields.
After dinner, everyone in the family can walk with the kids in the morning.
Yoga is particularly beneficial for providing a healthy lifestyle to our youngsters and preventing lifestyle problems.
You should practice Yoga for the first 30 minutes before starting your school and you will feel how much benefit you will get.
If I say that it is easy then it can be easily learned and because it is very simple, it can be done anywhere.
There is no need for special equipment or ground for this.
Yoga is very useful in controlling diabetes and many researches have been carried out.
A study is being conducted at AIIMS, which is very encouraging to see the results so far.
We do not see Ayurveda and Yoga as mere treatments but make them part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been many good news in the last few days in the field of sports.
Our soldiers played wonderfully and after decades we have been able to win the Asian Cup.
Earlier, India had won the Asia Cup in 2003 and 2007.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens and all my fellow citizens.
Following the hockey, India has also suffered good losses in the Badminton game.
Bedminton star Kidambi Srikanth has won the Denmark Open and made India proud.
After Indonesia Open and Australia Open, this is the third Super Series Premier Batch.
I congratulate our young sportspersons and their achievements for making India proud.
Friends, this month, the FIFA started World Cup for 17-year-olds.
The teams from all over the world came to India and everyone showed their talents on the foothills.
I also got the opportunity to see a dance.
Sportspersons and audiences were enthusiastic.
The whole world is taking care of the great event of the World Cup.
I was surprised to see such a big game, the energy, enthusiasm and the thirst for all the youngsters.
The world cup has been successfully launched and all the teams have displayed their excellent skills.
India may not have succeeded but the young sportspersons of India had won the hearts of all the people.
All the countries of the world, including India, enjoyed this grand festival, attracted and enjoyed the audience with the footprints of the entire bed.
There are signs that the future of footwear is very bright.
Once again I convey my best wishes and congratulations to all the sportspersons and their helpers.
My dear countrymen, when I look at the number of writers about Swachh Bharat, if I want to respect their feelings then I will have to give a daily Mann Ki Baat programme and I will have to dedicate every Mann Ki Baat for cleanliness.
Some are sending photographs of the attempts of minor girls, some are sending information about the youth's team's efforts.
In some cases, some innovations related to cleanliness are being created or somebody gets the news about the changes made by someone's untiring efforts.
I have been given a detailed report in the past about a revival story in the Chandrapur fort of Maharashtra.
There, an NGO called the Ecological Protection Organisation was engaged in the cleaning of the Chandrapur Fort through its entire team.
The campaign, which lasted for 200 days, worked for cleaning the fort without any retirement, without any comfort.
A series of 200 days.
Your disappointment and confidence will be transformed as soon as you see it.
It is a wonderful example of cleanliness, beauty, social activity and constant endeavour.
Fort is a symbol of our heritage.
We all have the responsibility of keeping our historical traditions safe and clean.
I extend my warm greetings and felicitations to the Ecological Protection Organisation and their entire team.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, we will celebrate Guru Nanak ji's birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Dev was not only the first Guru of the Sikhs but also the Guru of the world.
He thought of the interests of humanity as a whole, he utilised all castes equally.
He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women.
He gave a message of equality in the society, he not only kept his message in words but also his work.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji has given three messages of living a fruitful life - pronouncing the name of God, working hard and helping the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev ji passed a sacred book called Guru Granth to take up his teachings.
We will be celebrating the 550th birth anniversary of our Guru Nanak Devji in 2019.
Let us make efforts to move forward on the path of his teachings and messages.
My dear countrymen, after two days, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel will be celebrating his birthday on 31st October.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's specialty is that he was not only a manifester of the idea of change, but was also capable of implementing it and providing a practical solution to it.
He was an expert in implementing the idea.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel assumed the great responsibility of connecting India with one corner.
At the outset, he ensured that crores of countrymen should be brought under the umbrella of One Nation, One Constitution Act.
His ability to make a resolution gave him the ability to overcome all obstacles.
This speech of Sardar ji is still a focal point of our dream of a New India and is relevant today.
This is the reason why we celebrate his birthday as National Integration Day.
His contribution in providing an integrated form to the nation is unparalleled.
On 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar ji, a Run for Unity is being organised across the country in which many people from all over the country, children, youth, women and all age groups are going to participate.
I urge you all to participate in this run for unity and join the celebrations of mutual harmony.
My dear countrymen, after the Deepawali holiday, all of you have started re-engagement in your daily lives with a new commitment and a new strength.
My best wishes to you all for fulfilling your dreams.
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat started talking to you in Akashwani.
Today is the 36th phase.
In a way, the positive power of India, the emotions, desires, expectations and accusations in all corners of the country are somewhere - however, Mann Ki Baat has given me a wonderful opportunity to connect with the feelings of the people.
You might have noticed that I have never said this as the voice of my heart.
Whether it is email or telephone or mygov or NarendraModiApp, all these things are available to me.
Sometimes, the individual-related grievances, sometimes social problems, etc. are attractive.
Once a month, I take about half an hour of yours but people have been sending me information about Mann Ki Baat for 30 days a month.
I am grateful to the countrymen for the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country in such a short span of time.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered the words of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Thereafter, I received a lot of letters from everywhere in the country, several social organisations and many youngsters were saying that they are engaged in the work of not wasting food.
While watching, Selfie has become a big movement not only in India but also from all over the world.
This is not the problem of social media.
Every girl child has become a new self-confidence and a new proud moment.
Every mother appeared to have to take selfies with her daughter.
Every woman has a feeling of greatness for herself.
In the past, I had participated in a sitting of the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
I asked the travelers to send you pictures of Incredible India wherever you are visiting.
Millions of films have come from across the corner of India and in a way it has become a great wealth for those working in the tourism sector.
Every moment, the nation is on the right track.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something constructively for the welfare of others, for the betterment of the society and for the progress of the nation.
I learnt, understood and learnt from the people of the country for this three-year campaign of Mann Ki Baat.
This is the biggest capital and greatest power for any country.
There has been an increase in the sale of gasoline, which has led to increased employment in the households of the poor.
The discount will be issued from 2nd October onwards, which is substantial.
I once again urge you to take forward the drive related to paperwork and strengthen it further.
We have to bear the feeling that when we buy garlands, the light of Deepawali will be illuminated in the houses of the poor.
We have to do this for the poor people of our country.
Increasing interest in paperwork has led to a new incentive and encouragement to those working in the dockyard sector and those related to carpets in the Government of India.
How to introduce new technology, how to increase productivity and how to introduce solar equipment
They have started thinking about how to revive the ancient tradition that has been hidden from the routine for 20-30 years.
In Uttar Pradesh, Sevapuri Kati Ashram at Sevapur in Varanasi was closed for 26 years, which has now started functioning with a new theme.
That is, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, on the 2nd of October, 15 days ago, we had decided to participate in the Swachhta Pakhwada across the country.
We will unite the minds of the people through cleanliness.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the work and the nation was integrated into it.
Today, the elderly, the children, the men and women, the city and the village are connecting themselves with this cleanliness drive.
I had said that this cleanliness drive is moving in the direction of achieving success with our determination and it is spread in front of our eyes.
Everyone is making it their due, helping them and contributing in achieving this.
Sportspersons, film personalities, academicians, schools, colleges, universities, peasants, workers, officers, officers, police personnel and soldiers are connecting themselves with this movement.
There is a kind of pressure that people ask for cleanliness when they are polluted in public places and there is a need to keep the workers there clean.
This time I had to take care of another thing - it is a matter of hygiene and it is another matter that we are not filthy with awareness.
At the same time, Swachhta is an important thing and it is an ideal movement.
This time several competitions related to Swachhta Hi Seva were held.
More than 12 crore children participated in the essay competitions.
Thousands of children drew paintings with their imagination.
When we talk about cleanliness, I dont forget to express my gratitude to the media persons.
They have taken this movement forward with a lot of cleanliness.
They have contributed immensely in creating a positive environment by integrating themselves with it in their own way.
We are visually seeing how the electronic media and newspapers of our country are doing great service to the Swachhta Hi Seva movement.
A few days ago, one person told me about the 18-year-old Youth Pillar of Srinagar.
Asia's largest lake is near Srinagar, in which he used to remove plastic, polythene, used bottles and garbage dumps.
He also earned income from this.
Since his father died of cancer and died, he added cleanliness to his life.
Pilot Dar, who is younger in age, is an inspiration and a factor for all those who are interested in cleanliness.
The month of October marks the commemoration of many of our great personalities.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, the birth anniversary of 11 Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji.
This year marks the centenary of Nanaji and Deendayal.
Nanaji Deshmukh ji abandoned his political career and associated himself with the Gramodaya Abhiyan. It is important for us to respect his work towards Gramodaya during his centenary celebrations.
Abdul Kalam, former President of India, while speaking to the youngsters, will always present the topics on the rural progress of Nanaji Deshmukh.
He used to describe it with a lot of respect and went to villages to see Nanajis work.
Like Gandhiji, Deendayal Upadhyay ji will also spread the message of human beings at the edge of society.
Deendayal Ji will be remembered for the change in the lives of the poor, the vulnerable, the underprivileged and the deprived sections of the society in terms of education and employment.
If we think of all these gentlemen, it is not the comfort we give them. If we think of these gentlemen then we will be able to move ahead and we will find a way.
In every city of the country, there should be a massive drive for unity and the weather is comfortable and it is necessary to get iron like Sardar ji.
Sardar is not they he has united the country
We have to take part in this race for unity and take forward the mantra of unity.
We naturally say that unity in diversity is Indias achievement.
While we are proud of diversity, have you been trying to experience this diversity
I would like to tell the countrymen, especially the younger generation, that we are alive.
Take advantage of the diversity of our India and feel it and look at its gates.
You can see that this diversity of our country will become a school for the development of uniqueness within you.
On the occasion of holidays, on the occasion of Deepawali, there is a feeling of going somewhere on all the four sides of our country.
People from North India are unaware of what is happening in South India.
The people of western India are not aware of what is there in Eastern India.
Do you know how many diversity lies in our country
If you mention the speeches of Gandhiji, Lokmanya Tilakji, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam then one thing is well known - when they look around India, there was a new inspiration for understanding and dedicating their lives.
All these gentlemen were roaming around India.
Before their activity, they tried to know and understand India.
They tried to see India living within themselves.
Whether our different states, different societies, groups, their habits, their traditions, their sheep, their food systems and their beliefs cannot be tried to learn, understand and live as a student
The value of tourism is not limited to going and seeing, but we are becoming a student.
I have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts in India.
It has a dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many types of food habits are there
If you have every type of food in your entire life then there is no chance of eating the same food again and there are so many types of food.
This is the biggest strength of our tourism.
During these holidays, you should leave your homes and not stop, you should not go for a change but you should go out with the intention of knowing things and getting out of it.
Your life will be fulfilled through these experiences.
Your outlook will be widespread.
Tell me, who could be a bigger than your experiences
If you go this time too, you will take this movement forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences and share photos.
Definitely send your photos to Incredibleindia.
If you meet the people there, send them their photographs.
In order to give a boost to the tourism sector in India, what will be the seven most important tourist destinations in your state - every Indian should know about those seven places of your state and if you can go to those seven places.
Assisted by this, can you provide any information about this
Can we reveal this on the NarendraModiApp
Can we explain this in Incredible India
I would like to tell the government that if many people from a state say this thing then I would like to examine this thing and make publicity documents about the seven places that have been mentioned in every state in general.
In a way, how can we take the tourist destinations forward by taking the views of the people
Similarly, you can imagine that the places where you have seen in the country, which are the best 7 places for you, the others should visit this place and get information about these things. You must send 7 places of your choice to MyGov and NarendraModiApp.
Come, join me.
During this period from October to March, you can become a catalyst in encouraging the tourism sector of the country.
I'm calling you.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch my heart.
I'm a man like you
Perhaps this thing has come to your notice in the past days, in which the countrymen must have seen a wonderful example of women power and patriotism.
Two brave soldiers - Lieutenant Swachhata and Nidhi - are extraordinary heroes.
I tell you why extraordinary people have lost their lives in the service of Mother India, the husbands of both Swati and Nidhi.
When they slide the world at this young age, you imagine how they're psychologically
But the sacrifice was made by Colonel Santosh Mahadik's wife, Swati Mahadik, who, in the face of such difficult situations, strengthened his mind and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and joined the army to realize his husband's dreams.
Likewise, Financial Tubey's husband, Mukesh Dubey, served as a nayaka in the army, succumbed to his motherland's work, his wife, Nidhi, who enjoyed the frustration that she would join the army.
There is no doubt that every citizen will respect our mother power and our heroes.
My dear countrymen, Navratri Utsav and Deepawali have got a big opportunity for the younger generation of our country.
FIFA (FIFA) is scheduled to host a world cup of 17-year-olds.
I am confident that the footsteps will be reflected in all directions.
The interest in footwear will increase for every generation.
Youngsters do not play football in any school and college ground in India.
Come, let us make sports a part of our lives when all the countries of the world come to play on Indian soil.
All the countrymen, Navratri is going on.
It's time to worship Mother Durga.
The environment is full of pure fragrance.
There is a sort of spiritual environment, a fervor and a devotional atmosphere all around
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the countrymen, I urge Mother Bharashti to fulfill the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of the country and take the nation to new heights.
The country should get the opportunity to face every challenge.
The nation must move ahead at a rapid pace, at a time of 75 years of independence in 2022, at a time when India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022, we should move ahead with the dreams of 125 crore countrymen, with the determination to work tirelessly, with the helplessness, with the psychology and with the psychological vision of New India, let us move ahead with the vision of a New India and give us our blessings.
My best wishes to all of you.
Engage in celebrations, spread the club.
Our country was born with Buddha and Gandhi, and Sardar Patel was born in full swing for the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have been respected for the values and non-violence that have been observed in general and have filled our minds.
Ahimsa Paramodharma: - We have been listening to this word since our childhood.
This diversity is not seen only in food habits, habitats and clothes
This diversity is visible in every activity of life.
You must have seen that all our festivals have been organised in accordance with the schedule of nature.
All these are directly related to nature.
Many of our festivals are associated with farmers and fishermen.
Today, when I talk about festivals with you, I would like to say Michami sadness to all of you.
Yesterday the Jains celebrated the Samvatsari festival.
The festival of Paryushan is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
Samvatsari is on the last day of Paryushan celebrations.
This is a wonderful tradition.
Samvatsari marks the day of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
This celebration is a symbol of time, unity, equality and cleanliness.
Greetings to everyone on the auspicious occasion of Pilgrim Chaturthi.
Now the festival of Onam is celebrated in Kerala.
Keralas Onam Festival is one of the colourful festivals of India.
Nowadays, our festivals have become a factor of attraction for tourism.
I want to tell the countrymen that be it Navratri festival in Gujarat or be it Durga festival in Bengal, these are in a way tourist attractions.
Our other festivals have also provided an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We have to think about what we can do in this direction.
Eid-ul-Suha, the festival will be held in a few more days.
At the same time, in New India, festivals should be a factor for cleanliness.
Festivals and cleanliness are associated with family life.
Preparing for a festival is focusing on cleanliness and health.
This is not a new thing for all of us but it is essential to change it into a social fabric.
They put colours in them, one plants vegetables, one puts a piece of paper in it.
Every family is experiencing a variety of applications.
In a way, the biggest exercise of environmental awareness has been seen for the first time in this book festival.
Three years ago, we started the Swachhta mission and we are going to complete three years from 2nd October.
Its positive consequences are emerging.
Toilets have reached about 67 percent from 39 percent.
The people of Jamiat Ulema Hai Hind have demonstrated an exemplary example of unity, inspiring everyone for cleanliness.
And if the efforts made with dedication and dedication towards cleanliness are made in our perpetual nature then no peak can be reached by our country.
We will look for opportunities when we get the opportunity and where we will get the opportunity.
But we all have to join this thing together.
Let us consider this as a preparation for Deepavali or a preparation for Navratri or the preparation of Durga Puja.
Physical service.
We will work together on holidays or on Sundays.
We will go to the neighbouring habitations, we will go to the nearby villages but we can do this as a mission.
I appeal to all non-governmental organisations, schools, colleges, socio-cultural-political leaders, government officials, district government officials and panchayat leaders - 15 days before the birth of Gandhi Ji on 2nd October, we will create an environment related to cleanliness.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
After the construction of a toilet, you can register your name and the names of those whom you have assisted in constructing a toilet.
My social welfare friends can speed up some positive movements and you can motivate them to work at the grassroots level.
Through Swachhta pledge, Success in Cleanliness, the theme-based competitions are being organised by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation for essay competition, short film making competition and painting competition.
You can write articles in many languages and have no age.
You can make a short film and make it on your mobile phone.
It should be a 2-3 minute short film that will inspire cleanliness.
I invite all of you to join this cleanliness drive.
After this 15-day Swachhta Hi Seva campaign, when we celebrate 2nd October, when we see Gandhiji who was accorded accolades, you can enjoy the cleanliness and joy.
Hundreds of thousands of people are writing letters, reports, and many are delivering messages through telephones, which, for me, is a treasure of wealth.
This is a great opportunity to understand the mindset of the countrymen.
I look forward to your messages more than you are waiting for Mann Ki Baat.
I am thirsty because every one of your things gives me the opportunity to learn.
Yeah, I've made such a mistake too.
Sometimes we will not even tell us how many things are naturally transformed.
Prime Minister, I am talking to Aparna from Pune.
I want to talk to you about my friend
She's always trying to help everyone, but one of her actions surprises me.
Once I went to the business complex to buy goods with her.
She spent 2000 rupees without any difficulty in buying a sack, then she spent 450 rupees to buy a beetle.
But the auto driver who used to come to the premises was involved in a deal worth Rs. 5.
While buying vegetables on the way back, she bargained at every vegetable price and saved 4-5 rupees.
I have a lot of trouble.
We are buying goods without asking anything in bigger places, we are fighting against our brothers and sisters who have been working and surviving for retail money.
I am sure that after listening to this phone call, you might be surprised to know why you might be ashamed and you might be sure that I will not behave like this anymore.
Have you ever imagined what will happen in the minds of the poor
My dear young friends, the entire nation is going to celebrate the 29th of August as a day of all-round sports.
This is the birth anniversary of the hockey sportsperson and Major Dhyan Chand, who is regarded as the best in the world of hockey.
His contribution to Hockey is unparalleled.
I remember this thing because the younger generation of our country should connect themselves with sports.
Sports must become part of our lives.
As we are a young nation in the world, we have to reflect in our youth sports fields.
What else do you want to say is that sports provide strength, vigilance and personality development.
Sports, in a way, is a bridge that connects minds.
I would like to assure the young generation of our country that the world of sports should move ahead and that in today's forecast is even more important in the world than in the field of sports and sports.
The FIFA can play football in the forecast, but I can see football playing on the ground.
You can play cricket in the forecast, but in the field, play under the sky, its joy is incredible.
Sometimes when all the kids in the house go out, they ask, when will mother come back
In today's era, if this has changed then as soon as the children come home, they sit in a corner and start watching cartoon films or drown in mobile cameras
Any child of the country who has achieved something in the field of sports, if they have talent then they can provide information about themselves or video on this portal.
The portal will be inaugurated by the Ministry of Sports tomorrow to impart training to select and developing sportspersons.
In India, from 6th to 28th October, FIFA is organising a World Calendar for 17-year-olds.
Twenty-four teams from all over the world will come and play in India.
Let us welcome young guests from many countries through sports festivities and enjoy sports and create such an environment in the country.
While talking about sports, during the last weeks, there was an episode of touching my heart and I would like to share with you about it.
Six such women work in the navy.
Their feelings and their inspiration are inspiring for all of us.
These six women's wealth is also travelling in a small boat, INS TARINI, and trying to cross the seas.
Navika Sagar Parikrama i. e.
They will return to India after several months around the world.
Sometimes they spend about 40 days in water.
Sometimes it may be necessary to spend about 30 days in water.
In the midst of the waves of the sea, our six women travel through adventures and for the first time in the world.
I am also organising an exclusive course for their experiences at the NarendraModi App.
You must read it because it is a story full of courage, a story full of self-experience and I am happy to share with you the experiences of these womens wealth.
My best wishes to these women and my best wishes to them.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating Teachers Day on 5th September.
The former President of our country, Dr.
This is the birthday of Shri Radhakrishnan ji.
Though he was the President, he presented himself as a library throughout his life.
He always wanted to live a teacher.
He was dedicated to education.
While he was the President of India as a scholar, as a diplomat, he was a living writer every moment.
I remember him.
This time, when we celebrate Teachers' Day, can we all take a pledge together
Because of its efforts, the events that have been successful in bringing about change in the lives of every teacher will definitely be there in the lives of every teacher.
If we make social efforts then we can transform the country and we can make a big contribution in this thing.
Let us learn to transform, let us take this mantra forward.
Ananya Ashti.
I live in Mumbai and work for the Indian Research Centre at Howard University.
As a researcher, I am particularly interested in financial inclusion and related social programmes.
I would like to ask you the question that you had started Jan Dhan Yojana in 2014 and today after three years, whether India has been financially safer, whether it has increased the power, whether this empowerment and facilities have reached our women, farmers, workers, villages and huts, tell us what to tell the statistics.
My dear countrymen, Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana has been asked about financial inclusion - this has been a matter of discussion not only in India but also of the experts around the economic world.
I started this project on 28th August, 2014 with a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, on 28th August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be launched and three years will be completed.
30 crore new households have been connected and bank accounts have been opened.
This is a higher number than the number of countries in the world.
Sometimes, if the money is dumped in the hand, if it is in the pocket, if it is in the house then it will inspire the mind to spend the waste.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the amount saved by our poor people in banks is Rs. 65,000 crore.
In a way, this saving of the poor will be their strength in the future.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, those who have opened their bank accounts will also get the benefit of insurance.
Today, a new confidence has been created in the lives of the poor by paying a very simple fee of one rupee and 30 rupees to the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana.
In many families, if a poor person faces a problem due to the fee of one rupee, if a family member dies then he gets Rs. 2 lakhs.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start Up Yojana and Stand Up Yojana, crores of youngsters have been provided with the help of Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, be it the tribals, women, educated youth, or be it the youth who are able to stand on their own feet.
They are not only standing on their own feet but also making successful efforts to provide employment to two people.
During the last few days, some people from the banking sector had come to meet me and they had said that they had got a lot of inspiring things during a survey of how the common man had benefited from Jan Dhan Yojana, insurance schemes, RuPay card and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I will make every effort to bring these things to your notice
These include events that can be fully utilized by even media persons.
They can also interact with such persons and create a new zeal for the new generation.
My dear countrymen, once again my thoughts are with you all.
English rendering of the text of PMs address at Indian Radio Games in Agra
Monsoon is a time when people lose their hearts.
Animals, birds, plants and nature are all blooming with the arrival of rains.
However, sometimes it rains heavily and we are aware of the huge destruction potential of the water.
Mother Nature gives us life and blossoms all of us, but sometimes natural calamities such as floods and earthquakes and their dreadful form have caused great destruction.
The changing climate and climate change are affecting negatively.
Over the past few days, in some parts of India, especially in the North East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal, there has been a lot of natural calamities due to heavy rainfall.
Complete surveillance operations are being carried out in flood affected areas.
State governments are also making great efforts to assist the flood affected people in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and emotional citizens are also making every effort to help the people in this situation.
Farming, livestock wealth, infrastructure, roads, electricity and communication systems are all affected.
In particular, in order to compensate our farmer brothers for the loss of their produce and their produce, we have launched schemes to ensure that the farmers' claims are met immediately and insurance companies, especially crop insurance companies, are able to live up to their needs.
Besides, a 24-hour operational support number of 1078 is also fully operational to combat the floods.
People are expressing their hardships in this regard.
Before the start of monsoon, a training drive was conducted at most places and the entire government machinery was put in place.
The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams were stepped up.
They were trained to develop a voluntary organisation to help in disaster situations, to do what to do, to decide the volunteers, to create a peoples organisation and to act in such situations.
Nowadays weather is already calculated, technology has grown, space science has played a major role in calculating this, which is why we have almost got the right forecast.
Gradually, we have to change our activity according to the weather forecast and to protect ourselves from the calamities of disasters.
Whenever I prepare myself for Mann Ki Baat, I can see that the people of our country are also involved in the preparation of this programme.
This time there have been many letters and telephone calls on Goods and Services Tax
Even now, people have expressed their happiness about this goods and services tax and have expressed their expectations.
I would like to hear this telephone call: "Greetings, Prime Minister, I am talking about Kurgavan i. e.
After a month, are you expecting the results
I would like to know your thoughts about this. Thank you.
Goods and Services Tax has been implemented for nearly a month and the results have started to appear.
I can see how this new reconstruction system has impacted the transport and services sector.
Goods are also moving at a fast pace.
Despite this facility, it has added strength especially to the economic pace.
Due to the earlier separate tax regime, the majority of the resources of the Transport and Services Department were spent maintenance of documents and new warehouses had to be set up in each state.
This tax, which I call Goods and Simple Tax, has really had a very positive impact on our economy in a very short span of time.
The speed at which there has been a paradigm shift, the speed at which there has been a change, the speed at which new records have been laid, all these have created a new confidence in the entire country.
In many of the world universities, it will emerge as a model.
Because such a massive change in such a big way, with the involvement of crores of people, successful implementation of this system in such a large country can be considered as the highest success.
S. T.
All the states have a role and responsibility in implementing the GST.
All the decisions have been taken in a unanimous manner by the Central Government.
The price of a specific commodity before this regulation, after the new regulation, everything will be available on your mobile phones.
This is a historic victory and a historic achievement.
This is also a social reform movement in a way.
I offer my heartfelt greetings to millions and millions of countrymen who have made such a big effort in a very natural manner.
My dear countrymen, the month of August marks the revolution.
Obviously, we have heard about this thing since our childhood. This is the reason that the non-cooperation movement was launched in August 1920.
Then, on 9th August, 1942, the uit India Movement began, and we know it as the August Revolution
Next, on August 15, 1947, the country became independent.
In a way, many events in the month of August are specially associated with the history of liberation.
This year we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But Dr. Venkatesh has raised the slogan to leave this White House.
Only a few people knew that Yusuf Meher Ali was there.
Our new generation should know what happened on 9th August 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, we should inspire ourselves to build a Great India.
What else can be a greater zeal than the sacrifices, sacrifices and dedication of our freedom fighters
The uit India Movement is the most important struggle of the freedom movement.
It was this struggle that made the entire nation mind-set for the freedom from the British rule.
At that time, every corner of Hindustan, every corner of the country, every village, city, educated, uneducated, poor and wealthy, joined hands and took part in the uit India struggle against the British rule.
The anger of the people was at the peak.
Hearing the challenge of Gandhiji, hundreds of millions of people took up the struggle by bearing the mantra of Doing or Death in our minds.
Millions of youth of the country sacrificed their readings and books in the freedom struggle.
The song of freedom was sounded, they went ahead.
Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan have made a major contribution.
The non-cooperation movement of 1920, the uit India Movement of 1942, showcases two different dimensions of Gandhiji.
The dimensions of non-cooperation differed, the extent of independence in 1942, the mantra of 'Gandhi ji' was to present a mantra of 'Desa' or 'Desati Madi'.
The freedom struggle, which began in 1857, continued till 1942, every moment in some part of the country.
This protracted period had created an independent rivalry in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone was determined to do something.
Generations have changed, but there is no depression in morale.
People used to come, engage, go, and new people came, they joined themselves, they used to thwart British rule and made every effort in the country.
From 1857 to 1942, this struggle had set a new stage, which led to the peak of 1942.
In 1947, the British had to leave the country.
From 1857 to 1942, the freedom struggle had reached all the people.
These five years, from 1942 to 1947, were the expression of the plight of the people and these five years were the causes of national liberty.
These five years are your decisive years.
Now I want to connect you with this account.
We achieved independence in 1947.
Today we are in 2017.
It's been around 70 years.
The governments came.
Organisations grew, transformed, flourished and grew.
Everybody tried his best to relieve the nation from its problems.
Efforts were made to boost employment, eradicate poverty and promote development in the country.
Efforts were made in their own way.
We also got success.
We must have celebrated the 15th of August this year as the birth anniversary of Sabdam, 75 years after the independence of the country in 2022.
Remembering the Revolution Day of 9th August, the people of 125 crore country will make a solemn pledge on 15th August, as individuals and individuals - I will do this for the country, I will do this as a family, I will do this as a society, I will do this as a city, I will do this as a government department and I will do this as a government.
Millions of people have to make a pledge.
Efforts should be made to fulfil the promises made.
Just as the five years from 1942 to 1947 were the years of the determination to ensure the country's independence, similarly, these five years from 2017 to 2022 will change the country's future for the years to come.
We are going to celebrate 75 years of independence after five years.
Every citizen, every social organisation, every local government organisation, every school, college, every institution should make a solemn pledge to create a New India.
Let it be a pledge to achieve our goal in the next five years.
What goal should we achieve as a country
What can be my contribution as an individual
You can use technology to take forward all these things like video, posts, blueprints, articles and new ideas.
Let us convert this movement into a peoples movement.
uit India uit India uit India uit India uit India uit India uit India uit India Movement
This is an attempt to connect the youth with the country's proud history and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am confident that you will spread this message very well.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, as the Prime Minister of India, I get the opportunity to interact with the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
I'm an instrument.
I myself read them and I will try to reveal the time I have on August 15.
A charge has been made before me that the speeches I delivered on August 15 last three times have been a bit longer.
I am trying to lay down the rules for me and I don't know whether I can do it or not.
But I have the desire to try this time how to briefly constitute my speech.
I can see if I have a success or not.
My dear countrymen, I also want to talk to you about another thing.
India's economic system includes a socio-economic system.
We should never underestimate it.
Our festivals, our festivals, are not just occasions of joy.
Our festivals and festivals are also a movement for social rejuvenation.
But it is also directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
A few days later, Raksha Bandhan, Krishna Jayanti, Pillayar Chaturthi, then Chaudh Chandra, then Anant Chaturthi, Durga Puja and Deepavali will come together.
These connect individuals and society.
The natural journey between the two continues.
Ah Seh Viyam means that from the point of view of me we are going to move forward.
Several months before the festival of Raksha Bandhan, several families have started preparing rockets as a small slum industry.
A variety of rocks are being made from cotton to silk mud
But nowadays people have started enjoying the rocks being made at home.
This is directly related to the poor artisans who are producing small lamps.
But today, while talking about festivals and the economic condition of the poor associated with them, I want to clarify about the environment.
Sometimes I see that the countrymen are more conscious and constructive than me.
Over the last one month, aware citizens have been writing to me about the environment.
You have requested me to talk about the environment friendly child before the birthplace of the child so that the desire for the child on the soil can be increased from now on.
First of all, I express my gratitude to such a vigilant citizen.
At the same time, it is our commitment to create an environmentally friendly, soil-made childhood molecule that protects the environment.
This time I have said this thing a long time ago
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the upcoming festivals and festivals.
Just a few days back, our women and women have done a great job in the Gricket World Cup.
This week, I got the opportunity to meet all of them.
It gave me great pleasure to interact with them but I realized that they were pressing them on the burden that they were unable to win the World Cup.
The pressure on their faces, the crisis, was bursting.
I gave them a different assessment on my side.
Look, today's era has become a media world, expectations have increased, if success is not achieved then it becomes angry
If the sportspersons of India lose, then we have seen the anger of the nation on those sportspersons in many sports.
They praised and praised the achievements of these women and not limited them.
In fact, the younger generation of our country, especially women, are engaged in a lot of things to make the nation proud.
Once again, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the younger generation, especially to our women.
We all have to take the nation to new heights, take them to new heights and take them to new heights.
Come on, let's travel together, let's do something.
Let us move ahead with the confidence that the future of the country will be better.
Many congratulations.
Climate is changing.
After the rains, the cool air has given some assurance from the heat of the past days.
No matter how much hardships are faced in life, no matter how much the crisis is, we can feel that the arrival of rains in individual life, in public life, in the mindset of all of us is bringing about a positive change.
Lord Jagannath is connecting the poor with the country spiritually.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
There is a word juggernaut in English, which means that a special chariot that cannot be stopped by anyone.
When we look at the Agartadi, we came to know that this word 'Jagarnout' has been derived from Jagannath's chariot.
Looking at all these things, we can understand how the world has accepted this greatness in their own ways.
On the auspicious occasion of Lord Jagannath, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the countrymen.
Come, let us all collectively take inspiration from these holy festivals and share the joyous kajana and take the country forward on the path of development.
In this holy month of Ramlan, we have noticed an extremely concentrated event in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
There are about 3500 Islamic brothers and sisters living in this small village along with their families, in a way there are brothers and sisters of Islamic families.
In this month of Ramlan, the villagers collectively decided to construct toilets.
So they have said that they should spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for transforming this holy occasion of Ramlan for the welfare of the society.
In our country, the states of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already declared themselves free from open defecation.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana have been declared open defecation free states.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the administration of these five states, to the rulers and to the public.
We are aware that if we have to do something good, be it individual life or social life, then we have to work hard.
If our signature is bad, if we think that it should be corrected, then we have to make a lot of effort by staying awake for a while.
Only then will it become a physical and mental habit.
Likewise, some other bad habits are natural.
We have to draw everyone's attention.
We must recall the inspiring events.
I am glad that cleanliness has not stopped at the government level today.
This has emerged as a movement of people's society.
This happened in the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
What is its goal
Out of 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours, 1000 households have been constructed.
My dear countrymen, the public and the government will also be happy to note that they have been successful in constructing 1000 toilets in 100 hours.
in and through letters and aerodromes.
Prakash Tripathi ji recalled the Emergency and said that June 25 is one of the biggest democracies in the history of democracy.
Prakash Tripathi is commendable for their awareness about democracy. This is not just an institution but a culture.
At the same time, we have to take forward the good things of democracy.
It is a dark night on June 25, 1975, and no one can easily forget it.
No Indian can leave it.
The country's great leaders, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were imprisoned in prisons.
The students of today's media world and those working in the democratic system are constantly trying to create awareness and to remind them of the dark age.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
One year after the announcement of an emergency in the country, Atal ji had written a poem describing the situation in the country during that period.
We have to make this tradition more robust.
My dear countrymen, today every Indian feels extremely proud of him.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world is Yoga.
All the people from water to hills welcomed the sun rays in the morning through Yoga.
Yoga was not the case earlier, but today everyone has joined the path of Yoga and Yoga has become a bridge that connects the world.
Almost all the countries of the world have transformed this opportunity into an opportunity for you.
In Machu Pichu, the world heritage of the Peruvian continent, at a height of 2400 metres above the sea level, more than 4000 people were trained in the UAE's Abu Dhabi.
In Herah, Afghanistan, the India-Afghan partner, Salma Dam, engaged in Yoga, set a new benchmark for friendship.
Even in smaller places like Singapore, programmes were organised at 70 locations and they carried out the drive for a week.
This time again Yoga has made a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have done Yoga and have made a new world record.
I also got an opportunity to participate in Yoga in Lucknow.
But for the first time in the rainy season, Yoga has also been a good opportunity.
Even in Siachen with 20, 25, 40 degrees Celsius, our soldiers were engaged in Yoga.
Our Armed Forces, Border Security Forces, Indian Tibetan Border Police Forces, Federal Reserve Police Forces, Central Industrial Security Forces etc.
As this is the third International Day of Yoga, I had requested the families of three generations to take a picture of Yoga and share it with me.
Some television channels also took the matter forward.
A lot of people have sent me photographs and some of them have been selected in the Narendra Modi App.
Distinguished Prime Minister, I bow down to Dr.
I'm talking about Anil Sonara.
Sir, I recall that you have recently said in Kerala that instead of giving bouquet of bouquets in different places, we can give good memorial books.
We cannot do anything to implement this idea throughout the country, sir.
I liked it very much.
I am once again reminded of one thing that has escaped from my memory.
Because when I was in Gujarat, we should no longer offer bouquets, give books or welcome a handkerchief.
We will also provide a handkerchief because it will inspire the doorsteps.
It was a habit when I was in Gujarat but this habit has become a habit after I came from there.
But when I went to Kerala, I had an awareness again.
But when we provide books, in a way it becomes a part of the house and becomes a member of the family.
We can also welcome the offer of cardboards so that how many poor people can be helped
Cost deficit also works properly.
These things have great historical significance.
When I went to the UK last year, the ueen Elizabeth's mother had invited me to the banquet in London.
When I was married, Gandhiji conveyed his best wishes to me and presented him with this handcuff.
It has been years since, but the ueen Elizabeth kept the handcuffs that Gandhiji had gifted.
Gandhiji's very little love has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
These habits do not transform into nights, but are also subject to criticisms.
At the same time, efforts should be made to engage in such conversations.
For this, whenever I go anywhere, if someone brings a bouquet, I won't deny it, I can't do that.
Criticism will emerge, we have to say again and again, gradually there will be a change.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister of the country, there are many aspects.
Despite being immersed in the files, I am making a habit that I have been reading something in my letters and making an opportunity to connect with the common man.
There are several types of letters, and a variety of people write to me.
I feel it is important to share a letter that I have read a few days ago.
Therefore, under the Mudra Yojana, I have started the work of getting money from the bank and buying some products from the market.
In the meanwhile, the Government of India focused on Government e-Marketplace and Government e-Marketplace.
Whoever wants to give something to the government, whoever wants to sell something like electric bulbs, dustbins, dustbins, chairs, tables, they can register themselves on this platform.
And it is compulsory that the government departments should go to this base and buy the goods by considering which goods are available at affordable prices.
In this way, all the departments of the government are taking care of who is registered on E-GEM.
Due to lack of middlemen goods are available at cheap prices .
This is an opportunity to encourage entrepreneurship.
It also has a brilliant nature, it has empowerment and entrepreneurship.
I want all those who want to sell their products to the government to register themselves on this website in large numbers.
My dear countrymen, while we are proud of Yoga, our achievements in space sciences also keep us stunned.
While our footsteps are lying on the earth attached to Yoga, India's greatest significance is that we are fulfilling the dream of touching a far-flung application.
In the past, India has achieved a great achievement in sports and science.
Today, India is seeking its success not only on Earth but also on App.
ISRO has successfully launched 30 Nano satellites along with Cartosat-2 satellites two days ago.
Apart from India, there are about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the USA.
India's Nano-Satellite Mission will be of great help in the field of agriculture and information related to natural calamities.
1000 days of passing is an important milestone in our scientific journey.
Nowadays, we can see that our youth is making great strides in the field of sports.
Besides education, they are also realizing their future in the field of sports.
The country is proud of our sportspersons, their efforts and their achievements.
Recently, he has made India's badminton sportsperson Kidambi Srikanth a proud nation by winning the Indonesia Open Day.
My heartiest congratulations to him and his teachings for this achievement.
T.
Sports play a big role in the overall development of governance.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If children are engaged in sports in our family then we should give them an opportunity.
You should not urge them to take them out of the ground, put them in the room and study.
Let him study, and make progress in it: but if he has greater talent and interest in sports, let him be encouraged by all that are in school, college, family, and surroundings.
Everyone has to see the dream of participating in the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the period of monsoon and continuous celebrations has been the period of creating new experiences in a way.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all and join you in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
This summer is an unforgettable experience.
At the same time, we are expecting rain.
Today, while I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On this auspicious month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the people of Islamic society.
In the month of Ramlan, a lot of importance has been given to prayer, spirituality and devotion.
It is a matter of pride for 125 crore people of our country that all religions of the world are present in India.
We should be fortunate that our ancestors have created this great heritage.
There are people who believe in God, there are those who deny God in this country, there are those who worship the idol and those who oppose the worship of the idol.
The art of living in harmony with a variety of ideals, a variety of worshipping systems and a variety of traditions has mixed with our emotions.
Be it religions, be it methods, be it philosophy or be it traditions, we all have the same message of peace, unity and harmony.
In this holy month of Ramzan, we will be able to move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again my best wishes to everyone.
I am glad that a lot of people have registered their backgrounds.
Everyone wants to share their experiences with me with enthusiasm.
I am speaking with Deepawali Gad.
I decided to study on vacations when it was almost free from me.
When I started studying about the freedom struggle, I realized how many sacrifices and struggles were required to achieve India's independence and how many martyrs had experienced the prison atrocities.
The life of Bhagat Singh ji, who had achieved the greatest achievement at a very young age, inspired me and therefore I urge you all to make a message to the present generation about this thing.
I am glad that the younger generation shows keen interest in knowing about our history, our freedom fighters, about the sacrifices made by physical, material and spirit for this country.
Numerous gentlemen have lost their youth in prisons.
Many young people have kissed the ropes.
Today, we can breathe the breath of a free India because they have experienced all the hardships they had said.
All the gentlemen who spent their lives during the freedom struggle wrote books, reads, performed great tasks and their writings also contributed a lot to India's independence.
Several years ago, I had visited the Cellular Jail in Andaman Nicobar.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar Ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a book Maji Janmade in prison.
He wrote poems on the prison walls.
They kept him in a small room.
Do you know what atrocities the freedom fighters have suffered
Savarkar ji wrote Maji Janmade - Only after I had read the book, I had the desire to see the Cellular Jail.
There they organize a television show, which is very inspiring.
The people of all the states who sacrificed their youth in this Andaman and Nicobar Islands jail, called Kalabani, used to speak all the languages of India and faced many difficulties.
My dear countrymen, the 5th of June is the first Monday of the month.
Well, what does it mean to connect with nature
For me, we are connected and we are connected.
Connecting with nature means creating a better planet.
Who can express this better than Gandhi Ji
Gandhiji once said - One must care about a world one will not see that it is our duty to take care of the world we cannot see.
You might have experienced that nature has the power.
Perhaps you might have been very tired and you might have been able to imagine what kind of freshness you might have got if you take the water and sprinkle it on your face.
A new energy emerges whenever we are connected with the famine flowers of the famine which have created our body.
Therefore, on June 5, the worldwide movement of connectivity with nature should be a movement that connects us.
The Vedas have shown the Earth and the environment as the basis of power.
The Atharva Veda gives us a holistic guidance on the environment, which is thousands of years old.
Mother Earth: Budro Ahmad Prithviya is a case in our country.
It has been said in the Vedas that the cleanliness that we have is due to the Earth.
In our country, be it festivals or be it religious festivals or be it religious practices or be it the neglected, the urban-ruralists, the tribal community or be it the neglect of nature or beloved of nature is a natural life-style.
However, we need to understand this in contemporary terms and contemporary ideas.
I have been receiving a lot of news from the states.
With the arrival of rains in almost all the states, a big plantation drive begins.
Millions of trees are being planted.
We must also contribute this time to the tree plantation during this rainy season.
My dear countrymen, the 21st of June is a day of global recognition.
World Yoga Day is celebrated by all around the world.
The 21st of June is a short-term World Yoga Day, spread across the corner of the world, connecting the people of the world.
On the one hand, while the separatist forces in the world are showing their worst faces, India's biggest contribution to the world is Yoga.
Through Yoga, we can connect the world with one another.
Just as Yoga connects the body, mind, intelligence and soul, Yoga can connect the world.
Today, due to lifestyle, due to emergency and increasing responsibilities, life has become very strained due to pressure.
We have seen this situation in our childhood too.
Yoga will help us to lead a stress-free life during the period of hijacking of unfair drugs.
Yoga guarantees both good and compassion.
Yoga is not just an exercise.
If we want to enjoy such an inclusive journey through physical, mental, mental and habits, then it is possible only through Yoga.
Two days ago, on the occasion of Yoga Day, letters have been written to all the governments and leaders of the world.
Last year I had announced some competitions and some prizes related to Yoga.
Gradually, the work is progressing in this direction.
I have been advised to convey my best wishes to this fundamental suggestion.
This is a very interesting thing.
On the occasion of the 3rd International Yoga Day, I have been told that three generations of the family should come together to practice Yoga.
Three generations like grandparents, parents, sons and daughters can practice yoga and do the same.
Yesterday, as a day, it will be a fascinating combination and a new dimension for Yoga.
Yesterday, this will be tomorrow's film, which will guarantee a bright future.
I invite all of you.
Start training from today, as the International Yoga Day is still three weeks away.
For your part, share the topics related to Yoga, spread and connect people.
In a way, it is a preserving healthcare movement.
I invite you all to join me.
From that day onwards, I have visited various parts of India.
I have been observing that some people are careful about what Modi has done.
An interesting telephone call came to me and I didn't think of it.
But thanks to me for creating such a different perspective.
I hope this telephone call will make you feel like that.
Hello, Modi ji, I talk to Naina from Mumbai.
I often see that wherever you are going, the people there are paying more attention to cleanliness in television and social media.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people are imbibing cleanliness as a movement by listening to your calls.
On the one hand, there is awareness about cleanliness among children.
I have often seen their elders begging about dirt on the streets.
After launching a cleanliness drive in the fields of Kashi, it has become a marvel after getting inspired from you.
"You are right, wherever I go, the government machinery performs the cleanliness drive, but nowadays there is a cleanliness drive at the social level.
A substantial amount of cleaning work is being done 5 days, 7 days and 10 days before I leave.
A few days ago I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
There was a massive cleanliness drive.
I didn't see it connected, but only after this phone call came to me, yes, this thing was right.
It gives me immense pleasure to see all other preparations being made by the Muslims to welcome the Prime Minister, but giving importance to cleanliness.
This is a joyous and encouraging place for everyone who wants cleanliness.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all those who have strengthened the cleanliness drive.
Someone has given me a suggestion.
As it is, it's a humorous idea.
Whatever the idea is good, I have to think about it.
Whatever the right thing is to create a movement, it is better to remove so many tons of dustbins than to give them a gift.
The Government of India, with the help of the State Governments, has decided to launch a massive mission on waste management with the help of city representatives.
On the 5th of June, World Environment Day, about 4000 cities in the country will have access to solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of dustbins are to be provided, one in green, the other in blue.
There are two types of waste-liquid waste, other dry waste.
We have to follow the regulation, in 4000 cities, these dustbins are going to be placed, we have to put the dry waste on a blue ladder, we have to put the liquid waste on a green dustbin.
The vegetables such as kitchen waste, the rest of the food, eggs, leaves of trees, etc. all should be placed on the green waste table.
If we remember the colourful greenery of the fields then we will remember what to put in the green dustbins.
The second type of waste, including paper wastes, cardboard boxes, iron items, glass pieces, cloths, plastics, polythene, broken pockets, rubber products, metals, all these should be placed in the dry dustbins and recycled in the machines.
A few days ago, one thing had come to the ears and Versova Beach, which is considered to be a dirty beach in Mumbai, has now become a clean and beautiful beach.
The UNEP has given Afroz Shah the largest award for this work.
He is the first Indian to receive the Champions of the Earth.
My dear countrymen, for the past 15 days and months, articles have been published in newspapers, TV channels and social media on three years of the present government, discussions and analysis have been going on.
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of being the Chief Servant.
Integrated research has been carried out, with a large number of opinion polls.
I see all these as very healthy signs.
The last three years have been seen in every lecture.
People at all levels of society have studied it.
This is an excellent function in the democratic system.
It is my clear and moral view that the governments are obliged to respond to the democracy and the accounts of the work they have given to the mahasars of the people should be submitted.
I express my gratitude to all those who have spent time exploring our work in depth, discussing and supporting our work and have expressed their grievances. I consider these things very important.
I also express my gratitude to all those who have made significant suggestions in this regard.
Whatever crimes are there, it is only when revealed that there is a chance of rectification.
Progress can be achieved only through better performance, lesser benefits, worsening, lesser learning from them.
Positive criticism strengthens the democratic system.
This discipline and research is very important for an aware country and a rational nation.
My dear countrymen, I too, as an ordinary citizen like you, as an ordinary citizen, everybody feels good and bad and affects me as a simple citizen.
Some people see the voice of Mann Ki Baat as a conversation, some criticize it from the political perspective, but after a very long experience, I don't even think that the Mann Ki Baat programme will change me as a member of every family of India.
Sometimes I feel like sitting at home and talking about household matters.
I am grateful to the President, the Vice President and the Speaker of Lok Sabha, all those who have so many high positions have given importance to the voice of Mann Ki Baat by giving away their golden time.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given me a new dimension.
Some of our friends used to talk to me sometimes while working on the book Mann Ki Baat.
I am indebted to Akbar Sahab.
My dear countrymen, the next time we meet, there will be rainy season in all the parts of the country, the weather will change, the results of the examinations will have come, the learning will start again.
Come, let us all come together in this environment, let us move ahead with love for nature.
My best wishes to all of you.
Every time such powerful inputs come in Mann Ki Baat, detailed analysis is being carried out by the government.
What are the types of complaints and what is the experience of the people
We can generally see that giving advice to the next person is the nature of human beings.
When we travel in trains and buses, if someone coughs, then it is natural for us to advise and advise someone to do this.
Initially, when there were suggestions on Mann Ki Baat, there were suggestions on Mann Ki Baat, it was a habit for many, but when we tried to look at it, I was indeed very happy and floating in the flood.
After I had mentioned this thing in the Narendra Modi App, on MyGov website, do you know what is being done by using innovative methods to prevent food wastage from all corners of the country
I have not even imagined that the younger generation of our country has been engaged in this thing for a long time.
We know that some social organisations have been going on for years but the youth of my country have been involved in this thing.
Many have sent me videos.
Roti Banks are being run in many places.
People of Roti Bank, they offer bread from their side, they bring vegetables and those who need them, they get them.
The supplier does not have to feel happy and the buyer does not have to think of himself inferior.
This is an example of how to work together in the society.
Today is the last day of April.
The foundation day of the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra is coming in May.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states are constantly trying to scale new heights of development and contribute to the progress of the nation.
In both the states, there has been a continuous emergence of great men and their lives have been inspiring us in every sphere of society.
Remembering these great men, we have to take a pledge to raise our states, our nation, our society, our city and our family on the occasion of the birth anniversary of 75 years of independence in 2022.
We have to move forward in collaboration with all the citizens to realize that commitment.
Once again I convey my best wishes to the people of these two states.
There was a time when climate change was only talked about at the level of academics and seminars, but today, in our daily lives, we are experiencing it, we are experiencing it, we are experiencing it.
Nature has changed the rules of its dance.
The heat that we see in the months of May-June in our country this time has been experienced in the months of March-April.
While I was considering the suggestions of the people for Mann Ki Baat, most of the suggestions were about what we should do during the summer.
Although all these things are known and not new, it is very useful to re-think them at the right time.
Shri Prashant Kumar Mishra, D.
In Balkani, they have been told that water should be placed on the upper heels.
I have seen that even small kids in the family do this thing better.
If they keep in mind why they have to fill the water, they will leave it ten times a day and see if there is water in the vessel.
Besides this, the birds shall come and drink, and they shall take heed to the sin of their sins.
This may appear to us as a sport, but in fact, the pinch has been inspiring the wonderful experience of compassion.
In our country, the composite life of birds, lives and nature is naturally mixed with our nerves, but at the same time it is important to strengthen the efforts at the level of society.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, it took 100 years for Dharmaguru Syedna Saheb of the Dawoodi Bohra community.
He lived for 103 years.
In order to celebrate 100 years of his birth, Bohra community organized a massive movement to protect the guru through the Burhani Foundation.
It also got place in the Guinness World Records Book.
Sometimes we are so busy that even if we come to our doorsteps like a palanquin, a vegetable seller and a postman, we forget to ask if you drink a mouth water in the summer.
My young friends, I would like to share some things with you.
Sometimes I am worried that many of our younger generations want to live in a comfortable place and in a comfortable environment.
Parents are nurturing them very safely.
There are others, but most people are in luxury circles.
Now the exams have been completed and you must have made plans to spend your holidays.
The summer vacation will be a bit sweet after the heat is over.
I would like to give three suggestions to you people to make use of your vacation time and all the three of them are special, but I would like to make an effort to do something of them.
Take a new experience, strive and acquire a new skill and go to a place where nobody has ever heard, no, no, no, no, no, no.
New places, new experiences and new skills will be available.
The test must be positive, come out of your comfortable circle.
We belong to middle class families and are a comfortable family.
In the evening, take your kids, your kids or your kids or take other sports and take them to the neighbourhood.
Look at the joy of playing with the poor kids there and you will realise that you have not got the joy of playing in your life so far.
Have you imagined how a big change will be brought about in the lives of such poor children when they get the pleasure of playing with you
If you go once, you'd like to go there again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many volunteers are engaged in service.
You should associate yourselves with a cowherd guru, you should associate yourselves with some or the other organization for 15 days and 20 days.
Sometimes summer camps will be organised, governance development camps will be organised and various constructive camps will be organised and you will get connected with them.
After you have been trained in such camps, you should teach the poor that you have learnt as a service free of cost and that you have not got the opportunity to learn these things.
You can teach them how to do it.
Though technology has been used to reduce distances and to destroy the borders, the evil consequences of these things are scattering my mind.
Six people in the same house are sitting in one room, but they can't even imagine the distance between them.
Why
Everyone is immersed in technology.
Social nature is a good value, social nature is an efficiency.
Another thing that I have told you is about talent and dont you want to learn something new
Sometimes there is a fear that our younger generation is turning into robots.
Friends, the dreams we see in life are all good things.
But we should not interfere with the human element within us, it should be kept in mind that we do not leave our humanity.
Can't we focus on skill development
We are trying to spend time with us just a little away from technology.
If you don't know swimming, you can learn swimming, you can learn paintings, you can't draw excellently, but you can't do it on paper.
Your inner feelings will start reflecting in it.
You will feel that all these capabilities and these activities will not only give you happiness but will also remove the restrictions that you have kept on one side.
Do something differently, my friends
This is your opportunity to build your lives.
If you thought that after all the examinations were over, after your profession came to a new level, I had learnt all this then that opportunity was not available to you people.
Therefore, I want to tell you that if you have a Magic Learning Country, you can learn the Ticket Magic.
Please do this to your friends.
If there is something you don't know, try to learn it and it will definitely benefit you.
Make yourself aware of the creative efficiency that is within you and it will provide a wonderful platform for development.
Friends, I share my experience with you, we cannot imagine how many things we have to learn in the world.
There are new places, new cities, new villages and new areas.
Don't think of traveling too much.
Go and spend 3-4 days there and go to the next place and spend 3-4 days there.
This will provide you a lot of things to learn.
Friends, this time the Government of India has given you a wonderful opportunity.
The new generation has virtually issued cash transactions.
Whatever you people are involved in, but you can also earn through this scheme, do you know about a scheme of the Government of India
But someone else can recommend it.
You can connect others with it and if that new person does 3 transactions then you will get a income of 10 rupees.
In your accounts, 10 rupees will be added on the government side.
If you say that in one day you have included 20 people, then in the evening you will have 200 rupees.
Businessmen and students will be able to earn through this.
The project is scheduled upto 14th October, 2018.
You can contribute to making Digital India.
You are the protectors of New India.
I got a very interesting phone call.
Greetings, Prime Minister, I will be speaking to Shiva Saheb from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
I'd like to talk about the red light rotating.
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic crisis, I don't have to wait for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for this decision taken by you people.
The government's decision to abolish the red light is an organisational measure.
But we have to root out this culture that is rooted in our minds.
If we all strive together with awareness, we will be able to overcome it.
When I say that my aim is clear - Evergreen Person is Important, everyone is important.
If we accept the significance of 125 crore people, if we realise the importance of the people of 125 crore country then it will be a big power to realise the dreams of the people of 125 crore country.
We all have to do this together.
This year we are celebrating the 1000th anniversary of the 125 crore Indians.
Because of some reason we got stuck in our turbans, we were very small, we used to think about the centenary.
Centuries of other countries in the world are also considered to be very important.
Just imagine.
Even today, it is so difficult to break out social conditions.
How could it have been a thousand years ago
It would have been known to some that he had unleashed a massive struggle against the bitterness of society, the feeling that he was a superior and unpunished person, the status of caste.
He embraced and performed the task of embracing the society whom he considered to be unpunishable.
Thousands of years ago, he organised a drive to enter their temples and successfully entered the temple.
The Government of India will release a commemorative postage stamp to mark the commemoration of holy shrine of Shri Ramanujacharya on May 1st.
I salute the holy Lord Ramanujacharya, I bow down to my devotional flowers.
My dear countrymen, there is another significance for May 1st tomorrow.
In many parts of the world, it is observed as a day of labour.
While speaking on the day of the workers, there is talk of labour and labour and naturally I remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the concessions and honours being given to the workers.
The contribution of Baba Saheb for the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, while talking about Baba Saheb, while talking about the holy Shri Ramanujacharya, the greatest sacred and social reformer of Karnataka who lived in the 12th century, has got the opportunity to remember Jagadguru Basaveshwar Ji.
There was also a chance to release his gold compilation.
In the language of Kannada in the twelfth century, he made a deep impression on labour and labour.
In Kannada, he has called Gaya Kave Kailas, which means that only through labour you can attain the accomplishment of Lord Shiva, that is, only through action can heaven be reached.
While talking about the workers, it is natural to think of Tatopanth coconut.
My dear countrymen, a few days later we are celebrating Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha all over the world celebrate it as a festival.
The thoughts of Lord Buddha are very relevant when the world looks at the violence, war, destruction and the conflict of arms.
Buddhism is an excellent example of Ashoka's life-style in India.
This auspicious day of Buddha Purnima is celebrated by the United Nations as Visa Diwas.
This year, the festival will be held in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious day, I have the privilege of dedicating my homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
We are particularly talking about our neighbours.
We want to be compatible with our neighbours and they also want to move forward.
There are many possibilities.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The capabilities and amenities of the satellite will significantly help in economic and developmental activities in South Asia.
This is a favourable example of our vision for South Asia.
In every corner of the country, many families are associated with the preparations for the examination of their children.
Today is 26th March.
It is a matter of pride for us that Rabindranath Tagore and his memories are the wealth of all of us.
Jallianwala Bagh massacre was unleashed in 1919, when Rabindranath Tagore was one of the gentlemen who raised their voices against the massacre.
The massacre had a deep impact on a twelve-year-old boy.
Three days before today, on 23rd March, the British executed Bhagat Singh and his comrades Sukhdev and Rajguru.
During the tragic incident on 23rd March, on the faces of the martyrs, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, the joy and gladness of Mother India and there was no fear of death.
They had sacrificed all the dreams of life for the freedom of mother India.
These three are still an inspiration for all of us.
We cannot quote the martyrdom of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
The entire British empire trembled at these three.
They were imprisoned and sentenced to death, but the British were worried about how to treat them.
Several years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time then I could feel a tremor on that land.
Whenever you get the opportunity to visit Punjab, I urge the youth of the country to visit the places where there are the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Bhadkeshwar Dutt.
It was an era of independence and its intensity.
On the one hand, soldiers like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru used to inspire the youth to take up the armed revolution.
About 100 years ago, in April, 1917, Gandhiji had embarked on the Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time in Champaran, the expression of Gandhijis thoughts and methods of Gandhiji's freedom struggle had emerged.
This was a turning point in the journey of freedom struggle, especially from the perspective of the means of struggle.
It was the period of the deep impact of Gandhiji's thoughts and methods on all the Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha and the Mill Workers Strike in Ahmedabad.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new impetus to the country.
Today, in our minds, we cannot estimate the Champaran Satyagraha by keeping in mind the Gandhians.
Just imagine, a man who returned to India in 1915, experienced just two years...
He highlighted the magnificent power of Gandhijis integration through Champaran Satyagraha, the ability to know the pulse of Indian society, the power to inspire the poorest and the illiterate masses against the British, and to bring them to the battlefield.
We can learn from him how to start public life and how to work for it and how to work for it.
The great leaders of that period, Rajendra Babu and Acharya Kripalani, were all enthusiastic about going to the village.
He taught people how to connect their work with the freedom struggle.
Today, we are travelling in the 21st century, who doesnt want to change India in today's era, who does not want to take part in the transformation of the country
This desire of 125 crore countrymen and their efforts for transformation will be a strong foundation for themselves in creating a New India.
New India is not a scheme of the government.
New India is the challenge of 125 crore people of the country.
This is the feeling of a New India with 125 crore Indians.
This is a desire, a desire, a passion, a passion and a thirst for the 125 crore Indians.
Peacefully, they are engaged in this kind of work as a penitent.
Many people visit the hospital every day and help the patients.
As soon as the news is asked, there are many people who go out and donate blood.
If someone is starving, there are people who are good at feeding them.
Our country is a country of such valuable values.
Peoples service is called Magazine Seva, it is all in our nerves.
If we look at it altogether and look at it integratedly, then how immensely powerful it is.
When we talk about New India, it is a matter of nature that criticism of this idea is acceptable in a democratic way.
But if 125 crore countrymen make a solemn pledge, if they decide on their path, if they start taking steps one after the other then the dream of 125 crore countrymen of cooking a New India will be realised when we keep looking.
It is not necessary that all matters should be included in the budget or the government scheme or to be spent on government money.
That is, I want to say that every citizen of the country should do his duty as a citizen and he should realise his responsibilities.
Why don't we take this journey of ours, which is a good fortune for our autonomy, with regulation and dedication
I invite you to come and participate in this journey.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to express my gratitude to you.
Over the past few months, a large number of people in our country have participated in Digital Payments Mission.
After demonetization, the digital payments system can see many improvements.
It has been only 2-3 months since we started the BHIM App, so far about one and a half crore people have evacuated it.
My dear countrymen, we have to move forward in the fight against black money and corruption.
Can 125 crore countrymen make a pledge to make digital transactions worth Rs. 12 lakh crore this year
In order to implement this, we can pay the school fee digitally, we can take the ticket fee for travelling by train or by air, we can digitally purchase the medicines and if we are affordable food shoppers then we can make digital payment methods.
In the past, several programmes have been organised for Digital Celebrations to raise awareness among the people.
It was decided that 100 programmes would be conducted across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
70,000 businessmen won the prizes.
Everyone is determined to take this work forward.
A big movement has also been organised.
I am confident that we will create awareness about the BHIM App even more than the time we have spent on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
We have to contribute to reducing cash usage.
My dear countrymen, every time you have been giving me a variety of suggestions to invite you for Mann Ki Baat programme.
But I can see that in your suggestions, you have always been putting too much pressure on cleanliness.
This river is passing through the Rispana bridge and it runs near my house.
Against the pollution of the river, we went to the part of the area and took a pilgrimage and tried to create awareness among the people but this did not benefit.
I urge you all to send a team from your side or to create awareness about this thing through the newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, look at the pain in the minds of a student studying in class 11.
I see this as a good sign.
Awareness has also started from the commencement of the cleanliness drive.
Everyone has constructively brought them together.
This has emerged as a peoples movement.
Hate against dirt has been increasing.
Be it awareness or creative contribution or be it a movement, the importance of these things is definitely there.
Though the job is difficult, it has to be done.
I am confident that this feeling that has emerged from the new generation of children, students and youth of the country is indicative of a good sign.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat, all those people who have been listening to Gayatri's remarks, I want to say something to all of them - the message given by Gayatri should be a message given to all of us.
My dear countrymen, from the beginning of the Mann Ki Baat programme, I have had many suggestions about wasting my food.
We all know that when we feed in our homes and public events, we take more food than we need in our plates.
Have we ever calculated how much destruction we have caused due to the remaining remains that we have left
If we do not have the rest, how many poor people would be able to feed
But the treachery shown in this regard is a great treachery against society.
This is injustice against the poor.
On the other hand, if you don't waste food, savings will result in economic benefits for the family.
It is a good thing, a family looks at it, but it is a useful thing.
I want to be more aware of this.
I know some youngsters who are running the campaign by creating a mobile app.
If there is any food anywhere, they will be informed that they will collect more food and share it to the needy.
Young people of our country are working for this thing as a means of ensuring that food is beneficial.
You can meet such people in every state of India.
Look at the ways of transformation.
They always say that those who are aware of health should keep a little less in the leaf and fill the stomach a little less.
7th April is World Health Day.
Universal Health Coverage (UHC) has set the goal of healthcare for all by 2030.
A study says that more than 35 crore people around the world are suffering from depression.
Friends, speak to parents, brothers and sisters and teachers openly and tell them what is inside you.
Have you ever thought about why they are acting like that
You must understand that they are in the first step of depression.
Depression, psychological and physical disorders.
Just as diabetes provides a comfortable base for all kinds of diseases, depression also cripples all our capabilities in the fight against harsh conditions, self-sufficiency and decision-making.
If you are unable to speak openly to your fellow citizens, then work with the spirit of service at some place near you.
Contribute in full swing, participate in their comfort and you can see your grief automatically disappear.
If you try to understand the misery of others, if you do it with the spirit of service then it will give you a sense of self-confidence.
By interacting with others, by providing selfless service to others, you can easily dissolve the burden on your mind.
Similarly, Yoga is a good way to keep your mind healthy.
You can start your efforts from now on.
Make sure that millions of people participate socially in Yoga Day.
If you have any suggestions on the 3rd International Yoga Day, you must send your suggestions to me through the mobile app and guide me.
You can create songs and compositions related to Yoga, so that people's understanding can increase.
Today, I would like to talk to mothers and sisters about one thing and today we have talked about several things about health.
The government has taken a big decision in the past.
The number of women going to work in our country is increasing day by day, their contribution is increasing and this is a welcome thing.
My dear countrymen, the 5th of April is the holy month of Rama Navami, the 9th of April is the birth anniversary of Mahavir Jayanti and the 14th of April is the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
May the lives of these great men always inspire us and give us the strength to cook a New India.
After spring, crops have started to grow and farmers have the benefits of labour.
This new year is being celebrated in many corner of our country in many ways.
My New Year greetings to all of you.
The ice is now disappearing.
Spring is registering its presence in the lives of all of us.
After the autumn, new turtles have started blossoming on the trees, flowers blossom, jungles, gardens and fountains are getting greenery.
Besides flowers, fruits also glow in Adhavan's carpet.
Mangani's beans have started to appear in the summer season.
Turmeric flowers of mustard seeds in the fields give confidence to the farmers.
Flowers of flowers and flowers of priestly flowers commemorate the festival of Holi.
Ameer Kusru has described these moments of climate change as very tasty.
Heavy crops blossom everywhere in the fields, peacocks blossom, poultry blossoms, wells cry, cooking cooks, while blossoming in the natural cave, the environment becomes comfortable, the man is also enjoying the sweetness of this environment.
Spring panchami, Mahasivaratri and Holi festivals are enjoying flowers in the life of man.
In an ecosystem of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are going to complete the month of Partnership and we are preparing to welcome the new month of Partnership.
Spring is the combination of these two months.
Whenever I hear your suggestions before the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I express my gratitude to the millions and millions of people for sending me many suggestions.
My thanks to all of you who have contributed in every way in the Narendra Modi App, on Twitter, on Facebook and through letters.
In the Narendra Modi App, Shoba Jalan ji has said that a lot of people do not know about the achievements of the ISRO.
He further said that you must also inform about 104 satellites and the interception missile.
Shoba ji thank you very much for remembering the spectacle that has made India proud.
Our scientists have embraced India on the world stage.
We all know that ISRO has succeeded in achieving many surprising achievements over the last few years.
ISRO has achieved a new world record in the space sector just a few days before it was successful in sending Mangalyaan to Mars, on Mars.
At the same time, 104 satellites from different countries have been successfully launched.
This is a historic achievement not only for ISRO but also for the entire India.
ISRO's low-cost space program has made the whole world surprising, and the whole world has praised the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, one of the 104 satellites is extremely important - Cartosat 2T - is Indias satellite, which will help in identifying mineral resources, infrastructure, developmental evaluation and planning for urban development.
In particular, the number of baths in the country, how it can be used, how it should be taken care of, our new satellite Cartosat 2D will be a support to my farmer brothers and sisters.
As soon as we arrive, our satellite has sent a few films.
It has started its work.
It is a matter of great pleasure for all of us that all these works have been done under the leadership of our young social scientists and our women scientists.
It is a matter of great pride for ISROs success that such a remarkable contribution of young scientists and women scientists is a matter of great pride.
On behalf of your countrymen, I extend my heartiest congratulations to all the scientists of ISRO.
Your vision for the welfare of the people, for the welfare of the people and for the welfare of the people of the country, for the development of space science and for the upliftment of space science, you people have been making several new achievements day by day to day.
Whatever appreciations our scientists and their entire team, all of them are scarce.
India has successfully tested a continental Missile Breaking Missile in the defence sector.
This is a major achievement in the defence sector.
It will make you even more happy that these technological capabilities in the world are only with four countries of the world.
Indian scientists have achieved this.
Even though a missile is coming from far flung areas to attack India, its strength is that our missile is capable of destroying it.
When we see new technologies, when we see some new scientific achievements, our people are very happy.
In a world, the mind of man has been trying hard to find out the rules of creation.
New science and new technology have emerged from this.
Every technology has created a new era in every new scientific form.
Dear youngsters, while talking about the hard work of science and scientists, I have been expressing my heartfelt gratitude to the younger generation for inspiring science.
Many scientists need the nation.
Today's scientists are the factors of a stable change in the lives of generations emerging in the era.
None of the sciences jumped from heaven in full.
Gandhiji says that all scientific achievements have been accomplished by experience.
Respected Babu ji has said that the real philosophy should be appreciated by the hard work and hard work of our neo-scientists for their thirst, perseverance and sacrifice.
The need of the public is to understand how to adapt to principles, what kind of technology and means to adapt to them, so that it can become an important contributor to the common man.
Over the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had organized a unique competition on the occasion of the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
In 2005, there was heavy rainfall in Mumbai, floods, ocean rages and many difficulties.
If there is any natural calamity, it is the doors of a poor household.
Two people decided to find a solution, they saved the house in such difficult times and saved the households from floods and improved a household that can prevent water-borne diseases.
I could see a lot of innovations like this.
I would like to say that many people have contributed in this way in the country.
Our society is also becoming a society with the help of technology.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the past, more emphasis has been given on Digital.
Gradually, people are moving towards digital payments by shifting from cash transactions.
Digital payments in India are growing at a rapid pace.
In particular, younger generations are using digital payments on their mobile phones.
I see this as a good sign.
Over the past few days in our country, there has been a huge reception for the Lacky Grahak Yojana, the lucky consumer scheme, the Digital Business Scheme and the Digital Business Programme.
With the passage of nearly two months, 15000 people have received a premium of one thousand rupees per day.
Through these two schemes, Digital procurement in India is becoming a peoples movement and the entire nation has welcomed it.
It is a matter of great pleasure that so far, 10 lakh people have received prizes under Digital scheme, more than 50,000 traders have received prizes, more than Rs.
Under this scheme, more than a hundred traders have received one lakh prizes per year.
More than 4000 merchants have received Rs. 50,000 per annum.
Farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, homemakers, students and others have been very enthusiastic and have benefitted from this.
When I saw this, I came to know that not only the youth but also the elderly had participated in it, including a 15-year-old boy and a 65-70-year-old senior citizen.
Santosh ji had expressed his happiness in the Narendra Modi App from Mysore and said that he had received 1000 rupees through the Lucky Customer Scheme.
But I would like to share with you what I consider as an important thing in his writings.
Santosh ji, your name and your deeds give us happiness.
You are doing a very inspiring job.
Sabir, a 22-year-old car driver from Delhi, has started using digital transactions in his business after demonetisation. He has received a prize of Rs. 1 lakh in the government's fortunate customer scheme.
Today, even if he drives a car, he has become the ambassador of this project in a way.
He shares information on digital payments with all the passengers travelling in his car.
He is enthusiasticly sharing and encouraging others.
Pooja Nemade, a young friend from Maharashtra, shares her experiences with her friends about how her family uses RuPay card and e-wallet.
You come to the leadership of this movement.
You take it forward, it has an important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
In my view, all those who are associated with this work are the new warriors against corruption.
In a way, you are the fighters of honesty.
On the 14th of April, a massive gathering of awards will be held.
There are still about 40-45 days left.
Can you do one thing to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Just a few days ago, Baba Saheb Ambedkar passed his 125th birth anniversary.
To cherish his memory, at least 125 people should learn to upgrade the BHIM App.
May the birthday of Baba Saheb Ambedkar be a day of Bhim App and be a day of great importance
I would also like to mention this thing that we should strengthen the foundation of Baba Saheb.
You must ensure that the BHIM App reaches the hands of the people of 125 crore country by going home and connecting everyone with it.
Due to the impact of this movement in the last two-three months, several cities and towns have been victorious in many cities.
Friends, agriculture is the cornerstone of the economic system of our country.
The economic strength of the villages is strengthening the economic pace of the country.
I would like to share a happy news with you today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard and filled the stores.
Due to the hard work of the farmers of our country this year there has been an unprecedented production.
All indicators show that our farmer brothers and sisters have defeated the old achievements.
Looking at the mausoleum, today we are celebrating Pongal and Baisakhi festival.
This year, more than 2,200 lakh tonnes of collections have been received.
This is 8 more than the last achievement of our farmers.
As it is, this is an amazing achievement.
I would especially like to express my gratitude to the farmers of the country.
There is another reason why I thank the farmers that apart from producing traditional food grains, they have also cultivated a variety of pulses because pulses are rich in proteins.
The voice of the poor fell in the ears of my country's farmers and they have cultivated a variety of pulses in about two hundred and ninety hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but it is a great service done by the farmers to the poor of my country.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the farmer brothers and sisters of the country who have achieved the achievement of pulses by listening to an appeal from me.
Friends, in our country, everybody is travelling towards cleanliness through the government, through the society, through the organisations and through the movements.
In a way, everyone is somehow aware of cleanliness.
The government has been making relentless efforts.
During the past, an event of senior officials of 23 State Governments was held in Telangana under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation.
The seminar was not held in the closed rooms of the weekends in Telugu, but was initiated in the implementation of the importance of cleanliness at the grassroots level.
In February 17-18, a training to evacuate toilets was started in Hyderabad.
Six household toilets were wasted, they were cleaned, removed toilets with two knots and how they could be reused.
They demonstrated how comfortable the toilets that are being used in this new strategy, there is no difficulty, there is no psychological barrier, there is no barrier.
Just as we normally clean, we can also clean toilets.
On an average, a double tower toilet for a family of 6 members will be completed in about five years.
After this, the waste can be easily removed and it can be turned back to the second pack.
The more lights are shown, the more it will be beneficial.
Even in the government, various departments are organising simultaneously organising swachhta-related seminars for two weeks.
In the first meeting to be held in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will jointly strengthen the Swachhta Mission.
In the second meeting of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and River Rejuvenation will jointly take up the Swachhta Mission for the last two weeks of March.
Any citizen in our country is doing a good job, the entire nation is feeling a new energy, it is boosting self-confidence.
We welcomed the adventures of our disabled sportspersons at Rio Paralympics.
At the final match of the T20 World Cup for Visually Impaired held this month, India defeated Pakistan and became a global champion for the second consecutive term and made the nation proud.
Once again I congratulate all the team members.
The achievements of our disabled friends in the country make us proud.
I have always believed that our brothers and sisters with disabilities are more capable, full of dedication, achievers and minds.
Every moment we have to learn from them.
Whether it is in sports or in space science, the women of our country are not helpless.
They are moving ahead simultaneously and are illuminating the country's good name through their achievements.
Over the past few days, our women boys have won silver medals in the Asian Raxi Sevens Games.
My best wishes to all these heroes.
World Women's Day is celebrated on 8th March.
In India, there is a need to give importance to the girl child, there is a need to increase awareness and understanding in the family and society.
Today, this is not just a government scheme.
It has emerged as a movement of social understanding and education for all.
In the last three years, this programme has connected the people's society and has kept this important thing in mind every corner of the country and has changed the mindset of the people about the habits that have been going on for years.
Hearing the news that a girl child is born, there is a lot of joy in her heart when she falls into the ears.
In a way, positive thinking about women's children is becoming a cause of social consciousness.
I have heard that due to a special drive in Tamil Nadu district, Baliyah was blocked.
So far, more than 175 mammals have been blocked.
The District Administration has started bank accounts in the name of more than 55-60 thousand girls under the SAMRUTI scheme.
According to the convergence model of Convergence Model in Bandhav district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been involved in the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao programme, Gram Sabhas are being organized and efforts are being made to ensure the adoption of orphaned girls through the district administration and their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, a movement is going on for the education of every household girl child in every village under the scheme of Double Doordarshan.
In the state of Rajasthan, there is a movement to re-school our children, our schools, our movements and to re-school the girls who are halving their school education and re-school them.
I am telling you that the movement of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao is bearing various forms.
This entire movement has become a mass movement.
It is accompanied by new ideas.
It is being revamped according to regional requirements.
I consider this as a good sign.
On the occasion of Women's Day on 8th March, we have the power to be united, our Indian women, they are not very much in power, they are not very much in power, they are all very good people, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
You have come together constructively.
I am getting a lot of things to learn from you.
Global movement, the condition of the villages and the feelings of humility in the minds of the poor are all coming to me.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Our forefathers have made the system of cyclone, economic cycle and social life even better so that there should never be a recession in society under any circumstances.
In the last few days, we have celebrated several festivals.
Even after thousands of years, every festival is filling itself with a new spirit and a new energy...
Sometimes he picked up the mountain, sometimes he took up the task of removing the leaves of food, that is, we can feel an innovation in every activity.
Therefore, when I talk to you today, my thoughts are being shared by two Mohans.
One is Mohan who bears the Sudarshan Chakra and the other is Mohan who bears arqa.
Mohan, who had been bearing the Sudarshan Chakra, drove off the Yamuna River, went to the seashores of Gujarat, and settled in Dwarkai, but Mohano, who came to the seashores, came to the shores of the Yamuna, breathed his last in Delhi.
Mohan, who bears the Sudarshan Chakra, used his intellectual, his duties, his ability and his thoughts in accordance with the circumstances of that period, to avoid war and to live without conflict thousands of years ago
At the same time, arqa Mohano gave a new dimension to the freedom struggle, to safeguard human values and to empower the fundamental principles of governance and gave a new dimension to the entire world, which is still unique.
What is the importance of selfless service, what is the significance of wisdom, what is the significance of moving ahead with smiles in all the ups and downs of life
Today, while we are talking about festivals, India is engaged in a big celebration
Not only India but the entire world is talking about it.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On 2nd October, 1869, at Porbandar, on the coastal coast, today we have created an era, not an individual, in a small house called Kirti Mantra.
This has given a new dimension to the entire history of mankind and made a new achievement.
And there was always a thing connected with Gandhiji, in a way it became a permanent part of his life, it was service, service and obligation for service.
If we look at his entire life, he served the people of South Africa who were suffering from different types of problems, and during that period it was not a small thing.
He served the oppressed farmers in the Champaran region.
If anybody requires help at any time, he will be helpful in serving.
He not only strengthened service, but also strengthened the spiritual comfort associated with service.
But the experience of a self-sufficient enjoyment and a healthy health is also imbibed in service.
We can clearly understand this through the life of the ancestor.
For Gandhiji, individuals, society, man and man are all.
Whether it is Africa's Phoenix farm, or be it Dalstey farm, or be it Sabarmati Ashram or be it Vardha, he has always been insisting on social mobilization in a distinct manner everywhere.
I believe that I have got the privilege of visiting many important places related to Andolan and offering my homage there.
When it comes to society, there is a strength for it and in this event of Gandhi 150, there should be social expression and service.
The aim should be to have a good will, a good intention, a harmonious one, a spirit of full dedication and a spirit of service and a spirit of compassion and a spirit of compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I had visited Tandi in Gujarat.
Tandi, who was known as Salt Satyagraha in the freedom struggle, was a major turning point.
In Tandi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mother India.
I appeal to all of you to visit some place related to Gandhi Ji.
In the coming days, several events, competitions and exhibitions have been planned.
But on this occasion, I would like to share with you a very interesting thing.
This time, in Venice Biennale, the Indian Gallery, many interesting sights filled with Gandhiji's memories are being displayed.
The part of Haripura is very interesting.
You must be aware of the fact that during the Haripura Congress convention of Gujarat, the event that was chosen as the leader of Subhas Chandra Bose was recorded in history.
A very beautiful past has been drawn in these art areas.
Before the congressional Haripura conference in 1937-38, the then Chief Minister of Shanti Niketan's Kala Bhawan invited Nandlal Bose.
Gandhiji wanted the lifestyle of the people of India to be displayed through art and this art work should be exhibited at the conference.
This is the handiwork of the same Nandla Bose that has enriched our Constitution.
Nandlal Bose visited the villages adjacent to Haripura and drew paintings to showcase the rural life.
There were serious discussions in Venice about these priceless works.
Once again, with the good wishes of Gandhi Ji on his 150th birth anniversary, every Indian should make a solemn pledge.
We have to do something for the country, for the society, for something good.
This is what we can do to the palm, which is a genuine practical practical practitioner.
Brothers and sisters of Mother India, all of you must remember that in the last few years, we have been running a movement of Swachhata Hi Seva for two weeks before the 2nd of October.
This will commence on September 11 this year.
There is enthusiasm in all sections of the society for this movement.
My brothers and sisters of mine have hung up a proclamation table in their shops and they have written in it that when they come out of their homes, they should come with courage.
This will save money and contribute to protecting the environment.
This time, on 2nd October, when we commemorate the 150th Birth Anniversary of our Mother, on this occasion, we will dedicate an India free from open defecation and at the same time, we will have to lay the foundation for a new peoples movement against kitchen products across the country.
I appeal to all sections of the society, every village, every small area and every citizen of the country, to bow down and bow down to the people, this year we have to celebrate Gandhi Jayanti in a way to free our mother India from open defecation.
I appeal to the private corporations to come up with a favourable elimination after the collection of so many materials.
They can be recycled.
They can produce fuel.
But there was a lot earlier.
Today, I want to touch upon a matter of greater importance than a sumscribed gold.
Even though it was written centuries ago, even today, do you know how important it is
The peacocks are called gems.
Food has always been given a lot of importance in our culture.
So much so, we have scientifically scientifically discovered the knowledge of food.
A balanced and nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and children, because these are the future foundations of our society.
Poshan Abhiyan i. e.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once a matter was brought to my attention.
In Nasik, there was a massive movement of pigeon cereal.
During the harvest days, Anganwadi sisters collect a handful of grains from the people.
These grains are used for hot food prepared for children and women.
This ritual is done when the child is being given solid food for the first time.
Liquid food, not solid food.
This is a wonderful endeavour and it can be seen everywhere.
In many states, people have started a movement called Didi Poshan.
The family members prepare a nutritious diet, prepare a tasty meal and go to Anganwadi and go to schools where the family members exchange their food and feed on their own.
They share their happiness and they dont diminish when they share happiness.
With the feeling of service, the feeling of joy is a wonderful union.
Friends, through such small things, we can speed up a strong war against malnutrition in our country.
Today, because of lack of awareness, the poor and the self-sufficient, both are suffering from malnutrition.
We will celebrate the month of September as a nutrition mission throughout the country.
You must associate yourself with it, get information and add new ideas to it.
If you bring one or two people out of malnutrition then we can bring the country out of malnutrition.
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I had a lot of confidence that some questions would be asked about this thing.
Moreover, during the last few weeks, whenever I visited people, I was talking about Man Vs Wild.
I have never imagined that I will get such an opportunity to get a place in the minds of the youth of the world.
Last week I went to Bhutan.
As Prime Ministers, whenever I have the opportunity to visit, whenever I have the opportunity to visit, how the situation has become due to International Yoga Day, whenever I go to anybody in the world, whenever I have the opportunity to visit, they start questioning me about Yoga for 5-6 minutes.
Until now, I have become a global leader for discussions about Yoga and this has been my experience throughout the world.
But nowadays, we have got a new experience.
Whoever I meet, whenever I get the opportunity, they talk about the issues related to wildlife and debate about the environment.
This programme of Discovery is being organized by 165 countries in their languages.
But one more interesting thing, some people ask me a thing with some difficulty, Modi Ji, you are speaking in Hindi, Bear Grylls don't know Hindi, how could you talk so fast amongst you
Was it then compiled
Look, there is no secret in this.
The reality is that the technology to communicate with Bear Grylls was thoroughly used.
After this event, a large number of people have started discussing about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also visit places associated with natural and forest creatures.
I had told you earlier and I reiterate that you must visit the North-Eastern states in your life.
Your life is broad.
Your thoughts shall be great.
I have had the privilege of releasing the census of turtles in the past months.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
The number of LTTEs in India is 2967.
A few years ago, half of them were in number.
The LTTE-related summit took place in 2010 in St. Petersburg, Russia.
Concerned about the declining number of tigers in the world, it was finally confirmed.
This commitment is to double the number of LTTEs worldwide by 2022.
But this is a New India, because we are achieving the targets at a rapid pace, we have doubled the number of tigers here in 2019 itself.
India has not only increased the number of tigers but has also increased the number of protected areas and social shields.
When I published the data related to the LTTE, I was reminded of the lions in the Keer forests of Gujarat.
I was in charge of the Chief Minister while the lion's habitat was decreasing in the forests of Keer.
Their numbers were also declining.
We have taken steps one after the other in the forests of Keer.
In 2007, we decided to place female police personnel there.
We have taken steps to boost tourism.
Whenever we talk about natural and forest creatures, we only talk about conservation.
Therefore, it is necessary that we not only protect our forests, vegetation, forest creatures but also create a proper environment for them to live in a better way.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic address of Vivekanand Ji on September 11, 1893
This young saint of India, who has raised the humanity from all over the world, has left a glimpse of India in the world.
The slave that the world saw of India, the same world changed the vision of India by listening to the words of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893.
Come, let us try to live in whatever form of Swami Vivekananda ji has seen in India, whatever strength Swami Vivekananda ji has seen in India.
It is within us, everything is there, we will move ahead with self-confidence.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate 29th August as National Sports Day.
It will be a very interesting movement for all of you, children, elderly, youth and women.
But today I am not going to say anything about their intricate things.
I would like to inspire you to create awareness of sympathy in your minds. We will collectively set some goals for a stable India, for our nation.
I am confident that all of us will be able to free ourselves from wealth and we will be able to shout about it on social web sites.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
On the 26th of January, we celebrated the corner of the country with enthusiasm and joy.
In a way, the Constitution of India, the duties and powers of the citizens and the urge for the democratic system, in a way, is a cultural enthusiastic and empowers the future generations by creating awareness about democratic responsibilities.
However, the widespread and deep debate over the duties and rights of citizens in our country has not yet taken place.
Tomorrow, 30th January is the day of the passing away of our greetings.
At 11 a.m. on 30th January, we will observe 2 minute silence and pay our homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the nation.
As a society and as a nation, it is indispensable for us to observe a two-minute silence on January 30 at 11 a.m.
It is only for two minutes but it has a social character and a sense of dedication and an expression of our concern for the martyrs.
We have expressed our natural respect for the army and the security forces of our country.
I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to the soldiers and their relatives who have been honoured with various medals for the brave-hearts who have performed this Republic Day.
These medals include Keerti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
I especially urge the youngsters to do a job as you are working on social media platforms.
Seek two good words on the website and share them with your friends about all the soldiers who have been honored this time.
We will be surprised, proud and inspired when we know deeply about the courage, valour and might of those soldiers.
On 26th January, we had enjoyed great enthusiasm and joy, while on the other hand, some of our soldiers who were guarding the country in Kutch had died due to snowfall.
I salute and pay my homage to all the soldiers who laid down their lives.
My young friends, you all know that I have been continuously shouting Mann Ki Baat.
The four months of January, February, March and April have been a challenging month for every family.
Even though there is a choice for a child at home, the entire family is going to get stuck in the burden of examinations.
I always feel like coming out of this situation and therefore today I want to talk to my young friends in detail.
I would like to ask you how to make such a situation happy.
Though he has asked this question, I know that this question is in your hearts.
Exams must be an occasion of joy.
For most people, the time of selection is a period of pressure.
You should decide whether you consider it as a time of joy or whether you feel it as a period of pressure.
Those who consider themselves to be stressful, they feel sad - pleasure for pressure.
Therefore, my view is that you should consider the time of selection as a festival and a festival.
Whenever there is a festival or celebration, the specialty that we have within us is evident.
The entire family must act as a group and enthusiastically contribute to the success of this festival.
There will be a change in the time you are watching.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kach to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, this is the only choice in these 3-4 months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to embrace these three-four months in accordance with their family environment by following their traditions, in their own ways.
If you were happy, if you were fond of fondness then you would feel loyalty and in such a situation, even the old things of several years would easily start to blossom in your memory.
Your psychology clearly shows what the teacher has said in the classroom a year ago.
Simultaneous power will not only be stagnant but it will also become a burden.
I can feel it by experiencing it and I can say it by feeling it by feeling it, if we forget things, if we are loyal then we cannot imagine how many things are very useful if we suddenly come to mind.
You don't have information and you don't work hard.
But whenever you are under pressure, your knowledge and your information will sink away and pressure will drive on you.
That's why a happy mind is the secret for a good mark-seat, I would say that a happy mind is the key to the highest marks.
Sometimes it happens to me that we do not approach the exams in the right perspective.
This is not your life speech.
What kind of life you live in, what kind of life you live in, what kind of life you want to live is not an option.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a great example of inspiring all of us.
He joined the air force and failed.
Scores have become more important.
This has led to an increase in the number of pupils and a huge pressure on the minds of the students.
In such a scenario, I would like to share your views on the contemporary course of education and its future.
If you believe in these things then the marks will be buried behind you like a windmill.
It is necessary to know what is the status of my knowledge till yesterday and where I have reached today.
If you talk about the world of sports then it will be instantly recorded in mind then I have given this example.
Most of the triumphs take place in their lives because the players compete with them.
I want you to take the life of Sachin Tendulkar ji
He has been defeating many achievements for 20 years and has achieved a new milestone in the past.
His journey of life is amazing because he himself has been following the path of making challenges by competing with others.
Friends, you will have to write your exams in every sphere of life when you will have to study for 2 hours and you will be able to study for 3 hours
You might have decided how many hours you might have got up in the morning and it might have been delayed but can you get up when you decide
Therefore, I urge you to make yourself a challenge by letting yourself compete with others.
It should be careful how I worked in the past, how I moved ahead and how I worked better.
With this vision, you will be able to understand the changes that you have made.
S.
Sundar ji, you're absolutely right.
Even today, you might have noticed that those who ask me questions and those who advise me, there are more women in them.
Because when we see how mothers are cautious about the future of children in their homes then we find that they make many things easier.
You should act as a guide in the capacity of yourself and give up your time for whatever work you may have.
Once you have a habit of accepting, most of your problems will come to an end.
The expectations of parents and teachers are the cornerstone of their problems.
Acceptance of what is so reveals the way for a solution to the problems.
Expectations make the path even more difficult.
You'll be comfortable loading out.
In a way, we are going to see the patient and we are afraid of the disease.
I would like to tell my parents that sometimes we also create such a fear among our children.
Have you ever thought of creating a happy environment during the election days
You will see that the environment will change completely.
I got a wonderful phone call.
He didn't want to mention his name.
If you ask why he doesn't want to mention his name, you will understand it.
"Greetings, Prime Minister, I dont want to mention my name because of the work done by me in my childhood.
Once there is a habit of insurrection, the thirst for learning in life will be lost.
A telephone call came, "Greetings Prime Minister, my name is Monica and I want to ask you two questions about my exams as I am studying in class 12.
It is a common belief that if students focus on sports, there will be a lack of focus on education.
This basic idea is wrong, this is the root cause of the problem.
If you ask for complete development, there is a life beyond the syllabus, which is very vast.
This is the right time to live and learn that life.
Whether it's a five minute time or not, you must rest a bit.
You can feel that your work is incomplete.
I don't know if everyone likes it or not, but this is my experience.
During the elections, when I addressed the dais, my voice would perhaps refuse to cooperate.
Once a folk singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long you are sleeping.
Till now, I have not even thought that there is a connection between my speech and my voice, he gave me the basic treatment.
If we understand the significance of such fundamentals then we will get many benefits.
Don't do that, otherwise your family is going to get angry with me.
On the day your score comes, if you don't see, I'll look in their eyes.
Please don't do that.
This is a great milestone in keeping the mind, mind and body fit.
Well, my young friends, while you are engaged in the preparations for your exams, I am talking about something and perhaps I believe that what I have said today may be a relief for you.
But I also urge you not to consider what I have said as a burden.
If you can, do it, don't do it.
Remember the resolution you have taken, trust you, go to the polls and my best wishes to all of you.
Change that challenge into celebrations before facing every challenge.
Then there will be no challenge.
Keep this mantra in mind and move ahead.
My dear countrymen, 40 years of Indian Coast Guard will be completed on 1st February, 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to the officers and soldiers of the Coast Guard for their warm hospitality.
It is a matter of pride for us that our coast guard with 126 ships and 62 aircraft is 4 of the world's 4 largest coast guards.
The mantra of the Coast Guard is Vayam Raksham.
With this objective, the Coast Guard has been awake all night and day in a devastating situation in the country's coastal areas and coastal areas.
There are not only men in the coastal guard of our country, but also women shoulder to shoulder and shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to carry out their tasks successfully.
Our women officers of Coast Guard, who are pilots, monitors and are driving a Howard grab.
As the Coast Guard is the worlds largest issue today, I convey my sincere greetings to the Indian Coast Guard, which is engaged in the maritime security of India, on their 40th anniversary.
In our country, Spring Panchami is a big festival of Saraswati Puja.
This is regarded as an occasion to appreciate education.
Not only this, it is a time that inspires the soldiers.
Mara Range de Basanti Solah, let me be a spring inspirational idea.
On this auspicious occasion of Spring Panchami, I extend warm greetings and good wishes to my countrymen.
My dear countrymen, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani has always given new colours to new albums and new colours in accordance with her creative potential.
After the completion of my Mann Ki Baat in the last two months, they are telecasting Mann Ki Baat in the regional languages.
This has received a very warm welcome.
With Mann Ki Baat, I have got the opportunity to travel with you all.
Heartiest wishes.
My dear countrymen, greetings and best wishes to you all on Christmas Day.
Today is a day to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Many wealthy people came and gave us wealth.
In the end, a poor widowed mother came and gave her two buckets.
Today, on their birthday, let us pay our emotional tributes.
Just two days ago, I had the good opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Varanasi, the land of Malavia.
I had laid the foundation stone of the prestigious Madan Mohan Malavia Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
This Cancer Centre will be a boon for not only Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is also the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country will not forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we also took pride in the field of nuclear energy.
As a party leader, as a parliamentarian, as a minister or prime minister, Atal jis extraordinary contribution has made him an example.
Today, on the occasion of Atal ji's birth anniversary, I salute him, I offer my deepest regards to God that he should be given better health.
As an employee, I have had a great deal to work with Atal ji.
His memories are green in front of my minds.
Today, on the occasion of Christmas Day, the benefits of two schemes are available to the people of the country as a gift.
In a way, both of these could be the beginning of new schemes.
Whether it is villages, cities, educators, snake charmers or cashless transactions, we can see that the whole country is eager to know about how to do a cashless business and how to buy things without cash.
Everyone wants to learn the ways and means of learning from each other.
Dighi's Business Programme, which is aimed at encouraging traders, will receive awards on 25th December as Christmas Prize for 15000 individuals.
The programme is scheduled for 100 days starting today.
Every day 15,000 people will receive a thousand rupees of prize money.
Digi's business plan is mainly for businessmen.
And the business of the merchants shall be abundant, and there shall be an excellent opportunity to beat the palms.
The scheme is designed by focusing on all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class
Those who buy goods worth 50 rupees to 3000 rupees will get the benefits of this thing.
This is not for those who buy more than 3000 rupees.
Even the neighbouring poor can use USSD, feature phone and simple phones to buy goods, sell them and pay the amount. All of them will benefit from this scheme.
People in rural areas can buy or sell goods through AEPS and win prizes.
Today, there are around 30 crore RuPay cards in India, out of which 20 crore cards are from poor families and Jan Dhan account holders.
These 30 crore people will be able to participate immediately in this prize.
I am sure that the countrymen will take the country in this manner and they will be eagerly engaging with the youth around them to get the necessary information.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to see that awareness is spreading rapidly about how to use technology in the country, how to e-mode money and how to pay online payments.
Over the past few days, cashless business has grown from 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to take this forward.
Businessmen know very well how big this resolution is.
Those traders who make digital transactions, who are paying online payments instead of cash in their business, have been given income tax concessions.
I congratulate all the states and Union Territories of the country.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu has formed a committee under the leadership of him and he has been examining several schemes.
At the same time, the governments have started and implemented several schemes in their own way.
I have been told that the State Government of Assam has announced that 10 tax relief will be provided to digitally levyers of property tax and business licence fees.
In case of at least two digital transactions from January to March, the branches of Rural Banks, with their 75 account holders, will receive a discount of Rs. 50,000 from the Government.
The Committee has announced that the Digital Payment Guarantee Scheme will be provided to the villages which have achieved 100 Digital Payments by 31st March, 2017, at an estimated cost of Rs. 5 lakh from the Government.
Several organisations have been successful in taking forward the digital transactions for the rural poor farmers.
The taste is that this year, compared to last year's GNFC's fertilizer sales, has seen a 27 percent increase in sales.
80 rupees in place of availability of 100 rupees and 50 rupees in place of availability of 80 rupees and those who are deprived of insurance and health facilities.
But nowadays money is being paid in cashless manner.
Our country is a youthful country.
Technology is the art of our hands.
A country like India should be at the forefront of all the countries in this field.
Our youth have made significant strides through start-ups.
This is a golden opportunity for digital activity.
Our youth should incorporate new ideas, innovative technologies and modern methods to strengthen this sector.
At the same time, we have to connect ourselves with the entire power to get rid of black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I used to ask you every month before the voice of Mann Ki Baat, give your suggestions and express your views.
Accordingly, tens of thousands of letters have been concentrated on MyGov and the narendramodi app this time, of which 80-90 percent are related to corruption and black money eradication and demonetization.
After seeing all this, I feel that it can be classified in three ways.
Some people have written in detail about the difficulties and difficulties being faced by the citizens due to this demonetisation.
On the other hand, they mentioned how the serpents take new ways to set up fraud and irregularity in many places while the sacred work is being carried out for the benefit of the country.
I am grateful to my countrymen for writing so many letters to me.
"This is a commendable way in which the money has been brought under control.
Though it is true that all of us citizens are facing difficulties, we all are at the forefront of the fight against corruption and our cooperation in this war makes us happy.
We are fighting against corruption and black money, like the war by the armed forces.'
Gurumani Keval ji writes that every corner of the country is echoed by people everywhere.
These are the really transformative factors, the agents of change.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to those who have not only tolerated many difficulties themselves but also those who have given a stern answer to those who have been trying to take people in the wrong direction.
Efforts have been made on a massive scale to combat corruption and black money.
Moreover, many people jumped on the floor and used their creative skills and intellectual skills to tear off the pages of those who spread rumours and highlighted the truth.
When 125 crore people of my country are connected to me, can there be something that is impossible
If there are blessings of the poor, will it not be for Essen's blessings
I express my gratitude to the countrymen, I offer my greetings to them and people have been taking part in this Mahamahal against corruption and black money with full enthusiasm.
I had anticipated a detailed discussion on the ongoing war against corruption and black money in Parliament for political parties and political parties.
If there were sittings in the House, there would have been discussions.
It is absolutely wrong to say that political parties have been exempted in all respects.
Those who cannot openly support corruption and black money, they are spending their entire time and focus on finding government grievances.
A question has also been raised as to why they have often changed the rules.
This government is a government that runs for the masses.
The government has been trying to listen to public comments.
When they deal with new strategies, we have to adopt new methods to break their evil minds.
This war, in the form of Vitak Khandan and Kodaikandan, must have an end to corruption, bitter practices and black money.
On the other hand, letters have been received from a number of people about what kind of bad practices are being carried out and what kind of new methods are being used.
On this occasion, I express my heartfelt gratitude to my beloved countrymen.
The Government has created a separate email address for sharing such information.
Apart from this, you can also send MyGov to the Internet.
The government has tied up the shoulder to shoulder war against all kinds of evils, such as the evils you indicate.
When your cooperation is not over, it is very easy to fight.
Third classes of the letter are also in large numbers.
"Modi ji, don't wander, don't hesitate, do whatever you want to do, do whatever you want to do, don't worry, but if you decide to travel on the way, you don't have the right to resolve the decision, you don't have the right to retreat.
My dear countrymen, the last time when Mann Ki Baat had heard Mann Ki Baat, in spite of so many difficulties, our farmer brothers had made stern attempts to defeat the records of last year in the field of seeds.
From the perspective of agriculture, this is a simple sign.
Whether it is the worker of this country or the farmer or the youth, the hard work of all of them is bringing new energy to the country.
A few days ago, on the World Economic Forum, India has made its name proud in many fields.
This has been the result of a series of efforts by our skilled countrymen that India has progressed in the global rankings through individual indicators.
Indias ranking in the World Bank report on free trade has risen.
India has jumped 32 places in the World Economic Forum report on global competitiveness.
We have moved 16 places on the Global Performance Index of 2016, and have moved 19 places on the World Banks Infrastructure Services Performance Index for 2016.
Several other reports indicate the same assessment and India is growing at a fast pace.
My dear countrymen, this time the people of the country have read the anger of the Parliament.
Everywhere there is anger over the functioning of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President expressed open dissatisfaction.
But even in such a scenario, the mind becomes happy when there are some good things.
Even in the midst of the Parliament's passage, the country's attention has not diverted to a noble cause.
Brothers and sisters, I am happy and proud to say that the government's efforts have been made keeping in mind the goal of development of persons with disabilities.
I express my gratitude to the members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for fulfilling this thing. I express my gratitude to all the disabled persons of the country on behalf of millions of people with disabilities.
The Government is working towards the welfare of Divyangjans.
Individually, I too have been trying to increase the speed and speed with this objective.
My objective was to ensure the rights and dignity of the persons with disabilities.
Our differently abled brothers and sisters strengthened our efforts and trusts by winning four medals in the Parallelmpics event.
They have not only brought pride to the country through their successes but have also made the people astonished by their talent.
Our disabled brothers and sisters, like the other citizens of the country, are invaluable assets and invaluable potential.
After the enactment of the Act in the interest of Persons with Disabilities, employment generation for Persons with Disabilities has increased.
Reservation definition has been increased to 4 per cent in government services.
The Act provides for excellent arrangements for education, facilities and complaints of persons with disabilities.
In the last two years, 4350 camps have been organised for the Divyangjans and you can understand how the government is with the Divyangjans from the time we have provided equipment to 5,80,000 brothers and sisters with disabilities at a cost of Rs. 352 crore.
A new legislation has been enacted by the passion of the United Nations.
Earlier, Divyangjans were classified at seven levels but now we have made it 21 by the passage of the law, out of which 14 new conditions have been added.
For the first time, they have got the opportunity to get justice by incorporating certain differently abled persons with disabilities.
For instance, we have linked Thalassemia, Parkinson, victims, and those who have been born in the form of a henchman.
The Indian Cricket Team has won 4 matches against the United Kingdom.
Some youngsters have a commendable role in this.
Our country's youth, Shri Krishan Nair, slapped 3 percent.
KL Rahul scored 199 runs.
Test Captain Virat Kohli not only did a good interview but also led a good leadership.
Indian Cricket Team off Spinner R.
Ashwin's name was announced by the International Cricket Team, the Cricketer of the Year, 2016 and the Best Teast Cricketer.
My congratulations and best wishes to all of them.
In the hockey sector, a wonderful and excellent news has been received after 15 years.
The junior hockey team won the World Cup.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of India's hockey fire.
Last month, our women women have also performed well.
If the Indian women's hockey team won the Asian Championship, India's women's hockey team won the bronze medal in the Asian Cup for the age group of 18 a few days ago.
Like every year on Diwali, I once again went to the Chinese borders to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I had celebrated Diwali at the peaks of the Himalayas with the ITBP and Indian Tibetan soldiers and soldiers.
I go to Deepawali every time, but the experience that has been given on this Diwali is incomparable.
People are not only sending information but also connecting with their minds
One rendered poetry, the other painted films, the other produced cartoons, the other produced video.
This means that every household becomes a residential place for the soldiers.
When I saw the letters, I was astonished that how many imaginations and feelings were there in the minds of the people.
A soldier from the Army had written to me: The Prime Minister, all of us, the soldiers, every Pandique like Deepawali and Holi will be located on the borders.
We will spend every moment in the thoughts of the country's security.
Yes, however, in the days of festivals, there is a feeling of a house.
But to tell the truth, this time there was no such feeling.
On this occasion, there is no doubt that we are not at home.
Sometimes we feel that along with 125 crore Indians, we are also celebrating Diwali.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Deepawali, should the spirit of vigour disappear among the security forces of our country for a few moments
As a society, as a nation, it is natural for us to create this feeling, as a society, I urge all of you to imbibe our feelings, be it any festival or festival or be it a joyous occasion, we must remember the soldiers of our country in some way or the other.
When the entire country stands shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers, it is certain that the strength and strength of the forces will increase by 125 crore times.
Sometime back all the leaders from the villages of Jammu Kashmir had come to meet me.
They are from the Panchayat Sammelan of Jammu Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 leaders who came from different villages of the Kashmir Valley.
I had the opportunity to talk to them for a considerable time.
They had come to talk about some issues related to the development of their villages, some had come up with some demands, but when the conversation began to lengthen, it was natural that the environment of the valley, the law and order situation, the future of the children, had come up in it.
The way these leaders of the village had spoken with love and open heart was heart touching.
During the talks, when there was talk of burnt schools in Kashmir, I realized that the same kind of misery that our countrymen had suffered was felt by the leaders of these villages.
And they thought that schools were not burnt, but that the future of the children was made fiery.
After you returned to your cities, I requested you to pay attention to the future of these children.
I am very happy that all these leaders from the Kashmir Valley have done a very good job to me.
They went to villages and spread awareness among those who were far away.
A few days ago, 95 of the children of Kashmir participated in the board examinations during the board examinations.
The participation of such a large number of students in the board exams indicates that our children of Jammu Kashmir are committed to achieving new heights of development through education and for a prosperous future.
I convey my best wishes to those students for their inspiration while I extend my heartiest greetings to their parents, relatives, their teachers and all the rural leaders.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I was asking for advice from the people for Mann Ki Baat then everyone's suggestions came about one thing.
Everyone has asked me to talk about 500, 1000 rupees notes in detail.
In my address to the people of the country on 8th November at 8:00 p.m. on 8th November, I talked about the commencement of a movement that will bring about a transformation in the country.
Whenever I had taken this resolution before you, I had publicly said that this decision was not simple and difficult.
But the more important the resolution is, the more important it is.
I am sure that there will be a lot of innovative hardships in our average life.
Even then this decision was huge and I had said that it would be 50 days since we came back from its impact and only then can we take steps towards normalcy.
It will not be easy to get rid of all the diseases that we have been carrying for 70 years.
I can understand the difficulties faced by you very well.
500 and 1000 rupees notes, so many big nations, so many notes, millions and millions of notes, such a resolution - the entire world is carefully watching and every economist is evaluating it.
India has immense faith in 125 crore Indians and 125 crore countrymen are determined to achieve their goal of dedication.
All sections of Central Government, State Governments and Regional Local Bodies across the country, one lakh 30,000 bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices, more than 1.
In the midst of a variety of tensions, all of them were very quietly engaged in this thing, considering the work of this country as a maiden, as an attempt to bring about a great transformation.
As a result, it is clear that India will succeed in this task.
I can see that despite all these difficulties, everyone works in banks and post offices.
When it comes to humanity, they are travelling a little more.
One person told me that there was an accident in the place of Kandava.
Suddenly money was needed.
I am glad to know that when the bank employees there were taken to the notice of this thing, they went to the elderly house to collect the money and see that there was no hurdle in the treatment.
Several such uncalculated events take place every day on TV, in the media, in newspapers, in conversations.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the colleagues who have worked and contributed in this great youth.
But if evil is so widespread, even today, evil practices have become a habit.
Even now, they are contemplating to find a way out of this black money, uncovered money and benami money.
They have been trying to save their money by enjoying the poor, enjoying their own words or enjoying their hearts, putting money in their accounts and buying something from them.
Today, I would like to tell such people that whether it is shrinking or not, whether it is your will or not, whether it is in respect of law or not, your will will will take care of what you have to do.
But please don't play with the lives of the poor.
When the name of the poor comes in the registration and after the investigation, my beloved poor should not do anything so that the cause of your sins gets disturbed.
A very stringent law has been enacted in respect of Benami property, which is coming into force and there will be a lot of difficulties.
The government wants that there should not be any kind of problem for our countrymen.
I live in Dhirali village of Dhirali Taluka in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
You have taught a good lesson to those who have black money and corrupt people through 500 and 1000 rupees notes.
Had this step not been taken, there would never have been a good time for every citizen of India.
For this I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you all.
Some things are being encouraged by the media, by the public, by the government.
There is immense joy and pride when the common man of my country knows what a wonderful capability he has.
It has been written that even if you have an old note, if you want to eat food, do not worry about money, do not go back hungry only, you have to leave the food and whenever you have to travel on this path, you must pay the money.
People go there, eat food, and after 2-4-6 days when they travel by that route then they pay back the money.
This is the strength of my country, the spirit of service, the spirit of sacrifice.
During the elections, I used to talk about tea and this idea spread throughout the world.
People of many countries of the world have started talking about tea.
But I didn't know that marriages would take place during the tea talks.
On November 17, a wedding took place in Surat with a tea interaction.
In Surat, Gujarat, a woman gave only tea to her household married couples, did not attend any other festivals, did not make any feasts, because there was a shortage of money due to currency discount.
The marchers also considered it a matter of pride.
Surat's Bharatmaru and Daksha Parmar have shown their contribution to the massive fight against corruption and black money through their marriage.
While Navparinirani blesses Bharat and Daksha, I convey my warm greetings and best wishes to all of you for making the wedding ceremony a magnificent hub and for making it a new opportunity.
When such difficulties arise, people also make solutions for this thing very well.
Some people have got immediate benefits through this movement.
In the days to come, the country will be benefited, but some have immediate profits.
When I asked about what had happened, I got some information from small towns.
But because of this resolution on the 8th of this time, everyone used to run away to pay their old notes.
During the period last year, about Rs. 3000-3500 crore was collected in 47 urban units.
3000-3500 crore, where is 13,000 crore
Now these municipalities have been given four times the amount, whether sewerage systems are being set up for the poor people, whether water supply systems are being set up or the Anganwadi centres are being set up or not
There are many such examples of direct benefits that are visible.
Brothers and sisters, our villages, our farmers, these are the strongest pillars of the economy of our country.
On the one hand, because of this new transformation of the economy, every citizen in the midst of difficulties is reforming himself accordingly.
But I would like to extend my warm greetings to the farmers of my country.
Now I was investigating the figures related to the sowing of this season.
Whether it is wheat or pulses or oilseeds, I have an account of up to 20th November, the sowing has increased as compared to the same period last year.
In the face of difficulties, the farmers have found a way out.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given importance.
Under the Mudra Yojana, initiatives were taken to provide loans to them.
Several crores of rupees were given to the simple people under the Mudra scheme because crores of people are engaged in such small industries and crores of rupees are speeding up the business.
Today, whatever I want to tell my brothers and sisters of my small business, you can use this as an opportunity to enter the digital world.
You can also download the bank's app through your mobile phone.
Your contribution to the creation of a society without cash transactions can be immense. You can utilize your business and the entire banking system through mobile phones. Today, we can do business in many ways without handling the notes.
There are technical routes, they are safe, quick.
I just want you to give me your cooperation in achieving the success of this movement and I am confident that you will lead the transformation and you will be able to lead this kind of leadership.
I am confident that you will be able to do business of the entire village with the help of this technology.
I would like to tell the working brothers and sisters that more injustice has been done to you.
The wage of the paper is one, and the sum of your hands is another.
You will have to get your wages in full and no one will have to share it.
You should not be tortured.
If money comes to your bank accounts then you can also buy goods in the nearby stores through a small mobile phone so that you dont have to pay any smart phone and now even your mobile phone does the work of e-velot.
Therefore, my working brothers and sisters, I specially urge you to make your contribution in this scheme because I have made such a big decision in order to provide the benefits of the poor, the farmers, the workers, the suppressed and the deprived section of the society to the disadvantaged section of the society.
Today I would particularly like to interact with the youth.
We are putting a dandrora in the entire world that 65 of the people in India are under 35 years of age.
I am also aware that you are contributing to taking this forward in a positive way.
Guys, you are my real soldiers, you are my true comrades.
It is a wonderful opportunity for all of us to serve Mother India. This is a golden opportunity for the country to move towards economic heights.
My young friends, can you help me
You will be aware of the App, which means what is the App, you will be aware of online banking i. e.
These things are very simple for you and you are also using them.
But today, the immense work that the country wants to do, is a society that does not have a dream of cash.
It is true that 100 percent of the society is a society without cash.
But why shouldn't we make a beginning to make India a less cash society
Once you have started this low-cash utility society, the goal of a society that has no cash transactions will not be far away.
I am confident that you will never give me disappointment because all of us are carrying forward the desire to change the lives of the poor of India.
You will know how many opportunities are being created today to create a society without cash transactions, to introduce digital banking services or to introduce mobile banking services.
Each bank provides online access.
Wallet's direct content is e-purse.
Various types of cards are available.
According to Jan Dhan Yojana, there are RuPay cards with crores of poor families of India, RuPay cards which were used at a very low cost have started to be very useful after the 8th of December and has increased by 300 per cent.
Like the prepaid card on mobile phone, banks also get prepaid cards to spend money.
UPI is a nice place to do business so that you can buy goods, send money and get money.
This work is as simple as you send a message to the Wattspot.
Today, even a person who has no education knew how to send information to Wattspot and how to forward it.
Not only this, technology is very simple to the extent that a big smart phone is required for this work.
Money can also be exchanged through ordinary phones.
Whether it is a labourer, a vegetable seller, a dairy seller, a newspaper seller, a tea seller, a power seller, it can be used without any difficulty.
I have put pressure on efforts to make this process easier.
All the banks are engaged and are doing it.
Now we have abolished the extra fees for online business and we have ended all such taxes related to cards and you must have seen this thing in the newspapers in the last two-four days.
My young friends, despite all this, this is unmistakable throughout the generation.
I am very sure that all of you are actively involved in this great task.
I am observing the creative messages of WhatsApp, the slogans, poems, pieces, cartoons, new imagination and humor
And when we look at the creativity of our younger generation in the midst of challenges then I see that as if the Gita was born once even on the battlefield, as the specialty of this land of India, today, when we face such a huge change, I see a fundamental creation emerges amongst you.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work.
Yes, yes, I once again say that I need your help and I am confident that you and millions of youngsters of this country will do this work.
I assure you that you will be a part of a cashless society from today.
Make all the technology available online on your mobile phones.
You will have to lead a cashless society, a movement emanating from the net of notes, a movement that liberates the country from corruption, a movement that liberates people from black money and a movement that frees people from other problems.
Once you teach people how to benefit from RuPay card then the poor will give you blessings.
Within a month, we can stand as a new India and you can do this thing through your mobile phone
Go to 10 houses every day and join 10 houses everyday.
I invite you, come, your support is not enough, we will become the stalwarts of this change and we will make a difference.
We will move forward in this war that frees the nation from black money and corruption.
This country has created a massive revolution.
My dear young friends, I once again appeal to you all to take this movement forward.
I invite all of you to take up this task on a social and personal basis, each school, college, university, National Cadet Corps and National Cadet Corps.
We will take this task forward.
We have got an opportunity to serve the country with the best, we should not miss this opportunity.
My brothers and sisters, today is the birth anniversary of one of the greatest poets of the country, Harivansh Rai Bachchan Ji, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai Ji, today Amitabh Bachchan has given a slogan for cleanliness drive.
You might have noticed that the most loved artist of this century, Amitabh ji, has taken forward the cleanliness drive with great vigour.
Harivansh Rai ji had identified himself through this tax.
I offer my homage to Harivansh Rai.
I would like to express my gratitude to Amitabh ji for joining the Mann Ki Baat and leading the cleanliness drive.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat your thoughts, your feelings, your letters and your gov and narendramodi app keep me connected with you.
Mann Ki Baat will now be broadcast at 11 o'clock, but it will start soon after its completion in the regional languages.
Thank you very much for all of you.
Deepawali is being celebrated everywhere in India with fervor and enthusiasm.
In 365 days, in some corner of the country, our country is a country where there is a festival.
But one thing that we can clearly see is that this entire journey of festivals of India, their depth, depth and acceptance of the people, all these are linked to a mantra - to take individuality towards society.
Festivals express responsibility for trees, trees, rivers, animals, mountains and birds.
Now we celebrate holidays on Sundays but you must have noticed that the people of the previous generation, be it the working class or the fishermen, they have observed a holiday in the days of purnami and amavasya.
Science has proved that what kind of change is there in the sea water during the days of Paurnami and Amavasya, what kind of impact is there on the nature.
This also affects the human mind.
That is, in our country, the tradition of celebrating holidays with grandeur and science has also been preserved.
Today, we are celebrating the festival of Deepawali, as I have said earlier, it is the teaching and wisdom of every festival of ours.
It gives us the message of Deepavali and Damaso Maa Jyotirkaya, from darkness to light.
This is not just the darkness of light.
The darkness of superstition, the darkness of illiteracy, the darkness of poverty and the darkness of social evil.
If we can free ourselves from the darkness of Deepawali and the darkness of individuals who have burnt the fire of Deepawali and made it bitter in the society, then this is the aim of spreading light on Deepawali.
One thing is well known to all of us, you can go to any corner of India and see whether it is a very wealthy house or a slum of the poorest of the poor, whether it is the festival of Deepawali, you can see that the cleanliness drive in every family is shining.
There is cleanliness in every corner of the house.
He will keep his soil sewer clean that the poor will have earthen pots but Deepavali has come.
Canada's Prime Minister Dipawali is also sharing his film on Twitter.
The UK Prime Minister had organised a reception on the occasion of Deepawali in London to connect all societies.
With great celebrations, there is no city in the UK that does not celebrate Diwali.
Singapore's Prime Minister shared a film in Instagram with pride from the world.
Well, what do you know about that film
It is a film that 16 women members of the Singapore Parliament wear Indian saris and stand at the doors of the Parliament, which is a much widespread film.
All these have been done on the occasion of Diwali.
The thing I want to say is that Deepawali is a shining day and a great day to inspire people from all over the world towards light.
During the days of Deepawali, news of accidents, fires and premature deaths are concerned.
There is another problem - when doctors go to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers on the occasion of Diwali then there is a more difficulty in getting together.
In particular, I appeal to the parents and the guardians to be careful that while the children are burning fat, there should be elders with them.
Deepawali is celebrated in our country for a long time.
This is not a matter of one day
Govardham Pooja, Bhai Duj and Lap Panchami can be said in such a way that this is a long time to celebrate the bright festival of Karthik Poornima.
Along with this, we are also celebrating the festival of Deepawali and are also engaged in preparations for the Chat Puja.
In the eastern parts of India, the festival of Sat-Pooja is a big festival.
In a way, it is a big festival, it is celebrated for four days, but there is a special feature for it which gives a very deep message to society.
It is difficult to calculate what the Sun God has given us, from whom we all are able, whether directly or indirectly, it is difficult to calculate what God has given us.
This sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers and the security forces have been emotionally disturbed in my mind.
I want to share one thing from the world of these feelings - we will dedicate this Diwali to the security forces.
I had called upon the countrymen to participate in a movement of Sandesh2Soldiers, i.e. news for the soldiers.
I would like to assure you that there is no citizen who has no respect for the country's soldiers, pride in the army and pride in the security forces.
The media has also turned this inspiration into a day of gratitude to the soldiers.
When we are in the mood of celebrating, when we think of them then a new energy emerges in those memories.
Even a message gives multiple energy and the country has shown this thing.
Some painted, laid bars, and made cartoons.
I can imagine how proud it is for the soldiers of my country.
So many things have been identified in Sandesh2soldiers' hashtag.
I would like to read the poetry sent by Shri Ashwini Kumar Chouhan.
Ashwini ji writes: I celebrate festivals, I am happy, I smile, I celebrate festivals, I am happy, I smile, all these are because of you.
I convey my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, Sivani has sent a telephone message to me, saying, My dear countrymen, there are soldiers in the place of birth and there are soldiers in the house where they enter.
Let's hear what the soldiers want to say.
PM said, "Greetings, I am Shivani Mohan.
Army officers, soldiers and their families and their wives make a lot of sacrifices.
In a way, even the entire military community has received a very good news.
My dear countrymen, the brave soldier is seen not only on the border but at every stage of his life.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the practice of open defecation.
Vikas Thakur is a small village of Badana in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Our soldiers from the Indian Border Force went to their village on vacations.
When there was a Panchayat in the village, he went there and there was talk of constructing toilets in the village panchayat.
It was found that some families were unable to construct toilets due to lack of money.
He immediately took his cheque book and handed over the cheque of Rs. 57,000 to the Panchayat Speaker and asked him to hand over the 57 houses where there are no toilets to every household, to every household, to build 57 toilets, to make the village Open Defecation Free.
Vikas Tagore has shown that he has provided 1000 rupees per day to 57 families and has given a new energy to the cleanliness drive.
This is the reason why Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the practice of open defecation.
I would like to express my gratitude to the youth for this thing that has happened in Kerala too.
Immediately, the shields of the National Cadet Corps, national welfare programmes and engineering students came together to decide to build toilets.
The students carried all the items required to build toilets such as bricks, cement, etc. on their shoulders throughout the day.
They constructed toilets in the village through their hard work and these youngsters freed themselves from the practice of toilets in the remotest jungles of the village.
That is why Kerala is going to become an open defecation free state.
The state of Gujarat has declared that more than 150 municipalities are free from open defecation.
10 districts have been declared free from this practice.
But generally, these things are not taken into consideration.
The old scheme and the new scheme are being implemented and the upcoming projects are expected to take place in this manner.
In our country, those households where there is a gas stove, those households where there is electricity, they dont need kerosene.
However, those who are worried about the government, those who are provided with kerosene, those who are being provided with gas and electricity, they are getting the opportunity to make money for middlemen.
Look at a big change that will prevent black market sales, which will benefit the environment, which will save our foreign exchange and facilitate people.
Yes, there is no doubt that the middle class and the non-covered will suffer.
My dear countrymen, Gandhiji has always been a guide to us.
In every case, his claim that where the country should go and how to travel determines the quality.
The need of the hour is to focus on the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take steps one after the other to get them out of trouble.
Whatever our old beliefs, we have to free our society from the distinction of male and female.
Now there are toilets for girl children in schools and toilets for children.
This is a good time for our daughters to achieve a distinct India.
Even though the vaccine is being vaccinated on the government side, lakhs of children are getting rid of the vaccines and become victims of diseases.
Mission Indradhanush, a vaccination drive for children who have been left out of vaccine, provides the children with the power to get rid of dangerous diseases.
We are in the 21st century but the situation of darkness in the village cannot continue. A massive movement to bring electricity to the village is progressing successfully.
After so many years of independence, the poor mother cooked food at the woods and how her health would be when 400 cigarettes smoke in her body.
Efforts are being made to free 5 crore families from smoke and we are moving on the path of success.
Small traders, small businessmen, vegetable sellers, dairy sellers, end-to-end shopkeepers, etc. are getting interest loans from mortgage professionals.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana, these are the successful movements that have started to get rid of interest lenders.
Direct payment of money to the banks through Aadhaar and direct payment to the beneficiaries.
It is a good opportunity to get rid of the brokers in the lives of the owners.
We have to fill our hearts with the memories of the great personalities and do so.
But a telephone call from Punjab touched my heart. "Prime Minister, greetings, sir, I speak from Punjab.
Sir, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Sardar Patel had worked for uniting the country throughout his life, he had succeeded in this goal and united everyone.
I don't know what else the country's misfortune is, on that day, Smt. Indira Gandhi Ji was assassinated.
We all know very well what happened in the country after that.
I would like to know your views on how to prevent such unfortunate events.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not only for a human being.
After Chanakya, a Sardar and Sardar Vallabh Bhai have done the work of consolidating the country.
Sardar Patel ji had tried for unity and because of his main objective of unity, he had to face the anger of many but he was not loosened by the path of integration.
But on the birthday of the same ardar, thousands of ardars and families of thousands of ardars were killed after the assassination of Ms. Indira Gandhi.
The unleashed atrocities on the occasion of the birth anniversary of that great man, who spent his entire life in solidarity, pains us on one side of history.
But even in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the biggest strength of the country.
India's strength is the strength of unity in diversity, despite diversity of languages, different castes, different clothing and different food systems.
Every generation has a duty and every government has a responsibility in search of an opportunity for unity in every corner of the country and in promoting the principle of unity.
We will keep ourselves away from the divisive characteristics of separatism and the country.
Sardar ji has given us a united India and it is our responsibility to make it a great India.
The mantra of unity is the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
The journey of life of Sardar ji started in the farmers' struggle.
He is the son of a farmer.
Today we are hearing the name Amul.
Every object of Amul is well known in India and abroad.
But very few are aware that the dairy-producers cooperative union was formed because of Sardar's vision.
The district of GEDA was called Kera in those days, he strengthened this idea in 1942, and in the form of it today, we have a living example of how Sardar ji worked for the welfare of the farmers.
I offer my homage to Sardar ji.
On the 31st of October, the day of unity, wherever we may be, let us remember Sardar ji, let us commit ourselves to unity.
My dear countrymen, in this Deepawali series, the Karthika Paurnami is celebrated with fervor.
Guru Nanak Dev jis teachings belong to the entire humanity, not only to India but to the entire humanity.
It is the message of Guru Nanak Dev ji that service, poetry, Sarpad da Bal meaning good for all.
Peace, unity and harmony are the mantras.
Guru Nanak Dev ji was involved in every aspect of Guru Nanak Dev ji whose aim was to free society from diversity, superstition and evil practices.
May your dreams, your commitments and every possible success be achieved.
Over the past few days, a terrorist attack has been unleashed in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir and we have lost 18 soldiers of our country.
I salute all the brave and brave soldiers who laid down their lives.
This cowardly event has shaken the entire country.
There is a lot of distress and anger in the pulse of the people of the country
This loss is not only for the families of those soldiers who lost their children, lost their brothers and lost their husbands.
The entire country is experiencing this loss.
Therefore, my countrymen, I still say that I have said before you that day, the culprits will be punished and they will not be able to escape the punishment.
My dear countrymen, we have immense faith in our army.
They will defeat every manipulation by their might and the 125 crore people of the country will express their utmost courage in the way they can lead a peaceful and peaceful life.
We are very proud of our army.
Today, specially, I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir.
Citizens of Kashmir have begun to understand the country's enemies.
As they begin to understand the truth, they have begun to take away such destructive forces from them and travel on the path of peace.
Every Mother's wish is that schools and colleges should start functioning at a faster pace.
Over the past few days, business has also started well.
We are aware that peace, unity and harmony can be the solution to our problems, our path of progress and our path of development.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we will be able to provide the best way to the future generations of Kashmir if we have pacifically discussed and pacifically resolved every issue.
The responsibility of the security administration of the Kashmiri citizens.
The administration has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I also urge the security forces of the country to follow the capabilities, strengths, laws and regulations that we possess for law and order and ensure peaceful living of the common people of Kashmir.
Sometimes those who think differently from our views put forth new ideas.
Sharshvardhan, a student of class 11, has made a difference to my attention.
"After a terrorist attack, my mind was overwhelmed with anxiety, there was a feeling of ambiguity in doing something, but I didn't find any way to do it.
Harsh Vardhan, in this enraged environment, at such a young age, you have thought positively and it gives me joy.
But Harsh Vardhan has a great value for the anger in the minds of the people of the country.
This is the expression of the feelings of the people of the country.
Yes, you presented a positive approach.
But you are aware that during the 1965 war Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had led the country and this kind of feeling has emerged all over the country, it was very passionate and patriotic.
Every citizen had a commitment to do something in his mind.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was trying to give this feeling of the country a grand year.
He gave a mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and encouraged the common people of the country to work towards the service of the nation.
Every citizen should understand another attempt to express patriotism in the midst of the sound of the bomb blasts, which was presented by Lal Bahadur Shastri.
While Gandhiji was leading the freedom struggle, he successfully worked towards creative work in the society when there was a need for another platform when the freedom movement was intensely dreamt of.
Let us and our army fulfil our duties, let those in charge of governance fulfil their duties, let the people of our country and every citizen of our country make a positive contribution in this spirit of patriotism, then the country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, our sportspersons who have participated in the Para Olympic Games are a victory for human inspiration.
Varun Viswanathan ji has recorded the excellent performance of our sportspersons in the Narendra Modi App and has asked you to share it with your heart.
Not only you two, but every citizen of the country has got a sense of connect with the sportspersons who participated in the Para Olympics.
Beyond sports, these para Olympics and the achievements of our sportspersons have completely transformed the humanitarian outlook and the perspective that we see with disabilities.
I will never forget the words of our victorious sister Deepa Malik ji after winning the medal.
This time, 19 sportspersons, including three women from our country, participated in the Para Olympics.
In comparison with other sports, the psychology and determination of persons with disabilities are greater than their physical strength and capability in sports.
Mariyappan Thangavelu has won a gold medal in the elevation competition.
Mariyappan has lost his right leg at just five.
Poverty cannot restrict her mentality.
He is not a resident of a big city, nor a middle class family, nor a wealthy family.
He has achieved medals by leading a difficult life at the age of 21 and by contributing to physical distress and mental stress.
While they have raised our feelings, they have changed the perspective of seeing the differently abled.
Can anyone imagine that the Persons with Disabilities can dismantle the routine Olympics
This time it happened.
Abdul Latin Pear of Algeria has won the Gold Medal in the 1500m Olympic Games.
Once again I extend my heartiest congratulations to these sportspersons and I say that in the coming days, the Bharat Para Olympics will move in the direction of creating a positive plan for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a very different experience in the new government of Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a mega camp for the disabled persons in which many world achievements were created.
I had to meet a young girl who had no eye-seeker, who was named after Gauri Shardul, a small child from the long-lasting forest area of Nang district, who was sorry for her all the Ramakavima.
And she showed me some part of it, and I told it before the congregation: and the people were astonished.
I believe that the Government of India has achieved a global milestone in the New India.
The process of hearing appliances for 600 disabled persons with disabilities was carried out within 8 hours.
This was placed in the Guinness World Records.
It is a matter of great honour for our countrymen that three world achievements are being achieved by the Persons with Disabilities in one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on Gandhi Jayanti.
It may be remembered that cleanliness should become our nature, it should be the duty of every citizen, it should be the obligation of every citizen, it should be the obligation of cleanliness.
Now, on the 2nd of October, two years will come to an end, I assure you that there will be awareness about cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore people of the country.
Similarly, everybody has tried to take a step in the direction of cleanliness.
That is, 125 crore feet of the country are moving towards cleanliness.
If the direction is right then the results will be good.
Whether it is a common citizen or a ruler, government offices, roads, buses or railway stations, be it a school or a college, be it a place of worship, be it a hospital or be it a child or adult, the poor, the farmers and women of the village have made their contribution towards cleanliness.
Media friends have also done a constructive job.
This progress is not sufficient, but we still have to make progress.
It's very important
This is the reason that while talking about rural India, 2 crore 48 lakh toilets, that is, about 12 crore toilets have been constructed so far, and there is a commitment to construct another 12 crore toilets in the coming years.
In Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala, the habit of open defecation will soon be eliminated.
During my recent visit to Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji in Gujarat, the officers had told me that the date of October 2 will be the end of the habit of defecating open.
Come, people, let us make a solemn pledge and progress.
I would like to present a scheme before my younger brothers and sisters who are making full use of technology today.
The Government of India has organised a telephone number 1969 to know how the status of Swachh Bharat Mission is in your city.
You should make full use of this, especially the younger generation.
The Government of India is appealing to the corporate world to come forward and make your contributions better.
Give support to the profession of young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
We can utilize the districts as clean India partners and swachh bharat fellows.
This Swachh Bharat Abhiyan cannot be progressed if it is linked to the governments, it cannot be achieved if cleanliness is natural and it cannot be fulfilled.
Wealth from waste is also important.
Therefore, along with the cleanliness drive, we have to move from waste to fertilizer.
Fertilizers have been asked to buy waste-made compost fertilizers.
The farmers who want to engage in organic farming should find ways to get this fertilizer.
These fertilizers should be provided to those who want to improve the prosperity of their land, who are interested in the welfare of the land, who have suffered considerable loss due to chemical fertilizers, even if the requirement of this fertilizer is small.
Amitabh Bachchan has contributed to this task as a business ambassador.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, Municipal Mayors and Commissioners from all over the country are going to make deeper consultations on cleanliness.
What can be achieved by technology
What can be a financial model
There will be discussions on all such matters.
I am constantly watching innovative messages about cleanliness.
I read in a newspaper that day that students of Gujarat Technical University went to 107 villages to create awareness about the construction of toilets.
The Government of India has prepared a one-year schedule in its Ministries.
Every department should give a 15-day focus on cleanliness.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Department of Panchayati Raj and Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India, in collaboration with the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India, is implementing Swachhta Pakhwada on their respective borders from 1st to 15th October, 2019.
During the last two weeks of October, three more Ministries - Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs - will be implementing Swachhta Abhiyan on their respective territories from 16th to 31st October.
I appeal to the citizens that if you have any work related to these sectors then you too should join it.
You might have noticed that now the cleanliness related research campaign is going on.
Initially, 73 cities were surveyed on how cleanliness was done and it was placed before the people of the country.
There are more than 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh, and now we have resided in every city and we have hoped that the next time we will progress.
There is a competitive environment related to cleanliness.
All of us citizens should contribute to this movement as much as we can.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri will be celebrated.
It has been two years since the launch of Swachh Bharat Mission.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepawali, I have come here to ask you to buy some garlands.
I once again urge every family to buy some or the other thread, then it will burn the light on Diwali in the houses of the poor.
On the 2nd of October, as a citizen, can we not do anything related to cleanliness
I would like to urge you to associate yourselves with the cleanliness drive for 2 hours and 4 hours, and share your photo with me in the Narendra Modi App.
If you have a video, share that video.
With our efforts, this movement will get strength and a new pace once again throughout the country.
Recalling Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we reiterate our commitment to do something for the country.
In line with my request to quit gas subsidy in the past, the answers given by the people of the country are very inspiring for the country's survival.
This is a movement to collect food and clothing for the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, all our employees came out on the streets and took away the old sports items in the families and brought them to Anganwadi in the poorest of the poor.
Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya ji had explained the political ideas that have inspired millions of workers like me.
Today, the centenary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji, the political thought related to the roots of India, the idea of cherishing the tradition of Indian culture, the philosophy of philosophy of philosophy and humanitarian philosophy begins today.
Sarvajan Hittai, Sarvajan Sukhai, Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas.
Gandhiji also spoke of the well-being of those at the end.
How can we bring the benefits of development to the poorest of the poor
Deendayal ji had put forward the entire economic system in one word - 'Water for every hand' and 'Water for every land'.
The country must celebrate his birth centenary year as a good year for the poor.
The focus of the society, the government and the government should be on how to bring the fruits of development to the poor.
I recall Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was an inspiration for all of us and an influential inspiration for our thoughts.
What kind of inspiration is the master of this country giving me.
What are the aspirations of the common man of this country
In my mind and mind, the record of the Maman has emerged in Mann Ki Baat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for broadcasting my ideas and for making a complete effort to translate it into all languages.
They summed up the letters after Mann Ki Baat, gave suggestions and shouted slogans at the doors of the government, showed the grievances of the government, Akashwani prepared such letters and invited representatives from the government and set up a platform for solving the problems.
Mann Ki Baat is not limited to some 15-20 minute conversation, it is a new occasion for social transformation.
What else can be a matter of greater happiness
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all those who have contributed to its success.
My dear countrymen, next week Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijayadasamy are going to be held, arrangements for Deepawali are going on and in a way there is a different atmosphere throughout the country.
This is the power of energy efficiency, the unity of society is the strength of the country.
Whether it is Navaratri or Durga Puja, we will think of making this Shakti Puja a way of social unity.
To take the country towards new heights, we will observe the sacred days of Navratri and Durga Puja, taking into account the ideas of peace, unity and harmony.
We will celebrate Vijayadasami on the occasion of Vijayadasami.
This day is being celebrated across the country on National Sports Day.
He has done an important job in securing Indias Gold in the Olympic Games held in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
At that time, it was only 10 minutes to get the decision.
And Dhyan Chand put three rods in those ten minutes, and I put the rods in place of the wound.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a time for Mann Ki Baat, there are several suggestions on MyGov Internet or narendramodi App.
They are varied.
But this time I had the highest demands for a comment on the Rio Olympics.
I feel extremely embarrassing when the public is so much interested in the Rio Olympics, so much awareness and the pressure on the Prime Minister of India to talk about it.
Even beyond the grikettes, the people of India are so keen on other sports, there are so many awareness and so many information.
Sachin has written, I request you to talk about Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmaar in Mann Ki Baat this time.
One of these women is from North India, one from South India, one from East India and the other from the other from the corners of India.
It seems that the daughters of India have accepted the responsibility of making the country proud.
On MyGov web site, Shikar Dagur ji wrote that we could have done even better in the Olympics.
My best wishes to you all for the two medals we have received in Rio.
There is a need to undertake long-term tours in sports.
Our parents are focusing only on studies today.
Even now, in society, they see sports with the perspective of timelines.
We have to change this concept.
There is a need to inspire society.
Who else can do this thing better than you
Similarly, Shri Satyaprakash Mehra has also written on the narendramodiapp - Mann Ki Baat on Mann Ki Baat on the need for extra-curricular activities.
In a way, the same feeling reflected in thousands of writings.
It is true that there is no alternative to the fact that we cannot work as per our expectations.
We have only two medals in medals.
However, if you dont get medals then you can see that for the first time in many matters, India's sportspersons have shown considerable talent.
Our Abhinav Bindra ji was ranked 4th in the shooting category and he lost his medal in a very small way.
Likewise, Sania Mirza Rohan Bopanna took part in the Tennis competition.
We have done well in the Athletics sector this time.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalitha Babar has eligible for the final match.
For the first time in 36 years, men have succeeded in achieving the knock out in hockey competitions.
Vikas Krishan Yadav in boxing reached the final stage, but he could not get a bronze medal.
Several jawans, for instance, Aditi Ashok, Dattu Pognel and Dhanu Das were very good.
My dear countrymen, we need to do more.
But if we continue to work as we have done so far, perhaps we may have to be disappointed again.
I've made an announcement about setting up a committee.
The Government of India will deeply absorb it and consider what kind of activities are there in the world.
Action plan will be envisaged on what sector we can do well.
Our vision of 2020, 2025, 2028 should be evolved.
I appeal to all the enthusiastic Indian citizens to send their suggestions to me at the narendramodi app.
Let the State Governments send their suggestions after discussions.
My dear countrymen, the 5th of September is Teachers Day.
I could learn a lot with these little boys.
For me, the 5th of September is not only Teachers' Day but also Education Day.
But this time I had to go to the G20 Summit and today I feel like expressing my feelings in Mann Ki Baat.
The more important the mother has in her life, the more important is the place of the teacher.
We have seen teachers who are more interested than us.
They have dedicated their lives for their disciples, for their students.
Today, I am seeing Gopichand as an outstanding teacher across a sportsperson.
On Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji, his penance for sports and his entire involvement in the success of the sportspersons.
Teachers' contribution is always felt in the lives of all of us.
On the 5th of September, the former President of India, Dr.
Birthday of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan
Whatever position he had in his life, he always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only this, he will always say that a good teacher does not die.
The books that he had read in that month would have been referenced and cited.
He would have considered what I have done throughout the month as wrong in his vision.
Something is like teaching me in his classroom even today.
Even today, he has been giving me a distance education in a way.
When I look at his 90th year and his signature, I wonder how he can write so many pearls in this old age.
Because my signature is so bad that if someone has written beautifully, it will increase my respect.
You must have experienced as much as I have experienced.
Whatever good you have in your life by your teachers, you will say it globally, there will be a change in the perspective of our teachers, there will be a respect.
It is our responsibility to increase the dignity of teachers in society.
If you take a photo with your teachers, if there was any incident with your teacher then you must share it on the narendramodiap.
It is a matter of valuable value to see the contribution of the teachers of the country in the eyes of the students.
But when we talk about Ganesh Chaturthi then it is natural for us to return our memories to Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
The tradition of celebrating the Ganesh Chaturthi socially is the gift of Lokamanya Tilak.
He transformed religion into a day of national awareness, a day of social culture through a demonstration.
The Ganesh Chaturthi also discussed all the questions that touched the lives of the society, so that a new upheaval and a new upheaval could be created in the society.
It is not only his mantra but it is also his mantra: Swarajya is our birthright, it should be the focal point of view, it should be the strength of the freedom struggle.
Today, not only in Maharashtra, but also in the entire country, the Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated socially.
They are discussing public matters, conducting article competitions, organising rivalries in shaping the rockets.
The scenes in it would have artistically illuminated the things that touch society.
In a way, a movement that can create awareness for all is being carried out through a socially demonic segment.
Lokamanya Tilakaraswarajam has given us the genre of our birth.
But we are now in independent India.
Come on, I'll call you.
Celebrations are the forces of society.
They provide a new life to individuals and society.
Life is not possible without celebrations, but it has to be changed according to the need of the hour.
I can see that this time many people have written about Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Pooja.
They are concerned about the environment.
Mr Sankara Narayana Prishant has steadily appealed to you all to understand Mann Ki Baat programme that you should not use the statues made by the plaster of Paris.
He and many others have expressed their concerns that the statues made by the Plaster of Paris are not conducive to the environment.
I urge you all to use the sculptures made by the soil or the statues of wicked people to restore our old tradition.
Ganesh is the one who removes embarrassment.
In such a scenario, we should not build a statue of a genre that causes embarrassment.
I don't know how you will take what I'm saying, but I don't say that, many people say that.
A sculptor of Pune, Shri Ajith Dodbale, Nisark Mitra, Vigyan Brabodini, Nisark Kata of Vidarpa, Gyan Brabodini of Pune, Kirkawasa RA Raja of Mumbai.
Such organisations and individuals take greater difficulty in building silken idols and propagating them.
An unpolluted Ganesh Chaturthi is also a social service.
There is still some time for Durga Puja.
Employment through such terracotta statues should be provided to the families of traditional idols.
We will make a resolution that our ponds will be protected by the soil of the rivers and the environment will be protected.
It is natural that all the people of the country are proud of the fact that Mother Theresa, who has served for the poor of India, is now being given the title of Pilgrimage.
Every moment we have got the privilege of learning something or the other from the holy sages, sages, saints and great men.
We have received something from them, we have learnt more and we have understood good things.
My dear countrymen, when the Task of Progress is a mission then how big a change can be brought about
People's energy is seen as a form of Mahesh Shakti.
The Government of India in collaboration with the five State Governments in the past has been making a successful effort to clean the Ganga and to make it a clean Ganga.
We invited the leaders of the villages living on the banks of the River Ganga to meet in Allahabad on 20th of this month.
And these were men and women.
I convey my best wishes to all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have done this great job.
I also express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chief Ministers of the five State Governments who have been associated with the peoples power and have taken a vital step towards the Ganga.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch my mind and I have a special respect for those who create such an opportunity.
On 15th July, more than 1.
More than 25 lakh students wrote to their parents socially.
Some people in English, some in Hindi and some in Chattisgarh had written to their parents saying that there should be toilets in their homes.
They had demanded to construct a toilet. Some children had written that if you don't celebrate my birthday this year, it's okay, but you must have constructed a toilet.
Children between the ages of seven and seventeen have done this work.
There is a 16-year-old Mallam in the Kopal district of Karnataka who has done a Satyagraha against her family.
He didn't do anything for himself, he didn't wear good bracelets or sweets
Beti Bachao Mallamma's obsession is that we need a toilet in our house.
Look at the significance of village leader Mohammad Shahi, he arranged for 18000 rupees and he built a toilet within a week.
But everyone is connected in some way or the other, everybody is contributing to this thing.
I also urge the TV channels to make such short films and organize competitions.
There is no need for a big studio or a big camera to produce a film
In today's era, you can use the camera in your mobile phone to produce the film.
Our respected President Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated a new Akashwani Maithri Channel in Golgata.
The question of launching a radio channel by the President of India can be raised in many minds.
Bangladesh is our neighbour.
We are aware that Bangladesh and West Bengal have a common cultural heritage.
Here, Akashwani Maitri and BangladeshBeedar Radio are beyond the borders and people speaking Bengali from both sides will be happy to hear the audience.
People-to-people contacts are the biggest contributors of Akashwani.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated it.
I also express my gratitude to Bangladesh for fulfilling this task.
I also congratulate Akashwani friends for their contribution to foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, all of you may have made me the Prime Minister of the country but I too am a man like you.
Therefore, sometimes my mind gets wet with some emotional events.
Such emotional events provide a new energy and a new zeal, which inspires the people of the country to achieve something.
A letter that came to me just a few days ago touched my heart.
A mother of about 84 years of age has written this
If the retired teacher had not asked for his name, I would have mentioned his name.
I also forgot the subsidy, as you asked me to quit the gas subsidy.
As far as I am concerned, the letter written by the Prime Minister of India is like the Padma Shri award.
My dear countrymen, you are aware that I have written a letter from my side to all those who have quit the gas subsidy and have made an attempt to give it to those who have left the subsidy.
It is my endeavor to write letters to more than one crore people.
My dear countrymen, we have been suffering from drought last year but in August this year we have suffered a series of floods.
There have been repeated floods in some parts of the country.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the Local Bodies, the Social Welfare Organisations and the Citizens have made every effort to live in.
However, some of the actions that have taken place in the midst of this tragic flood are remarkable.
We will be reminded in August this year of what is the power of living together, what is the result of walking shoulder to shoulder with all.
In August 2016, the opposition political parties, including the 90 parties across the country, and all the political parties in the Parliament, together, passed the Goods Services Tax Act.
Appreciations for this will essence all political parties.
This is a wonderful example of the benefits that if all political parties travel together in one direction.
Similarly, all the political parties of the country had discussed the Kashmir issue in one voice regarding the situation in Kashmir.
The message to the world, the message to the separatist forces, and the understanding of the people of Kashmir was also expressed.
After talking to all the political parties about Kashmir, one thing came to light and if I ask them to suppress it in two words then they are unity and love.
These two words blossomed into the original mantra.
Any death in Kashmir, be it the life of a young man or be it the life of a security force, the loss is ours, it is ours, it is ours, it is our country's, it is our belief that the confidence of the people of 125 crore country, the faith of the people of the country from the leader of the village to the Prime Minister of the country.
One day there should be an answer to these filthy boys, who inspire some minor girls to create unrest in Kashmir.
I have faith in 125 crore people of the country.
Yesterday morning I got the opportunity to spend some moments with the youth of Delhi and I hope that in the days to come, the inspiration for sports throughout the country will increase the enthusiasm and zeal of every young man.
We all are aware that the biggest Kumbh Mela of World Sports is going to take place in a few days.
The word 'Reo' is going to be ringing in our ears.
Yesterday, in Delhi, the Government of India had made a grand arrangement for the Run for Rio to play, live, play and develop.
In the coming days, we will do something to encourage our sportspersons in whatever area we may be.
I am ready to do this work from your side.
The country's Prime Minister is ready to deliver your best wishes to our sportspersons.
Come, let us all inspire every sportsperson in the days to come.
Today, while talking about the Rio Olympics, I read a poem written by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a poet from Punjab Central University.
Like him, many more poets might have written poems in this regard, some might have made them lyrics and songs, it might have happened in every language but today I want to share the poem written by Suraj ji.
Gold, and silver, and brass: and let the heavens be poured forth measure.
Suraj ji, I dedicate your feelings to all these sportspersons and I convey my best wishes to you all on behalf of my side, on behalf of 125 crore countrymen and on the occasion of our flag hoisting in Rio.
Mr.
But whenever Abdul Kalams name is being named, a future picture of a Skill India as a science, technology and a missile shadows our eyes.
In that way, has your government been trying to realise the dreams of Abdul Kalam
And if we want to adjust our footsteps then we must do research and innovations that are the life of technology.
If research and innovations are not created, the way foul smell starts flowing in stagnant waters, similarly technology will become a burden for us.
If we don't do research and innovation, but depend on old technology, then we will be late in the changing era
Therefore, the government has been making several efforts to sow the dairy land of science, technology and research in the minds of our younger generation.
That's why I say Let us aim to innovate and innovate.
When I say AIM, it means Atal Innovation Mission.
If we want to build next generation innovators then we should connect our minorities with this scheme.
Therefore, the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
Wherever such shining centers are being set up in schools, Rs. 10 lakhs will be provided and another Rs. 10 lakhs will be provided for maintenance in five years.
Similar innovations are directly linked to the Capitol Incubation Centre.
If we have a powerful incubation centre, we get a system that requires to create innovations, experiments for start-ups and stabilize them.
While it is essential to set up a new composition centre, it is also important to strengthen the old centres.
In our daily lives, there are problems in our eyes.
Now we need to find technical solutions.
As Atal Grand Challenges, we have called upon the younger generation of the country to take up research and innovations to find solutions to the problems faced by your eyes.
The Government of India wants to give a special prize to the technology that has been identified for solving our problems.
It is also a matter of great pleasure that when we talk about Tinkering Lab, more than 13000 schools have applied and when we talk about the centre of creation, more than 4000 non-educational organisations have come forward to set up such centres.
I am convinced that Abdul Kalam is the real homage we can offer to research, innovation, find solutions to the problems we face in our daily lives through technology and simplify our hardships.
The more our younger generation pays attention to them, the greater their role in compiling the modern India of the 21st century will be, this will be a real tribute to the memories of Abdul Kalam.
My dear countrymen, sometime back, we were worried about famine and sometimes rain is enjoying it while there are reports of floods.
The State Governments and the Central Government have been working shoulder to shoulder shoulder to shoulder to provide assistance to flood victims.
There are some difficulties due to the rains, but every human being is able to overcome them because it is the cornerstone of all our economic activities and agriculture.
Sometimes life-long diseases that make us sad are also afflicting us.
But if we are awake, if we are tired then the ways and means of avoiding them are easy.
We'll take dengue fever.
We can protect us from dengue fever.
Even if the government, hospitals and doctors do their jobs, we should not allow dengue in our homes, in our areas and in our families, we should be cautious about the prevention of any disease caused by water, that is why I appeal to all of you.
My dear countrymen, I would like to draw your attention to one more issue.
Life becomes so urgent and fast that sometimes it becomes impossible to think about us.
You can get relief for a few moments, but you should stop the habit of taking antibiotics without consulting the doctors.
There is another problem: if a doctor recommends taking 15 antibiotic pills in 5 days, please complete it according to the recommendation of the doctor.
If we leave it slightly unnecessarily because it has become healthy, the microorganisms will be benefited and they will be further strengthened.
In the medical dialect it is called antibiotic resistance, and therefore it is important to follow the rules that take them as much as it is important to use antibiotics.
The government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance
You might have noticed that the antibiotic medicines that are now being sold on the bed are drawn in a red coat. This is to make you aware.
When we talk about health, I want to add one more thing to it.
Pregnant mothers in our country are sometimes extremely concerned about health.
Every year about 3 crore women in our country are pregnant but some mothers die during childbirth and some infants die during childbirth.
Sometimes both mother and child die.
Whatever the fact that the maternal mortality rate of mothers has declined over the last decade, we are still incapable of saving more lives of pregnant mothers.
Unknownly, what kind of problems such as anaemia, congenital infections, high blood pressure will prove to be beneficial for their lives during and after delivery.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has been implementing a new mission in the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Can my medical brothers and sisters dedicate themselves to this work for 12 days in a year
Many have written to me in the past.
I am sure you will associate yourself with it.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
Discussions are going on between people in the country and around the world.
India has been strengthening this idea for centuries.
In the song, Lord Krishna says, 'Sarvavrukshanam' means that I am in the trees.
It is said that there is no vegetation that has no medicinal properties and no medicinal properties.
An example of Sonal, a woman from Pune, attracted my attention.
On the observation of Mahabharata, it is said that trees also perform the duties of McChelva in the heavens, and Sonal has accepted the challenge of fulfilling not only the wishes of his parents but also the wishes of the entire society.
Krishi Khandu Maruthi Mahadre of Narayanpur village in Junner Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra
Several such efforts are being made.
During my tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, during the month of Bhadra, I have seen a large number of pilgrims visiting the Amba Devi temple.
Once a social service organisation has provided a sapling to those visiting the temples by offering a prasad to them and by taking it and planting it in your village, mother Amba will continue to bless you.
Hundreds of thousands of pedestrians were also offered trees that year.
Even temples can start the tradition of planting trees in the rainy season instead of Prasad.
This can pave the way for a peoples movement related to tree plantation.
I would like to ask my farmer brothers again and again that instead of wasting our land by constructing tree fences on the borders of our farmland, why should not we plant a coconut tree
Today, we have to import a single tree from abroad for manufacturing houses and chairs in India.
The government has created a mass movement and Rajasthan is a desert region.
Even there, a huge forest festival has been celebrated and a resolution of 25 lakh trees has been taken.
It is not a small thing to plant 2.5 million trees in Rajasthan.
Only those who know about the land of Rajasthan know what a big challenge it is.
In Andhra Pradesh, a resolution to increase green cover by 50 by 2029 has been taken.
Even in Gujarat, Van Mahotsav is a very popular tradition.
This year, several projects have been started in Gujarat like Mamar Van, Ekata Van and Shahid Van, in which several crores of trees have been planted.
As a foreign tour, multilateral agreements have been signed in a wide range of areas such as diplomatic diplomacy, non-cooperational organs, discussions on trade and defence related dialogue.
But for me, the visit to South Africa is like a pilgrimage.
When we think of South Africa, it is natural for us to recall the memories of Gandhiji and Nelson Mandela.
When words like Akims, Love and Forgiveness fall into the ears in the world, the faces of Gandhiji and Mandela will be seen in front of us.
As part of my visit to South Africa, I had to visit Phoenix and the place where Gandhiji lived is known as Sarvodaya.
I got the opportunity to visit Peter Maritzburg Railway Station, the train where Gandhiji travelled, the train where he sowed the seed of Mohantas turning him into Gandhiji.
This time I have got the opportunity to meet many important personalities who sacrificed their youth for equality and equality.
They fought shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela and spent 20-25 years with him in prisons.
In a way, they had sacrificed their entire youth, and I had the greatest opportunity to visit the great personalities of Nelson Mandela, Ahmed Kathada ji, Lalu (Christian EEBA), Siba ji, George Besos and Roni Castries.
While I was talking to them, while listening to their prison experiences, there was no bitterness or bitterness in their minds.
The feeling of equality and equality for all of us is a way to lead us towards a bright future.
Let us take pride in these Indians who have lived in the original mantras of our lives in South Africa too.
I recently read in a news article that a woman trapped in fraud and fraudulent email net had lost 11 lakh rupees and finally committed suicide.
I am extremely sad about the condition of a woman and her family.
I want to know what your views are about such fraudulent emails.
A new strategy of using technology is spread all over the world.
The way technology is playing a big role in the economic system, its misuse is also increasing.
When the daughter had to retire and get married, the person who owns a house was given a slap one day, you have received a huge reward from abroad, if you want to achieve this, put 2 lakh rupees in the bank account for the customs settlement.
Anybody can create and despatch a falsified letter box, get your Credit Card number and Debit Card number and clean your bank accounts through technology.
This is a new kind of fraud, this is a digital fraud.
I believe that we should protect ourselves from this conflict, Id like to be awake and if such letters come to us then we should immediately share them with our familiar friends and help them to create awareness.
My dear countrymen, while the Parliament session is going on, I have the opportunity to meet many people of the country.
I had a comfortable experience during such a meeting.
Some students from Aligarh met me.
The enthusiastic rush of the student was fleeing the shore, bringing a huge album, enjoying their faces.
They brought films that beautified the Aligarh railway station with them.
They had constructed a layer garden constructed by plastic bottles at the railway station and had given a new shape to the station.
If you have the opportunity to visit Aligarh then you must visit the railway station.
This kind of information has come to me about several railway stations in India and people from all the regions of the country are enjoying their regional artworks on the walls of railway stations.
One can feel a new feeling.
This is an example of how people's participation can transform.
My congratulations to all those involved in such work in the country, especially to my friends of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of festivals also begins in our country along with the monsoon season.
And you and your houses, and your publications, will enjoy feasts.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is very important.
Just like last year, during the Rakshabandhan period, can you not present Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiJeevanJyotiJeevanJyotiJeevanJyotiBimaYojana to the mothers and sisters of the country
My dear brothers and sisters, please give me a prize in life that is really safe and secure.
Why do we keep a woman in our homes for cooking food or doing household chores, or he may be the daughter of a poor mother
Whether they can also get the Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiJeevanJyotiJeevanJyotiJeevanJyotiBimaYojana as a gift during this Raksha Bandhan festival
My dear countrymen, many of us would have been born after independence.
We can create such an environment.
Freedom Day is not a programme of governments, it should be of the people of the country.
Like Deepawali, we have to celebrate this day as our festival.
I want to do something positive with the spirit of patriotism.
You can tell this thing to the people of the country and I would like to invite you to express it clearly from the Red Fort.
I don't want the comments from the Red Fort to be the Prime Minister.
Whatever reflected in the Red Fort has to be a feeling of 125 crore rupees.
Several events are scheduled during holidays.
Awareness is spread in many villages
Someone told me a few days ago that the Hivre Bajar Gram Panchayat in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra and the villagers there had emotionally approached the water problem.
Villages that want to save water may be strong, but after interacting with the farmers, the entire cropping pattern has changed the farming system.
They decided that those crops which use more water, whether it is sugarcane or banana, should not be cropped.
Something is simple to ask, but this is not so easy.
But look at my farmer brothers and sisters, they have left immediately because sugarcane needs more water.
They cultivated fruits and vegetables throughout the country, i. e.
They have succeeded in their own efforts to tackle the problem of water today through various initiatives such as drip irrigation, rain water conservation and water recharge.
Well, I have talked about Hivere Bajar, a small village, but there may be many villages like this.
I convey my best wishes to the villagers for their excellent work.
Someone told me about the Gorwa GORVA Gram Panchayat in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.
When the Indian government brings water to Ladur through trains, I think it is a message to the world.
It is human nature to feel that whenever there is any difficulty, if there is a good news from somewhere then the entire embarrassment is lost.
This time, I feel like there has been some enjoyable news since I heard that the rainfall is likely to be 106 to 110.
Even though it has been raining for a long time, the news of good rainfall has also been refreshing.
My dear countrymen, the way the news of good rainfall provides, the way it creates opportunities and presents the challenge.
Can we ever start a village-based water conservation campaign
Farmers need soil and this helps them in the field of farming.
Why don't we put the soil in the lakes of villages in the dustbins
While the soil health of the fields will increase, the water conservation of water storage will also increase.
What if the empty cement sauces, empty fertilizer bags filled the stones and the soil and put it on the way out
I have always said one thing that whenever we go to Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji, we can see different places there, one place is worth seeing.
It means that how the ponds under the house had been constructed 200 years ago to keep the water stored, it should be known how clean the water is.
His concern is very natural because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
There were several governments, several schemes were formulated and the money was spent so that it is natural to have such a question in the minds of millions and millions of people of the country like Bhaira Kumar Krishna.
Religious people consider Ganga as a source of housing.
Ganga itself gives us work and it is the Ganga that gives us the power to live.
The way the Ganga Pravah is being done, the economic activity of the country also gets a boost.
A Bhagirath brought the Ganges to us but crores of devotees are required to save it.
People cannot succeed in work without participation, so we all have to become a change agent for cleanliness and cleanliness.
We have to say this thing again and again and again.
Several initiatives are being taken by the government.
Efforts are being made to seek the full cooperation of all the states on the banks of Ganga.
Efforts are being made to bring together social and clean organizations.
Several measures have been taken to prevent surface cleaning, hygiene and industrial pollution.
Every day solid wastes come in large quantities through the canals.
In the coming days, in many more places, the mechanical dumping programmes will be implemented and the benefits of this will be felt immediately by the people living on the banks of the Ganges.
My heart feels that this too will have good results.
I am glad that some officials have told me that the expulsion from the roads in the states of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh has been successful in ero liquid discharge for the past few days.
The expulsion of the black liquor from the paper plants has almost completely come to an end.
This shows us that we are travelling in the right direction. Awareness has increased.
Not only on the banks of the Ganges but also on the far-flung southern parts of the country, they are asking whether the Ganga will be clean or not.
It is a matter of faith of the people that will surely bring success in cleaning the Ganga.
People are donating money to clean the Ganga.
The system is being implemented in a very nice manner.
My dear countrymen, today is April 24th.
On April 14, we celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar. Today, on April 24, we are celebrating the Panchayati Raj Day.
This is a good thing that happened in a coincidence that the Government of India, in collaboration with the State Governments, initiated the drive from April 14 to April 24, for 10 days from Gramodhyam to Bharat Uday, in collaboration with the State Governments, from April 14 to April 24.
Today, on 24th April, I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Day in Jharkhand, where our majority tribal brothers and sisters live, this movement has created a massive awareness.
How to strengthen the democratic systems at village level in all corners of India
How to make villages self-reliant
How can the villages embrace their own development plans
Several programmes have been organised in several villages of India in ten days, which may be less than that.
In an innovative way, I congratulate all the state governments and the rural leaders who have utilised it as an opportunity to empower democracy for the benefit of villages and villages all these days.
Awareness has been generated in the villages, that is the guarantee of India's rise.
The source of Indias rise lies in the village emergence
Therefore, we all are focusing on the rural awakening and we will achieve the desired results.
There has been a need for improvement in the education sector for the past several years.
Today, if the parents have a primary dream in every family then it is necessary to provide quality education to the children.
The idea of housing, vehicle, etc. is all after.
This feeling is enhanced in the minds of people of a country like India.
Therefore, I appeal to all the parents to take some time to discuss the practices of the schools in a detailed manner.
If something gets up in mind, go to school and meet teachers.
This awareness should lead to reduction in the many problems faced by our education system and the contribution of the people.
In our country, all the governments have focused more on education and every government has been making its own efforts.
It is also true that there has been a significant period of time when educational institutions should be established, education system should be expanded, schools and colleges should be established, teachers should be included and maximum children should go to school.
In a way, an attempt to spread education was made primarily and it was also necessary.
But the importance of expansion is more important than that of the development of our education system.
We have done a great job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Our primary aim is to provide good education to all through education drive.
What is true is that we have to undertake a long-term journey.
But if the people of 125 crore country have decided that a long journey will also be possible.
As Sharmila ji said, it is very important that we have to bring about fundamental changes.
India's universities can also become world-class competitive universities.
Just as the importance of education is equally important, similarly the role of technology in education is going to be immense.
I am confident that distance education and technology will facilitate our education and in a short span of time its results will begin to appear in the eyes.
My greetings to the Prime Minister, I talk to Mona Karna from Bijnor.
In today's era, sports is even more important than education for the youth.
There should be a team spirit, a team spirit, a good leader, and there should be a complete development of them.
I can say this through my experience because I have been in the Bharat Saranacharya system which has had a good effect on my life.
This required greater integration.
I am overwhelmed by their vastness and zeal that they have to do something.
I myself have been a shield in the National Cadet Corps. I know that through these institutions, a new perspective is being created.
I have enjoyed the benefits of my pedagogy, I have to fill up a new energy in these institutions and give a new impetus.
This time I have put some things in front of them.
During this season, why should not our youth and all the organisations participate in the immense work of water conservation
How many rounds, how many districts we can prevent open defecation.
My dear countrymen, today I have to talk about the issue of compulsory thinking.
I see it as a shocking thing.
You will be aware of the fact that how many gas cylinders will be provided by the party was the subject of discussion in the last several elections and the political situation in our country was there.
On the other hand, economists have been pressurizing subsidies to reduce subsidies, which led to the formation of a number of groups, which gave suggestions and decisions on subsidies reduction.
Several crores of rupees were spent on these committees.
But today I feel proud of the people of my country.
But if we look at the account, more than 80 percent of these 1 crore people went to the distributors themselves, stood in queue, gave them written form and quit their subsidies.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government gives some exemption from any taxation system, it will bring a lot of praise to the government on television and newspapers throughout the week.
Because they have forced political leaders to think in a new perspective.
This is an event that has forced the country's economists to think in a new perspective.
Even the economists of the world presenting a variety of possibilities, this is an extraordinary phenomenon beyond their thinking.
We have to think about it at some point.
This is an extraordinary thing that if one crore families give up subsidies, get gas cylinders instead of one crore poor families, the surviving financing of one crore families by quitting subsidies then it is an extraordinary thing.
I urge all the political leaders to say something wherever we go and trust the people.
May you have the benefits that you cannot even think of.
We have to travel in this direction.
For example, in my mind, there was a feeling of the fact that why the 3rd and 4th level workers should conduct a direct examination and why shouldnt we not put faith in their examination marks.
Even if we can make an announcement that there will be no ticket checkers on some railway tracks, I feel like doing so.
We can do many such experiments.
Once we have faith in the people of the country, there will be immense benefits.
This situation is not created by any political leader but by one crore families of the country.
A person named Ravi has written to me - good news everyday, good day and every day you should tell your officers about a good thing.
The worst news in every newspaper and the media is the breaking news.
Is there no good thing happening in our country with 125 crore people
A few days ago, a newspaper had sent me a letter, saying that we will not even release a bad news on Monday and will release a constructive message.
What is true is that a positive news environment has been created.
Everyone feels that good news and real news should be available to everyone.
Whatever a well-known person gives the best information, however beautiful it is, however beautiful it can be explained in a better way, it can be further benefitted by a better message.
Good news is a catalyst for good work.
The more we gain strength for good, the less space for evil is the truth.
If we take the lamp, darkness will automatically depart and surely depart.
You can also contribute to it.
Ravi ji, you have given good advice but please don't be angry with me.
Together we will make positive efforts, we will be able to speak constructively and we will be able to take positive steps.
Kumbh Mela is the specialty of our country.
The Kumbh Mela can become a tourist attraction.
Many people of the world are unaware that millions and millions of people gather on the bank of the river for several days.
The festival is celebrated in a peaceful and peaceful environment.
These events systematically accomplish greater standards as peoples participation in event management dimensions.
I have been watching the films related to the Simhastha Kumbh for the past two days.
I want the tourism department of the Government of India and the State Governments to organize a photographic competition in this regard.
You can ask the people to give you the best pictures.
This can definitely be done.
When the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh met me, he told me that special attention has been paid to cleanliness.
Cleanliness is aimed not only at this festival but at the same time people should carry the idea of cleanliness in their hearts.
While I acknowledge that the Kumbh Mela is a festival related to spirituality, I believe that it will also become a social opportunity.
How we can increase our love for water, how we can cherish water and how we can use Kumbh Mela to spread the message of water harvesting.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
It takes me to see that you are talking to me but I am trying to dedicate your thoughts and expressions to you with the help of Mann Ki Baat.
I remember that last time I had talked about a book containing the stories of Bremchand and whoever wanted to read it, I had asked you to share your thoughts about it through the Narendra Modi App.
A large number of people have put forward their views on books on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business and living standards.
Some others are asking me to talk about many other books.
I'm sure I'll talk about some other books.
But now I have to admit that I do not get enough time to read more books.
But I feel that we have to carry forward the experience that has been experienced in the last one month.
Friends, I have touched Mann Ki Baat on water conservation but even before that, water conservation is a matter of touching your hearts and it is a matter of favouriteness for the common man.
If it has been a matter of shaking the entire country for a few days then it is water.
Several steps are being taken to ensure water conservation across the country.
People are sharing information about traditional methods.
The media has also stepped up several innovative movements related to water conservation.
I am very happy to know that Meghalaya, the most beautiful state of the Northeast, has created a water policy for itself.
I convey my best wishes to the state government.
Agriculture is being encouraged to cultivate less water consumption and no harm to farmers in Haryana.
Why should we not use these festivals for water conservation
Friends, some things in life fill us with enthusiasm
And especially the achievements of the children and their achievements give us a new energy and enthusiasm.
The things that I will say now can bring you pride and enthusiasm together.
We all know how trembling a word called cancer can be in the world.
While death is waiting at the doorsteps, these 10 children have not only brought out cancer in their struggle for life, but have also lauded the country for their extraordinary work.
This month the World Children's Winners Games World Child Winners Competition was held in Moscow.
The bet is being organised for shooting, square, swimming, drilling, time bound and table tennis.
These 10 winners of our country have won medals on this occasion and some of them have won more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, I am confident that the success that India has achieved in the space beyond the Chandrayaan 2 sky will give you joy and pride.
Sanjeev Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Golgata, B.
Several people like Arvind Rao have been calling on NarendraModi App and MyGov from different parts of the country to talk about Chandrayaan 2 in Mann Ki Baat.
The year 2019 is the most beautiful year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists launched the A-Sat in March, followed by Chandrayaan 2.
In the run-up to the election, we were unable to talk much about A-Sat.
But the A-Sat missile is 300 km above the earth in just 3 minutes.
On the 22nd of July, Bong Chandrayaan was swept away by pride across the country.
Chandrayaan 2: This goal is of immense significance.
Chandrayaan 2 will help in furthering our understanding of the Moon.
We will have to face temporary backgrounds even in our lives
Today, through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to present an interesting competition for the country's students' wealth and the younger generation and I would like to invite our youngsters to participate in this competition.
Space knowledge, Indias space programme and scientific technology will be the theme of this quiz.
For example, what is the need to do in rocket launch, how the satellites are placed in the orbit, what are the information we receive from the satellite, what is A-Sat
The competition is scheduled to be held on 1st August at MyGov web site.
I invite my young friends and student wealth...
I appeal to all the schools, parents and enthusiastic teachers to work hard to make your school a success.
I encourage all the student wealth to be associated with it.
The most interesting thing is that the Government of India will take the maximum number of students in every state to Sriharikota at their own expense.
Moreover, they will also get the opportunity to see the Chandrayaan landscape in the landscape in September.
Our Mann Ki Baat has given a boost to the cleanliness drive
Similarly, the efforts being made for cleanliness have also inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that began five years ago, today has set new benchmarks for cleanliness with the help of everyone's contribution.
I dont say that we have achieved the blessings of cleanliness but the success of cleanliness drive from open defecation to public places and the strength of the commitment of 130 crore countrymen
But we are not going to stop with it.
This movement is now moving from uncleanness to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I had to know through the media about Yogesh Saini and his team.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who has quit his job in America and has returned to serve Mother India.
Sometime back, he made a challenge not only to make Delhi clean, but also to make it beautiful.
Together with his crew, he began his work from the trash dumps in Lodhi Garden.
You might remember how the streets of Prayagraj were filled with paintings on the occasion of Kumbh.
I came to know that Yogesh Saini and his team had shown their handwriting there too.
We have experienced this thing in the beauty of cleanliness drive.
Wealth from waste should be strengthened in our society and it should be our culture.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I had to read an interesting comment in MyGov.
Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Shobian area of Jammu Kashmir, has registered this.
I like Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy to note that I have contributed constructively in the Village Return Programme in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The Action Plan was organised in June.
I think this will be the first action plan that people directly engage with the government.'
Several more things have been added to this programme to make it more interesting.
Sports competitions were organized for children under the Khelo India programme.
They were awarded sports equipment, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Certificates, List of Scheduled Castes and Tribal Certificates.
In a way, this arrangement, the festival of development, the celebration of people's participation, is a celebration of public awareness.
People took part in this developmental festival of Kashmir in large numbers.
While it is a matter of great happiness that the activities of this Action Plan were carried out in the villages along the way to the villages, the government officials used to climb on the difficult hills and walk for a couple of days to reach such remote villages.
The officers also visited border villages across the border and across the border, not only in Shobian, Pulwama, Gulkanv and Anantnag districts, but also without fear.
If the reception given to them had an impact on many officers then they had spent more than two days in these villages.
Organizing Gram Sabha meetings in these areas, ensuring greater participation of the people in these areas, and setting up their own programmes.
New determination, new zeal and wonderful results.
This makes it clear that the months of those who seek to sow hurdles and hurdles during their development journey will never succeed.
My dear countrymen, Dattatreya Ramachandra Pentha, who was awarded the Gyanpeeth Award, how did he know about Mari Kaal in one of his poems
People from different cultures and languages across India are celebrating the month of Maritime in their own way.
If we look around us in this season then the earth will be seen as if we have waged some green garment on it.
A new energy emerges on all sides.
During this holy month, many devotees take a watch, take a pilgrimage to Amarnath, many are on hunger strikes and with great enthusiasm wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami.
It is during this period that Raksha Bandhan Pandik will also be an expression of the love of brothers and sisters.
When we talk about Maritime, this time you will be happy to know that devotees have been participating in the Amarnath Yatra in more than four years.
From 1st July till now more than 3 lakh devotees have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than the number of people who participated in this pilgrimage for 60 days in 2015, this number has crossed just 28 days.
I would like to specially congratulate the people of Jammu Kashmir and their hospitality in the backdrop of the success of Amarnath Yatra.
All those who have returned after completing their journey have been attracted by the hospitality and pride of the people of the state.
All these will be extremely beneficial for tourism in the future.
Even in Uttar Pradesh, this year Saradham has started a pilgrimage and more than 8 lakh devotees have visited the Kedarnath temple in just four and a half months.
For the first time since the terrible natural calamity of 2013, so many people have made a pilgrimage.
I urge you all to go and enjoy beauty places in the monsoon season, wherever you may be in the country.
There cannot be a greater association than tourism and a pilgrimage to see such a beautiful place of our country, to feel the feelings of our people.
May this beautiful month of Maritime bring new energy, new aspirations and new aspirations to all of you.
Similarly, in August, White House is bearing the memories of the uit India Movement.
On the other hand, there is heavy rainfall in different parts of the country and people of many parts of the country have been affected by floods.
When we look at the rain on television, we get a perspective - the floods, the floods, the waters, the transportation stagnant.
I will come back after waiting for a month.
Today, people from all over the world will be celebrating Easter.
Today, when India is dancing with Australia, I extend my best wishes to the two contingents.
India won the gold medal in the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games and India was ranked 4th in the 1956 Olympic Games.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been brought down to the rankings.
Today, if our position in the FIFA rankings has fallen, it is difficult to give up on it.
Be it EPL or Spanish League or be it Super League of India, today I can see the increasing interest in footprint for Indian youth.
The youngsters of India are watching television to know more about the football.
At the same time, we can take this opportunity to take footprints to every village and every street.
What kind of opportunity is the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup that we should strive to create a new spirit of footprint among the youth on all four sides of this year.
I consider this an opportunity to brand India globally.
My dear students, you must have planned to visit tourism on holidays.
Only a few people go abroad and most of them travel in every state for five days or seven days.
Some people leave their states and go to other states.
There is a doubt that there will be a district in India where I do not go.
There is such an enormous power for tourism in creating our lives. Nowadays Indian youth are showing great interest in tourism and their enthusiasm is increasing.
They dont travel on the path that the old model has either gone or constructed, they want to do something new or something new.
I think it's a good sign.
There is also a case in our area that if coal is blackened then the others will run away automatically.
But it is heartening to see a tourist circuit with the same coal.
This is just a beginning, so far, more than ten thousand people have enjoyed the coconut mine tourism that is suitable for the ecosystem near Sawaner village near Nagpur.
It offers an opportunity to see something innovative.
Can you contribute towards cleanliness while visiting other places during this holiday
This may not have been done very scientifically, but what is happening is true.
Can you also act as a tourist with a strong collaboration for cleanliness at the tourist centre
In comparison to the world, tourism in India is far behind.
But if 125 crore people decide to strengthen our tourism sector with a determination then we can attract the world.
Come, let us strive in this direction.
My young friends, I don't like the fact that some holidays have come and gone.
And you also consider this thing.
Would your vacations lead to the immense years of your life and their immense moments
I'll put forth an idea for your thoughts.
Can you develop a skill during your holidays and add a new thing to your personality
If you don't know swimming then you can decide whether I will learn swimming during vacation or not if you don't know how to drive a bike.
Even today, if I try to typically typically with two fingers, can I do the training of signatures
How many capabilities are there to nurture our personality
Why can't we learn them
Why shouldn't we remove our grievances
Why shouldn't we develop our energy
Just imagine, there is no need for greater training, no trainee is required, no higher fee is required, no big expense is required.
Similarly, we will have to talk to other friends.
I am sure you will do this and tell me what you have learnt newly.
My name is Abi Chaturvedi.
Good afternoon, Prime Minister, during the last summer vacation you had said that the birds should warm the summer so we should keep them in a pot on the balcony or on the rooftops of the house so that they can get water.
I was very happy when I did this work, through which I became friends with many birds.
This time again I urge you to express it in your Mann Ki Baat.
He has telephoned me and reminded me of a good thing.
I was asking you to fill the soil vessels outside your house in the summer season.
Abhi told me that he is doing this work throughout the year, so that many birds like him.
Mahadevi Varma, one of the world's greatest poets in Hindi literature, had a great deal to do with the birds.
He said in his poems, I will not allow you to go away, I will fill you with grains, I will fill everywhere with cold water.
Shilpa Cooke from Mysore put forward a very sophisticated idea.
Have we ever provided them with drinking water
Thank you, Shilpa, my heartfelt gratitude, you have put forward the most emotional idea in a very natural manner.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard a lot about Digital India.
Some people can talk about this Digital India as a matter of some urban youth.
If you use the App for the convenience of these farmers on your mobile phones then you will get all the information related to agriculture and weather in your hand.
What is the situation in the markets, what is the position in the markets, what is the trend of good harvest, how many information can be obtained from it about the types of insecticides.
And if you ask any questions of them, they answer or understand you.
I want my farmer brothers and sisters to upload the App for the benefit of these farmers on their mobile phones.
We have made an effort to create wealth for water conservation through Manrega.
The villages that have created such awareness in the country may be strong, the forerunner farmers may be many, the citizens of many awareness.
I welcome this.
In 2014, there were about 612 crore diabetes patients in India.
According to statistics, 3 percent of deaths occur due to diabetes.
Diabetes is of two types, one type and the other type 2.
Type 1 is genetically genetic, because of hereditary and parents, the child is also born.
Type 2 is due to habits, because of age and physical fat.
Since diabetes is causing concern all over the world, it is the theme of World Health Day on 7th.
Our lifestyle is a big reason for this.
Physical labour is declining.
Can we leapfrog to diabetes in our lives by 7th April
If every citizen of my country is healthy then India will be healthy.
Sometimes we do not get a medical check up done due to difficulty.
It is only after the situation has worsened that there has been a diabetes disease for a long time.
The number of tuberculosis patients in other countries is low in our country.
This disease can be ended by proper treatment.
India must be freed from the grip of these diseases.
But without your cooperation, it cannot be eliminated by governments, doctors and medicines alone.
Therefore, I urge the people of the country to fight against diabetes and eradicate TB.
My dear countrymen, several important events will be held in April, particularly on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated across the country throughout the year.
I have had the privilege of visiting Mhow, the birth place of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April this year.
Baba Saheb has given us all that is required to become a better citizen.
We will be able to pay a special tribute to him by travelling on the way he has shown and living as a good citizen.
Vikram will start the year in a few days.
The New Year is being celebrated in different states in different forms.
My New Year greetings to all
Last time I had told you that you can hear the voice of my mind whenever you want, you are aware of it and you can hear it in about 20 languages.
You can ask it at a comfortable time.
You can hear it on your mobile phone.
I am also happy to be with you.
My dear countrymen, my warm greetings to all of you.
I extend my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Easter.
My young friends, all of you will be on the one hand and you will be on the other.
There is a wonderful inspiration.
Perhaps you are aware that India is going to host the FIFA Under-17 World Cup next year in 2017.
If I say this thing then it is to insist that the interest in footprint increases, but when such a huge opportunity reaches the gates of India, will we be guiltless and fulfil our duties
Last time also I had requested you people that wherever you are going, you should portray the photograph of that place.
The work that was not done by the tourism department, the work that was not done by our cultural department, the work that was not done by the state governments and the Indian government, has been done by millions and millions of people of the country.
When they look at the photographs they have done, they really enjoy.
We have to take this task forward and do the same thing in the same way, but this time we have to do something else.
You not only send a photo but also showcase your creativity and you can find out a lot of things when you go to new places.
India is a country of diversity.
Once you start traveling to see it, you will be traveling throughout your life, you will be enjoying yourself.
We would generally think that coal should remain away from mines.
When we look at the pictures of the people there, we can imagine what will happen there
I am confident that my young friends will definitely help me in this work.
Whether it is the government, the organisations, the society, the citizens, all of us will join hands in this work.
Your personality will be recognised and your self-confidence will increase to a large extent.
They come to our homes to sell milk, to sell news papers, to get a postman, sometimes a client or a brave seller passes through.
Have we ever asked if we want water to quench their thirst when the summer is hot
Only then can one drop of rain water be used as waste.
The beginning of farming for farmers is a very important one.
But if there is no water then we should also think about what happens to the people of the country.
This time you might have noticed that 5 lakh lakes are making efforts to construct irrigation ponds.
At my young age, I still remember people getting scared as soon as I heard the name of DB.
In order to get rid of TB, proper treatment is essential and complete treatment is important.
If you leave half the treatment in the middle, the disease will come back.
You give me a missed foot, whenever you get time, you can listen to the old Mann Ki Baat programmes and ask them in your language.
My dear countrymen, my greetings to you all.
In a way, this is my Mann Ki Baat programme in 2015.
The next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be held in 2016.
In a way, we can say that every festival leaves the expectation of the next festival.
Sometimes, India can also call it a fast-paced economy by festivals.
These are the reasons for the economic activity of the people below the society.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the people of the country on the occasion of Christmas and wish them the very best for the year 2016.
May the year 2016 bring immense joy and happiness to all of you, may it bring new zeal, new spirit and new determination to take you all to new heights.
Whether it is terrorism, global warming, natural calamities or the embarrassment caused by mankind.
What could be a greater joy than this for humanity to live a peaceful life by eliminating them from all these things
Chawley Chawarkar ji, this season is a tourist season, a large number of domestic and foreign tourists come and people go to many places for Christmas celebrations
The way our tourist destinations are clean, the more we feel about India and the more we feel about it, I welcome Ganesh ji's ideas.
I am bringing the ideas of Ganesh ji among the people.
If we are visiting our homes as guests in the tradition of seeing guests as gods then we are immediately engaging in cleaning and cleaning our houses.
Similarly, we have to keep the tourist destinations, centres and tourist destinations in our country clean and clean.
I am glad that there are reports from all over the country about cleanliness.
From the very beginning, I have been conveying my appreciations to media friends on this subject.
Because they dug small and good things and take them to the public eye.
Considering that this work was extremely sacred, I want to share with you the message that he has constructed 100 toilets in the village of Bhojpur only because of his hard work.
The country is making rapid strides due to the relentless efforts of many.
125 crore people of the country are walking on the path of progress shoulder to shoulder and are moving ahead with the country.
Excellent education, improved skills and increasing employment opportunities
Life Insurance schemes for citizens, banking facilities, uninterrupted global trading and setting up of new entrepreneurship facilities are on one side.
All those who cannot go near the banks are now able to get loans easily through the MUDRA scheme.
Indians have started to understand that the entire world has started taking part in the art of Yoga.
When the entire world celebrated the International Day of Yoga, all of us had the feeling of how proud our country was.
This feeling is possible only when our thoughts and thoughts are enormous.
And it came to pass, when his mother opened the mouth of the testimony, that the glory of butter was open, who could forget what she saw there, and what she saw there
Similarly, Yoga Day has given us the Indians the importance of India.
Nowadays, talk about cleanliness is echoing in every household.
Be it a farmer, a poor, a young man or a mother, the feeling that you have been the cause of a change in the lives of those people that will bring about a massive satisfaction for the government officials engaged in bringing electricity to those villages. This is also a very positive thing.
Can't I do everything alone
But when I talk about it, should I not contribute to it
Even a simple citizen can fly an app Narendra Modi on his mobile phone and join me.
I am sharing simple things in this regard.
It is a matter of happiness for me that people also share a lot of things with me.
Come, let us collectively engage in matters related to the interests of the common man, let us take it to the common man, let us motivate them to get their dues.
My dear young friends, on the 15th of August, I had presented a basic idea of Start Up India and Stand Up India from the Red Fort.
After that, the idea of this thing has been intensified in all the departments of the government.
Can India become the start-up capital
Start-up India, Stand-up India, has brought a huge opportunity for the younger community.
My dear young friends, on January 16, the Government of India is launching the Start up India Stand up India initiative at full swing.
We have a stable idea of start-ups that the digital world is the only people in the IT sector.
We have to make changes in this regard keeping in mind the needs of India.
The intellectual skills of our younger generation are spread all over the country.
This start-up india and stand-up india should not be left in some cities, it should spread to India's corner untouched.
Therefore, I appeal to all the State Governments to take this project forward.
On January 16, I will definitely have a detailed exchange with you.
I am eagerly looking forward to your views.
My dear young friends, January 12 is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
There are millions and millions of people in this country like me.
From 1995 to January 12, we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda on National Youth Day.
The celebrations are scheduled to take place in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from January 12 to January 16 this year.
I would particularly urge my young friends to send your comments directly to me through my Narendra Modi App.
I want to know and understand what is in your mind.
Dilip Chouhan from Ahmedabad in Gujarat is a disabled person who observed the Accessible India Day in his school.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
Sometimes when we meet human beings like him in our lives, there will be monopoly in our minds.
The perspective of human beings like this will be revealed on the basis of our thoughts.
There is no doubt that I have a significance in words.
This year, when the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Yojana, arrangements were made to participate in it.
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in Chennai, I had to go there due to the severe floods and I could not participate in this programme.
Though I could not participate in this programme, the thoughts about it were emerging in my mind.
Innovations are needed to simplify schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, accessibility parks, lips and vernacular writings, technology requirements, systems and understanding.
They should not die on the files.
Wasn't the schemes either created for the common man or the poor
Efforts were made to simplify the beneficiaries of the scheme a few days ago.
The subsidy for gas cylinders is being given in our country.
For this, crores of rupees are being spent but no account has been filed for this.
The government has made a small change in the supply of subsidy to know whether or not the subsidy reaches the genuine beneficiaries or not.
By the end of November, about 15 crore people are beneficiaries of Pahal Gas Yojana.
Direct subsidies to the bank accounts of these 15 crore beneficiaries are increasing.
This is happening without intermediaries, recommendations and the possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, the Aadhar Identity Card movement, on the other hand, Jan Dhan bank account opening and on the other hand, the Central Governments have been working together to prepare the list of beneficiaries and link it with Aadhaar Identity Card and Bank Account.
There were monopoly allegations regarding the scheme.
In many places, money is being put directly into the bank accounts of the labourers.
So far, about Rs. 40,000 crore has been directly deposited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries in connection with about 35-40 schemes.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a golden moment for the Republic of India.
This day marks the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
We have to take this forward.
During the elections, more advertisements will emerge as the pious duty of voting, writing on walls and laying of plates.
We will talk a lot about our duties during the elections but why not talk about the same duties in daily life
When we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar this year, cannot we organise an essay competition, poetry competition and dialogue competition in schools, colleges, in our villages and towns, in different societies and associations for the 26th of January
When the 125 crore people of the country cross each other with a sense of duty, then imagine what a great history will be created.
On 26th January, when we are celebrating the Republic Day, cannot we properly clean and decorate the silver statues of the leaders of our city and the surrounding areas through our citizens, through our school and college students
I would like to put forward this idea as a citizen.
We are dedicated to maintaining the statues of those leaders whom we are very passionately engaging in laying down their idols.
Can we continue to clean up as a society and as a nation
On January 26 this year, we will join hands in this effort.
My dear countrymen, once again my New Year greetings for 2016.
Thank you very much.
On the other hand, the start of the Christmas festival is going on.
There is a separate place for festivals in social life.
Sometimes festivals are also useful for wounding and sometimes they give new incentives.
But sometimes during the days of festivals there are difficulties, they are extremely painful.
From every corner of the world, there are constant reports of natural disasters.
Until now, there have been unquestionable reports of disasters.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of climate change is spreading.
State governments are engaged in rescue and disaster relief operations in full swing.
The central government has always worked shoulder to shoulder.
I am confident that even after all these difficulties, Tamil Nadu will once again be on the path of rapid progress and will contribute to the progress of the country.
But when we face such a dilemma on all sides, there is a feeling of a change.
Until about 15 years ago, the natural calamity was associated with the agriculture sector because at that time the natural calamity was only due to drought and famine.
Governments, civil society, citizens, small and large organizations have to work in the field of scientific development.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I had to interact with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
I suggested that a joint activity should be undertaken to collaborate with all the South Asian countries to combat disasters.
I am happy to note that a thematic workshop in this regard and a seminar on best practices to combat disasters has been held in New Delhi.
This is a good beginning.
I will be speaking to Lukwinder Singh from the Jalandhar in Punjab.
We are engaged in organic farming here and are also guiding many more in agriculture.
One of the reasons for this is that you are doing organic farming
It gives you even greater happiness that you are not only able to do this but also understanding the problems of the farmers.
Your concerns are justified, but this is not happening in the states of Punjab and Haryana alone.
This is our usual practice throughout India and traditionally we are burning the agricultural waste after the crops.
Earlier, we were unaware of the evils caused by such burning, everyone used to do it, so I do it too.
Because of these things, it continued and it continued to grow and today it is associated with climate change.
After the impact of this embarrassment began to reach the cities, the voices of the people started shouting.
That's the real concern you've expressed.
In the first phase, our agricultural friends should be trained and they should explain the truth.
In such a scenario, burning of post-harvest agricultural wastes can save time, reduce the difficulty and make the land ready for the next time.
But this is not the right regulation.
The post-harvest waste is also very valuable.
They are naturally fertile.
We're wasting them.
Not only this, if we make them small pieces then they can become guests for animals.
Secondly, because we burn them, the layer on the ground is blown away.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, just think for a moment, our bones are firm, our hearts work well, our kidneys work properly, everything is fine, but if the skin on the body is burnt then can we survive
If the skin of our body is burnt to pieces then we cannot survive, similarly if we burn the post-harvest bottom and the remains of the agricultural produce, the skin of the mother Earth burns and the layer on our soil burns
Therefore, we have to take positive steps in this direction.
I got the opportunity to interact with the farmers engaged in banana cultivation.
They shared their wonderful experiences with me.
Earlier, after harvesting the livelihood, they had to spend 500000-15000 rupees per hectare to evacuate the livelihood.
None of the work was going on until the tractors had to take them off.
Last time, in Mann Ki Baat, I had talked about organ donation.
In this regard, I mentioned the NOTO free phone number.
Film actress Raveena Dunton and many others added themselves to the film.
Organ donation can save many lives.
What could be a bigger donation than this
The National Level Organ Transplant Registration Centre (NLOR) was launched on November 27, 2019, with details of patients awaiting organs and donors.
I am confident that awareness will spread in this sector and I hope that those who need it will get help in time.
This is because there is no one to donate, this help is not available in any way.
I had earlier said that on December 3, we will be celebrating Divyangjan Disabilities Day.
Physically challenged persons have unparalleled courage and disabilities.
Sometimes when they are portrayed as funny things, the mind becomes painful.
Sometimes compassion and compassion are expressed on them.
But if we change our perspective, if we correct their vision then they will become a motivation for us as well, they will become an inspiration for us to understand achievements.
Their determination, their devotion to life, their ability to transform embarrassment into favourable means, their thirst and commendation.
Today I would like to talk about the 40-42 year old Javed Ahmed ji.
In 1996, extremists shot at Jawad Ahmad in Kachmir.
But Javed Ahmed did not accept the defeat.
The wounds of extremism did not make him coward.
There was no part of his motivation, a person who was not guilty of any crime had been punished and his youth was wasted, but there was no anger or guilt in his mind.
Although he did not cooperate, he dedicated himself to the education of children in the last 20 years.
As a social worker, as a conscious citizen, he is making a peaceful revolution today as the sovereign messenger of the disabled.
Isn't it sufficient that Javed ji's life becomes a motivation for all Indians
I would like to especially commemorate the life of Javed ji, his vision and dedication on the 3rd of December.
Though I have been able to talk only about Javed ji today due to lack of time, even then the hypnotising lamps in every corner of India are shining, they are encouraging to live and the way is shivering.
Thus, on 3rd December, we have to draw inspiration from them.
In many matters, we have to depend on governments.
The central elite, the lower middle class, the lower class, the lower class, the downtrodden, the persecuted, the deprived and the oppressed, all of them are constantly associated with the government and the government-related organisations.
As an ordinary citizen, they have somehow had a bad experience with government employees.
These couples spend their wealth on the development of the poor in their retirement life.
The entire tribal population of the smallest village of Balasore district of Odisha is from the tribal community.
It is a poverty-stricken village that is suffering from malaria.
Jamuna Mani Singh, an ASHA worker from this village, decided that I will ensure that no one from this Denthaka dies due to malaria.
He stepped up the struggle against Malaria and prepared the entire village to face it.
There may be so many junior hours in the country.
You not only study but also make recommendations for others.
Creative energy is the greatest power.
You should also share good events related to this, share these E-books and make a combination of this.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is deeply concerned about climate change.
14th December is National Energy Conservation Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
The LED pulp mission is progressing on the trajectory.
Once I had said that on the night of Poornima I should shovel the street lights and wet them for an hour.
I got the opportunity to see a friend who had sent a link in my sight.
I felt like sharing it with you.
He is trying to provide light to the poor by using solar energy, he is fighting with darkness, he is acting in accordance with his name and he has created a group of women.
Launched a solar powered lighting workshop.
He is offering these lunar lights at a cost of 100 rupees per month.
In the evening, people take these lights and go to them in the morning and give them a light.
I am told that as soon as I heard, nearly 500 households are giving this kind of e-mails to the beneficiaries.
During the day, Nurjahan is performing the task of e-Governance for these lunars.
But a good beginning has been made.
66 lakh people have received Rs. 42,000 crore under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana in a very short span of time.
I am happy that out of 66 lakh beneficiaries, 24 lakh are women.
I had earlier said that Swachh Bharat would create such entrepreneurs.
They have acknowledged this at Silesh Phonesle.
I am aware that he is doing this by buying a tanker and has repaid a loan of Rs. 2 lakh to the bank in a short span of time.
This is our objective of the Mudra Yojana.
Similar mention was made in the case of Mamta Sharma from Bhopal city.
He also received 40,000 rupees from the bank under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
He is engaged in the manufacture of cups.
Because there is no need to pay more interest, it saves about 1000 rupees per month.
There was a good business for his family.
But I want to make this scheme more popular and expand.
All our banks should reach it with greater understanding and come forward to help small businesses in a big way.
In fact, they are acting as the economic drivers of the country.
These are the economic forces of the country.
This is what we want to inspire.
Good thing has happened, but it's going to be even more, better.
This means that the pricing of liberty is the price that we are paying for freedom.
The spirit of unity of the country should continue to shine.
But I expect more suggestions.
I am confident that your suggestions will certainly be beneficial.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter is about to start.
Once again my best wishes to the people of my country Jai Hind
Once again I have got the opportunity to interact with you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the fifth day cricket match between India and South Africa is being played in Mumbai.
Gandhi Mandela series is known for this 5-day cricket competition.
Hence, interest in final competition has increased.
My best wishes to all sportspersons.
Today, I congratulate all the friends of All India Radio.
Therefore, I convey my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to all the friends of the Kannur Radio Station.
Once again I would like to mention Kerala.
Clean Mary Upper Primary Schoolgirls from Sithur, Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter was special in many respects.
One, these girls had registered their thumb mile and dressed Bharat Mata in a very large cloth.
They have sent me the map of Bharat Mata.
First of all, I wondered why they have drawn this film with their thumb mile records.
But after reading the letter they wrote, I came to know how many indicators they had sent to me.
They are engaging themselves in the movement of awareness about organ donation.
Vasant Rao Chuduke Guruji, about 80 years old from Maharashtra, has been running a movement for a long time.
He wants to celebrate organ donation as a festival.
Nowadays, I have received a lot of news and phone calls.
Devesh ji from Delhi has also sent me such a message.
From Delhi, I would like to say Debesh - the government's efforts towards organ donation and the policy initiatives related to it make me very happy.
Countries like China are at the forefront of physical organ donation and I feel that the goal of the government to donate one million organs is commendable.
More than 12 lakh kidneys, heart and liver donations are required every year in the country.
But in a country of 125 crore people, we are able to implement only 5000 organ transplants.
It is necessary to give light to one lakh eyes every year.
But we can only give a glimpse of 25,000 people.
If there is a need of eye for 4 people, we can give it to only one person.
Efforts are being made to provide guidance to the State Governments in this regard.
Some states have made good progress in simplifying the administrative procedures in this regard.
I say that Tamil Nadu ranks first in organ donation.
A 24-hour helpline 1800 114770 is also served.
Even our ancestors are shouting at Honey Dyaktena Punjeetha
That is, the joy of making sacrifices is what they have said through the words of Honey Dhyaktena Punjjita.
During the last few days, the GST rates have been increased from Rs.
This operation was successful, saved a life.
A few days later, we are also celebrating Deepawali.
We also celebrated Eid and Ganesh Chaturthi festivals.
The India Africa Summit is scheduled to be held in New Delhi from 26th to 29th October, 2019.
This is the first time that such a big conference will be held on Indian soil.
Heads of 54 African countries and Unions were invited to participate in the conference.
The population of both our countries is one third of the world's population.
Millions of years ago, India and Africa were the only terrain, and later they were two parts of the Indian Ocean.
We have a lot of solidarity.
There are many similarities between the wildlife of India and the wildlife of Africa.
There is a lot of similarity in natural resources.
About 27 lakh Indians have been living in Africa for many years.
India and Africa have linkages in economics, culture and politics.
But above all, India has played a major role in training the younger generation of African countries.
More than 25,000 African students are educated in India in Human Resource Development and Capacity Building.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, is organising a very important event.
Competitions are being organised in schools connected to CBSE among all students in poetry and enhancing their contribution.
Thousands of schoolchildren have written about Indian African connections.
Several lakhs of school students visited the exhibition, the people of the village saw that what was the contribution of Ananth Gandhiji in the relationship between Africa and India, people knew and understood how his impact was on the minds of the people of these two regions.
There were many outstanding contributions in this competition.
A poetry is a robbery of my heart, it is my favorite, so I would like to teach it to you.
I congratulate Katra and all the students who have participated in this competition, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
On August 15, 2014, I had mentioned about the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, the Model Village Programme of Parliament.
Thereafter, several members of the family have completed the work.
They are fully engaged in this.
A thematic workshop was organised in Bhopal last month.
In this context, the leaders of the villages, district governments, some parliamentarians and officials from the Central and State Governments, along with leaders from the villages undertaken by this Model Village Programme, had intensive consultations on the Model Village Scheme.
A lot of new ideas have emerged and they have been inspiring.
I would like to bring some things to your notice.
Jharkhand is one of the most tribal areas.
Unfortunately, it will be remembered when we talk about Jharkhand by the extremists of Mao, Bomb culture and massacres.
Many areas have been destroyed by the impact of these left-wing extremists.
However, our senior parliamentarian Kariya Munda, who has been a Deputy Speaker of the Parliament, has dedicated his life to the tribal people.
He started going there, he lit confidence in the minds of the people, tried to give life to the government systems, he encouraged the officers to come and work there.
He established the country to bring about development in the long-running neglected area.
Besides infrastructure in the Model Village Programme, a successful effort to create awareness among the masses has been made in this Parsi village of Jharkhand.
I convey my best wishes to the distinguished parliamentarian Kariya Munda.
Other arrangements are going on and he has created a great innovation in this regard.
He handed over a job to students studying in schools there.
He called upon the upper classes of school students to keep their parents in this class.
The school was thus educating students in the morning and their parents in the evenings.
Similar children taught about 550 uneducated senior citizens.
Look, how a big change has been brought about in the society without any budget, without circularity, without any special facilities, just through a psychological commitment.
This is the lesson given to us by the Dwarapuri Gram Panchayat.
This village is known for its sugarcane production and sugarcane festival.
Ruwala ji inaugurated the Sugarcane Festival in this village on March 11.
He has drawn our attention to the right thing.
My dear countrymen, I would like to remind you that last year after the festival of Deepawali, a movement was organised in our country, especially in the media.
The way we try to clean up the festivals before the festivals, similarly, even after the festivals, your idea of continuing it is correct.
This kind of work should be done during every public event.
I congratulate all the media in India today.
On 2nd October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and the completion of one year of Swachh Bharat Mission, the India Today Group had the opportunity to participate in the programme Safai Giri.
During the last one year, he has been encouraging Swachhta related work through e-TV, and his newspapers have news about it, and he is focusing only on creative work.
He has connected about 55 to 56,000 schools in Andhra and Telugu to Swachh Bharat Mission.
Whether it is public places, railway stations, worship places, hospitals, parks or in many places, cleanliness drives are being carried out.
These reports are also strengthening the formation of a Swachh Bharat.
ABP News Channel, India My Country has launched an event.
The people of the country had sown the idea of cleanliness in the minds of the people in the wake of the cleanliness awareness among the people.
NDTV organised a mission to create a Swachh Bharat.
There are several channels, several newspapers in our country and because of the lack of time, I could not mention the names of all but everyone took this movement.
Over the last several years, this village has been working with a pivot of cleanliness and every generation has been actively taking up the issue of cleanliness.
A few years ago, the Governor wrote that this village has been awarded the cleanest village in Asia.
I am glad that a village in Meghalaya, a remote north-eastern region of our country, has been engaged in cleanliness for years.
It has become a village culture.
Such events give us confidence that our country is sure to be clean.
My dear countrymen, when I was speaking from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August, I had said that corruption had become cheaper in the country.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
In the last budget, we made an important announcement.
As per this, you will be able to get interest on depositing your gold in the bank as well as on how you will get interest on your investment.
Now the gold will be in the bank but the money will be given to you through the bank interest.
Now tell me, my countrymen, whether gold is worth the money or not
Wouldn't the gold that is locked in uselessly turn into a life-force
Don't keep the gold in the house waste.
Don't miss the benefits of its safety and routine.
Therefore, we will not have to buy gold, we will not have to protect gold and no one will ever strip the paper.
I will surely dedicate this project to the people of the country in the next week.
However, we have either used foreign gold coins or used foreign gold bonds.
Why shouldn't there be an indigenous index for our country
Therefore, in the coming week, the Indian gold coin, which has been eroded by the Ashoka Chakra of 5 grams and 10 grams, will be released before the Dentres Holy Day.
Besides, 20 grams of gold will also be provided to the people.
I am sure that this new scheme will bring about a new transformation in the path of economic development, in which I am confident that your entire cooperation will be there.
My dear countrymen, 31st October marks the birth anniversary of the Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
When Patel thought about them as the theme of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, the entire India would be inspired by them.
This great man has contributed immensely to India's unity.
Not only these diversities, but the beauty that has given us pride will not reach us.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the last several years, the Unity Run has taken place on 31st October.
I have got the opportunity to take part in it earlier.
I have been told that this time too, arrangements are being made in different parts of the country and people are making preparations for unity with enthusiasm.
The drive to unity is actually the drive towards development.
In other words, the guarantee for development is the drive of unity.
Come, let us pay our homage to Sardar.
We will carry forward the mantra of unity.
My dear brothers and sisters, you all are preparing for the festival of Deepawali.
I specially urge the parents to enjoy the festival of Deepawali, but I would like to particularly urge them to take care of our children even if they are not affected by it.
My dear countrymen, the next day on Diwali, I will go to Britain.
This time my visit to Britain is very interesting.
There is a special reason for this.
I am sure that this memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become a place of pilgrimage and a place of zeal when our children go to Britain to study.
As much as possible, as much as possible, and for the rest of the country, this was the message that Baba Saheb Ambedkar had given to him, he did not live.
Several years ago, the work done by Lord Basaveswar for democracy and empowerment of women is a matter of pride for everyone.
The dedication of Lord Basaveshwars shrine to the people of the world in London is an excellent example of the ideals and vision of Indias great personalities centuries ago.
When such an event comes together, the hearts of all the people of the country are filled with the holy shrine.
in. Your suggestions are coming to me.
Later, with your letters, programmes are being prepared on All India Radio, discussions are being conducted by inviting government officials, and efforts are being made to find solutions when some people write about their problems.
In a country like India, we need to learn many languages.
It is true that even though I have learnt a few languages, I cannot learn so many languages.
I will surely try to enter your minds in your language at 8pm.
See how beautiful our relationship has grown.
The last one year was over.
Today we are stepping up in a new year.
Once again my best wishes to the people of our country.
My dear countrymen, my greetings to you all. This is the 12th edition of Mann Ki Baat.
There is great significance of people's power in democracy.
There is a feeling of fundamentalism in my life, which is why I have great faith in this peoples power.
But Mann Ki Baat has taught a lot of things, it has experienced them and it has shown us how immense the power of the people is.
Our ancestors have made it clear that peoples power is the power of Mahesh.
I can say that keeping in mind my experiences in Mann Ki Baat, in the minds of our ancestors, there is great power and great truth.
In this regard, I congratulate All India Radio for not just seeing these suggestions in paper but also looking at them as the expectations of the masses.
As far as management is concerned, information must be from the bottom to the bottom and guidance should be from top to bottom.
Who would have thought that Mann's voice would become the source of information
But that's what happened.
I had said on 2nd October, we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
There was a time when there used to be doors for the country but today it is not necessary that there should be doors for the fashion.
No more, I said buy something a bit.
I am glad that in the last one year, the sale of garlands has been about two.
It is difficult to discontinue the subsidies for the goods of the society, for the middle class and the lower middle class.
Nevertheless they smote it.
Isn't this a peace revolution
Isn't this the expression of people's power
Beyond the power circles of the State Departments, the governments must also learn the lesson that is capable, efficient and stable.
Whatever I had faith in, after Mann Ki Baat programme, all these things have become my firmness.
Therefore, today, through Mann Ki Baat, once again I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the peoples power.
People considered the small things that I had said as one thing and made them their own for the welfare of the country.
What could be more enjoyable than this
This time, in Mann Ki Baat, I wanted to adopt a new approach.
I had appealed to the people of the country to contact you through phone and register your questions and your suggestions.
Discussions from all parts of India are gathering so that there is no incoming calls.
It's a pleasant experience.
All the elderly have given suggestions.
It was easier to hear some suggestions, and my team is focusing on the rest.
You might have spoken for a couple of minutes, but for me, your suggestions and messages are very important.
The government will pay full attention to your suggestions.
It generally appears that negative thoughts are full of negative thoughts on all sides.
But my experience is different.
Moreover, calls from disabled persons, particularly those with visually impaired persons, came in large numbers.
They can't watch television and ask for radio is one of the main reasons.
Bhawan Acharya Ji from Alwar region of Rajasthan is sharing a message with me.
I want the people of the country to listen to the advice of Bhawan Acharya Ji and follow it.
My name is Bhawan Acharya and I belong to Alwar in Rajasthan.
On the occasion of Deepawali, I urge the people of the country to make use of a lot of earthen lamps, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji in his Mann Ki Baat.
Moreover, he has been asking for employment for the poor who dont have to face the problem of environmental pollution due to the use of soil effluents.
I appeal to the people of the country that if we listen to the advice of Bhawan Acharya Ji during the upcoming festivals then soil lights will be switched to our homes but its light will be switched to the poor families.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the three forces during the Ganesh Chaturthi.
After 50 years of the war with Pakistan in 1965, an exhibition titled Anjali for Gallantry near India Gate in Delhi has been organised.
We have been questioning about the glorious moments of the war, the brave courage and sacrifices made by our soldiers and there are no photographs or images of that period.
If you want to create history then you should understand the nuances of history very well.
History connects us with our roots.
Cleanliness should be in our nature and we should also provide the means for it.
I didn't misunderstand this.
I have seen this thing in a good way that even the Parliament of the country is engaged in cleanliness.
Look, on the other hand, on the one hand Parliament and on the other hand the children of the country are talking about cleanliness. What can be a matter of pride for the country
A movement of ideas is going on, an environment is being created against pollution, an awareness has been created about cleanliness.
Do you know what Gandhiji said
Once he had said that if I want to choose between freedom and cleanliness then I would first like cleanliness, then he said that the country's independence was there.
Cleanliness was more important than freedom for Gandhiji.
Kulshan Arora from Delhi has also filed a report on MyGov website.
Deendayal Upadhyay ji wanted to know about his centenary.
Even last year, I had told you that the clothes of different types of fashions and clothes might be of different kinds but I had to keep them with someone for the dresses.
I urge you to give it something.
Last time you almost doubled the sales.
How many poor people have benefited from this
You have completed the work that the government has not been able to spend several crores of rupees with a little help.
This is the peoples power itself, so I once again appeal to you all in this regard.
My dear countrymen, my heart is filled with joy for something else.
I would like to share this with you.
I went to Golgatha in May and the family members of Subhas Bose had come to meet me.
His brother's son Chandra Bose organised the meeting.
Chandra Bose and his family were involved in this work, and it was only last week that more than fifty families of Subhash Bose had come to the prime minister's house.
Can you imagine how it is a matter of great happiness for me
Many of Subhas Babu's family live in other countries.
Everyone comes here for this reason. Do you know how enjoyable this is for me
I look forward to welcoming them.
We have to make it a habit.
I want the youth of the country to make efforts to connect themselves with the electoral rolls and participate in the voting.
During the elections, I am certainly saying one thing - first voting, then everything else.
Everyone should do this sacred work.
I met a child studying class VIII Kshitij Pandey.
Banaras is studying 7th standard at the Hindu University's Kendriya Vidyalaya.
Likewise, there was a chance to meet a girl named Sonam Patel.
This 9-year-old girl from Sundarpur, Varanasi, is the daughter of Sadavaruj Patel.
She is a woman from a very poor family.
The whole singing to this girl is a topic, but the greatest thing is, when she asked about a slogan of the Gita, she delivered it and gave her English explanation and Hindi.
When I asked her father about this, she said she was telling this from her 5th year.
He added that this is a wonder for all of us in the family.
This had a big impact on me in your own right.
Some children have a sympathy for popularity, but children Sonamuk have no such involvement.
I only felt that God had given her some special power.
I met these two children during my visit to Kashi.
I wanted to share this with you.
Once a month you have to make the voice of Mann Ki Baat once a week because we get more zeal from it.
You see, you don't know what you want from me to get a job
Now it is perfect for a month.
Mann Ki Baat has been completed one year.
Do you know how Subhas Babu used the sound
He started his broadcast in Germany and spread his ideas on the subject of freedom for the people living in India through radio.
Azad made the beginning of the Hindi radio through a weekly news report.
He broadcast radio in English, Hindi, Bangali, Marathi, Punjab, Urdu and Pashtu.
Even me, a year has passed since my radio broadcast through Mann Ki Baat.
Your contribution is worthless to me.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, my greetings to you all.
Once again I have got a good opportunity to inform you about the voice of my mind.
People are celebrating the festival of Onam in the southern part of the country and yesterday the festival of Raksha Bandhan was celebrated across the country.
Government of India has implemented several new schemes for social security keeping in mind the welfare of the people.
It gives me great pleasure to note that in a very short span of time, all of you have joined these schemes in a broader way.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan yesterday, I had made a small appeal to our sisters to bring the benefits of these security schemes.
I have been told that within a short span of time, about 11 crore families have been connected with this scheme.
I am glad that half of the beneficiaries are mothers and sisters.
I consider it a good sign.
I convey my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
About a year ago, we started implementing Jan Dhan Yojana in a big way.
Several questions and doubts were raised whether a scheme that could not be completed in 60 years could be implemented in such a short span of time.
However, it is a matter of great pleasure that all the sectors related to the implementation of this scheme, all the branches of the banks, all the branches of the banks have been engaged in this thing with full force and mind and we have succeeded in this thing, on the basis of the information given to me so far, about 17.
They have saved 22,000 crore rupees even though they were said to have started the buzzing account.
The banking sector is also one of the key drivers of the economy, which has reached the homes of the poor.
Today, 1.
25 lakh bank comrades are working on the field.
This has provided employment to the youth.
Now thousands of people have become empowered and taken overdraft due to this scheme.
There is hope that the poor will get bank loans.
Once again, I convey my best wishes and congratulations to all those associated with it and I appeal to all the poor people not to break your bonds with the banks at any time.
The banks are yours, and you don't get out of it in any way.
We have brought the banks to the doorsteps of your houses, do not leave it alone, hold firmly.
There should be cash flow in the bank accounts of all of us.
I am immensely confident that you will do this.
Just a few days ago, the incidents in Gujarat, the violence and the violence caused the entire nation to lose peace, this is a natural feeling.
This kind of incident has happened on the land of birth of Gandhi and Sardar. It hurts and hurts all the people of the country.
Peace, integrity and brotherhood - this path is right
On the path of progress, we all should walk shoulder to shoulder.
Progress can only be solved for all our problems.
India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru has visited Buddha Gaya.
I am proud that Buddhist clerics from all over the world are participating in this event.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I would like to share my Mann Ki Baat with you.
I am ready to accept any suggestion regarding the welfare of the farmers. I have come here several times.
My farmer brothers and sisters, my dear farmers, do not be drunk, do not be afraid.
I assure you that we will not take any action so that no one can lead you on the wrong path in order to make you smooth, to make you afraid.
For us, every citizen of the country has a value but there is a special significance in the thoughts and voices of the farmers.
We brought an emergency legislation.
The Ordinance will expire on 31st August, 2019.
This will ensure that farmers do not face economic losses.
For us, I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that the words Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan are not mere words but a mantra.
We are in our hearts for the welfare of the poor farmers living in the villages.
Therefore, in my Independence Day address, I had said that the Ministry should not only work in the field of agriculture but also in the field of agriculture and farmers welfare.
We have been taking this resolution forward at a rapid pace.
I'd like to talk about another thing.
Two days ago, the war ended in 1965 and completed 50 years.
Whenever we talk about the war in 1965, it is natural to recall Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
Similarly, the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan will also remind us.
Our scientists are really making excellent progress.
Several new information has been given to me.
This is inspiring and educating for me.
Many young scientists were very rapid and shared things with me and I dreamt of them.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had said that we should lead our student wealth towards science.
During my Independence Day address, I had also spoken about the need for a direct selection in lower level jobs.
When a direct examination is called, every poor family and widowed mother has to waver in matters related to getting a letter of recommendation, seeking help from whom to get jobs.
This is also one of the reasons for corruption at the grassroots.
I had said that there should not be a direct choice below a certain level.
I am glad that the government has been making rapid strides in this direction, the suggestions are being given, this resolution will almost be passed and the method of direct examination of grass root level posts will be squeezed.
Today, there are international figures coming to India.
In order to reduce the maternal and child mortality rate, 24 countries of the world have organized a conference in India in coordination with implementing the Call to Action Action Plans.
For the first time outside the US, this ideological meeting was held in India.
Every year about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children in our country die after childbirth.
Just as we were released from polio, we have also been released from the tetanus, which is one of the causes of maternal and child deaths.
The world has accepted this.
But even today we have to save our mothers and save our children.
Brothers and sisters, today dengue is spreading.
The fact is that dengue fever is dangerous, but it is very simple to avoid this.
My request for a Swachh Bharat is linked to it.
Even if we watch advertising on television, our focus is not on them.
Even if advertising is provided in newspapers, our minds are not paid.
Cleanliness and safeguarding of clean drinking water are also spreading awareness among the people on small issues at home.
However, we dont care about it, we live in good houses, there are many facilities in it, but sometimes we do not know that water is stagnant around us.
I urge you not to spread the carpet so easily for death.
Life is a very valued one.
Concentration on water conservation and neglect of cleanliness are the calls for death, which are not correct.
About 514 dengue fever centres have been set up across the country and free tests have been conducted here.
Timely testing and treatment is a life-saving option.
Your cooperation is very important in this regard.
From Raksha Bandhan to Deepawali, there will be celebrations and festivals in the coming days in our country.
Why shouldn't we connect all our festivals with cleanliness
Good records will be habitual, willn't they
My dear countrymen, I would like to share a happy news with you people.
Hydendra Mahajan, Dr.
The interests of our tribal people are shining in the minds of Mahendra Mahajan.
These two brothers have made India proud.
This year, these two brothers have succeeded in this festival and have made India proud.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to these two brothers.
But in all these endeavours, they are concentrating on the interests of ethnic groups - Team India, Vision for Tribals.
Everyone is contributing to the country's progress.
When we hear about such events, we feel proud.
Sometimes we commit terrible injustice to our younger generation due to perspective.
There is a concept that the new generation does not know anything, and I believe that this trend has remained for centuries.
But my experience with the younger generation is different.
Sometimes when we talk to the youth, we can learn many things too.
On Sunday on cycle, I have met a number of young people who have decided to ride a bike.
Some people pursue it as a cycle day for a day in a week that I will travel on a bike.
They say that it gives me the joy of my health and well-being of the environment and the joy of the youth.
Nowadays, cycle clubs are operating in many cities of our country and there are many people who are encouraging the cycle journey.
This is a good effort for health and environmental well-being.
Just as the achievements of the two youngsters of India have made the country proud, the perspective of the youth of the country is remarkable.
The monument of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on the Hindu Mills ground in Mumbai has been dragging for ages.
When the Indians around the world go to London, the memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, which will be formed by the Maharashtra government, will be given a concentration.
I express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to the state government of Maharashtra, who are trying to set up these two monuments to make Baba Saheb Ambedkar proud.
My best wishes and thanks to you all.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor need pulses, and there is a need for a small number of pulses to be added to the pulses.
I am very happy to note that in the current round of pulses, there has been an increase of 50 percent and there has been an increase of about 33 percent in oilseeds.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to my farmer brothers on this subject.
My dear countrymen, the 26th of July has been recorded in the history of our country as a victory in the Kargil war.
The Kargil war was not held on the borders, but every village and city of India contributed to it.
On July 26, I consider it a matter of great significance.
Just a few months after the formation of our government in 2014, we launched the MyGov website on 26th July.
I am glad that after nearly a year has passed since the government, nearly 2 crore people have reached MyGov portal and about 5. 12 lakh people have expressed their views on it.
It is also a matter of great pleasure that more than 50,000 people have given their suggestions at the PMO application, they have spent their golden time and they have put their thoughts on it.
They have given very good advice.
However, the people in the government have not been able to pay attention to this thing so far but we have taken the suggestions of brother Akhilesh Vajpayee with the government and we have been implementing it today.
Today, logo, tag lines are being created for any government scheme, projects are being implemented, policies are being formulated and more constructive suggestions are being received on MyGov website.
Nowadays, on 15th August, I have also started receiving suggestions from mygov address on what should I talk about.
Susitra Pazhawahari from Chennai has given me many suggestions.
He has asked them to talk about Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Swachh Ganga, Swachh Bharat.
This has inspired a feeling in my mind and you can register your views on what I should address on 15th August this year.
You can send Mygov to the address, write to the radio, send it to the Prime Minister's Office.
In my speech on 15th August, it is a wonderful idea that I should get what I should get from the public.
I am sure you will give me a wonderful idea.
Two days ago, I was reminded of an accident in Delhi and after that accident, the life of the person who had travelled in the scooter sparked for ten minutes.
He did not get any help.
On several occasions people have been asking me to talk about road safety and create awareness.
It's all right for you all.
If we ignore statistics, the heart will stop.
Every minute an accident takes place in our country.
I urge the parents to create an environment in the family where the child driving vehicle, two wheelers, four wheelers, all aspects of safety should be observed.
The government has also taken several initiatives in this regard - be it road safety awareness, road construction engineering, law enforcement, providing emergency treatment to the injured after the accident, we are bringing the Road Transport and Safety Bill in mind.
In the coming days, we have planned to take several important initiatives to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
We have given importance to cashless treatment on national highways like Guwahati, Jaipur and Vadodara to Mumbai and Ranchi.
Accordingly, we are thinking about the best possible life savings and maintenance in the first 50 hours by postponing the issues related to who will be able to pay even if there is no money.
We have to approach it primarily from the point of view of how accidents are not happening, in fact, every life is valued.
Sometimes I say that the employees should be Karma Yogis.
I share with you some of the events that touched my heart in the last few days.
One gets a good feeling when one sees how one can bring life even in his work.
Vijay Biswaal ji has expressed how he can connect his country, his artistic spirit and his work with his work.
I am sure that the picture of Vijay Biswal will be a thing to talk about in the days to come.
I am very optimistic that a big team of government officials from the Harda district of Madhya Pradesh is working on a project.
Sometimes even a few things are extremely pleasant and therefore I share them with you.
There is a village called Kashla in Rajnandka, Chhattisgarh.
Over the past few months, we have made efforts to build toilets.
Now no one from that village needs to spend the natural resources in the open.
Whatever be the case, when it was completed, the entire village celebrated it like a big festival.
The best examples of how values change in social life, how people's outlook is changing, how citizens of the country are taking the country on the path of progress.
Bhavesh Day from Guwahati has written to me about the problems faced by the North-Eastern states.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister of the country, a ministry named DONER was created which means the Ministry of Development of North Eastern States.
Well, we cant decide the interests of the North-Eastern states by sitting in Delhi or not
Therefore, a team of officers from the Government of India visited the North Eastern region of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim.
This effort is going to have good results in the coming days.
This is a remarkable effort, an effort to move from Delhi to remote areas, which I call the ACT EAST policy.
My dear countrymen, I am delighted to see the success of the SEWAYAM mission.
Just a few days back, India has launched 5 UK satellites through its PSLV C28.
Even though this news is not one of the most attractive things, it is a great achievement.
Sometimes when we ask the younger generation of the country, what do you want after you have grown then one hundred of them will answer that I want to be the most scientist.
It is a matter of concern that the country is less scientific.
With this, the Ministry of Human Resource Development of India has launched a National Innovation Mission.
I have requested the officers of the Government of India to spend one or two hours in a week to motivate the students of your neighbouring schools and colleges to share your experiences with them and it will definitely help them.
Whether our villages should get 24 hours of electricity or not
Though this work is difficult, it has to be completed.
Today, even though we need to charge mobiles, we have to go to another village.
The benefits of the cities should be extended to the villages and these facilities should be available to the poorest of the poor.
Towards this end, we have launched the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti.
Our country is the largest country, there are thousands of villages here and we have to ensure that electricity is supplied to the most remote areas.
Your suggestions will be a boon for me.
Thank you very much
When I said so, I didn't expect you to get such a huge response.
Hundreds of thousands of people had sent photographs through Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
I'm also retweeting some of them that attracted my views.
If some people in Andhra Pradesh say they did not record the photographs of the Belgaum caves, it would not have been known that there are such caves for many of the country.
This is the photo of Orchha in Madhya Pradesh.
We know that Rajasthan is always a water-less state but it is very surprising that a person from there sends photographs of the Mann Reservoir.
That is, in fact, a wonderful thing has happened.
I can assert that Yoga is not going to hide the sun in the world.
Looking at how the world is spreading red carpet and making Yoga its own, who will not have the pride and pride in the mind
And I, even I, was filled with joy, and my heart was filled with joy.
While the Cheen River and the Eiffel Tower are very proud of the people of France, they also chose these symbols to be the backbone of Yoga.
The people of Nayyark learnt the Times Square to practice Yoga.
As regards Australia's Sydney, the Aberra House scenes shine immediately.
The Australians undertook Yoga exercises in front of the Abera House.
Rajpath has become Yoga.
A new upsurge, a new spirit, a new zeal and a new zeal were felt in all the crores of the world.
A few days ago, a Vietnamese child, who had been trained in Yoga, was tweeted by her family, which was so captivating that it became popular all over the world.
Women, men, elderly, children, villagers, city dwellers, developed countries and developing countries have joined hands in Yoga training.
Yoga actually became a factor that connects the world.
I don't know how intellectual creatures will discredit and criticise the world.
But I feel that the world is very enthusiastic about India is a matter of pride for every Indian.
An interest in India has increased and the world is keen to know about India's values, heritage and culture.
But if we have the honour and pride of our heritage then we can show this to the world.
Sometimes we think of what is innovation in this, for example, we can say our family values and we don't know that India's family values are a big thing for the people of the world.
I would like to appeal to the youth of the country, especially the youth in the field of Information Technology. This is the request that all of you, the youngsters should come together to devise the programme on online yoga.
Do you know that there is an AYUSH sector in the government
Nobody's attention will return to it.
There will be news about it in two or four ways in five years, a small department in one corner.
But it was presided over Yoga Day.
The smallest sector has shown the largest work in the world.
This is an example of how small and medium enterprises can accomplish immense tasks when the goal is before us.
The world was wondering how our fellow citizens rescued the victims of Yemen.
In just a few hours, the world saw that Indians had gone and extended their hand in Nepal.
If we start working with a solemn pledge then the government will work faster, the government servants will work faster and the stuff will also be celebrated with the head.
This is my own experience.
This is the real power that will advance the country.
Last month, we announced three livelihood insurance schemes from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people are engaging in some or the other way in life insurance schemes but we have to take it further.
I want to put an idea in my mind, I want to put it before you.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is being celebrated in August and we can all start a strong peoples movement before the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Come, together with me, let us strive to fulfill this pledge.
When I shout Mann Ki Baat, many people give me suggestions.
This time, many people have suggested to me that I should inform you about the monsoon.
Thiruvananthapuram, Yogesh Thandekar of Nagpur, Harsh Vardhan of Mysore, Praveen Dinakarni and Divyaanshu Gupta have been asking you to talk about the monsoon in mind.
They have also given good suggestions for their part.
You too must have been enjoying this rainy season with hot Bakoda, Bajji and Solam tea.
Just as the rays of the sun give us life, the rain also gives us strength.
Every drop of rainfall is valuable.
As a citizen and as a society, we must nurture the spirit of conserving every drop of water.
Water in the village should be used in the same way as water in the city should be used for urban use.
Be it vaccination or water supply management or be it small ponds or be it lakes, we have to protect every drop of water.
If you go to Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji, if you can see his house, you can see that there is a water stored in his 200-year-old house in the storage of water, in which rain water can be supplied directly.
You must see this.
So much interest has been taken even at that time.
We can do this too
It has to be transformed into a peoples movement.
The village should always be followed in this manner.
Similarly, the greenery plunders our eyes.
How charming is the green life
Tree plantations, gardens and parks all these make life a green one, don't they
We all have to plant trees during this rainy season and the movement related to this must be implemented on a massive scale by social organizations and youth.
I would like to give a suggestion from my own experience that this rural technology is a very successful one.
And when you are in the middle of the tree, keep an old earthen vessel near the tree, and fill it with water.
Due to the moisture content in the environment, microbial bacteria are growing and health becomes very important.
Cleanliness becomes very important.
There is a need to drink clean water.
Most people drink by boiling water during this season.
It also has good results.
The more we take care, the more we get protection from diseases.
There is a need for water and rain but it is also important to be safe from the illness.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we have just introduced three new schemes, especially for the urban people.
Under the UMRIDA scheme, we have launched a movement to make our cities livelihood-friendly.
By 2022, when India will celebrate 75 years of its independence, every Indian should have a house.
Keeping these three things in mind, we have started a big scheme.
This, among all the fathers, took a selfie photo with their daughters and gave an inspiration to register on social web sites.
In Haryana, the rate of girl child is very low as compared to male children.
There are 100 such alarming districts in the country.
This is a lot more in Haryana.
In some way, we will transform the programme Beti Bachao Beti Padhao into a mass movement.
Keep in mind, you will realise how much happiness the movement will bring about the rise, dignity and safety of the daughters.
Secret the rainy season
Make our country green
I am saying this in an experienced manner.
Take this forward.
I will be meeting you for the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes I think that in my Mann Ki Baat programme, I should announce the welfare schemes of the government.
This is what makes me happy.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You can imagine how this mid-term would have passed.
And it shall come to pass on Sunday, and on the last Sunday of the month, at 11 a.m. and, behold, it shall come to pass, that I shall feel that something is gone away, and that it is yours
But what had happened at that time - no, no, I thought it should be a Sunday programme.
But I was eagerly waiting for this Sunday.
Many people have asked me why I travelled to Kedarnath in the midst of the hurricane elections.
But if I have started traveling in that direction then it can change the course of Mann Ki Baat.
Therefore, when the polls continued, I left for conceptions of electoral turmoil and victory defeat.
Many consider it a political implication.
For me, I consider it an occasion to meet me.
In a way, I went to meet myself.
I cannot say when I will do it but I will do it for sure because it is my duty to inform you about your right to know.
Just as people have expressed their willingness to know about Kedar, I continue to realise in your words the effort of you people to strengthen constructive things.
The insertions in the letters of Mann Ki Baat are entirely different from the customary governmental affairs.
Sometimes your words are opening the bed in the middle of my thoughts.
When someone writes about cleanliness, he expresses his anger against cleanliness and collaborates with the efforts to make cleanliness.
If one discusses the environment, it reflects his pain
But at the same time, he also mentions his efforts and the thoughts he has inspired in his mind.
That is, in a way, a vision of how the solution to the problems can be incorporated in the entire society will be reflected in his words.
Mann Ki Baat works as a glass to the country and the society.
This shows that there is no dearth of determination, energy and skills in the countrymen.
It is necessary to integrate those strengths and capabilities, create opportunities for them and make positive efforts.
Mann Ki Baat tells us that 130 crore people of the country want to be strong and constructive in their progress.
One writes a letter to the Prime Minister of the country, but you can imagine that he has not submitted any application for himself...
How excellent is the feelings of millions of such people in the country
When I examine all these things, I leave your imagination as to how much pleasure I am, how much enthusiasm I am.
You're driving me, you're driving me fast, you can't imagine you're putting your life in me every moment...
Without this relationship, I was waiting for salvation.
Today my mind is filled with happiness.
In this feeling, we will carry forward the Mann Ki Baat with eagerness.
When emergency was created in the country, the struggles against it were not limited to political limitations or political leaders
It has not been imprisoned even in the midst of prison wires.
Every citizen was furious with anger.
There was a pace for lost democracy.
If we eat food every day without any fault then we will not know what hunger is.
Similarly, when one comes to know about the joy of providing democratic rights in a normal life, when one breaks our democratic rights.
At the time of emergency, every citizen of the whole country felt that something had been taken away from him.
I can proudly assert that because of this tradition, India is a nurtured society.
That's why the people of the country felt the absence of democracy, and during the Emergency, we experienced this absence.
Therefore, the country has dedicated not for itself, but for the protection of democracy as a whole.
We are neglecting the miracles of any thing that is far away from our pockets and we have underestimated its importance.
More than 61 crore people have voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India.
This number may seem simple to us, but if we look at China from the point of view of the world, more people have voted in this election than in any country of the world.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha election is more than double the total population of the United States than the population of Europe as a whole.
This reflects the vastness and broadness of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha Election is the worlds largest democratic election in history.
Just imagine how great abundance of goods and human resources will be required to manage such a massive election.
This has become possible as a result of the hard work done by millions of teachers, officers and staff overnight.
This time, because of the hard work of all of them, there has been a lot more voting than the last time.
Nearly 1 million polling stations, more than 4 million voting machines and more than 17 million videobatts across the country for voting...
I leave the grandeur of the arrangements to your imagination.
All this was done to ensure that no voter should be denied the right to vote.
In a remote region of Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station was set up for only one female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the election officials had taken two days to reach there.
This is the genuine respect for democracy.
The world's highest ballot place is located in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet at Lahoul Spiti in Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, this election has one more thing to be proud of.
This may be the first time in history that even women have enthusiastically participated in the vote for men.
In this election, the voting rate for women and men was almost identical.
One more encouraging thing about this is that today the number of women members in the House is 78.
My dear countrymen, you might have heard often that the book is not a bouquet.
I was asking you to give books instead of flowers on occasions such as receptions and glory.
Since then, people have started delivering books at many places.
Now someone has given me a book titled 'Bramchand ji' and I like it very much.
We have not had time for several days, but we have got the opportunity to re-read some of his stories due to his foreign travels.
Bremchand has described the reality of the society in his stories and when he reads, those scenes begin to migrate in your mind as a painting.
Everything he wrote is alive.
My young days were shadowed in my mind...
The second legend touched the depths of my mind, its name is Eidgah.
The compassionate understanding of a young man, the pure love of his mother, and his compassionate heart at such a young age.
When Hamid, a 4-5-year-old, buys a bread-feeding waist, and comes to his mother, the human spirit is really touching the height.
Likewise, the name of a tale touching the chest is 'Bhoose Ki Rath.'
This story depicts a contradiction in the lives of a poor farmer.
Even after the destruction of his yield, why is a farmer named Haldu happy because he does not need to sleep in his field in bone melting cold
But even though these stories were written about a century ago, we can feel that these stories are relevant today.
After reading these things, I felt a lot of experience.
While talking about the subject of studies, I was reading in some media about the Akshara Library in Kerala.
Once they came here with a bundle of books and carrying them on their backs.
Today this library is showing a new direction not only to the tribal children but also to all.
Gujarat's Vange Gujarat Mission is a successful initiative.
In this movement of books, all the elderly participated in hundreds of thousands.
In today's digital world, during the period of Guru Gobind ji, I would urge you to spend some time giving a place to your books in the middle of your daily routine.
In fact, you are very fond of this thing and write about the book you have read and on the NarendraModi app so that the voice lovers of Mann Ki Baat can also know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to know that our countrymen are thinking about things that will emerge as challenges in the future.
When I was reading your comments on the Narendra Modi App and Mygov, I was able to see that many people had written about water.
Apart from Pawan Gaurai from Belgaum and Sidhamsu Mohan Parita from Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and others have written about many water related challenges.
Water has great significance in our culture.
This is said about the water in the occupation of Rig Veda - Apohishta Mayobuvah, Jasthan Urje Dattatana, Maharanaya Chakse, Yova: Shiva Dhamoras: Dasya Bhajayadehana: Ushtariva Matarah, i. e.
Water is equivalent to mother i. e.
Water scarcity has affected many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 of the water available due to rain can be stored in our country throughout the year.
Just 8 percent.
So the time has come for a solution to the problem.
I am confident that like other problems, we will be able to solve this embarrassment with the help of peoples participation and the opening of 130 crore countrymen with the help of Jan Shakti.
Recognizing the importance of water, the Ministry of New Jal Shakti has been set up in the country.
This will ensure speedy decision making on all matters related to water.
A few days ago, I started doing something differently.
I drafted a letter to the heads of Panchayats and village heads of the country.
I had written to them that they should collect water, collect water, maintain every drop of rain water and join the Gram Sabha and join the villagers in consultation with them.
I am very happy that they have been involved in this work. On 22nd of this month, millions and millions of people participated in thousands of Panchayats.
People from rural areas were determined to save every drop of water and contributed to their sympathy.
Today, on the Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to talk to you about a fearsome leader.
The people there are once again ready to contribute to water conservation.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the Panchayat leaders and all the rural leaders who have worked constructively from my side.
There are several leaders who have been facing the challenge of water conservation throughout the country.
In a way, this is an opportunity for the entire village.
There is a feeling in my heart that the villagers are now competing for some water in their village.
As I have said, there are positive results through social initiatives.
There is no single way to deal with water scarcity throughout the country.
Efforts are being made in different ways in different parts of the country for this purpose.
But the goal of all is to save water and to maintain water.
The sewage canals of Punjab are being repaired.
This effort will get rid of the problem of blockade.
There has been a transformation in the lives of the villagers due to the setting up of water plants at Thimayyapalli in Telangana.
There has been a major change in Kabirdham in Rajasthan due to the small ponds being constructed in the fields.
I was reading about a social initiative in Vellore, Tamil Nadu and I knew that there were 20000 women mobilizing the work of reviving the Naga river.
At the same time, I also read about the women of Garhwal and they have done a wonderful job for collecting rain water in accordance with each other.
When people gather, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I propose three requests to the people of the country.
My first request - Just as the countrymen have made cleanliness a mass movement, let us initiate a mass movement to convert water conservation into a peoples movement.
Together we will make a pledge to save every drop of water, it is my belief that water is God's gift, it is a miraculous rasamani.
It was said that this rasamani will be iron.
But you are also such a rasamani, a new life is being produced by the spray of water.
We have to create an awareness campaign to save every drop of water.
My second request to the countrymen was that there have been several traditional methods of water conservation in our country for centuries.
I urge you all to share these traditional methods with you all.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to Porbandar to the place of birth, then there is a 200-year-old water storage kitchen in a house behind the mother's house.
Come, let us create a full list of water conservation and inspire people to engage in water conservation.
All of you JanShakti4JalShakti - use this and share your thoughts.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to you and to the people of the world for one more thing.
The Presidents of many countries of the world, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities, ordinary citizens have shown me through Twitter that how Yoga is being taught in every country.
On that day, the world appeared to be a happy family.
We know that Yoga ensures that healthy and understanding persons are required to establish a healthy society.
Therefore, the spread of Yoga is a great service to the social service.
Shouldn't it be honoured to recognise such a service
In the year 2019, the announcement of the Prime Ministers Awards for outstanding contribution towards the promotion and development of Yoga has given me immense enthusiasm.
This award is conferred to institutions that have made significant contributions to the spread of Yoga throughout the world.
Japan Yoga Niketan conducts many organizations and courses there
Likewise, Ms.
He is an exemplary example.
When it comes to matters related to Yoga then whether India will stay behind or not
Yoga should be widely celebrated and those who bring the message of Yoga to every household should be honoured.
My dear countrymen, our journey has started today, new feelings, new experiences, new determination and new openness.
Yes, wait for your suggestions and views as usual.
We all will meet again and again and we will be happy to talk.
I listen to your feelings, I gather and understand.
Perhaps I'm trying to live up to those feelings.
Let your blessings continue.
You are my concepts, you give me strength.
Let us come together and enjoy the voice of Mann Ki Baat and fulfill our duties in life on Tuesday.
Once again we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat next month.
Thank you very much to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today, my heart is dreaming when Mann Ki Baat begins.
10 days ago, Mother India has lost her brave sons.
These brave soldiers have lost their lives to save 125 crore countrymen.
Our brave sons and sisters had dedicated themselves to sleeping peacefully during the night without me.
After the martyrdom of our brave soldiers in Pulwama's terrorist attack, the hearts of the countrymen are wounded and are boiling in anger.
There are also condolences about the martyrs and their families.
I salute the brave soldiers of the country who sacrificed their lives to save Mother India.
The task of facing this challenge before the nation should be forgotten by all differences of opinion like casteism, religiousism and regionalism, so that our endeavours and decisions against terrorism can be firmly and rigorously concluded.
Our Armed Forces have always displayed unflinching courage and might.
While maintaining peace, they have demonstrated their excellent ability to respond to the attackers in the same language.
You can see how the operations were carried out within 100 hours of the attack.
The military is determined to root out the extremists and their sub-servicemen.
After the valour of the brave soldiers, the inspiring words and ideas expressed by their relatives through the media have been widespread and have strengthened the mindset across the country.
Meena, wife of Prasanna Sahu, a martyr from Jagatsinghpur in Odisha, celebrates her unlimited courage throughout the country.
He has vowed to include his only son in the Central Border Security Force.
When Vijay Shorena's bouquet reached Kumla in Jharkhand, his son-in-law cried out that I would work with the army.
It is the greed of this pinch that has grown into a mixed spirit within the body, within the body of every child of India.
Whether it is the family of Deoria's martyr Vijay Maurya, the father of the martyr Thilakraj of Kangra or the six-year-old Balakana of Hemraj, a martyr of Koda, the story of every family of the martyrs is a source of inspiration and inspiration.
I urge the younger generation to know and understand the feelings and goals that these families have expressed.
In order to know about patriotism, sacrifice and penance, we do not need to reverse the past records of history.
My dear countrymen...
After independence, for so long, the time will come when we all have waited for a war memorial.
It is natural for the countrymen to have a sense of zeal and enthusiasm in this regard.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Ongar Shetty from Karnataka's dress expressed his happiness at the establishment of the National War Memorial.
It is a matter of surprise and anguish that no national war memorial has been set up in our country so far.
I wanted it to be a memorial decorated with the tales of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the protection of the nation.
I have pledged that such a memorial must have been set up in the country.
The second wheel, the cycle of valour, shows the courage and courage of the soldiers.
The walls of the gallery would have engraved the brave adventures of the soldiers.
Thereafter the Martyrdom Cycle
This chakra reflects the sacrifices of the soldiers.
The names of the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice for the nation will be engraved on the golden pages.
Thereafter, the Raksha Chakra symbolizes security.
There is a queue of dense trees in this chakra.
It is impossible to contribute in words and contributions of our Armed Forces, Police and Para Military Forces to the progress of the country.
In October last year, I had the privilege of dedicating the National Police Memorial to the nation.
This memorial was also created as a expression of the feeling that we should be grateful to the men and women of our police forces who have always been protected.
I am sure you will visit the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you visit those places, you must share the photographs that you have taken on the social web site so that others get inspired to visit these holy places.
My dear countrymen, thousands of letters and comments of yours have come to me in different ways for Mann Ki Baat.
This time when I was reading your thoughts, an interesting idea of Adisha Mukhobadhyay ji was drawing my attention.
His age was only 25 when the British arrested Birsa Munda on March 3, 1900.
Similarly, it is also a coincidence that on the 3rd of March, the birthday of Jamsetji Tata ji was also an accident.
He further said that while these two men belong to different family backgrounds, both of them have fulfilled the legacy and history of Jharkhand.
Giving tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamsetji Tata in Mann Ki Baat is in a way equivalent to cherishing the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great men have illuminated not only the name of Jharkhand but also the name of the entire country.
The entire country is grateful for their contribution.
If a man of inspiration is required to provide guidance to our youth then he is Lord Birsa Munda.
The British captured him while he was asleep in a jealous and hesitant manner.
Do you know why they have kept such an injury
Because even the British who had established such a magnificent empire were afraid of him.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda, with his traditional arrows, shook the British regime using guns and artillery.
In fact, if we get a leadership that can give people a sense of compassion, the social psychology becomes bigger than the power of weapons.
He took the deceitful and tyrannical targets from a dark life to a shining sun.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda was martyred at the end of his 25-year career.
Like Birsa Munda, the sons of Mother India have emerged from all parts of the country.
Such great men were filled everywhere so that they could not find any part of India that had not contributed to the freedom struggle that had taken place for centuries.
Unfortunately, their stories of sacrifice, heroism and sacrifice did not reach the new generation.
If people like Bhagwan Birsa Munda have made us feel our presence then people like Jamsetji Tata have given great institutions to the country.
In fact, Jamsetji Tata ji was a visionary prophet, who not only saw India's future but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He was very well aware that making India a hub of science, technology and industry would be a future requirement.
Because of his vision, the Tata Institute of Science was established and now it is known as the Indian Institute of Science.
Not only this, he also established trustworthy institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
The Indian Institute of Science was born as a result of this conversation.
My dear countrymen, the birthday of former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Desai is 29th February.
You all are aware that this day will come only once in four years.
As it is, a peaceful person, Morarji Bhai, was one of the leaders of a regulated country.
Morarji Bhai Desai, who presented the largest budget report in the Parliament of Independent India.
Morarji Bai Desai was a very difficult leader and a capable leader of India during that period, the democratic system of the country was in a grave threat.
Morarji Bhai Desai dedicated himself against the emergency in order to protect democracy.
For this, he had to pay a huge price in his age.
The then government arrested him and imprisoned him.
But when the Janata Party won in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his regime, the 44th Constitutional Amendment was passed.
What is important is that the 42nd Constitutional Amendment was enacted to promulgate a state of emergency, in addition to reducing the powers of the Supreme Court, some of the other elements in it had broken down our democratic values, so they were withdrawn.
This means that through the 44th Constitution Amendment, the functioning of the Parliament and the Legislatures was empowered to print in the newspapers.
The Presidents proclamation of Emergency was made for the first time only on the recommendations made by the Cabinet in writing and the period of Emergency cannot be increased by more than six months in a single manner.
Morarzi Bhai made a declaration of emergency and confirmed that the 1975 massacre of democracy could not be restored to the stage.
His contribution to the protection of the glory of Indian democracy is immense, and the future generations will always remember it.
Once again I have seen such a great prince, my salutations.
They have made a positive difference in the lives of others in different ways with the help of their hard work.
And as they are, they are genuinely caring for the service of the people, the service of the society and above all, the service of the country in a selfless manner.
When Padma awards are announced, you might have seen the people asking who the awardee is.
In a way, I consider this as a great success because they will not be seen in the television and newspaper cards and they will be away from the world of hustle and bustle.
But if they are such, they are not concerned that they should be named, they are convinced that they are working on the field.
Their lives are as follows: Karmasu Kaushalam.
I would like to share with you about such people.
You must be aware of Odisha's Tahitari Nayak and there is no reason to call him the canal man of Odisha and Tathari Nayak ji cut the mountain through his hands in his village and lay the canal road for three kilometres.
I gave him a commemorative presentation of the Tree of Life painting made by Abdul Kafur, the former US President, Barack Obama.
Among the Padma awardees, Shaper Saiyat from Maratwada is known as the servant of Pashutha.
The way he devoted his entire life to the service of cows is extremely unparalleled.
For the first time, a small child from Madurai had undertaken efforts to contribute to the empowerment of the victims and oppressed, through the Tamil Nadu Fertilizer Mission, and started micro-sectoral structures on a social basis.
Even after hundred years, he teaches Yoga to people all over the world, so far he has made 1500 people Yoga teachers.
Jamuna Tudu, a famous woman named Lady Tarzan of Jharkhand, has done an adventurous job to oppose tree robbers and naxals, preventing the destruction of 50 hectares of wildlife and inspired tens of thousands of women to protect trees and wildlife.
Because of this untiring hard work of Jamuna Ji, today every villager is carrying 18 trees while every child is born and 10 trees are being planted during the wedding of every woman.
The story of Rajkumari Devi, a farmer from Musafarpur in Bihar, is very inspiring.
Nowadays, wherever I go in the country, I am trying to meet some of the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, over the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have been benefitted from this scheme.
I can clearly see how big a change has been brought about in the lives of the poor.
This scheme belongs to all such poor people.
Sitting in my heart, my countrymen, the exams are going to start in schools.
Various educational boards across the country will start the selection of boards for 10th and 12th classes in the next few weeks.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who are going to appear for the examination.
A few days ago, a major programme of Pariksha Pe Charcha i. e.
One of the salient features of the Conclave on Examinations is that there are discussions on various subjects related to examinations without restraint.
Because we have a tradition of thousands of years old culture.
A few days later, the holy day of Mahasivratri is coming. This time, when Shivratri comes on Monday, a special significance spreads thrilling smell in our hearts.
I had visited Kashi a few days ago and I had got the opportunity to spend some time with the disabled brothers and sisters.
I could talk to them about many things, their self-confidence was really impressive and inspiring.
While talking, a young person with a visually impaired person said that he was a platformperson and when he introduced himself as a mixer on joke programmes, I asked who you would talk about.
He said I will mix up like Prime Minister.
At the same time, I was waiting for a comfortable surprise when I could do something right, just like I used to speak in Mann Ki Baat, he used to speak Mann Ki Baat.
I was glad to know that people not only listen to Mann Ki Baat but also remember it on many occasions.
In fact, I was overwhelmed by the strength of the youth with disabilities and they had a big impact on me.
My dear countrymen, connecting with you all through Mann Ki Baat has given me a unique experience.
In a way, I have been interacting with millions and millions of families every month through radio.
Whenever you talk to you, when you read your letters and when you hear your phone calls, you consider me as your family member.
This feeling blossoms a comfortable experience in my mind.
Friends, elections are the biggest celebrations of democracy.
For the next two months, we will all be drowned in the electoral fray.
I am also standing as a candidate in this election.
To pay homage to a healthy democratic tradition, the next Mann Ki Baat will be held on the last Sunday of May.
That is, on March-April, I will begin the series of three months of my emotions and after the elections with a new confidence and with the strength of your blessings and once again with the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I will travel along with your Mann Ki Baat for several years.
Once again I express my gratitude.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Sivakumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Sivakumar Swami is following this philosophy.
In his 111-year career, he served for the social, education and economic development of thousands of people.
His punditism was so widespread that he had a wonderful illusion in English, Samskrit and Kannada.
He's a social reformer.
He spent his entire life in feeding people, sheltering, teaching and spiritual wisdom.
The main objective of Swami ji's life was to provide all kinds of benefits to the farmers.
Siddhaganga Math is organising a fair of cows and cultivation.
I have often got the blessings of Swamiji.
During the Centenary Celebrations of Shri Sri Sri Shiva Kumar Swamiji in 2007, our former President, Dr.
During this occasion, Kalam siya taught a poem written for Swamiji.
This poem by Dr. Kalam Iyeah explains the life of Sri Sri Sri Shivakumar Swamiji and the aim of Siddhaganga Math in a beautiful way.
There is a very important institution in our country
This is an integral part of our democracy and it is more than our democracy. I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
This is the foundation day of the Election Commission on 25th January, which we celebrate as National Voters Day.
Looking at the level of elections held in India, the world is surprisingly turning to the nose
Polling stations are being set up in Himachal Pradesh at an altitude of 15,000 feet and also in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
You might have heard about Gujarat
In the far-flung areas of the Kir forest, a polling station has been set up for only one voter.
Imagine, mates...
In order to enable the electorate to utilise the ballot status of the voter, the entire team of EC staff goes to remote areas and makes the ballot system. This is the beauty of our democracy.
I express my heartfelt appreciation for the Election Commission, which has been continuously trying to strengthen the democratic system.
I compliment the Election Commissions of all the States, all the Security Forces and other personnel involved in the electoral process for free and non-discrimination.
Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country this year.
Young people born in the 21st century are going to vote for the first time in Lok Sabha elections this time.
They will have the opportunity to bear the responsibility of the nation on their shoulders.
Now they have become partners in the process of taking decisions for the nation.
The time has come for connecting their dreams with the dreams of the nation.
If you are eligible for a vote, you must register your name in the electoral roll.
If we cannot vote for some reason in life then we should feel that it is sad for us.
If we say something wrong has happened in the country then we have to feel sad.
This activity has to be transformed naturally.
I urge all of us to join hands in the Electoral Roll and vote on the day of polls that this time we should conduct a movement and create awareness.
I am confident that a large number of younger generation voters will register their names and they will be able to contribute to our democracy and will further strengthen it.
My dear countrymen, there have been many great personalities on this great land of India, such great personalities have done some wonderful and unforgettable work for humanity.
On 23rd January, he celebrated his birthday in a new way.
On Netaji's birthday, I had a great opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the brave soldiers who contributed in the freedom struggle of the country.
Inside the Red Fort, several such rooms and memorials have been closed since independence.
The closing Red Fort rooms have been transformed into museums, a museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army, Yaad-e-Jalian
The museum in the memory of 1857, Indias First War of Independence and the entire complex was dedicated to the Grand Finale of Revolution.
The fragrance of our glorious history resides in every brick in these museums.
It was in this place that the British Government prosecuted India's brave sons Colonel Brem Siegel, Colonel Kurbaksh Singh Tillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was listening to the memories associated with Netaji in the Revolutionary Temple of Red Fort, one of Netaji's family gifted me a very important cap.
In fact, there is a need to bring the bravery and patriotism of our heroes to our new generations again and again in different dimensions.
About a month ago, on December 30, I had gone to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
The place where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had hoisted the Tricolour 75 years ago, I got the opportunity to fly the Tricolour at the same place.
On this occasion, the announcement regarding the Government of Assam was made 75 years ago.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a capable administrator.
Such a brave soldier has played an important role in the freedom struggle.
Netaji fulfils every Indian's heart with the slogans of 'Delhi Shalo' and 'I will give you freedom'.
For years, there was a demand for the publication of secret documents about him.
I am extremely happy that we are doing this work.
I don't think that all the family members of Netaji had come to my house one day.
Together we talked about several things related to Netaji and we made a presentation to Netaji Bose.
Efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum connected with Baba Saheb Ambedkar, or the Grand Finale Mantra.
If you come to Delhi then you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, while today we are discussing about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, I would like to share that thing with you people in Mann Ki Baat and an incident related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered radio as an important medium for connecting people.
I have been told that this radio station has been telecast once a week and it has been broadcast in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangla, Marathi, Punjab, Pashto and Urdu.
In this radio station administration, MSMEs lived in Gujarat.
R.
Vyas Jis contribution is remarkable.
Broadcasting programmes on the Azad Hind Radio were very fond of the common people and its events gave a lot of strength to our freedom fighters.
A gallery museum has been built in this Revolutionary Temple.
Efforts are being made to describe Indian art and culture in a way that brings more thought.
There are four historic exhibitions in the Museum, where there are more than 450 paintings and art works of 3 centuries old.
The museum showcases the outstanding works of outstanding artists like Amruta Shergill, Raja Ravi Varma, Ajnidranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandal Bose, Jamini Rai and Sailos Mukherjee.
I would particularly urge you all to visit and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You might be wondering if this was talking about art, but you might be thinking about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore's noble work.
You all know Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I want to tell you that Gurudev is also a painter.
The special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not give any name to his majority works.
He said that the person who sees the picture should himself understand it, and he should see the message given through that picture in his own perspective.
His paintings have been displayed in European countries, Russia and America.
I am confident that you will visit Kranti Mandir and see his paintings.
My dear countrymen, India is a land full of sacred people.
Our holy people have given the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
One such pilgrim is Chand Ravidas.
Ravidas ji was born on 19th February.
In fact, if God is in all human beings, it is not apt to distinguish him from caste, creed and creed.
Guru Ravidas was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Prince Ravidas ji, through his messages, made every effort to make labour and worker understand the significance of his entire life.
It would not be exaggerated if he told the world the true meaning of the greatness of labour.
Once again I remember the holy Lord Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar ji in MyGov has been urging me to speak in Mann Ki Baat on the Indian Space Sector and its future dimensions.
Vikram Sarabhai has contributed immensely to Indias space programme.
Our space programme includes the contribution of countless young scientists of the country.
It is heartening to note that the satellites and soundingrockets developed by our students are reaching out to space.
It was on 24th January that our students launched the Kalamsat App.
Even the sounding rockets created by university students in Odisha have earned fame.
During the last four and a half years, the number of space missions undertaken during the period from the independence of the country to 2014 has been increased.
We have successfully launched 104 satellites in one spacecraft.
We will soon register India's existence in the moon through Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is making use of space technology in an excellent way for the protection of bio-energy.
Be it weather, rail or road safety, space technology has been providing substantial assistance in all these areas.
NAVIC devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which helps them to protect and promote economic growth.
We have been using space technology to fulfil the service delivery and responsibilities of the government.
Under the Housing for All, around 40 lakh houses in 23 states have been provided with geo-take.
Besides, geo-tagging of nearly three crore properties has also been done under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme.
Our satellites are the symbols of the growing power of the country today.
We have made excellent relations with many countries of the world because of its contribution.
There is an exclusive effort on South Asian satellites, which has given a reward for development to our neighbouring countries.
Through its excellent competitive mobility services, India has not only launched satellites of developing countries but also of developed countries.
The heavens and the earth have always been things that attract children.
Our space programme provides opportunities and opportunities to think greatly, seeing what is impossible so far, to move beyond those borders.
Our children are attracted by the girls and are also inspiring to look for new stars and showcase their vision.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that whoever plays, who grows and blossoms, this time the sportspersons in Khelo India have brightened.
In January, about 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 sports events for Khelo India Youth in Pune.
If a sportsperson performs well at the local level, he will be able to achieve the best in the world.
This time, sportspersons from all the states of Khelo India have shown their talent.
He lives in a cab with his family.
Like him, Captain Sonali Helvee of Maharashtra's Kabbadi group for women aged 21 is residing in Satara.
He lost his father at an early age, his brother and his mother inspired Sonali.
At times, we see that women do not get much encouragement in sports like kabaddi.
But beyond all this, Sonalee chose the crop and did a great job.
Abhinav Shah, a 10-year-old from Asansol, is proud to have won the Gold Medal at the youngest in the Khelo India Games.
Akshata Vaswani, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, has won a gold medal in the weightlifting sector.
His father is a farmer from Belgaum.
But did you hear about the competition to clean the toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets have participated in this wonderful competition that has been going on for nearly a month.
The name of this wonderful competition is a clean and beautiful toilet.
In addition to keeping their toilets clean, people used to use some paintings to enhance the beauty of their toilets, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, several photographs related to clean toilets are available on social web sites.
I urge all the Panchayat leaders and village leaders to take the lead in such a movement in your Panchayat.
Definitely share the photos of your clean toilet with MyIzzatGhar on the social web site.
Friends, Together with the aim of cleaning the country and to get rid of open defecation, we have made a memorable journey on October 2, 2014.
Due to the cooperation of the people of India, today, in 2019, before the 2nd of October, 2019, it is rapidly moving towards achieving freedom from open defecation and because of this, we can dedicate ourselves to him on the 150th birth anniversary of Mother India.
In this memorable journey of a Swachh Bharat, the contribution of Mann Ki Baat is immense and that is why I am happy to share this thing with you that more than 5. 5 lakh villages and 600 districts have declared that they have become Open Defecation Free (ODF) and 98 of the rural India's cleaning has reached the people and about 9 crore households have been provided with toilets.
My little friends, the election days are getting closer.
Sherma MyGov, a resident in Himachal Pradesh, is asking me to talk about examinations and about exam warriors.
And they said, Thank you, O Anshuel, for that which you have put forward this thing.
Yes, the first part of the year is the examination period for many families.
Students, their parents, teachers, all are involved in exams.
Moreover, students from many foreign countries are also participating in the event this time.
In this Pariksha Pe Charcha, I would like to talk to all the angles associated with the examinations, especially with our young friends on the issue of unconscious examinations.
I have been urging people to send inputs and comments for this thing.
I am very happy that a large number of people are sharing their views on MyGov.
Some of these ideas and suggestions will definitely be put forward during the Down Hall programme.
You must participate in this program...
You will also be able to see its direct telecast through social media and NAMO App.
May this visit of 2019 be a successful one.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
That is when we get the benefits of experience and self-confidence that we have to do something new.
What we do is not only bring about a change in our lives but also contribute to taking the country and society forward.
It will be an honour for all of us.
In 2018, Ayushman Bharat, the world's largest health insurance scheme, was launched.
Electricity has been provided to every village of the country.
All the world's prestigious organizations have said that India is getting rid of poverty at a record pace.

India won the Greek Cricket World Cup for the under-19 years and the Global Cricket for the Disabled Persons with Disabilities.
This time, India has won medals in a big way in the Asian Games.
India has done a wonderful job in the Para Asian Games.
If I talk about the efforts of every Indian and only about our social endeavours then the voice of our mind will be very long and it will be born in 2019.
All this is due to the relentless efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
Jayachandran joined the Lord.
People say that he was busy in providing treatment to patients at any time.
Similarly, Sulakitti Narasamma from Karnataka joined Lord Christ on 25th December.
Sulakitti Narmada was helpful in delivery to pregnant mothers.
He has served thousands of mothers in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
Earlier this year, he was awarded the Padma Shri award.
When we talk about healthcare, I would like to talk about the social efforts of the doctors in Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some of our party members had told me that some young doctors used to camp in the city and provide free treatment to the poor.
Every month several poor patients are benefiting from this camp.
The enthusiasm of these medical friends, who are serving with selflessness, is truly commendable.
Today, I would like to express my pride here that the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful movement due to social efforts.
A few days ago, some people had told me that in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, more than 3 lakh people were working together in the cleanliness drive.
People from all walks of life like municipality, volunteer organizations, students from schools and colleges, and people from Jabalpur participated with great enthusiasm.
The success stories about innovative youngsters and entrepreneurs are illustrated in this.
Well, shall we do a job
Would we share information on such portals
Let us all spread a positive feeling.
With this, a large number of people will know about our heroes who are transforming the society.
There is a special place for sports in all societies.
While playing, the minds of those who see it are filled with energy.
We feel many things like name, identity and respect for sportspersons.
But, sometimes behind these things, there are many things that are even bigger than the sports world.
I would like to mention about Hanaya Nizar, a girl from Kashmir who has won a gold medal in the Karate in Korea.
Hanaya, a 12-year-old girl, belongs to Anantnag in Kashmir.
He was trained by Karate because of his hard work and hard work and hard work. He knew it very well and showed it a record.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I wish him a bright future.
Hanaya has a lot of good wishes and good wishes.
Like him, there was a lot of news in the media about Rajini, a 16-year-old girl, and you must have read.
Rajani has won a gold medal in the junior category in the women's boxing competition.
When Rajani won the medal, he immediately went to a nearby milk shop and drank a cup of milk.
After that, Rajani dressed his medal in a cloth and put it in his bag.
Yeah, why did Rajani drink a cup of milk, all of you think, huh
He did this to pay homage to his father, Jasmer Singh, who is selling luxury at a shop in Panipat.
Rajani later said that he had made a great sacrifice to reach this position and tolerated many difficulties.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
This year, Vedangi Kulkarni, a 20-year-old girl from Pune, became the first Asian woman to come to the world at a rapid pace.
He travelled 159 days at a rate of about 300 km per day.
His unwavering enthusiasm for cycling is truly commendable.
Isn't there any motivation for us when we hear about such achievements and achievements
The names of all these festivals may be different, but the feeling of celebrating all these festivals is the same, in some way or the other these festivals are associated with harvest and potatoes, which are connected to the farmers, which are connected to the villages, which are integrated with crops.
It is time to enter the sun rays and sun rays.
Then gradually it starts increasing day by day and starts harvesting cold crops.
My warm greetings to our brothers and sisters who are felicitating us.
The fragrance of the spirit of unity in diversity - Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat spreads through our festivals.
We can see how close our festivals and festivals have relations with nature.
Many of our festivals have been specially created in the spirit of conservation of rivers and water.
On the day of shuttle, the sun is worshipped in rivers and water bodies.
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people take holy bath in the rivers of Bhuni.
Share the photographs you have taken during these festivals with everyone so that everyone can enjoy the diversity of India and the beauty of its culture.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela is very dimensional, it is full of divine glory.
People from all over the country and the world come and join the Kumbh Mela.
In Kumbh, people are mixed with belief and embarrassment.
Millions of people from the country's neighbourhood join each other at the same time.
The tradition of Kumbh is a resource of our great cultural heritage.
This time, the world famous Kumbh Mela being organized in Prayagraj starting from 15th January is awaiting you all.
Saints and saints have started coming to Kumbh.
We can calculate its excellent significance by incorporating the Kumbh Mela of UNESCO last year on the list of INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE OF HUMANITY, the abominable cultural heritage of mankind.
A few days ago, ambassadors from several countries visited the Kumbh festival.
At the same time, the flags of many countries were flown.
People from over 150 countries are likely to participate in the Kumbh Mela organised at Prayagraj.
With the divinity of Kumbh, India's glory will showcase its greatness in the world stage.
The Kumbh Mela is a big tool to feel oneself and every person coming here gets a different experience, they see and understand the subjects of the world spiritually.
This particularly offers youngsters the opportunity to experience greater learning.
I had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I was able to see the arrangements for Kumbh in a very critical manner.
The people of Prayagraj are very enthusiastic about Kumbh.
I dedicated to the people the Integrated Command  Control Centre, the Integrated Command and Control Centre.
Along with the hard work of the arrangements, cleanliness will also reach the remotest areas.
This time devotees can also visit Akshayvad after the holy dip in the Sangam.
This magnificent symbol of the faith of the people has been stuck in the fort for thousands of years so that even if the devotees wanted, they could not see it.
Now the doors of Akshayvad are open for all.
May this spiritual pillar become the glory of Indian philosophy.
May this group of beliefs become the palace of the nation.
Whether it is the palace of national unity or be it the palace of the devotees, be it the palace of world tourism.
He had an uncompromising connection with South Africa.
It was in South Africa that Mohan became Mahatma.
In South Africa, Gandhiji started his first Satyagraha and gave a resolution against inequality.
He established Fenix and Tolstoy farms, from where the voices of peace and justice all over the world began to sound.
He was blessed with the patience and inspiration that he could spend years in jail.
Do you know what Mandela ji said about her brother-in-law The Gandhians were an integral part of our history because here she did her first experiment with poetry.
This is where he clearly expressed his commitment to justice
It is here that he swept the path of his Satyagraha philosophy and struggle.
He set up the Annal as his model.
And Mandela has been a source of inspiration for the entire world and their aims will always inspire us to build a society of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, there was a convention of Director Generals of Police at Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat where there was a discussion with top police officers of the country.
There was a detailed discussion on how efforts should be made to further strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the nation.
He was always associated with building the unity of India.
Sardar Patel believed that India's strength lies in the unity of diversity.
We can pay our homage to Sardar Patel through this award.
My dear countrymen, on January 13, the holy birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
Until a large part of his life, his work was in North India, and he joined the land of Maharastra.
The birthplace of Patna, the workplace of North India and the final moments of life are in Nalanda.
In a way, the whole of India has got his blessings.
Guru Gobind Singh ji and Sikh Gurus had the courage to fight for justice.
But whenever efforts were made to suppress the voices of the poor and the weak, whenever injustice was done to them, Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice for the poor and the weak, he fought with determination on his shoulders, that is why he used to say - 'Sawa Lakse Ak Ladaum, Sidion Son Man Bhaj Tudaum, Thabe Gobind Singh ji.
He will say, "Conflicting with the weak cannot express their power.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji considered it a great service to alleviate the sufferings of humanity.
He was a well-known gentleman of valour, heroism, sacrifice and ceremonial conduct.
Besides, Gurumukhi, Brajbasha, Samskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu were experts in many languages.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are several programmes that have not been discussed much in the country.
FSSAI is such a different effort.
Celebrations of 150th Birth Anniversary of Gandhiji are being organised across the country.
Healthy India Yatra is being undertaken through Eat Right India, Make in India Campaign.
When India is clean and healthy then it is self-sufficient.
The most important necessity for good health is nutritious diet.
Knowledge of the importance of food is essential from childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the closing ceremony of 2018. We will re-introduce ourselves in 2019.
Inspired by individual life, the life of the nation and the life of the society is the source of development.
Come, let us inspire new inspiration, new zeal, new determination, new triumphs, new heights and new heights.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On the 3rd of October, 2014, on the occasion of Vijayadasamith, we all undertook a one-way journey through Mann Ki Baat.
This time most of the letters and telephone calls from you have come from this 50th part.
In MyGov, Anshu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar from Delhi, Vikas Yadav from Patna, Monica Jain from Narendra Modi App, Prasenjit Sarkar from Bardhavan in West Bengal and Sangeeta Sastri from Nagpur have raised the same question.
Your interest is natural.
In today's era, when radio has been forgotten, why does Modi connect through radio
I want to tell you about an incident.
This happened in 1998.
I was a BJP worker in Himachal Pradesh.
I was going to a place in May.
Take a ladder, which was kept in a pot from him, and eat first before it becomes tea.
I was wondering why, I asked if there was a wedding in the house.
No, bro, you don't know
I don't know what to do.
Now look, let us listen to the radio first.
He was talking about it on radio.
In this forest, in such an unpopular area, in the midst of snowy mountains, an ordinary man sells tea himself and asks for radio throughout the day.
Therefore, it is not surprising that when I was the Prime Minister, I turned my attention to the most powerful media Radio.
Mann Ki Baat has been inspired by the desire to take the country from far-flung villages to cities, from farmers to young professionals.
Every month lakhs of letters were read, telephone calls were heard, apps and MyGov were cited.
The journey of these 50 regions, which have been connected with all these things in one corner and in a fascinating manner, we have collectively covered this journey.
Now all Indian Radio and Mann Ki Baat have been conducted.
Some of the meetings were as interesting as they were.
Seventy percent of those who have been analyzed are constantly asking for Mann Ki Baat.
A large number of people consider the creative emotions of the society as a great part of Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat has inspired mass movements in a big way.
Indipositives have been widely discussed.
All this underscores the positive sentiment and the positive spirit of our countrymen.
People share their feelings that the spirit of self-confidence has increased due to Mann Ki Baat.
It is a big change in the minds of the people that the idea of social service is being done.
But people are not only connected with this programme through synthesis.
Besides TV, FM, Mobile, Internet, Facebook, Direct Broadcasting, Periscope, NarendraModi App, people in Mann Ki Baat are ensuring their contribution.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the stakeholders of Mann Ki Baat for believing in Mann Ki Baat.
Your doubts are correct.
At the end of their analysis, it was also a conclusion that the event was unpolitical.
When Mann Ki Baat started, I had decided that Modi should not be seen anywhere.
In front of every Mann Ki Baat, the expectations of the leaders in letters, comments and telephone calls were evident.
Modi will come, he will go, but this country will remain intact forever, and our culture will not be wasted.
Small stories of 130 crore countrymen will always be hidden.
I read the letter and if the same feeling had emerged in another letter, I would also take it along.
Apart from this, I also share my experience with you.
There cannot be any government with the ability to spread awareness and spread awareness from a small village in Haryana to the entire country and abroad.
When every department and celebrities of the society join together, in a new interpretation of contemplation change in the society, todays generation understands it, and the visually impaired awakening is taking place.
India's soul is about social justice and social power.
There are thousands of dimensions of social life, one of them is politics.
If politics becomes everything, it is not a good system for a healthy society.
The extent to which political events and politicians dominate, sometimes, the various capabilities and other attempts of society are suppressed.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
In a way, you have been asked because of your consent.
If I have to answer the question you asked directly then it is because I don't engage in any preparation in the Muslim world.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple job for me.
Peoples letters are coming in front of every Mann Ki Baat.
The letter is not merely a paper for me
In fact, for nearly 40-45 years, I have lived the life of a saint, I have visited most of the parts of the country and have spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
In fact, in Mann Ki Baat, the voice is mine, but the examples, emotions and sentiments are my countrymen.
Till now, I have not been able to mention the names of lakhs of such people in Mann Ki Baat but they are sending their letters and comments without disappointment.
I have full faith that your thoughts will contribute to making me more interesting and more effective than ever before.
Efforts are being made to make the letters and comments related to Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to express my gratitude to all my friends from All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other television and social media platforms.
In this way, they become Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I express my gratitude and gratitude to all of them for their capabilities and skills.
I appeal to all of you that you must listen to this event in your local languages.
Any political media will always have no pleasure, only a very small coverage and they will always consider that it is negative.
But the media made their mark on the many things raised in Mann Ki Baat.
Cleanliness, road safety, non-vegetarian India and a selfie with daughters have been used by the media in innovative ways to transform it into a mission.
Had your cooperation not been there, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
To tell the truth, I have no secrets.
It becomes easier to understand anyone until the old ages in our lives do not distinguish.
Sometimes, we talk about the gap between the elders in the family and those in the aging age.
In fact, it is rare to talk to most adults.
I have always been trying to interact with the youth through exclusive programmes or social media.
I am always trying to learn from what they do or what they think.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I am trying to give a lot of importance to the efforts of the youth.
But I believe that there is no time for the youth to waste and this thing helps the younger generation to create more innovations because they want to finish things quickly.
It seems to us that today's youngsters are more talented and think about big things.
Well, let them seek greater dreams and achieve greater successes.
Some say that the younger generation wants to do many things at the same time.
I'm asking, what can this be wrong
Scientists are doing a lot of work at the same time.
If we look around us, be it social entrepreneurship, start-ups, sports and other sectors, youth who are transforming the society.
These youngsters are asking questions and they are capable of dreaming.
If we make the minds of the youth on earth, if we provide an independent environment to shape them then we can bring a positive change in the country and they are doing it.
My dear countrymen, Vinita ji from Gurugram to MyGov, in Mann Ki Baat, I urge you to talk about the Constitution Day on November 26th.
And he added that this day is special because we are going to set foot on the 70th year of our adoption of our Constitution.
Vinita ji, thanks to your advice.
Yeah, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
This is a day when we remember the great men who gave us the Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1949.
It took two years, 11 months and 17 days for the Constituent Assembly to complete this constitutional task.
Just imagine, within three years, these gentlemen have given us such a broad and deep constitutional legislation.
The rapid pace with which they have enacted the Constitution is still an example of time management and productivity.
We also inspire to complete our responsibilities in a time bound manner.
The salient features of our Constitution are the detailed description of rights and duties.
It is a memorable occasion for the youth to enhance awareness of the Constitution and link them to various aspects of the Constitution.
As a Republic in 2020, we will complete 70 years of our independence in 2022.
Come, let us all take the values of our Constitution forward and ensure peace, development and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, you should not forget the contribution of that great personality who was at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
That gentleman is an admirer.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His Mahaparinirvana Diwas is the 6th of December i. e.
I pay my homage to Baba Saheb on behalf of all the countrymen, and he gave the right to live with dignity of millions of Indians.
Democracy is blended with the nature of Baba Saheb and Indias democratic values are not imported from outside, he added.
What is democracy and what is a parliamentary system is not a new thing for India.
Once again my heartfelt condolences to Baba Saheb.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji was celebrated and next year in 2019, we will celebrate his 550th birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Dev ji always thought of human welfare.
He always showed the path of equality, service, compassion and brotherhood in the society.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have been requested to observe this festival very well.
Similarly, the 550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
And a train will be constructed on the path of holy places associated with Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
Now when I participated in a meeting related to it, I was reminded of Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
The Gurudwara suffered a major impact during the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat.
But the renovation of the state government in collaboration with those circles is still an example.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat, we will meet again in the next episode of Mann Ki Baat and for the first time I have got the opportunity to reveal the sentiments behind Mann Ki Baat for the first time.
The more I engage with you, the more our journey will be deeper, it will be a pleasure for all.
The question of what I got from Mann Ki Baat can be raised in some people's minds.
Today, I would like to tell you that through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, one of these things touches my heart and when all the family members sit together and listen to Mann Ki Baat, our family leader sits with us and shares our concerns with us.
Your comforts, my joys.
Your expectations, my expectations.
Your desires are anointings, my desires are anointings.
Come, let us take this journey further.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
October 31 is the birth anniversary of our great Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This year, the youth of the country are ready to participate in the "Run for Unity" programme.
Currently, the weather is like this.
Therefore, I urge a large number of people to participate in the movement of unity.
About six months before independence, on January 27, 1947, the world-famous International Journal "Time" was released on its front page with the photograph of Sardar Patel.
The newspaper also published a map of India in its headline
But that map doesn't look like it's still there.
In that map, India appeared to be a piece of bit.
It consisted of more than 550 symposiums.
When they left the country, India was contemplating to be different pieces.
The Times commented that India faces various threats such as separation, violence, food shortages, rising prices and power politics.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had said that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel could only unite the country and heal the wounds caused by the people.
The article also describes the other side of the biography of India's iron man.
The article included the manner in which he carried out relief operations during the floods in Ahmedabad by 1920 and his conduct of the Burdoli Satyagraha.
His honesty and determination was so much to place full faith in him, from farmers and workers to industrialists.
Sardar Patel resolved every issue as it was to weave the garb through a single book print and integrate the country.
He ensured that all the ecosystems in the country are connected with a united India.
Whether it is Junagadh, Hyderabad, Thanjavur or Samasthan in Rajasthan, if we see an integrated India then the magnificence and vision of Sardar Patel is the main reason for it.
Built on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, this statue is twice as high as the statue of the freedom fighter of the United States.
This will be the world's tallest statue.
Every Indian will be proud to see the world's tallest statue being built in India.
Sardar Patel, the real son of our soil, will decorate our airspace.
I am confident that this statue, which has made Indian mother India proud, will make every Indian proud.
Because it is natural for every Indian to have a desire to see a statue of unity.
I am confident that this statue will be a place for people across the country.
My dear brothers and sisters, we all celebrated 'Kalaad Badi' yesterday.
I bow down to everyone who is a part of Indias security forces.
I also salute the families of our soldiers.
You must know that today we are celebrating the California Day.
Indian forces today took a foothold in Kashmir and saved the valley from being caught by the occupation.
This incident is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I read an old interview with our respected army officer Sham Manekshaw.
Film Marshal Sham Manekshaw recalled his time when he was a Karnal.
It was during that period that military operations began in Kashmir.
In a meeting at the time, Field Marshal Manekshaw pointed out how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had reprimanded Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir, there should be no delay in sending troops, there should be a quick solution to the problem and Sardar Patel gave him clear instructions.
After that, if our forces flew to Kashmir then we know how our army worked successfully.
The commemoration of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is on 31st October.
Let us pay our respects to Indira Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, who are those who do not want sports
If the youth of our country have these qualifications then our country will not only grow in the field of economic and scientific technology but will also look for pride in the field of sports.
I am delighted to have two recent meetings.
I congratulated them and their determination to break barriers and achieve success will inspire all the people of our country.
Similarly, I got the opportunity to meet the winners of the 2018 Youth Summer Olympics held in Argentina.
You will be aware of the fact that the performance of our youth in the 2018 Youth Summer Olympics has not been reflected so far.
We have won 13 medals in this competition and three medals in the mixed dual segment.
You must imagine that the recent Asian Games showcased the excellent performance of Indian soldiers.
You must have noticed that I have repeatedly referred to the word 'Best or Unprecedented Achievement'.
This is a reality that reflects the progress made in the sports sector of India every day.
India is making new achievements not only in sports but also in numerous sectors.
For instance, I would like to indicate to you the disabled sportsperson Narayan Thakur, who won the Gold in 2018 Asian Games for Persons with Disabilities.
He is a congenital disabled person.
He lost his father when he was only eight years old.
After that, he lived at home for eight years.
After leaving the house, he used to clean Delhi Transport Corporation buses and work in roadside restaurants.
It is Narayan who has won medals on behalf of India in international competitions.
Besides, it should also be noted that the speed at which the Indian sports sector is getting excellent.
Moreover, India has not yet won a medal in the Junior or Senior category in Judo.
But at the Youth Olympics, India's Tapabi Devi won a silver medal and made a historic achievement.
Tababi Devi, 16, belongs to a village in Manipur.
His father is an ordinary worker, a mother and a fisherman.
It's a time when there's no money to buy food.
Despite such a poor condition, his zeal and dedication have not diminished.
He has made a history by winning medals for the country.
The whole world also appreciated the success of this competition.
The World Cup for FIFA 17-year-olds has achieved a record number of eyewitnesses on the ground.
More than 12 lakh sports enthusiasts have seen football competitions in sports in different parts of the country and have given a big boost to the youngsters.
This year too, we have got the opportunity to host the 2018 World Cup men's hockey competition in Bhubaneswar.
The World Cup hockey competition is scheduled to be held from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian will certainly be interested in the hockey competition whether he plays any game or is interested in any game.
In the Hockey Games, India has achieved a record of golden editions.
India has won gold medals in various events and won the World Championships.
India has also produced a lot of good hockey players.
Whenever he quotes a hockey game, he cannot finish it without mentioning our achievements.
Major Diyan Chand, who is regarded as the father of Hockey, is known all over the world.
Further, Indian hockey has a long tradition from Uttam Singh to Dhanrajbul to Leslie Claudius Mohammad Shahid.
Even now, the Indian team is encouraging the younger generation by looking at their hard work and goals.
This is a good opportunity for sports enthusiasts who want to see the most beautiful competition.
Go to Bhubaneswar and encourage the Indian team and every soldier who is playing there.
Odisha has a very historical background and has a cultural heritage as well.
The people of that state are very fond of it.
This is a unique opportunity for sportspersons to visit Odisha.
One can enjoy sports as well along with world famous archaeological places like Konark Sun Temple , Puri Jagannath Temple and Silka Lake .
I convey my best wishes to the participating Indian mens team and assure them that they have the support of 125 crore Indians.
I convey my best wishes to all the teams participating in this competition from different countries of the world.
My dear countrymen, the mood of those who have come forward to serve the society is indeed a source of inspiration and zeal for all the people of the country.
But, in the present era, new generations are enthusiastic and innovative to fulfil their dreams.
I participated in the inauguration of a new portal called "I for Community," which has been launched by my Government and the IT and Electronics Industry of the country to encourage workers to take up social activities and to provide them the opportunity to work in this field.
Their dedication and valour will make every Indian proud.
I am not, the change that we are, from individuals to individuals, has created a new ecosystem for social work in the IT sector.
Some give lessons to older people
Some people dedicate themselves to cleanliness and some others help the farmers.
However, behind whose actions they have no instruments, they have become a motivating force with their determination.
But a person who sits in a wheel chair and learns to play basketbacks can also help the disabled sportspersons who are participating in the wheelchair basket.
This spirit and dedication is a work-framework.
It will make every Indian proud.
I am not-we will certainly inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, while looking at your suggestions to the Mann Ki Baat programme today, the idea of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry was very exciting.
The Mann Ki Baat App has said that the tribal people, their traditions and rituals are an example of nature.
He said that how we can imbibe the traditions of tribals in our lives and achieve sustainable development and learn from such traditions.
I congratulate you all for presenting this issue among the leaders of Manish and Mann Ki Baat.
It will inspire us to know our dignified past and ancient traditions when the entire world, especially the Western countries, is discussing environmental protection and exploring new ways of pursuing a balanced lifestyle.
Our country is also facing the same problem.
But to find solutions, we need to recall our past and understand our traditional riches, especially the way of life of our tribal people.
Living in close cooperation with nature is an integral part of the lives of our tribal people.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees, vegetation and flowers as gods.
Tribals of BHIL reside in central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, peepal and Arjun trees.
The Fischnoi classes living in the desert areas of Rajasthan are guiding us to protect the environment.
In particular, they are prepared to give their lives rather than damage to a tree.
The tribal people of Mishmi region of Arunachal Pradesh are closely associated with the LTTE.
They regard the LTTE as their brothers and sisters.
LTTE is also a forest guard in Nagaland.
The people of Warli in Maharashtra consider the LTTE as their guests and they consider it a reflection of their prosperity as the LTTE is with them.
The Centre's Gol ethnicity considers the LTTE as a direct link to their lives and feels that if the LTTE does not get food, the entire village will be hungry.
Fishermen of Central India also stop fishing in the Kaitan river during the early days of fishing.
They consider the area as a fishing sanctuary and think that due to this belief amongst them, nutritious fish will be available in abundance.
In addition, the tribal people are building their habitats with strong and environment friendly natural commodities.
In some isolated areas of the Nilgiri mountain range of southern India, the Dhodar community is building their habitats only with the products available in the region.
My dear brothers and sisters, this is a testimony to the fact that the tribal people have faith in living very peacefully and harmoniously and if someone attempts to harm or harm their natural resources then they will not hesitate to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that many of our freedom fighters were among the front runners of the tribal community.
No one can forget Lord Birzamunda, who fought hard against British imperialism to defend their forests.
Besides, I have mentioned so far that we can list a lot of tribal societies about how to co-exist with nature and we are very grateful to our tribal people for ensuring that the existing forests and forests of the country remain intact.
Everyone should come forward to express their gratitude.
My dear countrymen, we have mentioned the individuals and organisations that have played a vital role for society in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
However, all these things are not enough, but they have inspired deep feelings in our thoughts to show a new way to work for the society.
A few days ago, I had read about the farmer brothers of Panchayat Kurbachan Singh.
The marriage of the son of the hardworking farmer brother Gurbachan Singh is going to take place.
Kurbachan Singh has specifically told the bride's parents that this marriage should be done in a very simple manner.
There is no need to spend a lot of money on wedding reception or any other matter, he added.
He said it should be regarded as a very ordinary illusion, and suddenly imposed a condition.
He said that the condition is that a female householder will not burn straw and agricultural waste in their fields.
You should think well about the social strength of this idea.
However, it shows how high his quality is, how many families in our society feel that how they solve their personal problems in a way that benefits the entire society.
The family members of Thiruvananthapuram Gurbachan Singh have shown us such an example.
I also read about Kalarmajra village near Naba in Punjab.
Instead of burning the stores, the village of Kalarmajra has been illuminated by farmers following new technologies that mix them with soil.
Congratulations to Gurbachan Singh
Congratulations to the people of Kalarmajra village and to all those who are specially involved in maintaining pollution in their surroundings.
All of you have been the real way forward to take forward the Indian tradition of a healthy lifestyle.
As the ocean is formed by consolidation of small drops of water, every constructive activity is essential to create a good environment.
My dear countrymen, our ancient scriptures also reflect this: O Lord, there must be peace in all three worlds, in all the three worlds, water, air, land, fire, inhalation, medicine, plantations, gardens and deep-rooted works.
Every soul within me and within you, every heart and every magnificent soul must be quiet.
Shanti . Shanti .
Wherever there is talk of world peace, India's name and contribution will be engraved by golden writings.
As far as India is concerned, November 11 this year is important because the First World War was concluded on November 11, a hundred years ago.
With the completion of 100 years of the war, we feel that the catastrophe and human fatalities have been completed for a hundred years.
For India, the First World War is very important.
In fact, we have no direct connection with the war.
However, our soldiers fought bravely in that war and made great sacrifices.
Indian soldiers have also pointed out that Indians are not the victims of war.
Our soldiers have shown their courage and valour in difficult areas and in bad weather.
The only aim was to create peace.
This world knows that there was a large number of deaths and consumptions during the First World War.
There are reports that nearly one crore soldiers and the same innocent people have died.
This has made the entire world feel the importance of peace.
The meaning of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
Today, peace is not only a war but also a need for global cooperation and coordination to address terrorism, climate change, social change and economic development.
The development of the poorest of the poor will be a real example of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-Eastern states have a special significance.
There is no link between the natural beauty of the North-Eastern states - the people of this region are also very talented.
Now the North-Eastern states are famous for their excellent work.
The North-Eastern region has made great strides in organic farming.
In order to promote sustainable food processing, the State of Sikkim received the Golden Prize for the 2018 precious future policy a few days ago.
In addition to this, Sikkim has won the award by putting back the recommendations from 25 countries.
For this, I heartily congratulate the people of Sikkim.
I believe that such festivals will provide an opportunity to fulfil new promises.
Your progress is very important for the progress of the country.
If you develop then this country will also grow.
My best wishes to you all.
