Mann Ki Baat October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
I convey my best wishes to you all for Deepawali.
Deepjournment in the Enemy Landscape.
What a beautiful message.
At present, Deepawali is celebrated across the world.
It is not only the Indians who participate in this festival, but also the government of many countries, the citizens and social organizations of that country celebrate Diwali with great joy.
A similar India is built there.
Friends, There is a special attraction of such tourism in the world.
Our India is such a country where there is a huge opportunity for tourism.
We should strive to promote Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Kong, Bihu. And we should also include people from other states and other countries in this joy.
There are so many festivals in every state and every region, people of other countries are keen to celebrate these festivals.
This is why the role of Indians living outside India is very important for the development of such tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, during the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had decided that I will do something different on the occasion of Diwali.
I had said - Come, let us celebrate the strength of Indian women and their success in this Diwali.
Immediately after seeing, there are numerous inspiring stories in the social media.
Writing Warangal Kodipaka Ramesh, Namo App, My mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took charge of five sons.
Today we have five brothers living in a good life.
My mother is my God.
If you look at all my things, you will find India's Laxmi.
Ramesh ji, I salute your mother.
In a television interview, Mr Khushboo Kanya Bharati Laxmi, the daughter of Bus Conductor and she led the Assam Rifles women's army.
Her daughter is Lakshmi, who is also her power near poet Tiwari ji.
He's proud that his daughter painted a very good picture, and took a very good place in Claute's examination.
Again Megha Jain wrote: A 92 year old woman has been distributing water to the navigators at Gwalior Railway Station for many years.
Megaji, India has been inspired by the humble nature and compassion of Lakshmi.
People shared a lot of stories like this.
You must read, take inspiration and share a few things around you.
My heartfelt condolences to all these Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, Sachi Honnamma, a famous woman poet of the 17th century, wrote a poem in the Kannada language of the 17th century.
This is the feeling that India's Laxmi, whom we are talking about, maybe it's been discussed in the 17th century.
Peninanda Permangandu Himavantu, Penininanda Bhrigu Perchidanunda Jankarayanu Josededu means Himavantu meaning Parvati for her daughter, Rishi Bhrigu for her daughter Lakshmi and Janaka for her daughter Sita.
Our daughters are a strong identity and a bright future for our society through our pride and the noble cause of these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November, 2019, the 550th Birth Anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
The influence of Guru Nanak Devji is spread not only in India but in the entire world.
In many countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters who have completely dedicated their lives to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I will never forget my Gurudwara journey in Vancouver and Tehran.
There is a lot of talk about Shri Guru Nanak Devji that I can share with you but it will take a lot of time for Mann Ki Baat.
He has always placed service on top of everyone.
Guru Nanak Devji believed that selfless service is invaluable.
He fought firmly against the social curse like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji has conveyed his message to the world.
He was one of the most wanderers of his time.
He had visited many places and wherever he had lived, he had won the hearts of all through his simplicity, humility and purity.
Guru Nanak Devji has travelled to many important religious places.
It is said that the famous saint of Assam, Shankardev, was inspired by his ideals.
He traveled to the holy land of Haridder.
During his visit to Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the water problem there.
Videre, Guru Nanak Devji is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb which reminds us of him.
During an auspicious time, Guru Nanak ji travelled north Kashmir and surrounding areas.
This established a strong relationship between Sikh religion followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji had visited Tibet and he was accepted as Guru.
He traveled to Uzbekistan and was also venerable there.
And in a desperate time, he travelled extensively to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He lives in the hearts of millions of people, who followed his teachings with full devotion and are still doing so.
And this journey was organised to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
There, all the ambassadors, along with the Golden Temple philosophy, also got the opportunity to know about Sikh heritage and culture.
He was a great hero who bound the country in unity.
Just like Sardar Patel had the amazing power to unite people, he was able to coordinate with those who had shown ideological differences.
Sardar Patel was closely watching and examining the shortcomings.
He was literally the Man of Detail.
He was well versed in organizational skills.
He was specially skilled in planning and designing strategies.
When one hears or reads about Sardar Saheb's methodology, one gets to know how wonderful it was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country attended the Ahmedabad session of the Congress.
He ensured that no one suffers from water.
He interacted with the farmers and urged them to create Khadi bags.
Look again, for this, the sale of Khadi has increased.
The country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constitution.
He did an important job of ensuring our fundamental rights so that there is no possibility of discrimination based on caste or community.
Friends, We all know that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as India's first Home Minister had done a historic and great job of uniting the segments and territories of the country.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had a special feature that none of his vision would have been observed.
On one hand, his vision was focused on Hyderabad, Junagadh and other states.
So far south Lakshadweep could not escape his goal .
In fact, when we refer to Sardar Patel's efforts, we talk about his role in certain parts of the country.
Like Lakshadweep , for a smaller portion also he played an important role .
Immediately after receiving the news, Sardar Patel took immediate action without delay.
He instructed the brothers of Mudalia , Architect Ramswami Mudaliar and Architect Laxmanswami Mudaliar that they immediately hoisted the national flag along with the residents of Trevkar .
As per his instructions, an immediate evacuation took place and the neighbouring capture of Lakshadweep was overwhelmed.
After this incident, Sardar Patel told the brothers and sisters of Mudali that they should personally ensure that the development of Lakshadweep is possible.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing immensely to the progress of India.
This is also an attractive tourist destination .
I hope you'll roam these beautiful islands and their beaches.
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity built in the memory of Sardar Saheb on 31st October 2018 was dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the world's longest human statue.
In the past, it's twice America's Statue of Liberty.
The longest statue of the world fills every Indian with pride .
Every Indians heads up in self-respect .
You will be happy to know that in one year only 26 lakh tourists had come to see the Statue of Unity .
That is, everyday about eight and a half thousand people took pride in this Statue of Unity.
For Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel the faith and reverence that has been expressed in his heart .
Now there are several attractions like cactus gardens, vegetation gardens, jungle safaris, child nutrition parks, Ekta nurseries and for this the local economy is growing and people are also getting new employment opportunities.
Professional training is also being provided at homestay or at home.
Local people have started cultivating dragon fruits and I am sure this will be the main means for their livelihood.
Friends, For the country, for every state, for the tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a subject of study.
We are witnesses how can a place become a world famous tourist spot within a year , where people from within the country and abroad come .
Transportation system, accommodation, presence of guides, environment friendly systems, each one of them is getting better.
Very big economic development has started and local people are innovating the services of tourists as per their needs .
The government is fulfilling its obligations.
Friends , is there any Indian who would not be proud to know that a few days back the Time Magazine has placed this Statue of Unity in the top 100 tourist spots of the world .
My expectation is that you all will take out some opportunity from your precious time to see this Statue of Unity but I am very keen that every Indian who leaves for tour will go to tour at least fifteen destinations of the country and will spend the night there .
Friends, You are aware of the fact that every year from 2014, 31st October is being celebrated as National Unity Day.
This day conveys the message of unity, integrity and security of our country at all costs.
RAN for Unity is being organised this time.
This will involve all sections of society.
Running is beneficial for both mind and body.
I hope that all of you will participate in the 31st of October - the unity of the country and the goal of keeping your body healthy.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel had tied the country with unity.
This mantra of unity is a reflection of our lives and we should strive to strengthen the mantra of unity at every level, at every level in the diverse country like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious in strengthening the country's unity and concerns.
There are many examples around us that work for this purpose.
But sometimes their words get mixed up with our memories.
Friends, I am reminded of the month of September 2010 when Allahabad High Court had passed a decision regarding the birthplace of Ram.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country, Smt. Indira Devi, was also assassinated on 31st October.
Today, my dear countrymen, if a story is heard in every house, every village, from the east to the west, from the north to the south, from every corner of India, if a story is narrated then it is Swachhata.
Every individual, every family, every village is keen to talk about my joyous experience of cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is a collective effort of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Therefore, the benefits of this scheme are hundred and fifty million Indians.
But there is a joyous and thrilling experience.
I heard you and I want to hear you too.
In such a difficult situation, even in such adversity, it is not a matter of less heroism.
In such a scenario, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country but also conducting Swachh Siachen Campaigns.
There's nothing cold out there.
In such a situation, segregation and management of waste is an important task.
We all know that Siachen is a glacier which is the source of rivers and pure water.
In such a scenario, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan would mean ensuring clean water for those living in low-lying areas, using rivers such as Nubra and Seok.
My dear countrymen, Festival is an occasion that awakens a new consciousness in the lives of all of us.
And in Deepawali, specially some new things are being purchased from the market.
I once told you we tried to buy local goods.
We don't have to go to Tahsil if we get the things we need in our own village.
If you get it, you don't have to go to the district.
The more we try to buy local goods, the more Gandhi 150 will be transformed into a grand festival.
And I always request that we don't have our knife, we should buy something that is made by our Khadi workers.
Even in Deepawali, many people have bought a lot before Diwali but there are people who think that after Diwali, things may be cheaper.
So there'll be a lot of people who still have to buy.
Therefore, with the best wishes of Deepawali, I appeal to you all to come here for local reasons and buy local goods.
Look, can we also play an important role in fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion of Diwali.
We use beggars like everyone in Deepawali.
But for a long time, anonymity causes a fire.
Sometimes he gets hurt.
I request all of you to be careful and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
My best wishes.
Thank you very much.
What the fuck, September 2018
Are there any Indians who dont feel proud of our Armed Forces and the soldiers of our army
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion Indians celebrated Parakram Parv.
We have recalled the fact that in 2016, the Surgical Strike, when our armed forces responded to the persecution of proxy wire against terrorism in our country.
Our Armed Forces had organised exhibitions in different parts of the country so that the lions, particularly the younger generation could feel the strength of our country, how capable we are and how our armed forces can protect our country by putting their lives at stake.
Parakram Parv is a day to showcase the glorious heritage of our Armed Forces to the youth of the country.
It inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme at Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of brave warriors.
It is certain that our armies will give a befitting reply to all those who want to destroy the peace and prosperity of our country.
But with respect and respect, the sovereign power of the country is not insignificant.
India is always committed and committed to maintaining peace and stability.
In the two wars of the 19th century, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace. This is a war that we had nothing to do with.
Our vision has never fallen on any other country.
It was our commitment to Shanti.
A few days ago, on 23rd September, we remembered the brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lancers who freed Haifa from the invaders on the occasion of the centenary of the Haifa War.
It was also a bravery displayed by our soldiers for peacekeeping.
Even today, India is one of the largest number of armed forces in the UN peacekeeping forces.
Over the decades, our brave soldiers have played an important role in the cause of peace and order in the entire world by wearing blue helmet.
My dear countrymen, our air power is incomparable.
During the Republic Day celebrations, it is the Fly Past that awaits the keen interest of the public in the field of distress, which showcases the unprecedented architecture and strength of our Air Force.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
In 1947, when the Pakistani invaders launched an unprecedented attack, the air force ensured that the Indian Army and the combat equipment reached the battlefield in time to avoid the invaders.
The Air Force also responded to the war in 1985.
Who doesn't know about Bangladesh's Bangladesh war in 1971
In 1999, the Air Force played an important role in liberating Kargil from the intruders.
The Air Force deployed them in Tiger Hills by continuously bombing the enemy base.
The entire nation is grateful to them for the significant role played by the Air Force in the rescue and rescue operations.
The contribution of the Air Force in combating natural calamities like storms, storms, floods or terrible earthquakes is exemplary.
The Air Force has set an example to ensure the equality of women and men in the country and has opened the doors of each of its departments to the daughters of the country.
Now the Air Force is offering the opportunity to select the options of Short Service Commission as well as the Permanent Commission which I had announced on the 15th of August this year from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
India can proudly say that the Indian Armed Forces have not only male power but also women power.
The whole country was worried about how to save her.
You must know that Abhilash Tomy is a fearless, courageous and brave soldier of the Navy.
The first Indian to embark on a small boat without any modern technology was travelling around the world.
For 80 days, while participating in the Golden Globe Race Competition in the South of the Indian Ocean, there was a terrible seastorm in the hurricane.
With such a terrible danger, she said to me that she would do something like this again...
I pray for the speedy recovery of Abhilash Tomy and hope that his courage, valour and determination will inspire the youth of our country.
My dear countrymen, children also know the importance of 2nd October.
This year has a special significance.
We are going to celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in the next two years.
The thoughts and thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have reached the world today.
Mankind like Dr Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandela have gained strength from Gandhijis vision and have struggled for equal rights and dignity of the nation.
In today's Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to discuss with you about one more important work of revered Bapu which all the countrymen need to know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some thoughts as a constructive programme.
Later, when the freedom struggle was intensified in 1956, Gandhiji had revised his thoughts.
The venerable Bapu imbibed his thoughts before the people of the country regarding the rights of the farmers, the people of the villages and the labourers, to protect the rights of the brothers, to promote transparency and education, which is also called the Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a public communicator.
Meeting with the people, the specialty of Bapu ji, who adopted the people, was in his nature.
This has been the most valuable feature of Mahatma Gandhi's personality.
He made the nation realize that they are important and essential for the development of the country.
He transformed this realisation into a mass movement that was his greatest contribution to the freedom struggle.
Every section of the society, every section of the society had dedicated themselves to the cause of Mahatma Gandhi during the freedom struggle.
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra, which is known as Gandhijis magic.
Gandhiji had said - I am talking to you about such a trick. Remember my thoughts whenever you have doubts, whenever you feel arrogant or arrogant.
Remember the face of the poorest and the weakest person you have ever seen and ask yourself questions: the steps you are thinking of will be of great use to that person.
Does it mean that crores of people who are hungry and unhappy will get the heavens
Only then will you see that your doubts have been cleared and pride has been circulated.
My dear countrymen, one of Gandhiji's strategies is still equally important.
Today, the economic power and purchasing power of the country's rising middle class are emerging.
My happiness will be multiplied if it benefits the poor.
Keeping this in mind the strategies of Gandhiji, whenever we buy something, whenever we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we must keep in mind that every purchase of our countrymen is good and every one of our countrymen who sweat in the production of goods, those who have invested, those who have harnessed their talents should get some benefit.
I believe that a small step by you people can bring about a big change in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
Similarly, today we may feel that we can contribute to the economic progress of our country, to the economic empowerment of our country, to provide the power to fight poverty to the poor.
And I believe that this is the true patriotism of today's era, this is the tribute to revered Bapu's work.
Think of buying Khadi and Handicrafts on special occasions.
Two days later, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri Ji with revered Bapu.
Shastri ji's name is immensely a tribute to the people of India.
His gentle personality always fills the hearts of every countrymen with pride.
The specialty of Lal Bahadur Shastri was that he looked very soft from outside, but he was firm in his heart.
The mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan was the mantra of his great personality.
During the short span of nearly one and a half years, he had given the mantra to scale the heights of the achievements of the youth and the farmers of the country, which is the result of his selfless penance towards the nation.
Millions of people have participated in this mission and I am also fortunate to donate Swachhta Shram with children at the Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to that school, the foundation of which was laid by the venerable father himself.
School children, college students, NCC, NSS, Youth Organisations, Media Groups, Corporate Growth have donated Swachhata Labour in large numbers.
I convey my sincere congratulations to all the Swachhata-loving countrymen for this.
Let's hear a phone call, "Greetings, my name is Shaitan Singh.
I especially thank you for your phone call.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a success story not only in the country but all over the world.
This time India is hosting the worlds largest Swachhata Convention - Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
The Swachhta Ministry officials from all over the world and experts from all over the world will come and share their experiences and practices on Swachhata.
It is essential for the freedom, peace and justice of the deprived, the persecuted and the deprived.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on 12th October, 2017.
25 years of NHRC will be completed in a few days.
The NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also helped in increasing self-respect.
Our beloved leader, former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee had clearly stated that human rights do not have any foreign idea.
Our National Human Rights Commission symbolizes the principles of Vedic times, "Bhavantu Sukhinah".
NHRC has generated widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in curbing its misuse.
During the twenty-five year visit, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
I think it's very optimistic for a healthy society, democratic values.
Now 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been set up at the national level.
All these great men have inspired us, we salute them.
This year too, we have tried to organize the Run for Unity in our village, city, metropolitan cities.
Run for unity is the right way to remember Sardar Saheb because he has worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge you all to strengthen this endeavour to unite every section of the society, every section of the society through the "Run for Unity" on 31st October and that will be his due respect.
My dear countrymen, Navratri, Durga Puja, Vijaya Dashmi, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all of you for all these holy festivals.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today the entire country is celebrating Rakhibandhan festival.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious occasion.
This festival of Rakhibandhan symbolizes the love and faith of sisters and brothers.
For centuries, this festival is a great example of social well-being.
There are several such events in the history of the country, when it has been seen how two states, people of different religions have been bound by belief.
A few days later, Janmashtami.
The winds of the sky will be heard from the winds of Hathi Horse Pal Ki Jai Kanhaiya Lal Ki and Govinda.
It's a different joy to enjoy this joy with Krishna's colour.
Children must have started organizing Dahi-Handi in different parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra.
I am grateful to Chinmayee for taking this into account.
Friends, Apart from Rakhibandhan, Shravan Purnima is celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
I congratulate all those people who have been working towards preserving, taking forward and delivering people to this great heritage.
Every language has its own importance.
Sanskrit language and literature have a vast treasure of wisdom that can be used in every sphere of life.
Whether it is science or technology, agriculture or health, archaeology or architecture or be it management or be it environment or be it science or be it environment or be it global warming
You will be happy to know that today all the people of Mattu village of Shivamoga district of Karnataka have chosen Sanskrit as the medium of dialogue.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language that can create eternal words.
We use English quotations, sometimes Shayari etc. to weigh something.
But those who are familiar with the well-defined words of Sanskrit, they know that how few words can be explained through these well-defined words of explanation.
That is, if a guru gives a letter to his disciple, there is no such thing in the world that can pay the disciple Guru's debt.
On the occasion of Teachers Day, we always remember the great philosopher and former President of India, Bharat Ratna, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.
Teachers Day is celebrated across the country on his birth anniversary.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day and remember his dedication towards science, education and students with reverence.
My dear countrymen, our farmer brothers and sisters, who have worked hard for the welfare of the people, have received the news of the rainy season.
Just a few days ago, we saw how the floods caused a lot of distress to the people of Kerala.
In such a difficult situation, the entire country has come to Kerala.
I convey my deepest condolences to all those families who have lost their loved ones in this calamity.
I would like to assure all the bereaved families that 125 crore Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with you on this unfortunate day.
I pray that those who have suffered this natural calamity at the earliest, recover quickly.
I firmly believe that Kerala's public life will soon become normal with indomitable zeal and courage.
The way disaster destroys people's lives is very unfortunate, but on this very day we also realize the religion of humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, every person is doing his best to ensure that the areas where disasters are posed, be it Kerala or any district or region of India, the lives of the people of that place are naturally transformed.
People of all ages and people associated with all kinds of work are helping themselves.
Everyone is wondering how the sufferings of the people of Kerala can be shared with them.
We all know that the Armed Forces are the heroes of the rescue operations in Kerala.
They have taken all measures to save the flood affected people.
Air Force, Navy or Army, BS-F, CI-S-F, RA-F have been forced to carry out rescue and relief operations.
I would like to particularly mention the hard work of the NDRF personnel.
The way they have worked in combating these threats, they acknowledge special appreciation.
The power of NDRF, its commitment and its ability to make the situation sustainable, has created a reverence seat in the minds of all the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, while reading the suggestions sent for Mann Ki Baat this time, I have seen that most of the people have written about it, it is our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
From Ghaziabad to Kirti, from Sonipat to Soti Baat, brother of Kerala Praveen, from West Bengal to Dr. Swapan Banerjee, from Katihar in Bihar to Akhilesh Pandey, innumerable people have requested me to mention the various aspects of the life of Atal ji in Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov.
On the 16th of August, the people of the country and the world have reported the passing away of Atal ji.
He was a leader who had quit the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago and had gone far from active politics in the last ten years.
He wouldn't have noticed the news.
The affection, reverence and grief that everyone showed for Atal ji is a man of his great personality.
This country will always be grateful to Atal ji for bringing good governance into the mainstream.
Today, I would like to tell you about one more example of Atal ji's immense personality: the Political Cultural Cultural which he has tried to bring about changes in the Political Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Cultural Culture.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the Second Amendment Regulation, 2003.
This amendment brings about two important changes in the politics of our country.
The first is to limit the cabinet of States to fifteen percent of the total assembly seats.
Atal ji brought about a transformation in this system which helps in saving money and wealth, efficiency and efficiency.
Atal ji was the only Doordarshan who transformed the situation and created a healthy and smooth system in politics.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In 2001, Atal ji put the time for presenting the budget at 11.
One more freedom is through the creation of the Indian Flag Code.
It is from 2001, which enables the universal erosion of the tricolor.
The common Indians get the opportunity to hoist the National Flag.
This is how he brought our beloved Tiranga to the people.
You have seen how Atal ji has brought about a change in the voting process and has strengthened the country with the bold steps taken by the people's representatives.
My dear countrymen, whenever there are discussions about the Parliament today, there is talk of disruptions and housing, but when something good happens then there is no discussion about it.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament concluded a few days ago.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and that of Rajya Sabha was 74.
As a result, Lok Sabha has passed 21 bills and Rajya Sabha 14 bills, all MPs have tried to make the most useful by abandoning party interests.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament will be remembered for social justice and youth.
Several important bills have been passed for the betterment of the youth and backward classes in the Session.
You all are aware of the fact that for decades, OBC commissions like the SC  ST Commission were being formed.
In order to ensure backward class rights, the country has fulfilled this resolution of the OBC Commission and has given this institution a constitutional right.
This will help in achieving the objectives of social justice successfully.
The session also saw the passage of the Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will further protect the interests of the people of SC and ST category.
At the same time, it will protect the criminals from atrocities and enhance their confidence.
No civil society can injustice the women of the country.
The perpetrators of this crime will be punished for a minimum of 10 years, for raping girls under the age of 12 years.
Just a few days ago, you might have read in the newspapers that a court in Mandsoor in Madhya Pradesh has heard the punishment of two convicts for raping a navalikala after just two months of hearing.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh sentenced the culprits to death after hearing only five days.
A court in Rajasthan has given such a speedy verdict.
The Act will play a crucial role in resolving cases of crime against women and girls.
Financial progress is incomplete without social change.
The Third Talaq Bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha, although it was not possible to pass in the Rajya Sabha, I would like to assure Muslim women that the entire nation stands with all the strengths to ensure justice for them.
When we come forward to protect the country's interests, we can bring about a change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the deprived and the deprived.
In this Monsoon Session, all of us have come together to set an example.
I sincerely thank all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, this time the eyes of millions and millions of people are committed to the Asian Games organized in Jakarta.
Every morning, an Indian sportsperson has won a medal in the newspapers, on television, on social media.
The Asian Games are still on.
I congratulate all those who have won medals for the country.
I convey my best wishes to all those who are still in the race.
Indias athletes, especially Shooting and Wrestling, are performing well and our athletes are bringing medals in the games that we have not done well before, like Wushu and Rowing.
This is not just a medal, it is a proof of the courage and dreams of Indian sports and Indian competitors to touch the sky.
The number of our daughters in the list of medal winners for the country is a positive one.
Some of the youngsters who have won medals are 15-16 years old.
It is also a good sign that many of the players who have won medals have come out of unforgettable villages and humiliation and have achieved this by working hard.
On 29th August, we will celebrate National Sports Day. On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all sports enthusiasts and also pay my tributes to the great sportsperson of Haqi.
I appeal to all the citizens of the country to sports and pay attention to your fitness because a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
When India fits, India will build a bright future.
Once again, I congratulate the medal winners of the Asian Games and convey my best wishes to the rest of the players.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple at Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this unforgettable blend of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone was surprised to see the ueen Ki Bao of the 11th century at Patan in Gujarat.
An engineering laboratory along the Indian soil.
There are many engineers in India who have imagined the unimaginable and have set an example in the engineering world.
There are gems in the heritage of our great engineers, whose work still surprises the people.
This is Bharat Ratna Dr.
In that part of the country, he remembered the rest of the country with great respect and respect.
The 15th September was celebrated as "Engineers Day" in his memory.
Following his footsteps, the engineers of our country have made their own identity in the eastern world.
Speaking of the unprecedented achievements of the engineering world, I recall the fact that in 2001, Gujarat's Kutch had witnessed a terrible earthquake.
He was joking at me, look at this house.
Kutch is called Bhunga.
My house saw three earthquakes.
He was saying this thing with pride, and I feel that even a long time ago, our engineers used to build houses by judging the local environment and the situation, thereby protecting the people.
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we will have to think about the future and organize workshops at different places.
We have to think whether we should learn new things in the changing times
You have to teach
The world is fighting natural calamities.
What will be the new use of structural engineering here
What's his course
What should students teach
I convey my best wishes to you all for this thing.
We'll talk again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
It stimulates human thought.
You must have seen on TV that a team of 12 adolescent football players and their coaches went to a cave in Thailand.
It's usually a few hours to go there and get out of there.
But on that day, Bhagyadevi had a different wish.
When they entered the cave, there was a lot of water in the mouth of the cave due to heavy rains.
Efforts are being made to know where the adolescents are, where they are, how they can be brought out.
But I'd like to see this whole thing in a different way.
The government, the parents of the children, the family members, the media and the citizens of the country have shown a remarkable behaviour of peace and patience.
Everyone joined this mission in a team.
I think it is a matter of learning and self-confidence.
My parents didn't bother or mother didn't drop the water.
Everyone's patience, restraint, the peaceful use of the entire society are really educational issues for us.
In this case, a soldier from the Thailand Navy had to die.
The entire world was surprised to know that despite such a terrible situation, the rescuers were brave and patient in the dark cave.
This shows that when people are united, there are wonderful things.
It is necessary that we concentrate on our goals and work for them in a calm mind.
A few days back, our country's popular poet Neeraj ji passed away.
The salient features of the poet's silence were hope, confidence, determination and confidence.
All the words of poet Niraj can inspire all our Indians.
He wrote, The darkness will go as long as the thunderbolt rises, the darkness will go as far as the lightnings are lighted.
The months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth.
This is because this is the time when Peak Session for colleges.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam leave school and go to college.
During the month of February and March, examinations, uestions and Answeries were written, enjoying the holidays of April and May, the results were spent on deciding the future lifestyle and career choices.
The month of July is the month when the youth takes a new path in their lives, when the focus shifts from 'Kochen' to 'Kote off'.
The focus of the students goes from Home to Hostel.
Students enter the umbrella of Professors from the umbrella of Perents.
I believe that my young friends are very enthusiastic and happy about the auspicious occasion of college life.
For the first time, getting out of the house, going out of the village, getting out of a safe environment, we have to show ourselves.
All these youngsters have left their homes and moved their lives on a new path.
There is no way out of books, we have to study, but we have to keep on looking for new things.
Old friends are precious.
The youngsters who have left their homes and have gone out to study somewhere else should discover that place, the people there know about language and culture.
My best wishes to all the youngsters for starting a new chapter.
Her dad's lived up to the family by dumping dung.
I congratulate Hope for this success in that situation.
There are so many families who have shown their hard work and focus in adverse conditions that inspire all of us.
Like Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father is the driver of DTC, or Kolkata Abhay Gupta, who studied under the street lights from footpath, among them are Afreen Shaikh, the daughter of Ahmedabad's daughter Auto Chala, the daughter of a school-held driver of Nagpur, Kartik, son of Chaukidar of Haryana or Ramesh Sahu, son of brick-head labourer of Jharkhand.
Spinal Mascular Atopsy, a disabled girl from Gurgao, was born in Anushka Panda, who had achieved success in ensuring that the world was conscious of hereditary diseases.
We will get such examples when we look around.
Any good thing in any part of the country gives me strength and inspiration.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I saw a news in which it was written, Two youngsters have succeeded in fulfilling the dream of Modi.
After reading the news, I came to know how our youth is trying to bring about a change in the lives of the common man through technology smart and creative usage.
Once I had appealed to Indian youth in the city of San Jose, USA to think about how to use their talent for India and do something out of time.
I had requested to convert brain drain into brain gain.
Two IITs of Rae Bareli, Professional Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Bajpayee have made an innovative effort by acknowledging my challenge.
Using their professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together created a smart village app.
This app will not only connect the people of the village with the entire world but will also provide information and news on their mobile phones.
The app will provide a village telephone directory, news section, events list, health centers, information centers etc.
The FACT Rate between the Kisans is also very useful for the farmers and the FACT is being marketed for selling their produce.
Santosh ji, thank you very much for your phone
Indeed, Pandharpur's pilgrimage is a unique festival.
Friends, On the eleventh of the eighteenth month, which was on 23rd July this year, Pandharpur's pilgrimage to Pandharpur was celebrated with great fanfare.
Pandharpur is a sacred city of Kolapur district of Maharashtra.
The padukas of monks like Sant Gyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram were kept in the palanquin and dancing in the name of Lord Vithal was dancing towards Pandharpur.
Bhagwan Bitthal, also known as Bithoba or Pandurang, used to reach there for the darshan of the devotees.
He protected the poor, the helpless and the oppressed.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana have immense respect and devotion towards the Lord.
You visit the Beethoba Temple in Pandharpur, there is a different feeling of importance, beauty and spiritual joy.
My request to the audience of Mann Ki Baat is that if the opportunity comes, you will certainly get the experience of pilgrimage to Pandharpur.
Innumerable monks like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram are still teaching people in Maharashtra.
We get the advice of goodwill, love and fraternity from them in words like 'Verood' or 'Awang'.
We have got this mantra from them that society can fight against blind faith.
This has guided the society at the right time and has ensured that the old evils of the society are removed and the people have brought compassion, equality and goodness.
Just like this was Lokmanya Tilak who had made a deep impression on many Indians.
We remember Tilak ji on his birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was brave and self-confident.
He had the ability and intelligence to mislead the British rulers.
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he was accused of treason for three-three times in twenty years.
I would like to tell you about a special incident related to the statues of Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad.
In October, 1916, when Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, I imagine that more than 40,000 people had gathered to welcome him 100 years ago.
Vallabhbhai Patel, as mayor of City Corporation, decided to set up a memorial to His Majesty Tilak at Victoria Garden, the ueen of Britain.
Normally, the British rulers were very dissatisfied with this and the Collector repeatedly proposed to build a memorial called Smaru Hella.
But Sardar Saheb is Sardar Saheb, he will resign if required, but he will release the statue of Lokmanya Tilak.
Finally, the statue of Sardar Patel was constructed and the statue was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February, 1929.
Revered Bapu had said at the Great Inauguration Ceremony that Ahmedabad was not only the Mayor of the Cultural Centre but also the power that enabled him to establish the statue of Tilak.
My dear countrymen, one of the special features of the Statue that Sardar Patel had established here is the presence of Lokmanya Tilak ji in Chair, under which this statue says, Swaraj is my birthright.
It sounded like God's instructions to the English.
The first public Ganesh Festival started with the initiative of Lokmanya Tilak.
The universal Ganesh Festival, traditionally enriched in honour and organisation, became an effective medium for social awakening, unity, equality and equanimity.
Ganesh Mandap is now visible on the streets of any city.
All the families of the street organized the Ganesh Festival.
This is an unprecedented opportunity for our youth to gain immense powers like organisation and leadership and develop them within themselves.
My dear countrymen, I have said this thing in the last few days, I once again recall Lokmanya Tilak ji, let us celebrate Ganesh Utsav with Dhammadham but let us celebrate the festival of 'Parivas-Bandhab'.
Ganesh ji's idols, his decorations and worshipping objects must be environment friendly.
He had dedicated his life so that the countrymen could breathe in a free India.
I'm talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
There is a young man in India who will not be inspired by this poem Sarforshi whether he will be inspired by Haydekhana Hai Jor Kitna Baju-e-Katil May or May, the lines of this poem inspired the talents like Ashfaq Khan, Bhagwat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azad's bravery and independence inspired many youngsters.
Azad preserved his life, but he never gave his head to the foreign rule.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again I salute the two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, in the Junior 2019 World Athletics Championship held in Finland, India's brave daughter Hima Das won a gold medal in the 400m race.
Ekta Bhayan, one of the daughters of the country, e-mailed me from Indonesia in response to my letter, and is now preparing for the Asian Games.
Ekta is being written on e-mail: Whenever Mahendra was in the life of an athlete, he was in a hurry and I was proud that I had done it.
Ekta, we all are proud of you.
His achievements are remarkable because of the fact that he has made his challenge a medium of success.
On the road accident in 2003, unity in the bottom of the body of a terrible terrifying territory fell apart, but she did not lose courage and made herself strong and reached her destination.
I salute Ekta Bhawan ji, Yogesh Katunia ji and Sundar Singh ji for their courage and struggle.
Please come forward, play and progress.
My dear countrymen, the months of August are filled with events of history and festivals but sometimes diseases also enter the house due to weather.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for your good health, for this month of August inspired by patriotism and for the several festivals that have been going on for centuries.
Mann Ki Baat will be reunited.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, once again, on this occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I am fortunate to be face to face with you all.
A few days ago, a historic cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You must have realized that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistan's first international test match and it is a matter of pride for all Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
The two sides demonstrated excellent sporting talent in the match.
Rasheed Khan from Afghanistan played a very good role in IPL this year. And I remember the President of Afghanistan, Shri Ashraf Ghani, tagged me on his twitter: People of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I also thank our Indian friends who have created a platform for our sportspersons.
Rasheed represented the best of Afghanistan, the Prime Minister said.
He is a resource in the cricket world and he also wrote with a little joke - No, I don't want to give it to anyone.
This match will be remembered for all of us.
Though it was the first match, it's natural to remember, but I'll remember the match for one more thing.
The Indian team has done something that is unprecedented throughout the world.
When the Indian team took the trophy, a winning team did what it could.
At the time of taking the trophy, the Afghanistan team invites those who are playing the international match for the first time, and photograph them together.
We can feel the sportsman spirit and sportsmanship from this thing.
Sports is the best way to unite society and to find out the talent of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan teams
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, we witnessed an unprecedented sight of Yoga on 4th June.
Whether it is the Brazil-Auropean Parliament, the United Nations Headquarters at New York, the Japanese Navy fighters, or the Japanese Navy fighters, people are witnessing Yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic programme of Yoga has been organised and I have been told that women have also done the demonstration of several seats.
India and China's armed forces have practiced Yoga together on the high ice cap of Ladakh.
If people from all over the world participate in the Yoga Day celebrations with such enthusiasm, then why should it not be encouraging in India
Our Air Warriors performed Yogasana at a height of 15,000 feet from the ground in the middle of the sky.
It was a sight to see, they were not sitting in the airplane, they were drifting into the air.
Schools, colleges, offices, parks, high houses, playgrounds, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
A panorama of Ahmedabad was spectacular, where about 750 physically challenged brothers and sisters have created a record by practicing Yoga at one place.
I believe that today Yoga is doing one-wellness, revolution.
An effort is being made to make wellness through Yoga. I hope that it will progress.
Gradually, more and more people will choose Yoga as part of their lives.
Thank you for your phone.
Do you know why Kabirdas ji had gone to this memorial
He is the one who knows and understands the sorrows of others.
He who doesn't understand the sufferings of others, he's cruel.
Kabir Das ji gave a special emphasis on social coordination.
Bari Koi Nehi, Joe Mann Ki Baat.
Give me pulses, please.
Kabirdas ji has said, "Whatever kindness is religion, which is greed is sin.
Her invaluable message has been similarly impressed even today. Now when we talk about Saint Kabir Das Ji, we remember her duality.
This is Guru's greatness and one such Guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev.
The people who have shown the path of truth to millions and millions of people have been inspiring the people from the past.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2019.
There is another history associated with Punjab.
The horrific events in Jallianwala Bagh that are going to be completed in 2019, the event that shameed humanity.
On April 13, 1919, someone had forgotten the dark day when fire broke out on innocent, innocent and innocent people crossing all limits of cruelty by misusing power.
This tragedy is about to complete 100 years, but we will always remember the eternal message that has been given to this incident, it is that no problem can be solved through violence and abuse.
Peace, non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice always win.
My dear countrymen, Shri Raman Kumar from Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App in which Dr.
Raman ji, thank you very much at first
It is a pleasure to see your interest in the history of India.
You know, yesterday, June 23, 2019, Dr.
Perhaps very few people know that in 1937, Dr.
At the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had spoken in Bengali at Kolkata University Convention.
That was the first example when during the British regime, a person was speaking in Bengali at the Convocation of Kolkata University.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was India's first Industrial Minister and in a sense, India's entrepreneurship and in a holistic way laid a strong foundation for India's progress.
In 1948, India's first entrepreneurship was based on her vision and plan.
Dr.
It was the dream of Mukherjee that India will be self-reliant, better and prosperous in every sector of the industry.
He wanted India to build a bigger industry and also focus on MSMEs, cotton, textiles and cottage industries.
For the proper development of Cottage Industries and Small Scale Industries, he proposed to set up Finance and Organisation Set-ups, for the All India Radio from 1948 to 1950.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was a great contributor.
He was very passionate about the progress of West Bengal.
Because of his thoughts, consciousness and activity, a part of West Bengal has been protected and is still a part of India.
Come, let us remember this message of unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and let us make every effort to take India forward through harmony and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, for the last few weeks, I had the opportunity to talk to all those people who have benefited from various schemes of the government through video calls.
I got the opportunity to get away from the files and listen directly to the people.
People have said that their resolutions, their happiness and sadness, their perceptions.
I believe that this was not just a government function with me, but it was a different learning experience and what could be more satisfactory than the happiness that I have seen in the public at this time
When I used to hear the words of a common man, his simple words, his emotions, his feelings, he used to touch the heart.
I was told that in far-flung villages, girls have been helping in creating passports for the elderly and the elderly from the common service centre.
A sister from Chhattisgarh has been collecting attached to ice creams, lakhs of youngsters from Jharkhand have been supplying affordable medicines to nearby villages while running Jan Aushadhi system.
The youngsters in West Bengal who were pursuing their jobs two-three years ago, now they are successfully not only driving their businesses but also providing jobs to 10-15 people.
Students from schools in Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important topics like West Management in the Tinkering Lab of the school at a young age.
There were innumerable stories of experiences and there was no corner of the country from where there was no message of success.
I am glad that the success of the government in the entire event has given me the strength to the success of the people, the strength of the country's tenth, the strength of the dream of 'New India' and the strength of the resolve.
There are some individuals in the society, unless they talk pessimistically, do not talk about disappointment, do not work for unbelief, do not look for a broken path instead.
In such a scenario, when people talk about new hopes, new zeal and accomplishments of their lives then their success is not deserved by the government.
The story of a small girl from a remote village also inspires 125 crore people.
I am grateful to my countrymen.
You have connected 40-50 lakh people with this video bridge and have given me new energy.
I once again express my gratitude to you.
I have also felt this aroma of good.
In fact, the corporate professionals of Bangalore, IT engineers have jointly created a simple prosperity trust and have activated this trust to double the farmers income.
Through this trust, they have been connected to the farmers, have constructed the schemes and have been making efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
All these trainings are being imparted to the farmer brothers and sisters of professionals, engineers and technologists through this Trust, how to do organic farming with new methods of farming and how to grow crops along with other crops.
Earlier, those farmers who were dependent on just crops that would not have been able to afford crops and profits, today they are not only producing crops but also making good profits by proper marketing of crops through this trust.
The crops will be better only when the seeds of good species are used and Seed Banks have been created separately for this.
Women took care of this Seed Bank and women were also associated with it.
My dear countrymen, the GST system is going to complete one year.
The dream of One Nation One Tax has been realised today.
One Nation One Tax Reform: If I had to credit someone for this arrangement then I would like to give credit to the states.
GST is a shining example of cooperative federalism where all the states decided to work together for the welfare of the country and as a result such a massive tax reform has been launched in the country.
Till now, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can proud that the decisions taken so far in the GST Council have been unanimously taken by the individuals of different political views, representatives of different states and states of different priorities.
There were 17 different types of taxes in the country before the GST but after the introduction of this system there is only one tax regime in the country.
After the introduction of GST, check posts have also been discontinued and this has resulted in faster movement of goods and other goods which have not only saved time but also benefitted in logistics sectors.
GST is perhaps the world's largest tax reform system.
In India, such a massive tax reform has been successful because the people of the country have adopted this system and this Jan Shakti has ensured the success of GST.
It is generally believed that such a large-scale reform will take 5 to 7 years for the proper implementation of such a vast population of the country.
However, as a result of the enthusiasm of the honest citizens, the flow of honesty and the people's power, this new tax regime has created its place within a year, has got its status and has been revising itself through an inbuilt system.
This is a big achievement that has been achieved by 125 crore Indians.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
You must have remembered that a team of six women commanders of the Navy had been sailing for the past few months.
I would like to say something about Navika Sagar Parikrama.
The team of six daughters of India has returned to India on May 21, 2019 with more than 250 days of IN-SV Tarini and welcomed them warmly.
Approximately 22,000 nautical distances have been covered across the oceans and some seas.
This is an unnatural phenomenon all over the world.
Last Wednesday, I had got the opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
I once again congratulate these daughters for their adventurous work, for enhancing the dignity of the Navy, for enhancing India's honour and especially for the daughters of India.
You must have seen that in the last few days, new information has been received about Mount Everest-Jai people.
On 16th May, five tribal students of Chandrapur Ashram School, Maharashtra, Manisha Dhrube, Pramesh Ale, Umakanth Madhvi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Sowam have won the highest peaks in the world.
They were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Leh-Ladakh since August 2017.
They were elected in Mission Shaurya.
And they have brightened the name of the country by winning Everest.
I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to the young students of Chandrapur School.
Sixteen year old Shivangi Pathak has won Everest in Nepal as the youngest Indian woman.
The first father-daughter jute won the Everest by the unsuccessful Bajaj and his daughter.
Not only is the young generation winning Everest but on 19th May, the 50th Smt. Sangeeta Behal also won Everest.
There are some climbers in Everest who are not only skilled but also experienced.
This work is not only commendable but is also responsible for cleanliness and environment.
I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to all those brave hearts, especially daughters.
So many people from different fields will come forward to support this thing.
In the context of Fit India, I would like to say that the more we play, the more we play, the more we play the country.
In the Social Media, people are sharing their Fitness Challenge video, they are also tagging others and challenging them.
I believe that this is a very good process and this kind of challenge encourages us to stay fit and fit for others.
My dear countrymen, several times in Mann Ki Baat you have heard something about sports and sportspersons from me.
"Chobi Jadavji, thank you very much for your phone
These games were a part of the summer holidays.
Traditional Games have two parameters.
There's an outdoor and an indoor.
The unity between our diversity is perhaps visible in these sports.
The same game is known by various names.
It was played on the Square Board of 8-8 p.m. with a basket or a basket of basket.
Its name is Atu, Kerala's Pakidakali, Champal in Maharashtra, Dayam in Tamil Nadu and Changpo in Rajasthan.
If people of different states don't know each other's languages, they're right at playing
It's a village-city sport everywhere.
This is also known by various names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Gotibilla or Karabilla.
In Orissa, it's called a shooting place, in Maharashtra it's called Bittidalu.
Traditional sports are such that along with physical capabilities, it helps us to increase our physical thinking, concentration, consciousness and speed.
And these are not just sports but they teach the values of our lives, teach them to set goals, to achieve determination, to build team spirit and help each other.
A few days ago, I was watching that our traditional sports have been included in the training programmes of Business Management for the development of inclusive personality and for the development of interpersonal skills.
At the same time, we are also aware of our culture and traditions.
Some sports make us aware of our society, environment etc.
Now the schools, public, youth should come forward and encourage these sports.
Through Crowd Sourcing, we can build a museum for our heritage sports.
These games can be made videos to show how to play the rules and regulations of the game.
Animation films can also be made so that our new generation can know about these games, play and grow up, my dear countrymen
This time the theme is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I would like to assure you that we will not use polythene, low-grade plastic and we will try to reduce the harmful effect of plastic pollution on our nature, wildlife and our health.
From World Environment Day website weedindia 2018, I urge you all to try and use it in your everyday life.
Loss of life and property have been damaged.
The result of all these changes in the Weather Pattern.
This is what Mahatma Gandhi has said for his entire life.
Today, India is talking about Climate Justice, COP 21 and Paris Agreement, we have united the world through the International Solar Alliance, and behind all these things, we are doing a good job to fulfil the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this surrounding day, we should think about what we can do to make this world cleaner and greener.
How can we move forward on this path, what can we innovate
It's raining.
Now we can plant a record number of trees and it is important not only to plant but also to take care of them till the trees grow.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
All of you remember on June 21st, not just you and me, but the entire world remembers June 21st.
All over the world, 21st June is celebrated as International Day of Yoga and it is unanimously recognized that the preparations for the event began a few months ago.
It is reported that preparations are being made to celebrate 21st June as International Day of Yoga across the world.
Increased courage in Yoga, which always protects us like a father.
Forgiveness creates a mindset as mother feels for her own children, mental peace becomes our everlasting friend.
The subsidies said that by doing yoga regularly, the truth is our children, kindness is our fear, self-confidence, our brotherhood, the world is our bed and knowledge.
When there are such qualities, this Yogi naturally wins all kinds of fears.
Once again, I appeal to all the countrymen to take forward the huge heritage of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
My dear countrymen, today is 27th May, the first Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehrus Tirudhan Diwas.
I salute Panditji.
In the month of May 1857, the people of India had shown their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were roaring against injustice.
Sadly, we have been calling the 1857 incident a rebellion for a long time.
In fact, it wasn't just a small incident, it was an attempt to hurt our self-esteem.
This brave Savarkar was fearless in writing that what had happened in 1857 was not a rebellion but the first fight for freedom.
With Savarkar, the heroes of India House in London celebrated their 50th anniversary celebrations.
He was a worshipper of both weapons and scriptures.
In fact, Veer Savarkar, who was known for his struggle against Bahadur and the British Raj.
But apart from this, he was also an Ojwai poet and a social reformer who always emphasized on harmony and unity.
Our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji has given a wonderful description of Savarkar ji.
Savarkar is taking both poetry and revolution together.
Being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave admirer.
Our daughters, who were once forced to visit every household from the dustbin to the dustbin, today they are learning the work of sewing up the sewers of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters full of hopes and beliefs for a bright future.
These people have shown that if you are determined to do something and you are grateful for it then success can be achieved in all the difficulties and this is not just a sign but you will be able to see it in every corner of the country.
Looking around you, between neighbors and neighbors, you'll see how people are defeating the problem.
You have realized that whenever we go to a tea store, whenever we get satisfaction with tea, there are discussions and analysis with some people.
These discussions are political, social, films, sports, sports and sportspersons, the problems faced by the country, the solutions to this problem should be done in such a way but most of the time this practice is limited to discussions only.
He organised education, health and food for all children coming to school.
He wiped out the darkness of their lives.
TAMO MA GANDHAGAMA: I don't know who this penance is, but I have shown you that D.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and the entire nation.
There will be a lot of incidents that inspire you.
There may be so many incidents.
Come, let us take forward the positive mindset.
It's so hot in June that people wait for rain and hope for the clouds of the sky.
A few moments from today, people will wait for the moon.
The sight of the moon is the emergence of the Spirit.
After a month of fasting at Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a symbol of a bright festival.
I am confident that everybody will celebrate the festival with enthusiasm, especially for the children.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of goodwill in our society.
My best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, thank you all very much.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Recently, Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
71 countries of the world including India participated in this event.
When such a grand event was organised, thousands of sportspersons from all over the world participated in it, imagine how much encouraging environment could be created by it
Our sportspersons also showcase excellent sporting talents and win medals in accordance with the hopes of our people.
Whether it is shooting, wrestling, loading, table tennis or badminton, India has achieved record success.
India has won 66 medals in 26 gold, 20 silver and 20 bronze medals.
This has made every Indian proud.
After the end of the game, when athletes representing India along with medals hoisted the flag and medals on the Vijay Platform and played the national music, then the feeling of happiness, pride and honour is a unique experience.
But I want to tell you what I'm listening to these players.
India's performance at Commonwealth Games was very good at the same time it was very special.
Manika Batra has won medals in all those who have fought in the event.
Manika Batra is the first Indian woman who has brought gold medals to India in her personal Table Tennis.
A 15-year-old Indian shooter, Anish Vanvala, has been the youngest player in India to win the Gold Medal.
Para Power Lifting won medals at Indias only Sachin Tendulkar Commonwealth Games.
This time the Games have won most medals.
Whether it is squash or boxing, loading or shooting, women sportspersons have shown their bravery.
At the end of the badminton, two Indian sportspersons Saina Nehbal and P.
V.
The whole country has seen this game.
The sportspersons from all over the country have come from small towns.
We have reached this place with a lot of constraints.
The goals that they have achieved today, their parents, parents, teachers, coaches, other helpers, schools, school teachers and the environment of the school have played an important role in this lifestyle.
They also have the role of friends who have enhanced the morale of sportspersons in every situation.
Together with the players, I thank them all.
My body is my weapon, my basic substance water, my world is swimming.
Another person, Ruma Devanath wrote in the morning and I feel happy and healthy.
He added that Fitness comes with a smile, and when we are happy, we will laugh.
Smt. Devnath, there is no doubt that happiness is fitness.
Dhubal Butter wrote a picture of his trekking.
Traveling and trekking for me is Fit I India.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that some of the names are also very attractively inspiring our youth for Fit India.
The filmmaker has given a video on Akshaykumar Twitter.
I've seen that video, you'll see, and this video shows him exercising with a wooden skull.
He said that this exercise is very useful for stomach and back muscles.
I believe that this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
You must be preparing.
The entire world has accepted the importance of International Day of Yoga on 21st June.
Now, there is no need to tell anybody in India or the world about the use of Yoga in physical development, mental development and normalization of the mental condition.
You might have seen an animated video that showed me.
The work that a teacher can do is being done through animation. Therefore, I thank the animation makers for doing this work with great care.
My young friends, all of you have come out of the exams and are now thinking about vacations.
I would like to invite you to do a new job today.
I have seen that many youngsters are now spending time learning something new.
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to experience new lifestyles from the papers and computers.
My young friends, for a special internship today, I would like to urge you all to join the three or four Ministries of the Government of India such as Sports, Human Resource Development, Drinking Water Department.
All those who have done a very good job in colleges and universities will be rewarded at the national level and those who have done a very good job will be successfully felicitated.
Once again, I invite the students and the young friends to join the INTERNSHIP.
I hope that our youth will take the lead in Swachhata movement.
I want to know about all your efforts.
You must send your experiences, send story, send photos, send video.
See the India programme regularly, how people from different parts of the country are doing well and how well they are talking about it.
Just a few days ago, I was seeing that some young children from Delhi who are selflessly educating the poor, these youngsters have started an exciting work for the education of the children of Delhi and the children of Slums.
Initially, they explained to the street beggars and children who worked on the streets, they were also involved in the development work.
The programme, launched by 15 children from the slums near Geetha Colony, Delhi, has become a catalyst for two thousand children from 12 locations in the capital today.
Young teachers have been making efforts to change the society by extracting two hours of free time from their daily routine.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of Uttarakhand have set an example of inspiration for the farmers of the country.
They have changed the fate of not only their own people but also of their respective regions.
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, the cultivation of barley, cotton and yav is done.
The farmers did not get the right price for their crops due to hilly areas. However, the farmers of Kopkot Tahsil avoided the loss of their crops directly to the market and took the path of value addition.
They have made biscuits from farm crops and are selling those biscuits.
These farmers have created a government entity in Munnar and have opened the biscuits.
As a result of the efforts of the farmers, the administration has incorporated it into the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit has spread to almost 50 Anganwadi Centres in Bageshwar district, even to Kosani Almora.
This effort of the farmers has not only reached 10-15 lakhs but also provided food to more than 900 families.
My dear countrymen, I have often heard that the war for water will begin in the coming days.
Everyone says so, but don't we have any responsibility
Water conservation is not a new thing for Indians.
It is not a matter of reading books that there is no need to know any particular language.
In the past, our ancestors have shown it.
They gave maximum importance to the importance of every drop of water.
They have developed new ways to save every drop of water.
You will see that in many temples there are water irrigation systems, water conservation systems, water conservation, water conservation, lamp making etc.
Large inscriptions are seen in the temples of Manarkobil, Chiran Mahadevi Kobilpatti and Pudukottai .
Even today, many bouries are known as step wells in the tourism sector, but they are a shining example of the water conservation efforts of our ancestors.
If you go to Rajasthan, you will definitely visit the Chand Bauri of Jodhpur.
This is India's largest and most beautiful bourium, one thing that we have to remember is the largest bourium in an area where there is a severe water scarcity.
Water conservation will be as effective as the time and timelines for water conservation in April, May, June-July.
The MNREGA budget can be used for water conservation.
Several initiatives have been taken in the last three years for water conservation and water conservation.
Around Rs. 32,000 crore has been spent for water conservation and water dams in the MNREGA budget every year.
In 2017-18, I can say that out of 64 thousand crore rupees, 55 or 35 thousand crore has been spent on water conservation.
In the last three years, this water conservation and water conservation system has benefitted about 150 lakh hectares of agriculture.
This work has been done with the hard work of about 40-45 villages.
I will say, April, May, June, July and coming, we can take a lot of responsibility for water conservation and water conservation in the coming days, we can take some plans and do something.
My dear countrymen, whenever Mann Ki Baat happens, there are several news reports, letters and phone calls from all around the country.
But the philosophy of survival with the Nobel Prize winners, pacefully, beauty and integrity of Rabindranath Tagore does not know anything about it.
Please tell us about this in Mann Ki Baat so that the common man knows it.
He had a unique impression on everything in his writings, a talented personality, a personality of diversity, but he always felt a teacher in him.
He wrote in Gitanjali: "He who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students".
The comprehensive meaning of daily routine is that when people are illiterate then they can feel hungry for others.
When he is thirsty, he can feel the thirst of others.
This is a time to recall the teachings and messages of the Father of the Nation.
The teachings of his life make us equal and commit ourselves to the path of brotherhood.
Once upon a time, he asked a sermon: What is the best thing in Islee
The Poet had said, "Being a poor and needy person and maintaining goodwill with everyone in the absence of sensitivity.
Poet Mohammad believed in knowledge and compassion.
He was not arrogant about anything.
He used to say that pride only makes sense.
Poet Mohammad said that if someone has more than requirement, then give it to someone who needs it.
In this sacred month, everyone presents donations to the vulnerable.
Poet Mohammad believed that a person's own sacred soul enriched him.
My dear countrymen, Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is a land of compassion, service and sacrifice which has guided millions of people across the world.
Remembering Lord Buddha, this Buddha Purnima reminds us of his striving, determination and the great responsibility of walking on the path shown by him.
Lord Buddha is an inspiration for equality, peace, goodwill and brotherhood.
It's the human values that the world needs most today.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar was a great inspiration for Lord Buddha in his social philosophy.
He said, "My social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words
The people of the country, be it the dalits, the oppressed, the deprived or the deprived, have strengthened these marginalized people through the Constitution.
Mercy can't be a bigger example than this.
Lord Buddha's compassion for human suffering was one of his noble qualities.
We have inherited the teachings of Lord Buddha from all over Asia.
In many countries of Asia such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, the teachings of Buddha are linked to the roots of Buddhism. And that is why we are building the infrastructure of Buddhism that connects the important places of Southeast Asia with the Buddhist regions of India.
I pray for the blessings of those great men all over the world, so that we can fulfil our duties in a peaceful and compassionate world in their ideals.
Today, we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statue of Lafing Buddha, which is said to have come up with the good fortune of Lafing Buddha but very few people know that Buddha is also associated with an important event in the history of India's security.
Perhaps you are wondering what is the connection between the forces of Lafing Buddha and India
You must remember that 20 years ago, on the evening of May 11, 1998, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had delivered a speech to the countrymen who had conveyed the message of pride, valour and happiness to the entire country.
There was a new confidence in the people of India that was spread all over the world.
That day was intelligent.
On 11th May, 1998, atomic tests were conducted at Pokhran, Rajasthan in the western part of India.
Twenty years have passed since this test was conducted on the occasion of Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias experiments were successful and India was able to showcase its strength in science and technology.
We can say that the day has been marked as the day of his military exhibition in India's history.
Lord Buddha showed the world that inner strength is essential for peace.
In this way, when you will be able to become stronger as a nation, you will be able to live peacefully with everyone.
The month of May, 1998 is not just important because the nuclear test was conducted in that month, but the way it was done is more important.
It showed the whole world that India has the power to scale new heights and new goals by keeping the great scientists on their own land and a firm leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave the mantra Jai Jawan - Jai Kisan - Jai Vigyan.
Today, when we are going to commemorate the 75th anniversary of May 11, 1998, the mantra of Atal ji 'Jai Vigyan' that we have given us for the development of India, we will have to move forward to build a modern India and we will have to pledge to make every youngster of the country a strong India and a strong India.
We have to make our energy a part of India's energy.
And then we will be able to achieve a new pleasure and satisfaction in the journey that Atal ji had started to see.
My dear countrymen, I will talk about Mann Ki Baat again.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Representatives from ASEAN countries came here on 26th January and brought together various cultural groups.
It is a matter of great pride that most of them had presented the 'Rayan' to us.
It means that not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries of the world, the inspiration and influence of Ramayana and Ramayana is the same.
My dear countrymen, I have received plenty of letters, e-mails, phone calls and opinions from you all.
I have read what I have written in mygov about the online course of Software Sanskrit.
I am delighted to see your passion for Sanskrit as well as being an IT worker.
I have asked the stakeholders to inform you about this.
I also appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat who are working on Sanskrit, to think about how to take this resolution forward.
Shri Ghansham Kumar from Barakar village in Nalanda district of Bihar reads on the Narendra Modi App.
The concern that you have expressed about the decreasing groundwater level is truly important.
And Ayushman Bhoomi can happen only when we take care of every animal living in this land.
You have requested for water supply for animals and birds in the summer.
Shackle-jee, your thoughts have reached all the audience friends.
Speaking on the occasion, Shri Yogesh Bhadresha, I would like to say something about the health of the youth.
He said the youth of our country is physically weaker than other Asian countries.
A few days ago, the French President had visited Kashi and had written to Shri Pashupati Kumar of Varanasi that all the sights of that journey touched him and inspired him.
He expressed interest in telecasting all these pictures on the video social media.
Passenger, Government of India has shared all the photos on social media and Narendra Modi App on that day.
I would like to tell every child like a blind fool that if all these letters are read, my hard work and hard work are blown away.
There are so many letters, so many phone calls, opinions, among those I have been able to hear, and there are many things that have touched my heart.
They wrote about their exams, shared their vacation plans, and even thought about the water scarcity of animals and birds in the summer.
Farmer brothers and sisters have sent a letter to me regarding Kisan Mela and farming activities across the country.
Some conscious citizens have sent me suggestions on water conservation.
During the festive season, a lot of letters are coming to our festivals, our culture and traditions.
On reading your letters, I can understand that Ali, a rickshaw driver from Karimganj in Assam, had built nine schools for the poor children with his own will, only then I could feel the indomitable will power of this country.
When I hear the story of Dr. Ajit Mohan Singh of Kanpur, who travelled from footpath to footpath, treated the brothers and sisters and provided free medicines then it is a matter of pride for the sympathy and humanity of the country.
Calcutta taxi driver Saidul Laskar's sister died due to lack of timely treatment.
A lot of such inspirations have been inspired by my country's identity.
Today, the whole world sees India in other eyes.
Today, when the name of India is enshrined with great respect then the children and children of this country are hiding behind it.
My dear countrymen, in the coming months, it will become very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
Because there's a lot of farming letters.
This time, I have seen the video of my interaction with farmer friends on Doordarshan's DD Kisan channel, and I have felt that all the farmers should see this DD Kisan channel from Doordarshan, and agricultural suggestions should be used in their own fields.
Whether we mention Mahatma Gandhi or whether Shastri Ji or Lohia Ji or Rabindra Charan Singh Ji, all of them considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and public life.
Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri always stressed on the need for conservation of trees, plants, forests etc and better agricultural practices.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia talked about the better income for our farmers, better irrigation and ensuring that all these things are done and creating a comprehensive public awareness for enhancing food and milk production.
In 1957, in his address, Rabindra Charan Singh appealed to the farmers to use new technologies and innovate.
Our Meghalaya farmers have recorded a record production over the last five years in 2015-16.
They showed that if the goal is fixed, there is complete self-confidence, there is a promise in the mind then everything can be done.
Today, with the hard work of the farmers, technology has been combined.
Agricultural producers are getting immense energy.
I have seen the letter that has come to me, several farmer friends have written about MSP and they want me to discuss it in detail.
Brothers and sisters, A major decision has been taken in this year's budget to provide the farmers the right price for their crops.
It has been decided that MSP for specified crops will be at least one and a half times the investment.
Besides, detailed work is being done on the Agriculture Marketing Reform in the country so that the farmers can get the right price for their crops.
Efforts are being made to ensure that the local markets of the village and the cycle market are connected to the world market.
For the farmers not to go far to sell their produce so that they can connect with the APMC and e-NAM platform by upgrading the urgent infrastructure of twenty thousand rural haats.
That is, a system is being created to connect with any market in the country from one field to another.
My dear countrymen, this year marks the start of the 150th anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.
How will the country celebrate this festival
I request you all to share your thoughts with everyone through mygov.
What can be the logo of Gandhi 150
All the work related to health was earlier under the charge of the Ministry of Health.
Preventive Health Care is cheap and easy.
The more we become aware of the Preventive Health Care, the more it benefits the individuals, the families and the society.
Cleanliness is the first condition of keeping life healthy.
Besides, work is underway to create Health Wellness Centre across the country.
As a Preventive Health Care, Yoga has created a new identity in the world.
Yoga promises to be both healthy and capable.
As a result of the commitment of all of us, Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
This year, International Day of Yoga is 21st June and there is no more than 100 days left.
In the last three International Day of Yoga, people from all over the country and abroad participated with great enthusiasm.
This time also we have to ensure that we join ourselves and inspire our family friends to join hands.
In a new and innovative way, Yoga must be popularized among children, young and old people, male or female.
Television and Electronic Media in the country have a separate programme on Yoga.
But can we create awareness about Yoga from now onwards as a mission to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga but I am a Yoga practitioner.
Some people have made me a teacher of Yoga through their own thinking and have made me a 3D animated video of my Yoga.
I would like to share this video with you so that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Efforts are being made to make healthcare affordable, accessible and affordable for all.
Today, more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country, where more than 800 medicines have been sold at affordable prices.
More new centres are being opened.
Heart Stent prices have been reduced to 85 for heart patients.
The cost of artificial knee has also been reduced by 50 to 70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, the government of India and insurance companies will bear the cost of treatment of nearly 10 crore families i. e.
The number of MBBS seats in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
A new medical college will be opened in every three districts.
You need your help to reach this awareness to every person.
We must all strive together to get rid of TB.
Many years ago, Dr. Ambedkar had spoken of India's industrialization.
Industrialization is a powerful medium in his thinking, which will benefit the poorest of the poor in the country.
Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt that India would once become a strong centre for labour.
Today, when the Make in India project is progressing at a rapid pace throughout the country, its dreams are inspired by us.
India is now a bright spot in the global economy and the FDI inflows into India.
The world trade is looking at India because we are now becoming the centre of investment and new traditions of innovation.
Dr. Ambedkar had deep faith in self-reliance and self-reliance.
Dr. Ambedkar wanted that no one in the country should live in poverty.
He strongly believed that poverty cannot be snatched away by donating to the poor.
Today, schemes like Mudra Yojana, Start-up India and Stand-Up India are developing young innovators in our country.
He had said that the Doordarshan had always said that rivers and valley management was a legislative affair and had envisaged that water conservation and conservation would be a multi-modal executive committee.
Today, the historic map of waterways and ports has started in the country.
The work of renovation of new ports and old ports is also being done at the same time.
In the decade of 1970, when the world was second war, the cold war between two powers and the worries of the country, Dr. Ambedkar had imagined the spirit of Team India or India.
He understood the importance of Federalism and felt that the Centre and the States should work together for the betterment of the country.
Today, we have been initiated into a cooperative federalism and a competitive cooperative federalism at every level of the country and governance.
The most important thing is that Dr. Ambedkar is an inspiration for a large number of people like me from the backward classes of the country.
India's philosophy is very different: an India that belongs to the poor and the underprivileged.
Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organised across the country from 14th April to 5th May, 2019 to mark the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.
The campaign will cover various aspects of rural development, poverty and social justice across the country.
I have a sincere request to all of you to participate in this national mission automatically.
My dear countrymen, there are several festivals and festivals coming in a few days: Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Vaisakhi.
May Mahavir Jayanti recall the sacrifices and penance of Lord Mahavir.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavira, the preacher of non-violence, is an inspiration for us.
I convey my best wishes to all fellow citizens on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti.
Ester Ellie, we believe in the Christ Jesus, who wanted the peace of mankind, the peace of truth, justice, grace and compassion.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2018
We have seen that the colours of the sea look blue, but we know from our daily experiences that there is no colour of water.
Have we ever imagined the rivers, the seas, the waters become colorful
This question was reminded by a young man in the 1920s.
This question was given by a great scientist in modern India.
When we talk about science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding work in the field of light scattering.
His discovery is known as the Roman Effect.
We celebrate 28th February as National Science Day every year, as it is said that on this day, he discovered Light Scattering, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana, scientists like Satyendra Nath Bose are Indias pride.
Famous particles named Satyendra Nath Bose are also named Boson.
Recently, at a function in Mumbai, I got the opportunity to inaugurate the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
The wonderful work done in science is very attractive.
The Artificial Intelligence will help in manufacturing robots, bots and unspecified machines.
Nowadays, various machines are making their intelligence smarter through self learning.
It can help improve the lives of the poor, the deprived and the underprivileged.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientists to know what kind of artificial intelligence can be provided to make life easier for brothers and sisters with disabilities
Can we get a better prediction of natural disasters through artificial intelligence
Can Artificial Intelligence facilitate access to healthcare
A few days ago, I had the pleasure of inaugurating the 'I Create' programme in Ahmedabad, Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel.
There was a young man who said that he had created a digital instrument where if anyone cannot speak, then the instrument used to change in fear and you can talk in a way that you can talk to a person capable of speaking.
I think we can use artificial intelligence in such cases.
Science and Technology Valueutral.
You don't add value to it.
Any machine will do what we want.
But it depends on us what we want from the machine.
Thomas Alva Edison, the light ball's inventor, failed many times in his work.
Once he was questioned, he said, I have searched ten thousand ways to avoid making light bucks, that is, Edison has also made his own failure strong.
Incidentally, it is a privilege that today I am living in the workplace of Maharishi Aurobindo.
He challenged the British administration, fought against them, questioned their rule.
In this way, he questioned every aspect of his life like a great sage, searched for answers and guided humanity.
It's important to ask the repeated questions to know the truth.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, I have had a lot of messages about safety and disaster during the difficult times and people have written to me something or the other.
From Pune, ShrimanRabindra Singh has sent his comments on optical safety at the NarendraMobile App.
He wrote that safestards are not very good in place of artillery and construction in our country.
If we are not conscious of safety in daily life, if we cannot afford to protect ourselves then it is even more difficult to ensure the safety system in times of great danger or misery.
Most of the accidents are the result of our fault.
If we remain cautious and follow the required rules then we can not only save our lives but also protect our society from any major accident.
Sometimes I have noticed that there are several directions on safety in the workplace, but those rules are not followed at all.
I urge all the municipalities and municipalities that have fire brigades to go to school at least once a month to drive a mock drill in front of students.
It will be of two benefits - a cautious habit and a new generation of children will also learn a lot.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading the country in dealing with the menace of disasters.
A scheme named Apada Mitra has been started to provide training to voluntary workers in Cyclone or Vanna Pravan districts.
Training and awareness are very important.
Till two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year in Lou or Hit Wave.
NDMA then organised workshops on Heat Wave and launched a campaign to raise public awareness.
We have a good outcome in collective endeavours.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat wave decreased unexpectedly to about 220.
This shows that if we give importance to safety then we can be safe .
I would like to honour all those who are present at the scene in the event of an accident and help the victims in rescue and rescue operations.
The number of heroes known by such names is not very low.
Besides, the Fireand Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Para-Military Force and the brave soldiers of the Armed Forces who risked their lives and rescued others.
India and other BI MSTEC countries - Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal - participated in the exercise led by India a few days ago.
We all heard them many times.
But today if someone takes our plane and asks us, where is it, where is the life jacket, how to use it, I'm sure nobody can answer it.
If we become aware of our safety then the security of the society is also included in it .
My dear countrymen, in this year's budget, emphasis has been laid on making WasteTo Wealth and Wasteto Energy through biogas in villages to create a Swachh Bharat.
Efforts have been initiated and it has been named GOBAR Dhan i. e.
The objective of the GOBAR Dhan Yojana is to clean the villages and generate income and energy from them by converting dung and post-harvest waste to compost and bio-gas.
Animal dung and other biological fossils are used for energy generation in any European country and in China.
But India has not been fully utilised.
We are moving towards this direction by incorporating it into Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen.
These are cattle dung, post-farm waste, kitchen waste.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, the farmers, rural brothers and sisters of rural India will be encouraged to look at dung and waste as a source of income, not just waste.
It will also increase self-sufficiency by using biogas for cooking and power generation.
This will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal husbandry.
New employment opportunities will be created in the areas of waste collection, transportation, bio-gas sales etc.
An online trading platform will be created to ensure proper implementation of the Gobardhan scheme, which will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers get the right price for dung and agricultural waste.
I would like to urge the enthusiastic, especially the sisters living in the villages to come forward and make Self Help Groups and make full use of this opportunity by organising the Assistant Committee.
I invite you all to join the movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs, to convert the waste of your village into wealth and to make dung-rich with cow dung.
But we got to know of an unparalleled attempt at Raipur of Chhattisgarh and that is the first ' Waste Festival ' organised in this state .
The objective of this festival organised by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to increase awareness about cleanliness, create awareness about the various ways to create awareness about city waste and re-use of garbage.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Raipur Nagar Nigam, to the people of Chhattisgarh and to the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for displaying this festival in an innovative manner with the importance of waste management and cleanliness.
The International Womens Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
There are several events in the country and the world.
On that day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar was conferred on all those women who have done exemplary work in different fields in the last few days.
Today, the country is moving ahead with women-led development and women-led development.
Today, I am reminded of a speech by my husband Vivekananda.
Independence, this idea of Swami ji, a hundred and twenty-five years ago, reflects the spirit of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
Today, our women power has given them self-confidence and self-confidence through their work.
They have not only advanced themselves but have also taken the country and society forward and have also taken steps to scale new heights.
Finally, the dream of a New India is that where women are empowered, strong and are equal partners in the overall development of the country.
A few days ago, a man gave me a great suggestion.
He suggested that on 8th March, various programmes were organized to observe Women's Day, but what can be organized to honour the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village and city
This number is not small - 15 lakh women have been organised and have been running the cleanliness drive for a month.
Beginning on 26 January , 2018 in just 20 days these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets .
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand Jal-Shiya i. e.
You can imagine how big it is.
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is the strength of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that will transform the cleanliness drive in everyday life and the transformation of cleanliness into a peoples habit.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching the news that electricity had reached three villages of Elephanta Island after seventy years of independence.
You are well aware that Elephanta Island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai.
It's an important tourist destination.
I am amazed to know that despite being such a big tourist destination in Mumbai, electricity has not reached Elephanta even after so many years of independence.
For seventy years, three villages of Elephanta Island - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Senthandar - all those darknesses in the lives of the people there have been removed and their lives have become bright.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that the Elephant Village and the Elephant Cave will now emerge in the light of lightning.
This is not just a power but a new auspicious occasion for development.
My dear brothers and sisters, a few days ago, we had celebrated the Shivratri festival.
The importance of Hollywood festivals is as important as Holika Dahan, which has been said to have caused the burning of evil in the fire.
On the day of Holi, sitting together on all charms, sharing happiness and joy - a beautiful moment and a festival of Holi - a message of love, unity and harmony.
My dear countrymen, thanks a lot
And two days ago, we had observed the Republic Day at ease.
In history, it was the first time that the top leadership of ten countries was present on the occasion.
My dear countrymen, today Shri Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter to me in the Narendra Modi App and he has expressed his desire that I should touch his letter.
He wrote, 1st February is the Day of Death of Astronaut Kalpana Chawla.
He has taken us away from the Colombian Space Accident but has inspired millions of youngsters around the world.
I express my gratitude to Bhai Prakash ji for starting his long letter with the farewell episode of Kalpana Chawla.
If there is a will and a firm commitment, if there is any hunger to do something, nothing is impossible.
Several industrialists have contributed immensely to the creation of various segments of Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Friends, I don't know how many names
Today, we talk of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, but hundreds of years ago, in our scriptures, Skandh Puranas, the tenth generation, congregation, the tenth salvation.
This is the importance of women in our society.
And that is why in our society women have been given the status of energy.
This woman power binds the entire country, all the societies and families on the brink of unity.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given many more examples.
He wrote that our adventurous Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharamans 'Sukhoi-30' fighter plane will inspire him.
Three brave women thought Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi are the aircraft drivers and are currently undergoing training to run the Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft.
Today, there are several areas where women are the first to live, our women power is doing something or the other.
It has also been added as e-book on the Narendra Modi website.
Today, women have an important role to play in the ongoing positive changes in the country and society.
As we discuss women empowerment today, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment. You might be wondering what could be the connection between this.
Mumbais Matunga Station is the first railway station in India where all levels of staff are women.
Women employees in all departments.
More than 40 women personnel are handling this station in collaboration with the Commercial Department, Railway Police, Ticket Examiner, Announcer and Point Person.
Today, our energy is leading from the front.
Whenever there is talk of tribal women, there is a certain picture in everyone's mind, there will be forests, mountain chests, there will be a familiar view of the girls moving ahead with their heads.
But in Chhattisgarh, our tribal women, our energy has created a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is one of the Maoist-affected areas.
Violence, torture, bombs, guns, guns and guns have created a terrible environment there.
Tribal women living in such tragic conditions are making their own self-reliance by carrying out e-rickshaws.
In a very short span of time, all the women there have become part of this process.
On the one hand, as they are empowering themselves through self-employment, the Maoist-affected area is also changing the pictures.
Besides, it is also possible to provide a lot of energy to conserve the environment.
I also appreciate the district administration there. From grant-in-aid to training, the district administration has been playing an important role in the success of these women.
We have heard it again and again, the people said, There is something that doesn't disappear from our existence.
Whatever negative excitement, its erosion, whatever is required to be absorbed in its reforms.
And the specialty of our society is to continue the process of self-reform.
The identity of any living society lies in its self-reform process.
Centuries-long attempts against social evils and evils are continuing in our country individually and socially.
Through this campaign, efforts are being made to create awareness against social curse such as child marriage and curse.
He was sworn in in the State to fight against illicit policies such as tradition and marriage.
Children, elderly, enthusiastic and inspired youngsters, mothers and sisters have all fought for this.
From the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, the human chain continues to cross the borders of the state.
In order to make all the people of the society a part of the real development process, it is important to be free from such mischief.
Come, let us all pledge to eliminate such evils from the society together and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration there, every person involved in human discipline, for describing such special and comprehensive issues for the welfare of the society.
My dear countrymen, Shri Darshan from Mysore, Karnataka, wrote in MyGov, spending six thousand rupees per year for the treatment of his father.
He was not familiar with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana earlier.
But whenever he came to know about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra, the prices of medicines went down by up to seventy-five percent.
He expressed his willingness that I should talk about Mann Ki Baat while talking about it so that more and more people get information about it.
Over the past several years, many people have written to me about this.
I have seen several videos on social media too.
And when I come to know about such things, I am very happy.
I have a deep satisfaction.
And I was also pleased that Shri Darshan ji had a feeling that he had received the benefits of others.
This will benefit the common man, especially the senior citizens who are compelled to take medicines daily.
The life-saving medicines taken from here are prepared according to the standards approved by the World Health Organisation .
This is the root cause of affordable healthcare.
Today, more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
These not only provide cheaper medicines but also create new employment opportunities for private entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Amritsar Stores of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and Hospitals.
The only purpose behind this is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi App.
It was such a picture that my attention was drawn towards that picture.
A grandson had joined her grandfather in the Clean Morn River sanitation drive.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised a Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Morana river through Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morna river used to flow for twelve months earlier, but now the weather is dependent.
Sadly, the river was filled with wild grass and garbage.
A lot of garbage was being washed away from the river and its surroundings .
Hence, an action plan was created by NEE and the first phase of Mission Clean Morna from 13th January onwards was cleaned at fourteen places on the banks of the river Morna.
The Swachhta Abhiyan was carried out in a similar manner on 20th January and I am told that this campaign will continue every Saturday morning till the river Morna is completely cleaned.
This shows that nothing is impossible if people make a solemn pledge to do something.
A massive change can be brought about through the Jan Andolan.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and the city administration and all the citizens associated with this work as a peoples movement.
My dear countrymen, you have heard a lot of discussions on Padma awards recently.
Newspapers and TV Discussions have attracted attention.
But if you look at it with a little bit of attention then it will be a matter of pride for you people because of the great people who are amongst us and it will naturally be a matter of pride for us that how today the small people of our country are reaching this height without any recommendation.
There is a tradition of awarding Padma awards every year but its entire process has changed in the last three years.
Now any citizen can choose any person.
This has brought transparency in the process of online processing.
In fact, the election process of this award has completely transformed.
Padma Awards have been given to all those who cannot be seen in big cities, newspapers, TV, etc.
Now the importance of his work is increasing, not individuals in the field of awards.
You might have heard about Shri Arvind Gupta ji.
He has been creating toys from the things he has captured for four decades, so that he can enhance the curiosity of science among the children.
His efforts are to promote scientific experiments from small things that are unnecessary.
This inspires youngsters by showcasing films made in 18 languages in 3,000 schools across the country.
One such story is from Sitaba Jodatti in Karnataka.
He is not called the Goddess of Women Empowerment.
Since the last three decades, he has done a great job in transforming the lives of countless women in Belagavi.
He had dedicated himself to Devdasi at the age of seven but he had spent his entire life for the welfare of the goddesses.
Not only this, he also worked excellently for the welfare of Dalit women.
You can keep in mind the names of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh. Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a poor family, in a tribal family.
He used to do a small job for leading a life but he was fond of creating traditional tribal paintings.
Today, he is respected not only in India but also in the whole world for this hobby.
His paintings have been exhibited in many countries like Nawab, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyamji, who brought laurels for India abroad, has been recognised and awarded Padmashree.
You will be surprised to hear the story of Kerala's tribal lady Lakshmikutty.
Lakshmikutty taught in Kollar area and is still living in shadow huts in tribal areas in the middle of dense forests.
He made five hundred herbal medicines depending on his memories.
He has the capability to manufacture snake bites.
Lakshmi ji is continuously serving people from his knowledge of these herbal medicines.
This unconscious personality has been recognized and honored with Padma Shri for his participation in the society.
Today, Subhasini Mistrik, seventy-five years of West Bengal has also been selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistri is a woman who has distributed utensils and vegetables in the houses of other people for the construction of a hospital.
When he was thirty years old, his husband died due to lack of medical treatment and this incident inspired him to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated freely in the hospitals created due to their hard work.
I firmly believe that there are many such gems and jewels in our multi-storied splendor, women and gems whom no one knows or knows.
Sometimes people should come to school and colleges to know about their experiences.
There should be some effort in the society outside the awards.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
This is the day when revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bonds between Indians and Indians living in different parts of the world.
This year, on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we organized an event where all MPs and mayors of Indian origin living in different countries of the world were invited.
You will be happy to note that Indian descendants and mayors from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa, America and many other countries have joined the event.
Our Indian diaspora, who live in different countries of Europe, are working on cyber security, some are associated with Ayurveda, some are enjoying the hearts of the society through music or poetry.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for the recognition of the Indian diaspora and for their contribution to the people of the world.
On 3rd January, the venerable Bapu, who showed us a new path.
These were not just the basic principles.
Even today, we can see in every step that Bapu's message was justified.
If we take a pledge that we will walk on the path shown by Bapu then what can be a bigger tribute than that
My dear countrymen, I conclude my speech by congratulating you all on the auspicious occasion of two thousand eighteen years.
Greetings.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2017
This is the last episode of Mann Ki Baat this year and see what a strange conclusion is that this is the last day of 2017.
This year, I and you have shared a lot of things for nearly a year.
The exchange of letters, comments and opinions on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat always keeps me filled with a new inspiration.
The years will change in just a few hours, but this continuity of our conversation will continue.
In the coming New Year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018
A few days ago, the smoke-filled Hulcrum Festival all over the world.
This festival will be celebrated with great fervor throughout India.
At this time of Christmas, we recognise the teachings and teachings of Jesus Christ, and the greatest emphasis on Christ's speech is the spirit of service.
This is also evident in the essence of service ideas.
Ramakrishna Paramhansdeva also said, "Serving life in the wisdom of Shiva and every word has a human value all over the world.
Dear countrymen, this year was also the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru, poets, philosophers and great warriors have always inspired mankind.
He taught us to fight injustice and atrocities, he showed us the path to freedom from the bonds of caste and religion.
And in this endeavour, he had to lose a lot in his personal life, but he never missed the feeling of inferiority.
Every moment of his life was full of love, sacrifice and peace.
Let us commit ourselves to take inspiration from the teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji and his great philosophy of life and inspire his ideals in our lives.
You must be surprised to know that the New Year comes every year and the fiscal year also comes every time.
The entire India is looking forward to welcoming you in the 21st century.
You must be proud of yourselves as voters of the 21st century.
Such a power is the greatest strength of democracy.
Remember, you can also play a crucial role in building India in the 21st century and it is going to start from 01st January.
In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had specially tried to understand the youth of 18-25 years of age, full of vibrancy and determination.
I believe that the dream of a New India will be realised by the capabilities and strengths of a life-fledged life-force.
The New India that we are talking about in the coming days is an India free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
India is free from dirt and poverty.
New India, which will be the guiding force of peace, unity and goodwill.
Make a roadmap for yourselves, connect those who are associated with you people, and enrich yourself in this manner.
Imagine how we plan before 2022
Mahatma Gandhi had transformed the freedom movement into a peoples movement.
My young friends, this is the need of the hour that we too should transform the dreams of a positive India into a mass movement of the 21st century.
Today, a lot of new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and enterprise, our youngsters are coming forward and succeeding.
I would like to ponder over how this New India Youth could be found in one place and create a system in this regard so that it can be easily accessible to the world by the age of seventeen.
My dear countrymen, I had talked about Impactivity in the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Nothing is impossible for a person who is positive and enthusiastic.
Pessimism Leedstoo Wickness, Optimism to Power.
I had requested the people of the country to share their positive moments in 2017 and welcome 2018 in a positive atomsphere.
I am happy that a large number of people have shared their experiences and experiences on social media platforms, MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
Lakhs of Positive India Hashtags have been made which have reached out to more than 1. 5 crore people.
The transmission of economies of scale has started in India and has spread all over the world.
The Tweet Arresponse was actually inspiring.
There was a feeling of happiness.
Some of the countrymen have discussed the positive impact of the events that had affected their minds during this year.
Some people shared their own experiences.
Sound White  Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Phase One, Delhi.
 Name is Jyoti Rajendra Growth
And he died in the accident.
We know what happened to us at that time.
This government helped us a lot and we were able to handle the situation.
 My name is Santosh Yadav.
National Highway was constructed in 2017 from different villages across our villages.
Two things that our Indian soldiers have done - the surgical strike carried out by Pakistanis has destroyed the extremist launching pads and at the same time it was incomparable for our Indian soldiers in Doklam.
 My name is Satish Bevani.
Over the last forty years, there was water scarcity in our area and we were dependent on the pipelines built for the army.
Now we have a pipeline.
So in 2017, we didn't get this bigger.
There are many people who are doing such things at their own level so that there is a positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India that we are building together.
Let us enter the year 2018 with all these small joys, start a new year and take concrete steps for Positive India.
When we all talk about positivity, I also want to share one thing.
I came to know about the inspirational story of Anjum Bashir Khan Khatk, the topper of administrative service in the state.
He drove out of the bitterness of radicalism and hatred and topped the examination of the Administrative Service in Kashmir.
You will be surprised to know that in 1990 the rebels burnt his ancestral home.
There was so much violence and jealousy that his family had to leave their ancestral homes.
The atmosphere of violence surrounding a small child was sufficient for darkness and bitterness in the hearts but it did not allow Anjum to do so.
He never gave up hope.
Today, he has been inspired not only by Jammu and Kashmir but also by the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that no matter how bad the situation may be, the clouds of despair can be destroyed through positive work.
Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
The time I have interacted with these daughters has inspired me and this is the strength of the country. This is the strength of our country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a discussion of the world's famous religious places in our country, it is very natural to discuss the Sabarimala temple of Kerala.
Millions of devotees are present here every year in this world famous temple with the blessings of Lord Ayyappaswamy.
What is the challenge of maintaining transparency in a place where there are such a large number of devotees who have come here in such a large number
And especially in the mountains and jungles.
P.
Vijayan, a police officer, started a program called Punyanam Punkavanam and started the Swachhta Abhiyan to raise awareness about cleanliness.
This campaign is a pilgrim who will not complete his pilgrimage until he seeks some physical labour for cleanliness.
There is no small difference in this mission.
Every pilgrim is participating in the cleanliness drive as a part of the worship of God.
Every morning there is a wonderful sight of this cleanliness and all the devotees participate in it.
Whether it is celebrity or wealthy, whether it is a big officer or a common pilgrim, everyone should participate in the Poonam Poonkavanam programme and move ahead with the sanitation work.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
The Swachhta Abhiyan in Sabarimala has progressed, Punyan Poonkavanam has been successful and all the devotees participated in it.
And we have taken a pledge that when Bapu will be the 150th Birth Anniversary, we will do something for the Swachh Bharat Mission of his dreams.
Efforts are being made at the level of Swachhata across the country.
There is a transformation in the rural and urban areas where people are participating.
The Swachh Survekshan 2018, the world's largest survey, will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018, to monitor the progress of Swachhata at the urban level.
The programme will cover over 4000 crore citizens of the city.
The Swachhata App will provide analysis for revision of the utility and service sector.
It will be seen that every citizen of the city is connected to the process of keeping the city clean and it is transformed into the habit of the city.
My dear countrymen, some things seem to be very small, but in a society it becomes far-reaching.
Today, I mention one such incident in Mann Ki Baat programme.
For decades, this injustice has been done to Muslim women
However, she was not entitled to Muslim women of our country.
I am very happy that our government has focused on this thing.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken urgent steps in this regard and has removed the obstacles in this 70-year-old tradition.
Today, a Muslim woman can go to Hajkar without pride and I am glad that about 1300 Muslim women have applied to go to Bahadur Haj and Muslim women from different parts of the country - from Kerala to North India - have expressed their desire to go to Haj.
I have suggested to the Minority Affairs Ministry that the women who want to go to Haj alone should get permission from them.
Our efforts will be to ensure that our women get equal rights and equal opportunities so that they can participate equally in the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic day for our country.
However, the day of 26th January, 2018 will be specially remembered.
This has never happened before in India's history.
The year 2017 was significant for both ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN has completed 50 years this time and Indias MoU with ASEAN has been completed 25 years in 2017.
It is a matter of pride for us that on 26th January, the ten great leaders of the world have met together.
My dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals, however, our country is a country of economics.
Perhaps it's not a day when there's no penance.
Recently, we all celebrated Christmas, and the new year is coming.
May the New Year bring happiness, prosperity and happiness to all of you.
Let us all move ahead with new initiatives, new zeal, new hopes and resolves.
In January, the sun was resurrected and the closing ceremony of Makar Sankranti was held.
It is a festival related to nature.
On the one hand, each of our mountains is connected with the natural calamities in some way, but in our culture full of diversity, these incidents of nature are different.
All these mountains are covered from 13th to 17th January.
The name of these mountains is different, but there is only one element in its depth - a blend of nature and agriculture.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all fellow citizens.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
There is hardly anybody in India who does not remember or respects him.
He is a witness to the valour of all of us and the facts of the country.
He completed ninety years on 28th September.
I had the privilege of talking to Didi on the phone ahead of my foreign travel.
This conversation was exactly the same as a younger brother who spoke with his elder sister very carefully.
Latadi, Namaskar.
I'm talking about Narendra Modi.
Greetings.
Modi ji: I had called for this because this time on your birthday I will be busy traveling by air.
I will return on the 28th of this night, and on the 29th of this morning, your birthday will be over.
Okay, okay.
Lota ji: There are many people who grow up in their age but it is very important to get the blessings of those who grow up with their jobs.
Yes, but I think this is the blessings of my parents and the blessings of all the listeners.
Modiji:..
I'm more happy when you proudly say your mother was Gujarati...
No, I don't want to hurt you anymore, because I can see and know how busy you are and how much you do.
How much you have to think about.
When you brought your mother's footsteps, I sent a man to take her blessings.
My mother too was very happy to see your love.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all on your birthday.
But I was so busy that I couldn't take time.
Yes, yes, yes, of course
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, the atmosphere of festivals will once again be filled with new zeal and resolve.
It's a festive season
The Festival will be celebrated across the country for several weeks.
The house will be filled with happiness.
But you must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of this joy of festivals.
And it is called darkness on the bottom of lamp.
Perhaps this proverb is not just a word, it is an instruction for us, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Imagine, some houses on one side are illuminated
On the other hand, in front of him, there are some people in the neighbourhood.
In some houses, sweets are destroyed, and in some houses children are sweet for sweets.
At least, additional or unauthorised household items can be delivered out.
In many cities, start-ups of young friends from ENGOs are doing the same.
They collected dresses, sweets, food from the people's house and then discovered the bad guys and sent them to them.
Can we sleep on the banks of the lamp with full awareness and determination during this festival
Lakshmi was welcomed in the traditional tradition.
In our culture, girls are considered Lakshmi because they bring fortune and prosperity.
This year, can we have a universal programme to honour girls in our society, villages and cities
Can we have a programme to honour these Lakshmis of India on this Diwali
There are many daughters and daughters around us who are doing extraordinary work.
Some people are studying the poor children, some are creating awareness about cleanliness and health, some are serving the society as a doctor, others are trying to bring justice to someone by becoming a lawyer.
May our society take pride in their recognition and honour.
The Prime Minister said that the programme to honour them should be implemented across the country.
One more thing can be done, share the benefits of these girls in social media as much as possible and use hashtagbharatkilaxmi.
For example, we all carried out a massive drive called Selfie with Daughter, which was spread all over the world.
My dear countrymen, I have said this thing in Mann Ki Baat earlier that I am fortunate to have a direct or indirect conversation with many familiar and familiar people.
A few days ago, a student from remote Arunachal Pradesh, Alina Tayong, sent me a very attractive letter.
I'm Roing, Arunachal Pradesh.
I like reading, I think it would be very useful for me to read books before exams.
I liked a lot of things in this book but I also noticed that there are many suggestions in this book for students but there is nothing in this book for parents and teachers.
See, my young friends also have the confidence that the country's chief servants will have to do something.
My little student friend, I thank you for writing the letters first.
Thank you for reading Ekjam Warriors twice or thrice.
If I can take time out for a new version, I will definitely try to write something for parents and teachers as you say.
But I'll put an application to all of you.
Can you help me
I must consider them.
I will think about it and I will definitely try to write it in my own language, in my own way.
This may be, if your suggestions come in plenty, my new version will also be confirmed.
So I'll wait for your opinion.
I once again thank our little student friend Arunachal Alina Tayong.
My dear countrymen, you are aware of the busy schedule of the Prime Minister of India through the news papers and TV.
But you know that I'm a common man like you.
I also heard that speech and watched the match.
The simplicity and the simplicity of the 23-year-old dancing intellectuals is like affecting everyone.
I must have been impressed.
Shortly before that speech, he won 19 Grandslam winners and finalized near Thiruvananthapuram legend Raphael Nadal.
I'm sorry to have someone else in that situation.
He complimented Sportsman Spirit for having defeated the finals after a tough fight.
Champion Nadal also complimented Danil for his performance.
The morale of the players and the humble use of the players in the same match is both learnable.
If you do not listen to the speech of Daniel Medvedev, I would like to appeal to all, especially the youngsters to watch the video.
It has a lot to learn for people of all ages and ages.
There are moments that are beyond defeat and these moments teach us how to win.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, what I am going to say now is for your good.
Arguments, litigations and liabilities will continue, but the problem should be resolved before it gets over.
Otherwise the problem takes a bigger one and solving it becomes a tough thing.
If we are conscious at the root, we can save a lot.
With this feeling, I feel that my young friends must talk about an urgent subject.
We all know how harmful the drug addiction to the health and once it becomes a bad practice, it is difficult to get rid of it.
Tobacco nicotine is intoxicating.
Consumption of tobacco during adolescence also affects the development of the brain.
We all know about these things, but today I want to inform you about a new topic.
You are aware of the fact that the ban on e-cigarette has been issued in India recently.
This e-cigarette is an electronic device different from ordinary cigarettes.
In e-cigarette, nicotine rich fluids are heated and chemical smoke is generated through which nicotine enters the body.
We know about the dangers of ordinary cigarettes, but there is a misconception about e-cigarettes that it is not harmful.
It uses aromatic chemicals for not smelling like ordinary cigarettes.
We usually see that even if a family has a father chain smoker, he attempts to prevent any family from smoking.
More of the little chigarettes, stay away from the beetles.
There is no smoke in the cigarettes, those who are selling, those who are buying or seeing, all of them know that the cigarette is harmful.
But the issue of e-cigarette is quite different.
There's very little awareness about this among people.
People are not familiar with the devastating aspects of e-cigarettes, and this is why the e-cigarette has entered the house.
Sometimes the children in front of their parents say that they are playing magic, without fire, without smoke, with e-cigarettes and the elders smile.
You know, we smell it when someone around us ate the cigarette.
Even in pockets, cigarette packets, smells.
This is not the case with e-cigarettes, the youngsters knowingly or unknowingly, the fashion statistics, in their bags, in the books, in the middle of the books, in the arms of their hands, and thus they fall under the influence of this intoxication.
Youth power is the future of our country.
E-cigarette has been hampered so that these new instruments of intoxication do not ruin our country, do not destroy the dreams of our families, do not spoil the lives of our children.
Somehow, this drug addiction cannot be rooted in society.
I urge you all to abandon the practice of tobacco and stop confusing about e-cigarettes.
You must remember Fit India.
Fit India means not just going to the gym every morning and evening.
It is also called Fit India to avoid all these misconceptions.
I believe you don't feel bad about me, but you'll feel better.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a matter of great privilege for us that India is the birthplace of such great personalities who have sacrificed their lives for others and not for themselves.
Our India, our land is a land of plenty of gems.
This country has given a lot of humanitarian gifts.
A human being is going to be honoured in Vatican City on October 13, which is a matter of pride for all of us.
On that day Pope Francis is going to announce a St. Mary Thresia.
Sister Marium Thresia has contributed immensely to the well-being of humanity at the young age of fifty years.
Once again I pay my homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially my younger brothers and sisters, for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but also for the entire world that today when we are celebrating Gandhi 150 then at the same time, 130 crore Indians have pledged to stop the use of single-use plastic.
The way India has played a leading role in environment conservation, the entire world is now looking at India.
I am confident that on 2nd October, all of you will join the Single Use Plastic Expedition.
People are contributing to this mission in their own way.
However, a youth of our country has started a unique mission.
His work attracts my attention and I try to understand and understand his new plan by talking to him on phone.
Perhaps his words will help other people in the country.
It was new to me when I first heard the plogging word.
Perhaps this word is used at a small level abroad.
Hello, Ripudamanji, this is Narendra Modi.
With this, we will not only take care of our own health, but will also save the health of mother Earth.
I believe that our country will take 130 crore steps to make a single useful plastic-free India by moving ahead with this objective.
Rippu Daman ji, thank you very much
My dear countrymen, the preparations for 2nd October are going on throughout the country and across the world, but we want to take Gandhi 150 forward.
I want to live my life for the welfare of the country.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is the dream of all of us and that is why on 31st October every year we are organizing the Run for Unity in the country.
My dear countrymen, perhaps you might remember from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August that by 2022, you would visit 15 places in India.
Go to at least 15 places and try to stay there one night.
Look at India, understand, feel it.
We have so many varieties.
On the occasion of Deepavali, whenever there is a holiday, all of you go for a walk and I urge you all to travel to 15 places in India.
You will be happy to know that India has made a lot of progress in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index, which has been possible due to your cooperation.
It's possible, especially because it understands the importance of travel.
That is, we have gone a long way in this direction and if we try more then we will be able to make tourism a global destination by completing 75 years of independence.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to all of you for this diverse India.
It must be seen that during Diwali, there should not be any fire incident or any human being being being harmed due to fire.
Once again I convey my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to you all
Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
Six days after Deepawali, the Lord Chhot is one of the most dedicated festivals in our country.
From food to dressing to dressing, every subject is practiced in tradition.
Chhath Puja is completely associated with the unparalleled nature and the worship of nature.
On the one hand, the sun and water are the centres of worship, on the other hand, bamboo and soil utensils and roots are the common ingredients of worship.
It includes the expression of the importance of Swachhata in our lives.
Before the dawn, all the people gathered together with the zeal and enthusiasm of sanitation in the entire house, along with rivers, ponds, ponds, worship places or valleys.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja - Conservation, Disease Reduction and Discipline.
Behind this tradition of eating prasad, it is also logical that it destroys the pride and the feeling of pride that hinders the progress of the individual.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I believe that Mann Ki Baat has tied up with the masses of the country.
Take the examples of Khadi and Handloom.
You must have been happy to hear that this is being sold at just one store in Khadi and Handloom.
The sale of Khadi gift coupons during Diwali has increased by 680.
The net worth of Khadi and Handicrafts has also increased by nearly ninety percent this year compared to the previous year.
It is evident that today the young, the elderly, the women, every age-old man likes food and handloom.
I can imagine how many families, poor families, handicraft families have benefitted from this thing.
And we had talked about Khadi for Fashion but in the last few years, I have been able to say that after Khadi for Nation and Khadi for Fashion, Khadi for Transformation is taking that place.
Khadi has emerged as a powerful tool to empower the poorest of the poor by changing the lives of the poorest of the poor.
Gramodiya is playing a very big role.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt wrote in the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about my experience of Diwali with the Defence Forces and he also wants to know how the Defence Forces is celebrating Diwali.
Shriman Tejas Bhagwad also wrote on the Narendra Modi App: What can we do to bring our homes to the defence forces
We also consider our heroic defence forces.
We also believe that our household sweets need to reach out to the soldiers of the country.
Deepawali must have been celebrated with great fervor.
Deepawali has brought a special experience for me.
Once again, I am fortunate to celebrate Diwali with our brave defence forces deployed on the border.
This time, the Diwali celebrations with the Defence Forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir have become memorable for me.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I salute every soldier of our defence forces for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice of our defence forces in the face of the difficult situation on the border.
Whenever we get a chance, we should know the experience of our soldiers and listen to their pride.
Many of us do not know that our defence forces are playing a vital role not only in border but also in providing peace to the entire world.
As UN Peacekeeping Forces, they are illuminating India all over the world.
A few days ago, on 24th October, United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everybody remembers the contribution of the United Nations towards peace in the world.
And we believe that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam means that the whole world is our family.
And since the beginning, India has been contributing actively to the United Nations.
You must be aware of the proposition of the Constitution of India and the proposition of the UN Charter, both started with the words 'We the People'.
India has always emphasized on equal rights of women and is a living example of UN Declaration of Human Rights.
In its opening statement, it was proposed that the All-Main and Burn Free and Equivalent, which has been converted into an attempt by the representatives of India, Hansa Mehta, was followed by the Olympian Beings and the Burn Free and Equivalent.
It seems to be a very small change, but we can see a healthy thinking in it.
India's most important contribution to UN umbrella is its role in UN peacekeeping efforts.
India has always played a major role in the UN Peacekeeping Mission.
You are among those who may first know this information.
More than 800 Defence Forces have contributed to UN peacekeeping efforts.
Currently, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with UN peacekeeping entrepreneurs and this is the third highest in the world.
Until August 2017, about 50 of the world's solitary peacekeeping efforts have contributed.
These efforts are being carried out across the globe in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan etc.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated at Indian Army Hospitals in Congo and South Sudan and have been rescued.
India's defence forces have not only protected the people of different countries but have also won their hearts by spreading peace and security.
Indian women have played a key role in the peace process.
Very few people know that India is the first country to send women police units to Liberia for UN peacekeeping operations.
And see, this step of India has become a source of inspiration for all the countries.
After that, all the countries started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to know that Indias role is not limited to peacekeeping, India is also training the peacekeeping forces of 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers are spreading the message of peace and harmony across the world.
Peacekeeping campaign is not very easy.
We have to work in the remotest areas of our security forces.
They have to understand different situations and different cultures.
Remembering him, the hearts of all the countrymen are filled with pride.
He was the only member of the UN Peacekeeping Force who was awarded the Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeepers who has specially acknowledged his work in Cyprus.
In 1989, at the age of 72, he was appointed the Commander of the Army in Namibia's mission and served him to ensure the independence of Namibia.
The former Chief of the Army Staff, Thimaya, led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and performed his best for peace.
India is always sending a message of peace, unity and goodwill to the world as ambassadors of peace.
May each one live a peaceful and harmonious life and move forward towards a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our sacred land, this India, is brimming with the magnificence of all such great men who have served humanity selflessly.
Sister Nivedita, who is well-wisher and revered as Bhagni Nivedita, is also one of these great men.
Margaret Elizabeth was born in Ireland and later renamed her husband Vivekananda Nivedita.
Nivedita means complete dedication.
Later, he had proved the excellent glory of his name.
Yesterday was the 150th Birth Anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his life for the welfare of the poor and the deprived.
Sister Nivedita used to suffer a lot from the tyranny of the British Raj.
The British tried to force Indians not only physically but also psychologically.
Efforts are being made to degrade our culture.
Bhagni Nivedita revived the pride of Indian culture.
He encouraged the national consciousness, awakened and helped unite the people.
He travelled across the globe and fought against the propaganda of Sanatan Dharma and philosophy.
Renowned nationalist Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati will be inspired by his revolutionary poems Pudumai Penn, NewWomen and Nari Sashaktikaran.
It is said that Bhagni Nivedita was the source of inspiration for all these things.
The great scientist Bhagni Vedita had also helped Jagdish Chandra Bose in many ways.
Through his writings and conferences, Shri Basu helped in publication and publication of all the tests and exams.
This is a wonderful co-existence of India where the spirituality and science of our culture are incompatible with each other.
Sister Nivedita and Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose.
In 1899, Kalkata metropolitan cities saw a devastating planet.
Sister Nivedita, ignoring her health, came forward in the Rastaghat, Narmada Safai Abhiyan.
This is the woman who gave herself away from luxury and joy for the poor and the distressed.
Sister Nivedita, who has given her everything to India, is resting here.
Undoubtedly, it's true.
It will be a tribute to this great personality - if every Indian learns from his life and follows his exhibition.
Thank you for your phone.
First of all, I convey my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the most important part of building a New India.
Your anxiety is perfect, the diseases that were seen earlier in old age are now being seen in your childhood.
It was astonishing to hear that kids too are suffering from diabetes these days.
But there has been a lot of change in our lifestyle.
Today, these diseases are called lifestyle disorders.
The main causes of these diseases at a young age are lack of physical labour and change in food habits.
It should be monitored by both the society and the family.
Considering this, there is no need for unusual or terrible change.
What is needed is to concentrate on small things and make them subject to their habits.
I want the family members to be conscious so that the kids can play open fields.
If possible, the elders of the family will also join them.
Children should be habituated to using stairs to convert elevators.
After dinner, the whole family will walk with the kids.
India Yoga will help in creating a healthy life-style habit of our youth and preventing lifestyle disorders.
Yoga is simple because Yoga can only be taught.
No specific equipment or field.
Several tests are being conducted in the field of Yoga in diabetes control.
A lot of work has been going on in AIIMS and the results so far are very optimistic.
He said that Ayurveda and Yoga should not only be treated as disease-free, but also as part of everyday life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have made good news in the last few days from the world of sports.
India has good news in badminton as in Hawkey.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikanth has won the excellent Kheldenmark Open and has honoured every Indian.
After the Indonesian Open and Australian Open, this is his third super film.
I congratulate this youngster for his success and Indias pride.
Friends, FIFA Under-17 World Cup was held this month.
The teams from all over the world have come to India to participate and their sporting skills have impressed us.
I had a chance to see a match.
The audience was very enthusiastic.
World Cup is a big event, where the world is watching you.
I was surprised to see the enthusiasm, zeal and inspiration of the young players.
The World Cup has been successfully organised and all the teams have demonstrated their best skills.
Even if India cannot win the world, the players of India have won the hearts of all.
India and the entire world have enjoyed this festival and the entire football tournament is very enjoyable for football lovers.
The future of football is very bright and it's predicted.
I once again congratulate all the athletes, their colleagues and all sports enthusiasts.
My dear countrymen, if I have to deal well with the people about Swachh Bharat then I will have to do Mann Ki Baat every day and I will have to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes sometimes, sometimes sometimes, sometimes sometimes, sometimes sometimes, sometimes sometimes, sometimes sometimes, sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes, sometimes, sometimes sometimes, sometimes sometimes, sometimes sometimes, sometimes sometimes, sometimes sometimes, sometimes sometimes, sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes some or the other, sometimes, sometimes sometimes some or sometimes some or the other, sometimes sometimes
Somewhere there is an incident of innovation about cleanliness and sometimes there is a lot of enthusiasm towards the work of an officer.
A few days ago, I had received a bouquet where there is a description of the renovation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
The entire team of NGO organisation called Ecological Protection Organisation was conducting sanitation drives at Chandrapur Fort.
They sent me two pictures before and after Safai.
And I am surprised to see that those who are desperate to see the filthy environment around them, think how to clean such dirt, how to see the pictures of this Chandrapur Fort, I would like to tell them about how the young women of the Ecological Protection Organization have reflected in their labour, resolve, jihad and livelihood.
Your despair, your unbelief will disappear from them.
This Bhagirath effort is a unique example of beauty, dedication and dynamism for cleanliness.
The castle is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of all nations to protect and preserve our historical heritage.
I thank all the employees of the Ecological Protection Organization and all the people of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on the 4th of November, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.
Guru Nanak is not the first Guru of the Sikh community, he is the Jagadguru.
He spoke of the welfare of the entire humanity, equal to all the nations and communities.
Emphasis has been laid on womens self-esteem and empowerment.
Guru Nanak Dev travelled 228 thousand kilometers and spread the message of humanity in this journey.
He had met people, guided them to the path of honesty, sacrifice and dedication.
He didn't just say that he did that in his own life and in his own way.
He started the langarkhana and served the people.
Equality and harmony emerges from simultaneous consumption of food at anchorage.
Guru Nanak has said that there are three ways of life: chant the name of the Supreme, stay busy in labour and help the troubled.
Guru Nanak also created Guruvani for his propaganda.
550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak will be celebrated in 2019.
Come, let us try to move ahead with his teachings and teachings.
My dear countrymen, and after two days on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be celebrated.
We all know that he had created a plan for an integrated modern India.
We can learn a lot from the wonderful life of this great son of Mother India.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had worked as a catalyst for India.
Millions of Indians were ensured in the shadow of One Nation One Constitution.
His thinking gave him the strength to overcome all obstacles.
He has set a goal and has progressed in the past.
He used to say: Only a person who dreams of a nation where everyone has equal rights.
I want Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel to always inspire us.
He said that we cannot change the diversity of nations and communities. Every man and woman of India should have a love and a future of love and goodwill.
The words of Sardar Saheb are still the inspiration and energy of our New India Vision.
And that is why his birthday will be celebrated as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas.
His contribution to make our country an integral part of it is unforgettable.
On 31st October, Sardar Saheb's birthday, the Run for Unity will be organized across the country where children, women, youth and elderly people will be involved.
I urge you all to participate in the Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali, you have returned to your daily lives with a new resolve and a new commitment.
On behalf of me, I convey my best wishes to all my countrymen for fulfilling all their dreams.
What's the matter, September 2017
Three years have passed since Mann Ki Baat.
Today is the 36th edition.
Most of them inspire me.
And I take half an hour of your time every month, but people keep on talking about Mann Ki Baat for 30 days.
And that is why the government is also creating a simple sense of sensitivity.
And that is why the journey of three years of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of our countrymen, of their thoughts and feelings.
I am extremely grateful to the people of our country for the opportunity that I have got to share with them in such a short span of time.
In Mann Ki Baat, I often remember the words of Acharya Binoba Baat.
Acharya Binoba often used to say, unofficial, effective.
I am sure that after three years, sociologists, universities, researchers, media experts will definitely analyze this.
And I believe that this analysis will be very useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future, it will create a new consciousness and a new spirit.
And once I had said in Mann Ki Baat, we should think while eating that we will not waste as much as we need.
But then I have seen that so many letters have come from every corner of the country, so many social organizations and many youngsters have been doing this thing for a long time.
And then I have seen how many people have come forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
Once I saw the Selfie With Daughter of a Panchayat Chief in Haryana and I kept it in front of everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only in India but also in the entire world, a big campaign of Selfie with Daughter has been started.
A few days ago, I had met the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
Send photos of Incredible India wherever you go.
Millions of photographs from every corner of India have become a huge resource for those who work in the tourism sector.
In Mann Ki Baat, I felt how small events created a massive movement.
Today, I feel like, because when I think that it has been three years, how many things have been happening in my mind for the last three years.
The country is moving ahead every moment to take the right path.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the betterment of others, for the betterment of the society and for the betterment of the country.
In my three year journey of Mann Ki Baat, I have learnt it from my countrymen, I have learnt it.
This is a huge resource, a huge power for any country.
And I have seen that there has been a lot of attraction towards Khadi recently and I have naturally said that no one will have to go to Khadi.
But there are many kinds of fabrics, why not Khadi
It looks like a younger generation has been attracted to Khadi.
The sale of Khadi has increased and a direct connection has been created with the employment of the poor.
On 2nd October, Khadi was released and a lot of discount was received.
Once again, I would like to say that we should take forward the campaign for Khadi and increase it further.
We are working with this feeling that we will get the light of Deepawali in the houses of the poor by buying Khadi.
The poor of our country will get a boost from this work and we should do it.
And in order to enhance the interest of this Khadi, the Khadi workers and the people associated with the Khadi government of India have been encouraged to think in a new way.
How can we bring new technologies, how to increase productivity, how to bring solar energy and handlooms
How can we revive the old tradition that was closed for nearly 20, 25, 30 years
A Khadi Ashram at Sewapur, Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh was closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
Several methods have been added.
New opportunities have been created for many people.
The Khadi and Village Entrepreneurship Training Centre (KVETC) which has been closed in Pampore, Kashmir has a lot to offer in this regard.
I am glad that the new generation has been able to provide new things to the new generation for the modernization of this training centre. And I am glad that the big corporate houses have started giving the gifts to the people during Diwali.
People are giving a gift to each other.
We are all feeling the way things are moving forward.
My dear countrymen, we all made a solemn pledge in Mann Ki Baat last month and we decided that we will celebrate 15 days of Gandhi Jayanti across the country.
We will connect people with cleanliness.
Our honourable President has started this work and the country is connected to it.
The elderly, the men and women, the city-village have become a part of the cleanliness drive.
When I talk about Sankalp simultaneously, we can see how our Swachhta Abhiyan is moving on the path of pledge.
I'm sure some people are doing their jobs.
This time we have seen one more thing - first of all, we will clear one place, secondly, it may be that we will not defame any place in a conscious manner but if cleanliness is to be a habit then we need a revolutionary change in our judiciary.
This time, several competitions were organized in the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign.
More than 2. 5 crore children participated in the Swachhta Pakhwada.
Thousands of children have painted.
They have painted their own imagination of cleanliness.
Whenever there is talk of cleanliness, I never forget to express my gratitude to the people of the media.
We are witnessing the Swachhata Hi Seva Movement that how much electronic media and print media can serve the country.
A few days ago, somebody had attracted my attention to the 18-year-old young Bilal Dar from Srinagar.
For the past 5-6 years, Bilal has been working on cleanliness since the age of 12-13 years.
Plastic, polythene, used bottles, waste wastewater are cleaned in the largest lake in Asia near Srinagar.
I am glad that the municipality has not only created Brand Ambassador but has also given a uniform to Bilal, Bilal is also educating the people of other areas about cleanliness, inspiring them and not leaving the mark till the expected results are received.
Bilal Dar is a young but inspiring person who is interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we have to admit that the history of the future is born in the womb of history and when we talk about history, it is natural to remember the great men.
The month of October is the month to remember many of our great men.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel in October this year, many great men were born who led us in the 20th century and 21st century, who showed us the path of walking and who suffered a lot for the country.
When former President of India Shriman Abdul Kalamji spoke to the youth, he often talked about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh.
In his deep sense, he mentioned the programme and himself went to the village to witness the work done by Nanaji.
Remembering these great men, we remember them not to be of any benefit to them, so that we can find a way forward so that we can give the right direction to the future.
In the next episode of Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely talk about Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
We say that unity in diversity is the uniqueness of India.
We are proud of the diversity and the diversity that we are proud of, do we ever try to realise our diversity
I want to tell all my countrymen in Hindustan, especially to my young generation that we are in a state of consciousness.
Feel the separation of India, touch her and realise her pride.
This diversity of our country plays an important role in the development of your inner personality.
You go abroad, I don't mind, but sometimes you'll see your own house
People of North India don't know what is in South India
The people of western India do not know what is there in Eastern India
Our country is full of diversity.
When Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, all of them travelled to India then a new inspiration for the country was born to see and understand the country.
These great men have seen the country in a big way.
In the beginning of their work, they tried to understand and understand India.
He tried to make India self-reliant.
Can we not imbibe the norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms and norms of different states of our country, norms of different societies, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms of our country, norms, norms, norms, norms, norms of our country, norms, norms, norms, norm
There will be value addition in tourism only when we will be able to understand, understand and imbibe the characteristics of those places as a student and not just as a visitor.
I have got the opportunity to visit more than five hundred districts of my own Hindustan.
More than 4,500 districts have experienced night stay.
Today, when I am taking charge of this important responsibility of the country then the experience of that journey is very useful for me.
That's why I have a lot of benefits to understand.
My request is that in this huge India, unity in diversity is not just a slogan but also acknowledge the strength of our strength.
It will not be repeated if one type of new food can be eaten every day throughout life.
This is the greatest strength of our tourism.
I would like you to say that on this vacation, you just went out of your house for a little change.
Your concerns will be enormous.
What could be a bigger teacher than perception
Normally, from October to March, the time is extensive for tourism.
If you meet the people there, send them pictures.
Not only the beauty or architecture there, but also the beauty of the people there.
Please send all your excellent papers on your journey to MyGov and send them to the Narendra Modi App.
I have seen this thing that if you are the best tourist destination in your state for the development of India's tourism industry then every Indian should know about these seven things of his state.
If you can, you have to go to the seven places.
Can you give us any information about this
You see, if everyone in the same state sends these information, then I will tell the government to scrutinize them and make publicity about the seven common issues that have come from every state.
That is, how can we improve tourist destination from the inspiration of a human being
In the same way, the seven of the things that you have seen in the entire country, the best of them, you want someone to see it, someone should go there, you must know about it, you must send the names of seven such places to MyGov, NarendraModiApp.
The Government of India will work on it.
The government will accept the suggestions made by you people for making films, video-production, publicity literature, orientation, orientation etc.
Come, join me.
You can also be a big driver of tourism development from October to March.
I'm inviting you.
My dear countrymen, for the sake of being a human being, a lot of things touch my heart, and who shakes my mind.
I have a deep impact on my mind.
Because I'm a man like you.
Just a few days back, perhaps your vision has drawn - a wonderful example of women power and patriotism.
Lieutenant Swati and Nidhi, the Indian Army, have found two brave colours, which are an extraordinary heroine.
It is indeed extraordinary that the husband of wealth and funds had been martyred to serve Mother India.
We can imagine how the world will be in a bad shape at this young age.
But the martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadekar's wife, Swati Mahadek, fought against this difficult situation, took this decision and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to realising the dream of his husband.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey, her husband, Mukesh Dubey, worked as a hero in the army and when she was martyred for the motherland, decided to concentrate on her wife Nidhi and she also became a soldier.
It is very natural for every citizen to respect our women power, our heroes.
I congratulate these two sisters from the bottom of my heart.
They have given a new inspiration and a new consciousness to millions of people of the country.
Many congratulations to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, this time between Navratri festival and Deepawali is also a great opportunity for the youth of our country.
The World Cup of FIFA Under-17 is happening here.
I believe you'll hear football sounds everywhere.
Every generation will be attracted to football.
There will be no school-college field in India where our youngsters will not be able to play football.
Come, when the entire world is coming to play on the soil of India, we will also make this game a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, Navratri festival is going on.
Mother Durga's time.
The entire environment is full of pure fragrance.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country, to the mother power and to the aspirations of the people of our country.
May the country have the power to tackle every challenge.
May the country progress at a rapid pace and in the 75 years of Indias independence in 2022, we have started our journey by creating a road map of five years to realise the resolve, hard work and resolution of 125 crore countrymen.
My best wishes to you all.
Celebrate the festival, enlighten the spirit.
Mann Ki Baat, August, 2017
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
Our country is a country of Buddha and Gandhi, a country of Sardar Patel who is dedicated to the unity of the country.
Since ancient times, the universal values, non-violence and harmony that our ancestors have nurtured are linked to our lives.
Ahinsa Param Dharma - We have been listening to it since childhood.
I had said from the Red Fort that violence will not be forbidden in the name of faith, it can be communal belief, belief in political ideology or belief in any tradition.
No one has the right to enact laws in the name of faith.
Dr.
The Constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us, the right to every individual is ensured there.
I want to assure the countrymen that the government or the country will not compel anybody, individual or community, whoever goes on the path of violence against those who have taken the law.
Everyone has to be censored to the law, the law will judge him and the culprit will be punished.
Even our festivals are full of diversity.
Many of our festivals are directly related to the farmers and the fishermen brothers and sisters.
Today, I am talking about the festival, so first of all, I would like to tell you the problem of irritation.
Yesterday, the festival of Sambastari was celebrated in the Jain community.
In the Jain community, Purushan Parva is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
The festival is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
And it is also known as the festival of forgiveness and on this day there is a tradition of conveying best wishes to each other.
Besides, our scriptures say, forgiveness is blessed with bravery.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated everywhere in India with great zeal and enthusiasm.
And when we talk of Ganesh Chaturthi then the issue of Ganesh Chaturthi comes naturally.
This great festival of Ganesh Chaturthi lasted for 10 days.
And we know this festival as a symbol of unity, equality and sanctity.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the Ganesh Festival.
Now the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala.
Onam is one of the major festivals of Kerala in Indias multi-faceted festivals.
This festival is unique for its social and cultural significance.
The festival reminds us of the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
And now this festival has also become a centre of attraction for tourism.
Besides, I would also like to tell the countrymen that like the Navratri festival of Gujarat or the Durga Festival of West Bengal, today it has become the main attraction of tourism.
There is a lot of opportunity to attract foreigners in other festivals of our country.
We have to think about what steps we can take in the coming days.
Id-ul-uhah will be a part of this festival.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Id-ul-uha.
Festivals and cleanliness are part of our family life.
Preparations for the festival begin with cleanliness.
It is not new, but it is important to transform transparency into a social fabric.
Universal cleanliness is not only in our homes but in every village, in every city, in our state, in our country and in every country, this cleanliness and festival has to be tied to a thread that will be unbroken.
My dear countrymen, the language of modernisation is changing.
Nowadays this new dimension has become a new parameter.
You will be able to see that these days the children are building the statues of Ganesh with soil in the house.
The Swachhta Abhiyan that we launched three years ago, is the third year of its launch on 2nd October.
In such a scenario, the officers of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat have taken up the task of cleaning and cleaning 22 flood affected temples and 3 mosques.
If this effort to ensure dedicated sanitation becomes a sustainable part of our nature then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I urge you all to come again, once again, on 2nd October, 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti, I started campaigning for Swachhata Hi Seva, just as I was told earlier, Jal Sewa is Prabhu Seva and Swachhata Hi Seva is the best.
We are creating an environment conducive to cleanliness across the country.
The way opportunities are available and whenever opportunities are available, we should look for opportunities and utilize them.
Shramdaan.
Work together on holidays or Sundays.
Go to the neighbouring colonies, go to the nearby villages, transform it into a movement.
I appeal to all the NGOs, schools, colleges, social-cultural-political leaders, government officials, collectors and panchayat chiefs to create an atmosphere that will fulfil the dream of Gandhiji on 2nd October, 15 days before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Mygov.
In-I, a department has been created where after the construction of toilets, you can enroll your name and the names of those families which you have helped in this thing.
Friends from my social media can play a creative campaign in the virtual world that can be really inspiring.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is organizing a short film and film drawing competition under Swachh Sankalp Se Swachh Siddhi campaign.
You can write articles in different languages and there is no specific age limit for this competition.
Among the participants, three at the district level and three at the state level will be selected and rewarded.
I urge you all to participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
You must take some steps for cleanliness.
Millions and millions of people sometimes send messages or communicate on the phone, send a message which is a supreme achievement and rare asset for me.
This is a great opportunity for me to know the thoughts and feelings of the people of the country.
I look forward to watching the Mann Ki Baat programme more than ever before.
I wait very enthusiastically because I can learn a lot from you.
I try to see, hear, read and know as much as you can.
"Prime Minister, I am calling Oparna from Pune.
I want to tell you about one of my friends.
He's always trying to help people, but he's got a mischief that I'm surprised to see.
I once went to mall with him to buy.
I saw he bought a two-thousand-rupee sari and spent Rs.450 for the pizza.
At the same time, he spent a long time with Autowallers for five rupees to go to Mal.
He did the same thing while buying vegetables on the way back and saved four-five pieces.
I felt terrible.
We spend a lot of money in big shops without guarantee, but we dont believe in the small amount of money we pay to our labourer brothers and sisters.
My belief is that after listening to this phone, you have decided not to be awake, you have decided not to make that mistake.
Don't you think that whenever someone comes to our house to sell things, comes to the ferry, we work with a small shopkeeper and a vegetable seller, sometimes we need to do something with autonomy. Whenever we work with a stalwart, whenever we come to work with a stalwart, we get into a lot of hardships then we pay less than two rupees or less than five rupees.
And when a person like us goes to a big restaurant to eat food, then don't see what is written in the bill.
Not only this, I don't care if I buy saris in a showroom, but if I work with a poor person, I don't give up.
There will not be any difference in your life for two rupees, five rupees but have you ever thought of how deep your behavior hurts her mind
I'm grateful to you, madam. You called me with such a heart-to-heart message.
I believe that if my countrymen have a habit of living with the poor then they will definitely abandon it.
My dear young friends, on August 29th, the entire country celebrates the National Sports Day.
This day marks the birth anniversary of Major Dhyan Chand ji, the great hockey player and wizard of hockey.
His contribution to Hockey is incredible.
I am reminded of this thing because I want our country to be associated with the new generation of sports.
Let sports become part of our lives.
If we are the youngest country in the world, we should also look into the playground.
Playing means physical fitness, mental alertness, personal enhancment.
Playing on the one hand is a wonderful bond of hearts.
May the young generation of our country progress in the field of sports and today in the era of computers, I would like to make sure that the playing field is more important than the playing field.
Play on the computer but sometimes even in the fields outside, you can do it hard with football.
Perhaps cricket matches on the computer, but playing cricket under the sky on the open ground is a different joy.
Today, the situation is such that the kids start watching the cartoon movies at one corner of the house or the mobile game gets mixed up and the mother starts screaming and telling them when will you get out
Time changed, it was an era when Mother told the boy, when will you come and today it has happened to tell Mother, Dad, when will you go out
Friends, Ministry of Youth Affairs Sports has created a sports talent search portal for sports talent and for its development where children from all over the country who have achieved some talent in sports, they can upload their video or video on this portal.
Ministry of Sports will impart training to Selected Emerging Players and the Ministry will launch it tomorrow.
It is a matter of great happiness for our youngsters that on October 6-28, 2019, the Seventeenth World Cup will be held in India.
Twenty-four teams of the world are going to make India their home.
Let us welcome our young guests from across the globe to the festival of sports, enjoy sports and create an appropriate environment in the country.
Today, when I am talking about sports, I am reminded of the fact that last week's interactions are a matter of concern and I want to share it with my countrymen.
I got the opportunity to meet some young girls and some of them were born in the lap of the Himalayas, who never had links with the sea.
Six daughters of our country who work in the Navy, their emotions and enthusiasm will inspire all of us.
These six daughters, with a small boat - I-NS Tarini, will be able to cross the sea.
This mission has been named as Navika Sagar Parikrama and they will reach India after several months after travelling all over the world.
Sometimes forty days in the water.
Sometimes he will spend thirty days together in water.
Between the waves of the sea, our brave six daughters, and this is the first thing in the world.
There is no Indian who will not be proud of our daughters
I salute the feelings of these girls, and I have asked them to share their thoughts with the entire country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their thinking on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read them.
Because, in a way, it's a brave story, it's a matter of thought, and I'm glad to bring these girls to you.
My best wishes to these daughters, the blessings of waves.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we all celebrate Teachers Day.
The birthday of Dr. Radhakrishnan ji, the former President of our country.
He was the President, but he made himself a teacher for the rest of his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was a devoted life to education.
The values of a teacher are the joys of awakening and enlightening creation among his students.
Can we start a campaign in a mission mode
Just like the mothers of the family, the role of teachers in the society will be remembered when there is talk of transformation in our country.
Teachers have a huge role in transformation.
Every teacher has a transformational artificiality in his life and we are trying our best.
It will play a major role in the country's transformation.
Let us move ahead with the mantra of Teach to Transform.
My name is Dr. Anya Awasthi.
I am a resident of Mumbai and affiliated with the I-India Research Centre of Howard University.
This scheme was launched on 28th August, 2014 with a dream.
Tomorrow, on 28th August, three years of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed.
30 crore Indians participated in this scheme and opened their first bank account.
The number of new account holders is more than the population of many countries in the world.
If there is money in the house or in the pocket, then you will feel like spending money.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited by the poor people of our country.
Again, those who have opened the accounts under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) have also got the benefit of insurance.
The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, with a premium of just one rupee and three rupees, has created a new confidence in the lives of the poor.
When these poor people are in trouble in many families, the head of the family has died, the result of that premium is getting two lakh rupees.
I have been told about the encouraging results of Jan Dhan Yojana, Rupay Card, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, the benefits of insurance for the common man.
My dear countrymen, let me tell you, "Muchchi Dukkam"
What's your mind, July 2017
The hearts of the people are such that the rainy season is very pleasant for the people.
Animals, birds, birds, nature, everyone is happy with the arrival of rains.
But sometimes when rain takes a terrible form, it shows how much water is capable of destruction.
Nature is our life-style, our nurturer, but sometimes floods, earthquake-like natural magnificence, its terrible forms of destruction are devastating.
The changes in the weather cycle and the surroundings have a negative effect.
During the last few days, some parts of India, especially Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, have been facing natural calamities due to heavy rains.
Floods are under observation.
Extensive rescue operations.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers are on their way.
The state government is also making all efforts to help the flood affected people in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations, citizens wishing to do service are making every effort to reach out to the people in this situation.
It affects agriculture, animals, infrastructure, infrastructure, electricity and connectivity.
In particular, for the loss of crops and farms of our farmer brothers, we have recently formulated a scheme to ensure that the insurance companies, especially the agricultural insurance companies can play a positive role so that the farmers can easily get the benefits.
People are talking about their duration.
Before the monsoon, most of the mock drills were put in place to prepare the entire government programme.
The NDRF team was appointed.
Gradually, we have created such a thing that we will do our job as per the forecast of rain so that we can get rid of the destruction.
Whenever I am ready for Mann Ki Baat, I see the citizens of my country who are more than me.
This time there are so many letters about GST, so many phone calls, and people are still glad about GST, asking questions.
I would like to tell you that Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I am extremely impressed by your speech on Chartered Accountants Day.
This is the reason in our country that GST has been started today.
I'd like to hear your opinion on this.
Thank you.
It has been almost a month since the GST was launched and the results are visible.
And I am glad that whenever a poor man writes a letter, how the prices of the poor have come down for GST, how the goods have become cheaper.
Anyone living in the North-East, in the remote mountainous regions, in the jungles writes in a letter that he was scared or he didn't know what would happen earlier. But now when I learn and understand this thing then I feel that the work has become easier than before.
Business has become much easier.
And the biggest thing is that the confidence of the consumers is increasing.
Now I see the impact of GST on the transportation logistics sector.
How the trucks have grown.
As a result, there is a strong smooth transition in which migration is taking place, new registration is taking place and this has led to a new confidence in the entire country.
And sometimes, economists, eminent people of management, scholars of technology, through their research, the use of GST in India will certainly be a model for the world.
This will become a case study for the world's universities.
This is because such a massive change in such a large scale, it is indeed a success for millions and millions of people to take it forward in such a large country.
The world will do research on this.
GST has been used, every state has participated in it, every state has its responsibility.
All decisions have been taken by all the States and Centres in unanimous manner.
And as a result, the primary goal of every government is that there should not be any pressure on the poor for GST.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the stakeholders of the Ministries, all the departments, central and state governments associated with this work.
GST is an excellent example of the success of India's inclusive energy.
This is a historical experience.
This is a campaign for social reforms.
I once again bow down to millions and millions of people who have made such a big effort.
My dear countrymen, the months of August Month Movement.
Yusuf Meh's Ali.
What happened on 9th August, 1942 to our new generation innovators
From 1857 to 1942, how much hard work has been done to the people of India, how much hard work has been done to them, how much hard work has been done for them, how much it has been done for them, how much it has been possible for them to fulfil their aspirations for independence.
This was the time when every corner of Hindustan, everywhere in the city and everywhere in the villages, all the educated, educated and poor fellow citizens shoulder to shoulder with the uit India Movement.
At the behest of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians had dedicated their lives to the struggle of 'Karenge Ya Marenge'.
After Mahatma Gandhi called for the uit India Movement on 9th August, the British sent all the big leaders to jail and then came forward to take up the movement.
Lohia, Jayaprakash Narayan is the second generation leader.
In the 1920 'Association Movement' and the 'uit India' movement of 1942, two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi were distinguished.
The face of the Non-Cooperation Movement was similar, followed by the situation in 42, the intensity of the movement increased so much that even a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of Karenge Yamarenge.
Behind these achievements were peoples participation, peoples participation, peoples participation and peoples participation.
The whole country fought together on that day.
I sometimes feel that India's first freedom struggle was in 1857 when we collected the leaves of history.
The war that began in 1857, took place every time till 1942, in some part of the country and in this long time, it gave rise to a strong demand for freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Every person is committed to doing something or the other.
Generations have changed, but the intensity of their resolve has not yet come to an end.
A group of people have come, have joined the struggles, have left, new parties have come, they have joined the struggles in the same way and they have tried their best to uplift the British Empire.
From 1857 to 1942, the movement was carried out in such a way that it reached its peak in 1942 and the venom of uit India was ruined in such a way that the British migrated to 1947 in five years.
Between 1857 and 1942, freedom struggle reached every country and from 1942 to 1947, the five decisive years of solemn pledge would be the reason for the country's independence.
These five years were the key determinants.
Now I want to connect you with this process.
In 1947, we became free and in 2017.
It's been 70 years.
The government's here.
Policy regulations have been framed, changed and enhanced.
Everyone has worked hard to get rid of the country's problems.
Efforts are being made to increase the income of the common man in the country, to eradicate poverty and to develop it.
Expectations have increased.
We will celebrate the 15th August of 2017 as the beginning of the Sankalp Parv and we will fulfil our resolutions by the time we complete 75 years of our independence in 2022.
From 1942 to 1945, when the country was at the forefront of independence, the five years from 2017 to 2022 could be the decisive year for Indias future.
After five years, we will celebrate 75 years of our independence.
A solemn pledge that we will achieve in the next five years.
Come, use technology to come forward with new ideas like video posts, blogs, books and new ideas.
This movement has to be transformed into a mass movement.
The Narendra Modi App will also host a uit India uiz competition for young friends.
The uiz Competition is an attempt to make the youth of the country familiar with the glorious history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am glad that in the last three years, I have received several proposals from every corner of the country on what should be discussed on 15th August, the main objective of these proposals is to make their dreams a word.
On 15th August, I will try to discuss these proposals as much as I can.
I'll finish in 40-45 or 50 minutes if it's too much.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk about another thing.
Socio-economic linkages with Indias economy are unprecedented.
It should never be rude.
Our festivals and festivals are not just for joy and joy.
Our festivals, festivals, social reforms, together with our festivals, are directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor in the country.
After a few days, Rakhibandhan, Janmashtami, Chaturveda, Chauth Chandra, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Deepawali etc. will be celebrated.
A simple joy is also associated with this festival.
A few months before the Rakhibandhan Festival, hundreds of families have become entrepreneurs in small families.
Several types of threads such as cotton, silk, etc. are used in different ways, and nowadays people prefer to keep homemade.
Hundreds of thousands of traders are associated with a festival like this.
Deepawali is directly related to those poor families.
Today, when I talk about festivals, festivals and the economy of the poor people associated with it, I also want to talk about the environment.
Sometimes I feel that the people of India are more conscious and active than me.
Last month, I was written by conscious citizens about the neighborhood.
They have appealed to me that during this period, I should talk about eco-friendly Ganesh on Ganesh Chaturthi so that people like earth-made Ganesh and plan.
Lokmanya Tilak started this great tradition and this year marks the 125th anniversary of Ganesh Utsav.
125 years and 125 crore Indians.
Lokmanya Tilak started the festival of Ganesh with the spirit of social unity, awakening society and social reform.
Come, let us also remember him for organising this year's Ganesh Festival.
Come, let us link this festival with the economy of the poor, let us celebrate our festivals as a financial festival for the poor, let us enjoy our economic joy.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the upcoming festivities.
My dear countrymen, we have been consistently seeing that our daughters are bringing laurels to new heights in education, financial sector, social sector or sports.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters, we are honoured for them.
Just a few days ago, our fishermen showed extraordinary talent at the Women's Campaign.
This week, I had the opportunity to meet these players.
They had the impression on their faces.
I told them that I had a different assessment.
I have seen that if the players of India are failing then the anger of the countrymen falls on the players.
Some people say something that breaks the honour, say things that are very painful.
Not all this, girls praised what they did, gave them respect.
I have seen a beautiful change, and I have told these girls that you will see that this fortune has been fortunate to be fortunate only for you.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won the hearts of 125 crore countrymen.
In fact, the youth of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to enhance the name of the country.
My dear countrymen, once again I would like to remind you of the August movement and once again I would like to recall it on 9th August.
May every Indian, every countrymen continue to guide him for five years to fulfil his resolutions.
Come on, let's walk together, let's do something.
Let us move ahead with this belief that the fate of the country and the future of the country will be better.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2017
Weather is changing.
It was so hot this time.
But fortunately, the monsoon season has been following its footprints.
Rainfall has started in some parts of the country.
In the cold weather after the rains, it feels comfortable with the heat of the past.
We all have seen that whatever excitement or anxiety may be there in personal life or in public life, rains may occur but our mindset changes.
Today, the chariot of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated in different parts of the country with great enthusiasm and joy.
Nowadays, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated in some other places of the world.
The poor people of the country are specially associated with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
Very few people know that there is a word Juggernaut in English which means a beautiful chariot whose speed does not stop.
It is obvious that this word has come from Jagannath Devarath.
This shows how the world has acknowledged the importance of Jagannath Dev's journey.
My best wishes to you all on the occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
Come, let us collectively take the country forward by inspiring us from this festival.
In this month of Ramzan, I came to know about a very inspiring incident in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In this small village, he lived in thousands of Muslim brothers and sisters.
In the month of Ramzan, everyone in the village decided to build a toilet.
17 lakhs have been disbursed to the government for construction of private toilets.
You will be happy to know that even in this holy month of Ramzan, the Muslim brothers and sisters have returned the government's 17 lakh rupees.
17 lakh per annum for other services.
I express my gratitude to all the villagers of Mubarakpur on this auspicious occasion of Ramzan.
Everything is very inspiring.
The most important thing is that they have made Barrackpore Open Defecation Free.
We know that three states of our country - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala - have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the administration and the people of this state for completing this work.
We are very well aware of the fact that we have to work hard either in a personal life or in a social life.
If my handwriting is bad, I have to try to fix it for a long time.
This is how physical and psychological changes occur.
Cleanliness is the same.
Some bad habits have become our nature.
Everybody's attention needs to be drawn.
Inspiring incidents will also be remembered again and again.
I am glad that cleanliness is no longer a government programme.
It is taking the shape of a mass movement in the society.
When people associated with the administration take this work forward with the participation of the people, it naturally increases the strength.
I am reminded of a good thing that I want to tell you.
The incident took place in Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
Their aim was to build 71 Village Panchayats and 10,000 Family Toilets in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the local administration and local administration have successfully completed 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71,000 villages have become Open Defecation Free.
In-A, all these suggestions come in the All India Radio.
It is important to be conscious of democracy and that is why it is necessary to remind them of the events that hit democracy and promote goodwill for democracy.
25th June, 1971, is such a dark day that no Indian can forget about democracy.
The entire country was transformed into prisons.
The voices of the opposition were stunned.
Eminent leaders of the country including Jaiprakash Narayan were imprisoned.
The judicial system didn't escape the worst situation.
The newspaper was completely unnecessary.
Students from today's journalistic world, even those working towards democracy, have repeatedly recalled the dark day and have been consistently striving to increase awareness about democracy and should continue to do so.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also jailed.
During the year of emergency, Atal ji wrote a poem describing his mental state of time.
We have to strengthen this heritage.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud of the world today.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world grew.
People from the sea to the mountains welcomed the rays of sun through Yoga morning and evening.
Is there an Indian who will not be proud of it
Its not like that Yoga was not practiced earlier, but today when Yoga has been tied up with the help of Yoga then Yoga has become a cause of global connectivity.
Almost all the countries of the world have adopted this vision of Yoga.
On the one hand, over the Great Wall of China, people have practiced Yoga in Peru's World Heritage Site at a height of 2,400 meters above sea level.
The Eiffel Tower was shadowed by people in France.
More than four thousand people have joined the UAE in Abu Dhabi.
In the Herat of Afghanistan, the India-Afghan Friendship Dam has given India a new dimension of friendship by associating itself with the Salma Dam.
In a small country like Singapore, programmes were organized in seventy-five locations and they carried out an expedition throughout the week.
The United Nations has released 10 postage stamps on International Day of Yoga.
Headquarters, United Nations Headquarters (UNH) under the aegis of Yoga specialists.
UN employees, world-class diplomats participated in this.
Once again, Yoga has created a world record.
Around 50 thousand people have joined hands in building a new world record in Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But for the first time, I am fortunate to join the rains.
The Siachen where our soldiers are at 20, 25, 40 degrees Celsius has also been practiced.
Our Armed Forces, be it BS-F, IT-BP, C-R-P-F-Hoh, CI-S-F, all have joined hands with their duties.
On the occasion of Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, since it was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that the three generations of the family should join together and share their photographs.
Some TV channels have taken this matter further.
I have received a lot of photographs in this regard, some of them are photographed and kept on the Narendra Modi App.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to attend a very dear organisation.
For a few days, a good programme is being organised in Kerala, a peoples teaching habit has been developed through the PENPONICKAR Foundation, people are encouraging people to read books, hence reading day, reading menth is being celebrated.
I had the opportunity to go to the auspicious time, and I was told there that we didn't raise flowers, we gave them books.
I'm nice.
This time I also remembered the fact that I had left the center of concentration.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a ritual in the government that we will not raise it, we will not give it or we will welcome it with the handkerchief.
He will be a manufacturer of Khadi so that Khadi gets a boost.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this was the habit of everyone, but after coming here, I lost that habit.
But that habit resurfaced in Kerala.
And I'm starting to issue notices to the government again.
We can gradually create a habit.
Flowers are very low in life.
Once you have to take it off your hand.
But if I give the book then it becomes a part of the household and becomes a member of the family.
I went to London, the ueen of Britain, ueen Elizabeth invited me to dinner.
It has been so many years since ueen Elizabeth took care of Mahatma Gandhi's handkerchief.
And I've seen him very happy to go.
I didn't know if he wanted me to touch once.
A small gift from Mahatma Gandhi has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
I am confident that these habits do not change overnight and sometimes there is a criticism in saying such a thing.
But despite this, such a thing should be spoken, efforts should be made.
Now I can't say I'm going somewhere and somebody left with flowers, then I'll tell him I can't do it.
But, whatever it is, there will be discussions, but we should continue to talk, it will gradually change.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work has been done in the direction of becoming the Prime Minister.
I have to immerse myself in the file but I have made a habit of reading some letters from the letters that I received and this is an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different kinds of people wrote letters.
I thought I'd read a letter like this.
A housewife from Tamil Nadu, Arulmozhi Sarwan, has written a letter to him.
I had thought of doing something to tackle my culture, to handle children's education so that there could be some financial implications for culture.
In the same way, I started the work of lending some loans from the banks under the 'Mudra Yojana' and buying some goods from the market.
I heard that the government has started a system called Governance e-Marketplace.
So I'm registering myself in the system.
Whoever wants to supply any goods to the government, there can be electric bulbs, dustbins, brooms, chairs, tables, you can register whatever you want to sell.
He wrote, First of all, I got the money from the Mudra Yojana and started my business, then I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office, PMO, after registering all my sales items at E-GEM.
It was an unknown news to me, asking me what the PMO wanted to buy
He said he bought the lunch thermos and got 1600 pamants.
Yeah, that's Empowerment.
It has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship as well.
GovernmentE-Marketplace-GEM
I would like that the number of people who want to sell something to the government should continue to grow.
I understand that it is an invaluable example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance and its goals are MinimumPrice and Maximumese, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we can take pride in Yoga and on the other we can also take pride in the success of space science.
This is India's specialty, Yoga has covered our country and it is our country's far-flung space expedition.
Earlier, India had achieved a lot in sports and science.
Today, India is not only on the planet but also on the planet.
Two days ago, ISRO has launched 30 nanosatilites along with Cartosat-24 satellites.
Besides India, almost 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America have joined these satellites.
These nano-satellites in India will also provide immense useful information in the field of agriculture and forecasting of natural fodder for the benefit of farmers.
A few days ago, we all remember that ISRO has successfully launched GSAT-19.
Just imagine, how big our scientists have found in space research.
On 19th June, Mars Mission completed 1000 days.
You all remember that for this Mars mission, we were successfully engaged in orbiting and the term was fixed for six months.
Its work was six months.
But what an extraordinary skill of our scientists has been able to complete a thousand days even after six months.
Our scientific journey that has been completed for a thousand days has been guiding us greatly in the field of space research.
Our younger generations are boosting their skills and their physical capabilities in the field of education as well as sports.
In Indonesia and Spain, Indias badminton player Kidambi Championship has made the country proud.
I congratulate Shrikanth and his coach for this retirement.
T.
Sports personality plays an important role in development.
Sports contributes significantly to the development of a holistic personality.
There is no dearth of patriotism in the country.
If the kids and kids of the family are inclined towards sports, they should be encouraged.
Once again, the countrymen, the rainy season, the festival of festivals, in a way, gives a lot of pride to this time.
What the hell is your mind, May 2017
Today, when I talk to you people, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the people of the world, especially the Muslim community, on this auspicious month of Ramzan.
During Ramzan, special emphasis is laid on prayers, spirituality and compassion.
We are fortunate to be Hindustani. Our forefathers have created such a tradition that Indians can take pride in it.
We can take pride in the fact that India is home to all communities of the world.
This is a country that believes in God or atheist who worships idols or those who oppose the idol worship, all kinds of thinking, all kinds of worshipping methods, all kinds of traditions and people have acquired the ability to lead their lives together.
And be it religion, community, thinking or tradition, it gives us one message - peace, unity and goodwill.
This holy month of Ramzan will help in furthering this current of peace, unity and goodwill.
I once again convey my best wishes.
Last time when I had spoken Mann Ki Baat, I used a word, especially the youngsters told me to do something new, to get out of the comfort zone with a new experience.
And this is the age of survival - to be a little risky, tough.
I'm glad that many people gave me feedback.
Personally, they encouraged me to speak my own words.
There are so many messages that I can't fall, I can't even hear the messages sent by everyone.
However, I have seen all the things that have come upon me, some are trying to learn songs, some are listening to new musical instruments, some are trying to learn new things by using YouTube, some are trying to learn new languages, some are learning cooking, some are learning dance, some are learning drama, some are writing poetry.
My reading habit almost stopped.
That's why I tried to fall on this vacation.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realised how much struggle was made for India's freedom, how many lives the freedom fighters had spent years in jail.
I got inspired from the life of Bhagat Singh who had done a lot in a very young age.
That's why I request you to say something about this in today's session.
I am glad that today's youngsters are expressing their desire to know about our history, our freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives for our country.
I went to Andaman and Nicobar many years ago.
I went to see Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar sat in jail and wrote a book Manji Janmath.
Writing poems on the prison walls.
He was locked up in a small room.
How much hard it was to bear for freedom.
I am inspired to see the Cellular Jail when I read the book Manji Janmath of Savarkar ji.
There's a light and sound show that's very inspiring.
There is no such state in Hindustan, there are no language speaking people who did not suffer from drinking water for freedom, who did not lose their lives in this cellular jail in Andaman.
If you ever get a chance, you will definitely visit the pilgrimage centre of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, the first Monday of 5th June.
And this year the theme of the United Nations is Connecting People toNature.
In other words ' back to basics ' .
And who has said something better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi has repeatedly said: "One must carry about a world one will not see". It is our duty to think and take care of the world we have not seen.
After getting tired, the window of the house opens up and breathes fresh air.
Whenever we are connected to the Panchbhav, we are connected to that Panchbhav then you are the one who brings a new life and a new passion to our body.
We all saw it, but we didn't think about it, we couldn't tie it to a rope.
After that, you must see that whenever you are associated with various natural conditions, there will be a new consciousness in you.
And that is why on 5th June, we should launch our own campaigns across the world to connect with nature.
We have some fruits of what our ancestors have done to protect the environment.
If we protect the environment, our next generation will get its results.
The world and the environment are considered to be the source of energy in Vedas.
We are told here - Mother Land: Son of the Earth:
It is said in the Vedas that the sacredness between us is for our world.
Earth is our mother and we are his children.
If we think of Lord Buddha then one thing comes out that the birth of Lord Buddha, the attainment of his knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana were done on the trees only.
But we need to connect him with modern words and with modern debates.
This time, I got news from different states.
With the onset of rains, a big campaign to plant trees has started in almost all the states.
Millions of trees are planted.
The world celebrates this day as World Yoga Day.
In a short span of time, on 21st June, this World Yoga Day has expanded all over the world and is involving people.
On the one hand, many powers that discriminate in the world are showing its distorted forms and at this time World Yoga Day is a major contributor to India.
Through Yoga, we have bound the entire world together.
Just as Yoga binds the body, mind, mind and soul together, Yoga has binding the world together.
In this context, Yoga has a major role to play in ensuring a stress-free life.
Yoga is not just an exercise , it is a result of health , it is a combination of body , mind , judgement and this combination is possible only through yoga exercise .
Two days ago, I wrote letters to the governments and leaders of all the countries of the world on Yoga Day.
Last year I had announced some Yoga related competitions and announced some awards.
A funny proposition.
He said, This is the third International Day of Yoga, I would like to urge all three generations to practice Yoga on this 3rd International Day of Yoga.
Brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters should practice Yoga along with three generations and upload their photos.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow, a lucky combination of Yoga will showcase a new direction.
I thank you for this proposal and I believe that as we have carried out the drive of Selfie with Daughter, we have created a joyous experience, the pictures of these three generations of Yoga will create a hustle-bustle in the entire country and the world.
You must send me a photo by the people of these three generations through the Narendra Modi App in MyGov, where people of the three generations are practicing Yoga.
It'll be tomorrow, today and tomorrow, a beautiful tomorrow guarantee.
I invite you all.
There are about three weeks left for International Day of Yoga.
Start a habit today.
You should also spread the message of Yoga for three weeks and involve people.
This is the movement of a kind of Preventive Health Care.
I invite all of you to participate in it.
Since the time you have given me the responsibility of working as the Chief Servant, and from the Red Fort, I had got the opportunity to speak on the 15th of August.
I have been visiting different parts of India since that day.
Nowadays, on Modi ji, on TV and on social media, wherever you are going, people of that place are paying special attention to cleanliness.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have adopted Swachhata as a mission in a comprehensive manner.
Even the elderly have become aware of cleanliness.
Sometimes the younger ones have seen the dumping of their dust.
The cleanliness drive that you have started from Kashi Ghat has taken the face of a movement through your inspiration.
You are right, wherever I go, there is a government sanitation work but nowadays there is a festival of cleanliness in the society.
But when this phone call came, I thought and saw that yes, that's right.
The rest will be ready to welcome the Prime Minister, but the first is Swachhata.
It will automatically enjoy a transparent person.
I would like to thank everyone for emphasizing on this cleanliness.
Someone gave me an offer.
Well, it's a funny proposal.
I don't know if I can do it.
Modi ji, when you are on an invitation, you will tell me that if you invite me then what level of cleanliness will be, how many tons of waste will you give me, on that basis I will decide to go.
Dea is very good, but I have to think.
Again, there's a need to be a movement, and a few tons of waste will be cleaned instead of other things.
How many people we're gonna save from illness
How big a humanity will be.
Once we consider it as a wealth, we will have a new way of Waste Management.
Youngsters associated with start-ups will come forward with new plans and new instruments.
It is expected that dry dustbin and wet waste will be removed from the green dustbin in these four thousand cities.
The waste of kitchens, such as vegetables, peas, eggs, leaves of trees, green dustbin.
All these things are such that if you keep in mind the greenery of your food then you will remember what to do with the green dustbin.
And the remaining waste materials such as unnecessary papers, iron, cardboards, glass, clothing, plastic, polythene, rubber and other metallic items such as dry waste, which are required to be recycled by the machines, are not usually used in these things.
I believe that we will be able to develop a habit like this and we will have to take new steps for cleanliness so that we can fulfil the dreams that Gandhiji dreamt of cleanliness.
Today, I would like to mention with pride that if a person thinks about it then how big a movement can be created.
Cleanliness is such a thing.
During the last few days, you must have heard a news that the stinking Barsoba Beach of Mumbai has become a clean and clean Barsoba Beach.
It wasn't a sudden, a citizen worked hard for 80-90 weeks to change the image of Barsoba Beach, making Barsoba beach clean, beautiful by removing thousands of tons of waste.
And he took charge of it, Versova Residence Volunteer.
Shriman Afroz Shah, an individual, gradually joined the work with utmost vigour since October 2015 and became a peoples movement.
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) awarded Afroz Shah for this purpose.
He was the first Indian to be awarded the Championsof the Earth Award.
I came to know that the local women were leading the most.
They took torches to create awareness among the masses, in every street, in every household, they inspired everyone to do so.
I extend my warm greetings to all these mothers and sisters.
I also congratulate the Governors of Jammu and Kashmir for the beautiful launch of an Open Defecation Free Block.
My dear countrymen, the work done by the present government for the last three years has been continuously being discussed in newspapers, TV channels and social media for the past 15 days.
Three years ago, you took over as the Chief Servant.
People from all walks of life have analyzed it.
This is a good tradition for democracy.
I also thank all those who have given critical and important feedback, for taking into account the misconceptions, shortcomings, etc.
This criticism is essential for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, because of this a small citizen like me and you, the kind of impact that affects the minds of a common citizen is the same.
There are hundreds of families who have written this to me.
As a simple human being, as a simple citizen, it has made a special impact on my mind, it has encouraged me.
I'm grateful to Akbar.
Come, let us all move ahead in this environment with love and affection.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
And the curiosity of the children, the aspirations of the younger generation, the aspirations of the elders, the feelings of the elders, etc.
Every time the inputs for Mann Ki Baat have been analyzed in detail by the government.
What are the suggestions, what are the complaints, what are the feelings of people
Totally, people's nature is advisable to others.
On the train, if someone wishes to go on a bus, then do the same with others.
But when I tried to look at these things, I was filled.
Most of the people sent suggestions, tried to reach me, who really did something in their own life.
They have tried to do some good work according to their own intellect, strength, capability and opportunities.
And when I knew it, I thought these suggestions weren't simple.
It's all from the fountains of people's experiences.
Some people feel that if people listen to these things while working there, they will be able to create a comprehensive form, it will be of benefit to many people.
Not only this, whenever I mention anything, I feel like this and it's very happy.
I have never imagined that our country, especially the younger generation, has been working on this thing for a long time.
For a few years, I knew that some social organisations have been working on this thing but I can see that the young generation of my country is working on this thing after a long time.
Many sent me video.
There are many places where bread is being run.
People gather bread on their own in the bread bank, deposit their bread, and those people who are poor, they collect them for themselves.
Those who are giving, they love it, and those who are doing it, they don't feel like their own.
This is an example of how society works through cooperation.
This is the last day of April.
On 1st May, Gujarat and Maharashtra got recognition as kingdoms.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of both the states.
Both the states have worked towards achieving new goals of development and have worked for the betterment of the country.
And in both the states, the arrival of great men and their livelihoods in every sector of the society continues to inspire us.
Remembering the legends of the two states, we should pledge to take our own states, our own countries, our societies, our cities and our families to greater heights after 75 years of independence in 2022.
It should be planned to make this resolve a reality, and all citizens should enhance their collaboration.
The time has come for March-April to experience the kind of heat that was there in our country.
When I was asking people for advice in Mann Kibat, I had suggested what should be done in this summer and the people gave it.
All these things are in vogue, nothing new, but it is useful if you re-think them at a particular time.
And I see that the family members are doing this work very well.
Once they realize why they should fill this water, then ten times a day they go to see whether there is water in the vessel or not.
And the birds are coming or seeing.
I believe this is a game, but it is a unique way to inspire the real boys.
In our country, we live together with the nature of animals and birds, colour them, yet we have to make concerted efforts to preserve them.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a hundred years of Dharmaguru Abhimana Saheb of Dawoodi Bohra Samaj was completed.
He was alive for 103 years.
And to celebrate his 100 years, the Bohra community carried out a massive campaign to save the slaves through the Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to honour this mission.
Approximately thousand bird feeders spread them across the corner of the world.
This campaign has been launched in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes I have become so busy that I have forgotten to give some water to the news papers, milkmen, vegetables, postman who come to my house in the summer days.
Young friends, I would like to talk to you too.
Sometimes I feel that some of our younger generations are enjoying living from the comfort zone.
Their parents have brought up among their aggretopes.
Some people pass through extreme adversity but most people live this life of comfortzone.
Now the test is over, a lot of plans have been made to make fun of the holiday.
It's fun to get hot in the summer.
But I would like to talk about how your vacation will be done as a friend.
I'm sure some people will listen to me and tell me.
Sometimes there is a difference between watching things on TV or reading books or listening to people who are familiar with them and feeling themselves.
May the test be effective, maybe a little out of the comfortzone.
We are middle class families, happy families.
Friends, Have you ever thought that without reservation, I would like to sit in the second classroom of the train and travel for 24 hours.
Sometimes feel it, I don't tell you to take it out, but do it once or twice.
In the morning, he used his football, volleyball or other sports equipment to go to a very poor village.
Play with those poor boys yourself, you will see, you will feel that you have never enjoyed playing with your life before.
You must have seen how many changes will be brought about in the lives of those children who are living in the society when they will get the opportunity to meet you.
This experience will give you a lot of information.
Several voluntary organizations are doing this service.
Sometimes several summer camps are organised for personality development and it can be included in this.
If you have participated in the Summer Camp, you have been doing personality development courses, you must go freely to all those people of the society who have been deprived of these sub-categories and teach them what you have learnt.
You can teach me how to do this.
Concerned over the fact that technology has come to reduce the distance, but the result is that there are six synergies in the same house but the difference between them has increased so much that is imaginative.
Everyone is busy with new technology.
Living together is also a reform, unity is power.
Secondly, I'd like to tell you about your skills.
I try and lose myself for the best of the fruits. I am filled with a coaching class in Vacation.
Sometimes I'm scared, our younger generation is not going to be robots.
A little emphasis can be laid on improving skills.
Far from technology, one can try to spend time with oneself - someone has been learning musical instruments - Tamil, Telugu, Tamil Nadu, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi - if we look at it then somebody will find friends in our neighborhood.
If you don't swim, learn to swim, draw pictures, maybe there won't be a good picture, but you can try to draw something on the paper.
Do you ever want to learn how to drive auto-rickshaws
You see, this new experiment, its skills will give you joy and you will be able to get rid of the horrific rhythms that you have tied to life.
Get out of traditional life, do something, guys.
It's a chance to make life.
You might assume that all exams are over, we'll learn when we're in a new career, but we won't get a chance.
Again, you'll get into some other problem, so I'll tell you, if you're gonna learn your magic, then at least learn the magic of it.
Keep showing your friends magic.
Try to find out something you don't know, you're gonna be useful.
The human qualities within you will be awakened, so many steps will be made to improve.
I say with my own experience, we cannot imagine how much we learn and understand the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new cities, new villages and new areas.
However, before going there, if we try to see the rituals there, if we look at them like a guide, if we look at them then the joy of visiting that new place increases.
Go to the same place and stay for four days.
Go to another place and stay for three to four days.
You can learn a lot from this.
Where did you go
You can share your experiences using wash tag incredible India.
Friends, This time the government of India has also given you a very good opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from cash transactions.
They need cash.
They started believing in digital currency.
But if someone refers to someone else or someone else and the new person does the transaction thrice, you will get ten paise of money.
Your account will get ten rupees from the government.
If you do 20 people a day, it'll be 200 rupees by the evening.
Businessmen can also earn, students can also earn.
This scheme has been launched since October 14. It will be your obligation to create Digital India.
Now the red light is gone, so no one can say that the red light is in the heart, it may have gone out.
I wanted an interesting phone call.
They expressed apprehensions, but this phone shows that people did not like it at all, they felt a distance.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, this is Shiva Choubey from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I want to say something about the government's Red Bacon Light Band.
I don't have to get trapped in traffic jams, and I don't have to wait for anyone.
I want to thank you very much for this idea.
Thanks for the cleaning of the granddaughters of PPPs.
It is a part of the government's system of fuelling red carpet.
But we have to strive to get this idea out of our minds.
We all have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that our history, our culture, our heritage must be remembered again and again.
We save energy from this, we get inspiration from it.
This year we are following the years of Saint Ramanujacharya.
Centuries are considered to be sufficient in other countries of the world, but India is such an ancient country that has a chance to remember thousands of years or more.
Thousands of years ago, he had devoted his life to the temple and had succeeded.
We are so fortunate that in every era, some great man was born to deny social faults.
We can take inspiration from him to reflect the spirit of social integration which is the source of strength for social integration during the centenary celebrations of Santaramnujacharya.
The Government of India is releasing a Postage Stamp in the memory of Saints tomorrow, 1st May.
I salute Santaramunacharya. I salute him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is the 1st of May.
This day is observed as Labour Day in many parts of the world.
And when we talk of Labour Day, when we talk of labour and labour then it is natural for me to remember the story of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Very few people are aware that today we are grateful to Babasaheb Ambedkar for the facilities and honour that the workers have received.
Babasaheb's role in the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb Ambedkar and Saint Ramnujacharya then I also remember the great saint and socialist Jagatguru Basaveshwar of the 12th century Karnataka.
In the twelfth century, he talked about labour and labour in a few languages.
In Kannada, he used to say Kai Kai Kai Kai Kailas.
This means that with hard work you can reach Alokilas in Shiva.
Today, when I talk about the labourers, it is very natural to recall Dattapant Tengri.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Buddha Purnima in a few days.
All the Buddhist religious leaders of the world celebrated that day.
And in India, the journey from war to Buddha is a unique symbol in the life of His Excellency Ashoka.
It is particularly applicable to our neighbouring countries.
May the neighbouring countries continue to co-operate and develop.
Several projects are underway at the international level.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 05 May 2019.
The benefits from this satellite will be immensely helpful in economic and other developmental areas of South Asian countries.
These will include mapping of natural resources, telemedicine, education, IT connectivity and people-to-people contacts, and South Asia Satellites, which will go a long way in our solidarity.
One of Indias key initiatives to enhance our engagement with the entire South Asia is an invaluable gift, an exemplary symbol of our commitment to South Asia.
My best wishes to all those countries in South Asia who are associated with this South Asia Satellite project for this special effort.
Mann Ki Baat March, 2017
Most of the families in every corner of the country are busy examining their children.
Those whose tests have ended have a bit of comfort and where the test is going, all those families are still in a hurry.
But at such a time, I would like to say that the last time I had spoken to the students of Mann Ki Baat, listen to them again.
You must use those words when you're tested.
Today is 26th March.
26 March 2019 Bangladesh Independence Day
Historical fight against injustice, the remarkable victory of the people of Bangladesh led by Bangabandhu.
On this auspicious day, I convey my best wishes to our Bangladeshi citizens and sisters on the occasion of Independence Day.
I assure the people of Bangladesh that India will contribute to peace, security and development in the entire region by working shoulder to shoulder with a strong partner and friend of Bangladesh.
We all are proud that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are a legacy of our two countries.
National Music of Bangladesh is also composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
One very interesting fact about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is that in 1913 he was not only the first person to be honored with the Nobel Prize in Asia but also to be given the name of Nighthood by the British .
And when the British massacred Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, then Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who had fallen into antagonism.
The cruelty of Jallianwala Bagh brought a new orientation to the lives of a laughing-in-house boy.
And in 1919, the 12 year old boy Bhagwad is our beloved, inspired by all of us.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, the British had hanged Bhagat Singh and his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru and we all knew that on 23rd March there was no fear of death due to the serving of Bharat Mata on the face of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
They had sacrificed their lives for Mother India's freedom.
And those three heroes are still our inspiration.
We cannot describe the sacrifices made by Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
The entire British administration was afraid of these three young men.
Prisoners, they're fine on the day of the execution, but they were worried about what they could do.
And so, on March 24th, where the hostage was to be hanged, it was 23rd.
It's a hiding thing that can't be seen normally.
And then the British brought their bodies to Punjab today and burned them quietly.
Several years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time then I felt the vibration of that land.
And I would like to tell the youth of the country that whenever you get the opportunity to visit Punjab, you must visit the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagwat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt.
It was during this period that the handle of freedom, his intensity, his insanity grew.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth for armed revolution.
On the other hand, just 100 years ago, on 10th April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi performed Satyagraha in Champaran.
This year marks the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time in India's freedom struggle, the Gandhian ethos and Gandhian style were visible in Champaran.
In the entire freedom struggle, it was a paradigm shift, especially from the perspective of the rituals of the United Nations.
In the same phase, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Kheda Satyagraha, the Hartal of the workers of the factory in Ahmedabad and all these were deeply influenced by the spirit and style of working of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1915, Gandhiji came back from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
Imagine a man who had returned to Hindustan in 1915 and had worked for only two years.
And Champaran Satyagraha was one such thing where the organisational strategy of Mahatma Gandhi, the power to know the pulse of the Indian society, the power to know the stars of Mahatma Gandhi, the power to fight the British administration, the power to create, inspire and inspire the illiterate persons to fight and bring them to the battlefield.
Therefore, we can feel the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if we think of Gandhiji a hundred years ago, the Champaran Satyagraha is Gandhiji, it is a matter of deep study for any person to enter the realm of public life.
We can learn from him how to participate in public life, how to work hard and how Gandhiji did it.
And there was a time when Tabd Tabd leaders, whom we heard, Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani Ho, had sent everyone to the village.
Prisoning on one side and supposed to be constructive.
There was a strange balance between Gandhi's style of functioning.
What could be the meaning of Satyagraha, what could be the disadvantage, what could be the meaning of helplessness in front of such a large empire - not just by words, but by successful presentations, Gandhiji had presented a new system.
The unflinching efforts of all those great men who have sacrificed their lives for the country's freedom will be accomplished by the unflinching efforts of the country and the society.
And in the 21st century there are no Indians who do not want to change who do not want to be a partner in the progress of the country.
A New India-New India seed will be distributed in the spirit of the progress of 1. 25 billion Indians.
There are many people who regularly visit the hospital to serve the patients.
Our country, Ratna Garbha and Jan Sewai Prabhu, have been born to us.
If we simultaneously see this thought together, we can understand how powerful it is.
In the context of India, it is natural and urgent that different views and views will emerge.
But it is also true that if the entire nation takes a pledge and takes steps to realize it then the dream of a New India can be successful.
It is not necessary that all the work is done in the budget or in the government expenditure.
If every citizen makes a solemn pledge, follows a solemn pledge, performs a solemn pledge, at least one day a week stops the use of petrol and diesel, then we will be able to take this small step forward.
And I would like to say that everybody should observe his civic religion and perform his duties.
Thus, a New India can be launched.
India will be celebrating 75 years of its independence in 2022.
I urge you all to come, to dedicate your lives and to participate in this journey from Swaraj to Suraj.
My dear countrymen, today I want to express my gratitude to you all.
The BHIM App was launched two-and-a-half months ago, but almost 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
You cannot imagine, you can become a major partner of the country, you can prove yourself to be a brave soldier against black money and corruption.
A few days ago, Digidhan Mela was organised for public education and awareness.
Nearly 1. 25 lakh people have received specific awards for the beneficiaries and seventy thousand people have received specific awards for the businessmen.
Let us join this effort to reduce cash transactions and the use of notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that whenever I ask your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, there are many opinions.
But I have noticed that there is no lack of interest in cleanliness.
I think it's important for the common man to understand the importance of transparency.
I cross a river every day, where people pollute the river by causing many wastes.
This river is coming through the Rispona bridge and our house is encircled .
In order to keep this river clean, I have spoken to the people at Parpa, but it has not been specially beneficial.
I'll request you to send a team here or publish it through a newspaper.
Brothers and sisters, You can see how a girl from 11th century is suffering.
He's so angry at the dirty garbage in the river.
I think it's a good sign.
I want 125 crore countrymen to be angry with garbage.
Once there is anger, dissatisfaction and anger, we will be able to do something against garbage.
It is a good thing that Gayatri has expressed his anger, has advised me and has said that he has tried a lot, but has failed.
Since the Swachhata movement has started, awareness has increased.
Everyone has been associated with it in a positive way.
It took the form of a movement.
Hate to waste is growing slowly.
Be it awareness, active participation or movement, it has its own importance.
This movement is possible in a comprehensive manner.
It's hard, but we have to do it.
I believe that the consciousness among the youth of the country, among the boys, among the students, among the youth is indicating a good outcome.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell all the countrymen that Gayatri's speeches are being spoken by all of us.
I don't get half as much as I can, and I leave it there.
Have you ever imagined how much we waste our nutritious food.
Have you ever imagined that if you don't waste then how much of this food can fill the stomach of the poor people.
There's nothing different about this.
Normally in our house when mother gives food to small kids , then she says that take as much food as she can .
There must be some effort in this regard, but indifference in this regard is a reflection of social inequality.
It's unfair to the poor.
Secondly, if saving is done, the family will also get financial benefits.
Thought is good for the society , but this thing is that the family will also be benefitted by this .
I don't want to say anything about this, but I want to raise awareness.
I know some youngsters who are associated with this kind of movement.
The youngsters of our country do such hard work.
This kind of people will be found in all the states of the country.
Their work can inspire us so that we don't waste food.
We'll eat as much as we can.
That's the way to change.
And those who are healthy always say - keep the plate a little empty , keep the stomach a little empty .
When we talk of health then we say that 7th April is World Health Day .
The United Nations has set a goal of Universal Health Coverage by 2030.
This time, the United Nations has focused on depression on the World Health Day on April 7.
According to an advisory, more than 150 million people worldwide are victims of mental depression.
The problem is that many people around us are victims of this disease, but we don't understand that, and perhaps we are hesitant to talk about it.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not such that one cannot get rid of it.
When he builds a psychiatry, he begins to get rid of it.
The first thing is that we should express the depression without suppressing it.
Along with your friends, with your parents, brothers and sisters, tell the teachers what is happening inside you.
Have you ever wondered why that man is doing this
You must be sure these are the first symptoms of depression.
If you want to keep yourself out of the middle of everyone and stay alone, don't let him be alone.
Leave those with whom he likes to stay.
Encourage him to speak in a funny way, find out what is hidden in his heart.
As people become physically weak in diseases like diabetes, depression reduces the strength of people, gains courage, reduces the strength of fighting in life-style and destroys all our life-force.
Your confidence will come back if you start resolving other problems with the heart of service.
If you are able to meet yourself with others , if you are able to serve yourself and do it selflessly then see if your mind is lightened on its own .
Yoga is a habit but it is a good way to keep mind healthy.
Yoga is an extremely effective way of getting rid of psychology, getting rid of dysentery and to be happy.
The International Day of Yoga was celebrated on 21st June every year.
If you have some suggestions on International Yoga Day, send me the ideas and guidance through my Mobile App.
All the poems and songs that you can write about Yoga, keep writing so that there can be an inspiration for the common man.
This time I will talk to my mothers and sisters about healthcare.
A few days back, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
The Government of India has taken an important decision for this thing.
The maternity leave given during pregnancy, pregnancy and post-natal childbirth was 12 weeks before.
Only two-three countries of the world are ahead of us.
When these children grow up, they will have the resources of the country.
New Year Festivals are celebrated in different parts of our country.
In Maharashtra, Gudi Padhava, Andhra-Karnataka New Year is celebrated with Ugadi, Sindhi Cheti Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Ayodh, Samsantra Puja, Judh Sheetal in Mithila in Bihar and Satuvani in Magadh.
The vast country is full of diversity in India.
New Year greetings to all of you
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
The bird's clumsy brings a tide of joy.
Not only flowers, but fruits also brighten the branches of trees.
Summer fruits are also seen in the spring.
In the same way, there is a yellow flower of mustard in the field of cultivation.
Red flowers in the neighbourhood indicate Holly's arrival.
Amir has given a very beautiful description of this season of seasonal change.
He writes: The forest is bursting, the mustard is bursting, the fucking Kokil is calling, uh-uh.
People also enjoy the joy when nature touches the colour of happiness, when it touches the joy of joy.
Spring-five, Mahashivaratri and Holi festivals paint human lives.
And so he said I'd like to say something about 104 satellite launches and interceptor missiles.
Shobha ji thanked you very much for remembering the pride of India.
Be it fighting poverty, protecting ourselves from diseases, connecting with the world, inspiring knowledge or information, technology and science have proved their role.
15th February, 2017 is a glorious day in the national life of India.
Our scientists have raised our heads to the world.
And we know that within a few years, ISRO has successfully completed a few unprecedented projects.
ISRO has set up a world record for space missions in the aftermath of the successful launch of Mars Mission Mangalyaan on Mars.
India is the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together.
And it is also heartening to note that this is the 38th Sustainable Launch Vehicle of PSLV.
This is not just a historic achievement for the entire India but also for the entire India.
ISROs cost effective space programme has been a miracle to the world and therefore the whole world appreciates the achievements of Indian scientists in an open mind.
Our new Satellite Cartosat-2D will be of great help to our farmer brothers and sisters, especially to know about how water resources are available in our country, how it should be used and what should be monitored.
We've sent some pictures to our satellite room.
That's what he started his work.
It is also a matter of great pleasure for us that our youngsters, our women scientists, have led this campaign.
The excellent cooperation between the youth and women is a privilege for the success of ISRO.
I also compliment the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
They have always kept abreast of the goal of using space science for the benefit of the common man and the nation.
The less we admire our scientists and their entire team.
Sobha ji put another question on India's security.
In the defence sector, India has successfully completed the Ballistic Interceptor missile test.
Interception technology, the Baliyan missile captured the missile captured nearly 100 km from the ground during its experimental flight.
This is a significant achievement in the defence sector.
We are happy to see new technologies and new scientific achievements.
And asking has played a major role in the development of human life.
And those intellectuals who did not allow him to ask, they also questioned him, they asked for new questions and created new questions.
That's the reason for a new invention.
They don't calm down until the answer is answered.
And, if we see the stream of development of human life for thousands of years, we can say that there is no breakthrough in the stream of development of human life.
It's impossible to complete.
Efforts are continuously being made to convey to the universe, the laws of creation and the minds of the people.
New science and new technologies emerge from him.
And every technology, every new form of science gives a new generation.
My dear young friends, when we talk of science, when we talk of hard work of politicians, I remember this Mann Ki Baat programme once again that the younger generation should be attracted to science.
A lot of scientists are required in the country.
Today's scientific community will launch a sustainable transformation in the life of the next generation.
When science researches, innovations and innovations in the minds of the common man, and in the minds of the people, science becomes the hallmark of the common man.
This is where I have seen an innovation for our destitute poor fishermen.
All such innovations were obtained from this competition.
Different services are also becoming technologies.
Technology has become an integral part of life.
Indias digital transactions are on the rise.
In particular, the youngsters are evacuating digital payments from their mobile phones.
I think it's a good sign.
Laki Grahak Yojana, Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana have received a huge response.
It has been almost two months since then, 15,000 people are receiving prizes per day under these two schemes.
A lot of people have received 1 lakh prizes under this scheme.
Fifty thousand rupees have been received by more than four thousand businessmen.
Mysuru Smt. Santosh also conveyed his happiness at the Narendra Modi App that he has received a prize of Rs.
And then, I believe that Santosh should share what he has written with you.
I am so pleased to know that Santosh ji, your name and work have given us both immense pleasure.
On the one hand, he has become an Ambassador of Loki Grahak Yojana.
With the inspiration of the train passengers, they are also making the digital ecosystem aware and inspired many more to participate in the digital system.
He interacted with his friends about how the use of RuPay cards, e-wallets and how pleasant they are in this regard.
One lakh rupees awards are important for him and he is encouraging others to take it up as a mission.
In a way, this work plays an important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
A memorable day.
A few days ago, the 125th anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar was fulfilled.
Remembering him, you also taught at least 125 people to upload BHIM.
Teach how to deal with it.
Therefore, I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation stone of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
The BHIM App has to be delivered to 125 crore people at home.
The movement that has been going on for the past three months has been accomplished in several villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture has contributed immensely to the economy of our country.
The economic power of the village enhances the economic growth of the country.
Today, I want to tell you about the joy.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked very hard to fill the food grains.
The hard work of our farmers has resulted in the maximum production of paddy this year.
All sorts of information indicates that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This year, the way the crops in the fields have flown, every day I feel like celebrating the festival of Baisakhi.
This year, more than two thousand seven crore tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
The last record of our farmers was 8 higher than what was written.
It's an unprecedented achievement.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I am glad that the farmers of this country have heard about the poor and about two hundred and ninety lakh hectares of land have been cultivated with various types of pulses.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service provided by the farmers to the poor.
I am extremely grateful to my farmer brothers and sisters who have worked hard, who have produced a record amount of pulses, for opposing one request.
My dear countrymen, in our country, some programmes are being run by the government, by the society, by the organizations and by the organizations for cleanliness.
Everyone thinks that there is a sense of hygiene.
Seminars are being organised at Warangal in Telangana.
On February 17 and 18, the Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organised in Hyderabad.
Six household toilet pits have been cleaned and officials themselves have shown how to use the toilet made by TwinPit Toilet.
They also demonstrated how convenient the toilets of this new system are, and there is no other problem or embarrassment until it is cleaned.
We also do the work of cleaning small kitchens, like we can clean toilets.
A Standard Twin PitToilet for a family of six has been completed in about five-four years.
Our farmers are well acquainted with NPK.
Different government departments and differently observed Swachhta Pakhwada.
For the first time in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
On the 2nd of March, the Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will undertake Swachhta Abhiyan.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does a significant job, the entire country gets a new energy and confidence grows.
We have welcomed our Divyang friends in the Reo Paralympics.
In the Blind T-20 World Cup this month, India has made the country proud by being the World Champion for the second time in a series of defeats in Pakistan.
I once again congratulate all the players in this team.
The country is proud of the success of our Divyang friends.
I have always believed that the Divyang brothers and sisters are supportive, determined, brave and unwavering in their resolve.
We can always learn something new from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, our daughters are not lagging behind in any field.
They have moved on their feet and have made the country proud by their achievements.
A few days ago, our women sportspersons won silver medals in the Asian RagabiSavens trophy.
I congratulate all these players.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is progressing at a rapid pace.
This is not just a government scheme, it is now a campaign for social consciousness and public education.
In the last two years, people have also been associated with this scheme.
The burning sensation from every corner of the country makes the people think and the mindset of the people is changing over the years.
It is a matter of great joy when news has been published that the festival of birth of a daughter is celebrated.
This kind of positive thinking towards a girl child is a way of social recognition.
I came to know that the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu has been able to stop child marriage by conducting a special campaign.
More than 175 marriages have been closed so far.
More than 55-60,000 bank accounts have been opened under the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.
A campaign to educate the girl child in every village under the Har Ghar Dastak Yojana in Madhya Pradesh is being carried out.
Your Children's Application campaign is aimed at encouraging those who leave school without finishing their education and re-enrolling them in schools and motivating them to study.
New imaginations have also been linked with it.
It has been changed as per local requirements.
You are actively associated with it.
I know a lot from you.
What is happening on the planet, the thoughts of the poorest of the poor reach me.
I am extremely grateful for your cooperation.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Perhaps our ancestors decorated our cycle of weather, economic development and social systems in such a way that there is no relaxation in social life in any case.
In the last few days, we have celebrated a lot of festivals.
Yesterday, the birth anniversary of Shri Krishna was celebrated across India.
Shri Krishna is an individual who, even after so many thousands of years, creates innovation, inspiration and innovation in every festival.
He can be an example and inspiration to solve any problem even today.
Any person can find solutions to any of the present problems from the life of Shri Krishna.
On the other hand, despite such a great personality, it can be said that Sarathy is willing to work in the battlefield.
Sometimes when the mountains pick up the bundles of food, then you can feel the innovation in everything.
Today, when I talk to you, my heart is moving towards two fronts.
One handsome cycle Mohan, the other wheeled Mohan.
Mohan left the bank of river Yamuna and landed at Dwarka on the coast of Gujarat and spent the last days of his life in Delhi on the banks of the river Mohan, born on the beach.
Thousands of years ago, the Sudarshan Chakravardhan Mohan had used his ideas, duties, courage and thinking to avoid the war.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On 2nd October, 1869, a person was born not only on the sea shore of Porbandar, which was called Kirti Mandir, who had shown a new path to human history and had established new heights.
Million labourers who were not paid satisfactory wages have served them.
He considered serving the poor, helpless, sick, hungry and hungry as one of his duties.
He himself served the leprosy patients to prove the wrong concepts of leprosy among the people.
Whenever any person is in danger, Mahatma Gandhi used to run away to help him.
He not only emphasized the importance of service but also knew the importance of self-reliance in service.
The word 'Seva' can only be enjoyed if it is done with joy.
But simultaneously, the real joy of 'Anant Sukha' is also inherent in the spirit of service.
We can easily understand this when we observe Gandhiji's life.
In the life of Mahatma Gandhi, individuals and societies, humanity and humanity were the only concerns.
Africa's Phoenix Farm - Whether it is Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, he gave a fundamental philosophy to social development.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to pay homage to the revered Mahatma Gandhi at various workplaces.
Gandhiji emphasised on organisational energy along with the spirit of service.
Both social service and social integration, community service and community mobilisation.
Will you come and leave. Can we accept this
There is no obstacle, no obstacle, no obstacle, no obstacle, no obstacle, no obstacle, no obsession, no joy, no joy, no joy, no joy, no joy, no joy, no joy.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I visited Dandi in Gujarat.
Several programmes, competitions, exhibitions etc. are being organized in the coming days.
I'll give you a wonderful news on this occasion.
The Haripura panels were specially fascinating.
You remember that there was a Congress session in Haripur, Gujarat where Subhash Chandra Bose was recorded in the history of the Congress Presidential election.
These Art Panels have a very beautiful past.
Before the Congress Haripura session in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then President of Santiniketan Nandlal Bose.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people living in India through art and exhibit it during the Art Work Session.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose artwork embraces our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
This practice of his art has given immortality to the Constitution as well as to Nandlal Bose.
Nandlal Bose inspected the villages around Haripura and then constructed someart canvas on rural India.
This invaluable artwork was discussed in Venice.
Once again I congratulate Gandhiji for his 150th birth anniversary and appeal to every Indian to make some resolutions.
There is a need to do something for the country, for the society, for the other.
This will be our beautiful, true and true reverence to Bapu.
Friends of Mother India, you must have remembered that for the last few years, we have been running the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign for two weeks before 2nd October.
This year it will begin on September 11th.
This time we have to put special emphasis on plastic.
This campaign is inspired by all sections of the society.
Many of my business brothers and sisters have placed a placard in a shop where it is written that the buyers must come with their bags.
It can also showcase its partnership to save money and protect the environment.
On 2nd October, when Bapu will complete 150 years of his life, we will not only dedicate ourselves to open defecation free India but the foundation stone for a new mass movement against plastics will be laid.
I appeal to all the communities, every village, every corner of the city, every village, every village and every citizen of the city, to pray and pray that Gandhi Jayanti this year is celebrated in a way to free our Mother India from plastic waste.
2nd October as a special day.
It could be recycled.
It can also be used as fuel.
There is no need to be seen here for inspiration, no one bigger than Gandhiji can be inspiring.
My dear countrymen, our culture is well-defined, a gem of knowledge.
Today, I want to touch an important topic by a Sanskrit Subject, which has been written a long time ago, but it still has a great significance.
Fools call stones gems.
Our culture has abundant glory of food.
We have also transformed the knowledge of food grains into science.
We all need sustainable and nutritious food, especially for women and newborn children.
People are fighting against malnutrition in a new and entertaining manner.
On the day of harvesting, Anganwadi workers used to collect one handful of crops from everyone.
These food crops were used for making hot food for children and women.
As a result, those who are donating have become a conscious citizen and a social worker.
Thereafter, he dedicated himself to this cause and he became a soldier in this movement.
Liquid food is not solid food.
In Gujarat, it was thought in 2010 that the children should be given complementary food during the Annaprashan programme so that people are aware of it.
It is a great initiative that can be adopted everywhere.
In many states, people celebrate Thithi Bhojan.
If a family has a birthday, a happy day or a memorial, then the family members go to Anganwadi, and go to school by making tasty, nutritious meals and the family members themselves feed the children, share their joy and enjoyment with everyone.
This is a unique combination of serving and joy.
Friends, There are several small issues like this that our country can fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, malnutrition has affected the families of both the poor and the rich.
Poshan Abhiyan will be observed throughout the country in September.
You must be associated with this mission, collect information and add new ideas.
If you can protect one or two people from malnutrition, our country will also be protected from malnutrition.
This time, when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that there will be a lot of questions on this subject and that is why this thing has happened.
In the last few weeks, wherever I went and whoever I met, there has been a mention of Man Vs Wild.
Through this episode, I have not only been able to connect with the youth of not only India but also with the youth of all the parts of the world, I have never thought that such a place will be created in the minds of the youth.
I have never imagined how diverse things our country and the world youth are looking at.
I went to Bhutan last week.
That's what I felt.
Tiger, Lion, Organisms, I am surprised to see how many things can be encouraged.
I firmly believe that now people are trying to know about the steps taken in the field of climate justice and environment in India.
Is it edited later
Look, there's no secret in it.
Some people have questions about this, so I am unveiling this mystery.
It's not really a mystery.
I used to say Hindi but he used to hear it in English, that's why the conversation would have become very easy and that's the trick of technology.
After this show, I have noticed that many people are discussing Jim Corbett National Park.
You must visit nature and the wildlife contagious places.
I told you before, I repeat, you must go to the North East.
Your mind will expand.
On 15th August, I had requested all of you from the Red Fort that in the next three years, 15 places of India, 15 places for 100 centres of tourism, 15 places for tourism, please visit, discuss, take family, spend some time there.
Your life, your thoughts will spread.
Last month, it was a privilege to issue a Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know the number of tigers in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
A few years ago, half of it would have suffered a lot.
Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010 with tigers.
A resolution was taken here expressing concern over the reduction in tiger population in the world.
The resolution was to double the number of tigers worldwide by 2022.
But this is New India, where we have achieved the goal at a rapid pace.
We have doubled the number of tigers here by 2019.
The number of tigers not only in India but also in the Protected Area and Community Reserves has increased.
I also remember the lions of the Gir Forest in Gujarat when I was publishing the lions.
When I was in charge of the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the lion's residence in the jungle of Gir was shrinking.
Their numbers were declining.
We've done a lot of entrepreneurship in Gir.
I decided to recruit a female guard there in 2007.
Infrastructure facilitation will lead to improvement in tourism industry.
In terms of nature and wildlife, we are focusing on conservation only.
This time we will have to think in terms of compassion and compassion in the direction of conservation.
My dear countrymen, can we forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893
This young Indian monk gave a brilliant answer to the voice of the world's humanity.
In 1893, when India was at the threshold of compassion, the world was compelled to discover a New India by the brilliant words of the great Swami Vivekananda in 1893.
Come, let us build the India that Swami Vivekananda had seen, the strength that he knew.
On this occasion, we are going to launch Fit India Movement across the country.
You have to keep yourself fit, make the country fit.
This will be a very attractive mission for the elderly and the elderly.
But I don't want to explain it in detail today.
Wait for August 29th.
2nd October, 2018 for total dedicated plastic.
With all our strengths, we will join the campaign to keep the houses and its surroundings free of plastic.
I believe this mission will create a vibrant social media.
Let us initiate this campaign with a new zeal, new resolve and new energy.
I'm waiting for your message and advice.
May our hearts be filled with joy and service.
Thank you very much, Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, January, 2017
The Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to the democracy should be a remarkable festival that brings about reforms and reforms in the future generations in terms of democracy and democracy.
However, there should not be much debate over the duties of citizens and the rights of citizens in our country, the deeper the ignorance, the widespread conduct that should be done.
I hope at every level, every moment, the more emphasis is placed on duty.
Indias democracy can move on both the paths of right and duties.
Tomorrow, on 30th January, we will celebrate the auspicious occasion of Pujyabapur.
On 30th January, we observe a two-minute silence at 11 a.m. and pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country.
As a nation, as a nation, as a nation, we should become a habit of two minutes of paying homage at 11th January.
On the eve of Democracy Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families who have been honoured with the various Bravery Index Awards.
All these awards include Kirti Chakra, Shourya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Seva Medal and Seva Medals.
I would like to especially appeal to the youngsters: can you people be very active in social media, can you do something
Now, those who have been honored with this honor - please write a praising paper on the Internet and send it to your friends.
When we are able to know about their courage, bravery and heroism in detail, we get astonished as well as inspired.
On the one hand, when we were happy with the news of January 26th and spectacles, our soldiers in Kashmir, who were determined to protect the country, who lost their lives due to the devastation of snow.
I pay my homage and respect to all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are well aware of the fact that I am continuously listening to Mann Ki Baat.
The months of January, February, March and April are months of examination in each family.
Half of the children in the world are tested but the entire family is smoked by the pressure of tests.
Family worries, student anxiety, teacher anxiety, a diverse psychological environment can be seen in every world.
And I have always believed that we should come out of it and that is why today I want to talk to my young friends in detail in detail.
When I announced this thing, a lot of teachers, parents and students sent me a message, they asked me questions, they mentioned the pain and I felt that today I would like to share it with you.
I sent a telephone message from the Creator.
Anyway, the question has been raised, but you must have the same question in your mind.
The test must be a pleasure.
We have worked hard throughout the year, this time we have got the opportunity to inform, this should be an occasion of hope and enthusiasm.
You're gonna have to decide if you think it's pressure, not pleasure.
And when it's festive, the best thing that comes out of us.
It is during the festival that society gets its own strength.
There should be an environment of festivals in the family, friends and neighborhoods during the examination too.
The entire family should celebrate this festival like a team with zeal and enthusiasm and see how quickly it changes.
The truth is that from Kashmir to Kanyakumarika, Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal, these three-four months are just tests and tests.
It is our responsibility that every year these three-four months, by adopting their own methods, by following their own traditions, by understanding the atmosphere of their own family and by making them a festival.
And that's why I'll tell you smile more score more.
And you've seen that when you're happy, you're relaxed, you're very easily relaxed, and when you're relaxed, you're a year old.
You remember the whole view of what the teacher said in the classroom a year ago.
Sometimes it seems that we are not able to see the exams in the right direction.
It's like testing a question of life and death.
The meaning of the exam is the evaluation of what you've done for years.
J.
Brilliant examples of darkness.
He wanted to join the airspace but was ungrateful.
Just imagine, if he had become disappointed, had he gone away, would India have got such a big scientist
This has not only increased the competition amongst the children but also increased the tension.
I would like to share your views on the current situation and the future of education.
What you really need in life is your knowledge, your skills, your self-confidence and your determination.
Of course not, you think he's a good doctor, so you need to go to him.
Whenever you go to any Namikil, do you look for his marksheets while charging a big case
You have seen his experiences, his wisdom and achievements.
That is why sometimes the burden of this number becomes a burden on us.
In a self-exploration, you will find that when you just ran for numbers, you found the easiest way and focused on specific things.
And that is why sometimes it happens that despite being extremely grateful in the examination, we face failure in life.
Richa has raised one more topic that is competition.
It's an area of great psychological conflict.
We can give the example of Sachin Tendulkar.
Friends, in every sphere of life and especially when you are going to conduct your exams, you will notice that if you used to spend two hours in your exams, have you done that for three hours
Earlier, when he used to think about getting up, it was too late, can you get up in time
Shri S.
That's how he helped me.
My mother couldn't pass the examination of the tenth grade but I couldn't pass the CBSE exam if she didn't get help.
Nice-yes, you're right.
You must have noticed that the number of women who ask me questions and advise me is more.
If you learn to admit once, many problems will be solved there.
If you don't admit it, you're gonna get rid of this problem.
Hope makes the way harder.
Acknowledging the current situation, there is a possibility of opening a new way for solutions.
So admit what you have.
Look, you'll be unloaded.
We talk about the weight of school bags for small children, but sometimes I think that parents' expectations and aspirations are more than school bags for children.
Many years ago, due to heart attack, one of our familiars was in the hospital.
In fact, we go to a sick person and create a fear in his mind about the disease.
I would like to tell the parents that sometimes we live in the same way with the younger ones.
Have you ever thought of giving a glimpse of laughter to the children during the exams
You'll see the situation will change.
I have a very funny call.
The gentleman didn't want to name himself.
If you hear the details of the phone, you'll know why the person doesn't want to publish his name.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I had done such a thing in my childhood that I am not going to mention my name.
I tried to duplicate once as a child.
I wasted a lot of time thinking about how to duplicate, what to do, what to do with it.
I could get the same number if I spent that time studying.
When I duplicated and tried to pass, I was caught and I had a lot of friends around me.
I'll tell you the same thing again.
So where will you reach
Think you're digging your own path, that is, creating obstacles.
I have also seen that some people are using all their talents and creative powers to find ways to imitate.
If I talk about sports at the time of the examination, everyone will say - what kind of Prime Minister
This is because the common man thinks that if students think about sports, they will be neglected in studies.
Besides the brain, there should be proper activity of the rest of the body.
If you have a brake for five minutes, you'll feel more like you're studying.
I don't know if everyone likes it, but I told you about my faith.
Once a folk singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long did you sleep
I wanted to know, brother, are you a doctor
He said, "No, no, you don't tell me, your throat goes off to give me this address.
If you sleep well, your cord will be relaxed in the morning.
I didn't think of my sleep and voice before.
He gave me a simple trick.
Don't do this forgotten, so your feelings will displease me.
Otherwise, the day the marksheet comes, parents will see my reflections instead of you.
If you sleep, it will work. Don't think about it once.
Sports plays an important role in keeping the mind, mind and body functional.
Let us move ahead with this mantra.
Dear countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years of its existence on 1st February this year.
On this occasion, I congratulate all the personnel and personnel of the Coast Guard for their duties towards the nation.
Our Coast Guard has taken pride in the top four Coast Guards in the world, with 126 warships and 62 aircraft built in our country.
In keeping with the commitment of Coast Guards Mantra Om Rocksham, our Coast Guard has always been resistant to safeguard the maritime boundary of our country.
Last year, the Coast Guard had planned to clean the coastal areas of our country along with their mainstream activities and thousands of ordinary citizens were also involved in it.
Our Coast Guard has a female pilot officer who is capable of handling the cannons of the Hovercraft.
Spring Rituraj.
Saraswati is worshipped in the spring-five.
For the sake of practicing science, worship is followed.
It is not just learning, it is also a festival of inspiration for valour.
My colour is Devasanti Chola. This is the inspiration.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of this spring-five festival.
My dear countrymen, All India Radio has made the programme Mann Ki Baat even more colorful.
Last month, after the address of Mann Ki Baat, Mann Ki Baat was recited in regional languages.
This has been a great success.
The countrymen have written letters from far and wide.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all of you for this self-inspired effort of All India Radio.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
My best wishes to you all for Christmas.
Today is a day to realise service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Christ said, It is not good for the poor, I want our recognition for them.
There's a story that's very popular about this.
Lord Jesus once stood by a Temple Treasury.
A lot of rich people came and donated a lot.
After that, a poor widow came and donated two copper paise.
On the one hand, two copper donors don't carry any money.
Malviya ji, who had made a solemn pledge and self-confidence in the Indian public, had shown a new direction to the modern education system.
On his birthday, I pay my homage to him.
Just two days back, I had the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in the pilgrimage of Malviya.
I have also laid the foundation stone of Mahamati Madan Mohan Malwa Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University.
A cancer centre is being set up for the entire region and it will not only benefit the people of Uttar Pradesh but also the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of the Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country will never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, our country's head has also risen in the field of nuclear energy.
Atal ji has laid the foundation of Atal ji in every role of the leader, Parliamentarian, Minister or Prime Minister.
I salute Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray to God for his health.
I am fortunate to have worked with Atal ji as an employee.
A lot of memories are floating in front of your eyes.
I shared an old video when I visited this morning, how Atal ji's affection for a small worker could be seen only after watching the video.
As a Christian gift, all the countrymen are going to benefit from two schemes today.
Everyone wants to understand and learn from each other.
In order to encourage this, the Government of India is launching a scheme to encourage customers and small businessmen to make e-payment a habit to increase the strength of mobile banking.
The scheme for incentivising customers is "Lakki Grahak Yojana" and "Digi-Dhan Vyapar Yojana".
And on 25th December, as a gift of Christmas, the Draw system will provide an account of one thousand rupees to 15 thousand people.
Today, not just for one day, this scheme will continue for 100 days.
15,000 people will receive this award every day.
In 100 days, crores of rupees will be provided to more than lakhs of families but they will be eligible for these gifts which include mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI.
Use of digital transactions like USSD etc.
DG-Dhan Vyapar Yojana is for the businessmen.
Just as the businessmen themselves join this scheme, they will also connect the consumers to cashlessly carry out their business.
Businessmen will also be given different prizes and thousands of prizes.
These awards will not be available to those who can purchase more than Rs. 3000.
The poorest of the poor can avail the benefits of Feature Phone and General Phone with the help of USSD so that they can avail the benefits of this scheme.
People from rural areas will be able to win this award by educating them through AEPS.
Ten-twelve-class children in your family will also be able to teach you this method.
It is very easy to send the Houts App from the mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know how to use technology, how to make e-payments and how to make online payments.
In the last few days, cashless transactions and cashless transactions have increased from 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to encourage this process.
Businessmen can easily guess how big this decision is.
The traders who have digitally exchanged their businesses will be exempted from income tax on online payment systems instead of cash.
I have learnt that the Government of Assam has announced a 10 discount on payment of Property Taxes and Trade License Fee digitally.
The branches of Rural Banks have decided that if their 75 consumers get two digital transactions from January to March, they will get 50,000 prizes from their government.
As on 31st March, 2017, if a village has achieved 100 digital transactions, the Government has announced an award of Rs. 5 lakhs under the Uttam Panchayat for Digital Transactions Scheme.
For the farmers, the Government of Assam has decided to confer a prize of Rs. 5000 on the first 10 farmers under the Digital Kisan Shiromani scheme, who will be fully digitally purchasing seeds and fertilizers.
I congratulate the Assam Government and congratulate all the States who have taken such initiatives.
Interestingly, GNFC fertilizers have increased by 27 over the previous year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, in our day to day lives, the importance of unorganised sector is high.
In most cases, the wages of these people are paid in cash for their work, and we know that the workers are deprived of it.
80 instead of Rs. 100, where Rs. 80 is to be given, Rs. 50 is to be provided and these workers are deprived of other benefits, including health insurance.
But when cashless payments are made, the money is directly deposited in the bank.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is accessible to us.
Countries like India should come forward in these areas.
Our youngsters have made great strides through start-ups.
This Digital Movement is a golden opportunity. Our younger generation should take new ideas, new technologies, new technologies and innovative ways to take initiatives in this field.
We have to join the campaign to free the country from black money and financial corruption.
My dear countrymen, I appeal to the people before every Mann Ki Baat programme, you send your suggestions, share your opinions and this time thousands of suggestions have been received on Mygov and Narendra Modi App.
The authors of the second gathering, who have emphasized upon all these things, such good work for the betterment of the country, such a sacred task, however, have given a detailed account of the kind of frauds that have been committed against them and how new evils are being carried out.
Shriman Gurumani Kaubal has written in MyGov: This step is worthy of appreciation for black money.
As citizens, we are suffering, but we are cooperating in the fight against corruption.
We are playing the role of the Armed Forces in the fight against corruption, black money etc.
This is the same feeling from all corners of the country.
We all feel it.
In fact, this is the fulfilment of change in Agent of Change.
I would like to thank all of you for one more reason, not only for the sufferings they have suffered, but also for those who are trying to distract the common man.
Moreover, some people with their intellect, strength and creativity have unfolded the masks of rumors and rumours and brought them to the fore.
I salute this power of the people.
People's happiness is God's blessings, people's blessings.
I thank the people of our country, I salute them for taking part in this great zeal against corruption and black money.
I wanted that the fight against corruption and black money should be discussed in detail in the Parliament as well as in the political parties and political funding.
Those who are running the political parties have a lot of discount, their role is wrong.
This government is a people's government.
On the other hand, I said on the first day - 8th, this is a wonderful fight.
There's a lot of news coming from government officials coming from civilians.
The success that we have achieved is really because of the public awareness.
Can anyone imagine how much the citizens of our country are at risk of opening their masks
If you get help then this fight will become easier.
There is a third party among those who are sending me letters, a large number of people.
They are saying that Modiji should not stop, should not get tired, should he take as much steps as possible.
We have to win this war, we don't have to ask for tiredness.
We have brought it out and we have made the Benami Property Act very strictly.
This law will play its role in the coming days.
Our primary duty is to enhance the domestic and public interest.
In the last few years, India has established itself with pride in the global economy.
As per the World Investment Report released by UNCTAD, India has moved to third place in the Top Prospective Host Economy in 2016-18.
India has improved 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
Likewise, the World Banks Logistics Performance Index-2016 showcases India's 19-point progress.
Similarly, some other reports also indicate India's rapid progress.
My dear countrymen, this time the Parliament session has created a lot of fervor among the countrymen.
Their anger has been reflected in a variety of ways in the proceedings of Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also expressed their condolences on the occasion.
But sometimes something good happens in these things and the mind is filled with happiness.
In the House of Parliament, a good work has been done which has not been noticed by the people of the country.
Brothers and sisters, Today I am glad that a bill related to the goals for the Divyangjans has been introduced in the Parliament.
Our government is committed to the people with disabilities.
My Divyang brothers and sisters have added strength to this effort when they won four medals at Para Olympics.
This win not only enhances the dignity of the country but also surprises the countrymen.
Like other citizens of the country, our Divyang brothers and sisters are our invaluable resource and energy.
I am glad that the passage of this Act will facilitate more jobs for the Divyangjans.
Reservation limit for Government jobs has been increased to 4.
The Act provides for the education, facilitation and grievances of persons with disabilities.
The government has framed this new legislation in accordance with the views of the United Nations.
Certain categories of persons with disabilities have been prepared so that for the first time they can get the right opportunity and justice.
Thalassemia, Perkinsons Disease Affected Persons and Dwarfs are also included in this category.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, there have been reports from the field of sports so that all of us are proud.
It is natural for us to be proud of being an Indian.
Indian Cricket Team won 4-0 matches against England.
The performance of some young sportspersons is very commendable.
The Test Test Test Big Kohli didn't just do a good job, gave a good leadership.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all of you.
Good news has been received in Hockey after 15 years.
I congratulate these youngsters for their achievements.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of the Indian hockey team.
Last month, our women sportspersons too have made great strides.
The Indian women hockey team won the Asian Championships trophy and the Indian women hockey team won the medal in the 18 Asia Cup a few days ago.
I extend my warm felicitations to all the players of cricket and hockey teams.
My dear countrymen, the year 2017 is a year of new hope and zeal.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
Last month, we all celebrated Diwali.
Every year, during Diwali, I went to China to celebrate Diwali with the army.
I have celebrated Deepawali in the high altitude of the Himalayas with the jawans of ITBP.
Every year I go to the border, but this time the experience of Deepawali is completely different.
They were full of emotions and not only were they witnessing a wonderful response from the countrymen who had conveyed their greetings and had embraced them with their own happiness.
When I was watching these things, I was surprised to know what a wonderful imagination he had made.
But, to be honest, we don't feel like this during the festival of Diwali.
On the contrary, I felt like joining the festival of Deepawali with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, the spirit, joy, love and joy that has spread among the soldiers of our Armed Forces will be limited only to Holi-Deepawali.
I would like you to appeal to me, as a society, as a nation and as a nation, to make it a part of nature and be it a mountain or festival, we will remember the soldiers of our Armed Forces in some way or the other.
The strength of the Armed Forces will increase by 125 crore when it unites the Armed Forces.
A few days ago, the heads of all the villages of Jammu and Kashmir had met me.
He had come here to attend the Panchayat Sammelan in Jammu Kashmir.
Approximately 40-50 chiefs came from different villages of the Kashmir Valley.
It's been a long time for a conversation.
They made some claims for the development and development of the village, but naturally, the recent situation in the Kashmir Valley, the laws and the future of the children came up.
A few days ago, the Board of Governors in Kashmir was frozen and about 95 of the students there were examiners.
I can clearly see that our children in Jammu and Kashmir have a strong commitment to the development of a bright future through education.
I thank them not only for their commitment but also for their parents, parents, teachers and village heads.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I asked for a public debate on Mann Ki Baat this time, I confess that everybody has made a single proposal.
Everybody wants me to say something in detail with a note of five hundred thousand rupees.
On 8th November, at 8:00 pm, I had announced a massive campaign for the country for the right development of the country.
Whenever I took this decision and made it clear that it was not a simple decision, it was a difficult step.
At the time of the announcement, I had warned that the impact of this proposal will be so bad that it will take at least 50 days to come out of it and then we will be able to move towards normalcy.
It is not easy to recover from the diseases that have spread over seventy years.
125 crore Indians have unwavering faith in their own country and are committed to the development of the country.
This is the reason why we will succeed, whether the banking and post office workers are working in adversity.
And when it comes to humanity, they're getting more active.
When the local bank employees lost their ears, they immediately reached the old gentleman's house in Taka.
Not only this, he has arranged for his treatment.
I'm surprised at this incident.
They are taking various legal measures to save their black money.
One request is not to play with the poor people to fulfil their unjust interests.
Your injustice is being linked to the records of the poor, not to you after the investigation, these poor people will be trapped, they will suffer.
Strict regulations have been framed to bring Benami Property under implementation in all sectors.
I am an ordinary citizen of District Harada, Tahsil and Village Tirali in Madhya Pradesh.
Your five hundred thousand note-books are commendable.
My request is to give some examples through Mann Ki Baat where the common man has welcomed your move for the betterment of the nation even after facing many difficulties.
Thank you very much, you said that the season is coming, but no one can imagine that you can take such a big step.
By closing the notes of five hundred and a thousand, you should have taught the corrupt blacksmiths.
Every citizen of India doesn't have a bigger date than this.
I thank you once more for this.
When we hear such stories through media, public and government sources, the enthusiasm of working is enhanced.
People went there and ate it, and when they returned with the stars after two or four days, they paid the bill.
This is the strength of my country, where service and sacrifice are the main.
The news that I had made during my election was spread all over the world.
Many countries of the world also learnt the use of tea-speaking words.
But I didn't know that there could be a 'Cha-bat' on board
I got the news that there was such a marriage in November 7th.
In this marriage, only tea was arranged for the party invitees, there was no food and snacks, because they lacked cash due to the closure of the note.
The followers also endorsed this and set an example in the fight against black money and black money that Bharat Maru and Skilled Marriage (BMS).
Whenever there is a problem, people find new ways and once again I see an incident in Dhekiyazuli village of Assam on TV news.
These four-labourers and village workers get weekly wages.
Four neighbouring women collectively bought and paid a thousand rupees note.
You are very well aware of the fact that even a few days ago, the poorest of the poor could deposit the minimum wages.
Each municipal tax pays only fifty percent of the tax.
But after the announcement dated 8th, the old notebooks of the people fell.
You will be surprised to know that in the last four years, Rs. 3,500 crore has been deposited in the tax regime.
We are witnessing a massive catastrophe that has the direct consequences.
Brothers and sisters, the villages and the farmers are the backbone of our country's economy.
I would like to especially congratulate the farmers of the country when we are adjusting to every citizen despite the difficulties faced by this change in the economy.
I was calculating this year's seedlings.
I am glad to see that the number of wheat, pulses or sesame seeds has increased in comparison to last year.
In all the adversities, the farmers have taken a new path.
Some important decisions have been taken by the government, while priority is being given to the farmers and the villages.
Our country's six traders also generated employment opportunities and also participated in economic development.
In the last year's budget, I had made an important decision that even small shopkeepers from villages like the big Mall of the city will be able to do business for twenty-four hours and no law will stop them.
Under the Mudra Yojana, a lot of initiatives have been taken to provide loans to them.
Millions of crores of rupees have been given to these small traders under the 'Mudra' scheme because those who are associated with this small business will continue to do business.
However, it is natural for all the small businessmen to face difficulties due to this decision.
You should also download the bank's app on your mobile phone.
Provide POS Machine for Credit Cards and learn how to do business without notice.
You have seen that big Malls continue to operate in the medium of technology.
Similarly, a small businessman can also do business with the help of user-friendly technology.
There is no possibility of any loss, there is no scope for growth.
I urge you all to join the Cashless Society.
You can facilitate full banking on mobile phones for business promotion and enable cashless transactions.
These are technological solutions that are safe, secure and fast.
I want you not only to help in the success of this mission but also to give leadership and I believe that you can lead this transformation.
I am confident that you will be able to finish all the business transactions in the village through technology.
I also want to tell the worker brothers and sisters that there has been a lot of remuneration on you.
It's written on a salary and what is being given to it is different.
Sometimes when there was a full-scale labour, there was a man standing outside, he had to split and forced to absorb this absorption as part of his life.
In today's new system, we want your accounts in the bank, your wages are deposited in the bank so that the minimum wages are changed.
You get the full money, no one takes it off.
Today, I would especially like to talk to young friends.
India is a country with 65 of the population below the age of fifteen.
You, the youngsters and the youngsters of my country, I know that my decisions have been approved by you people.
I also know that you support this decision.
I am also aware that you will contribute immensely to this thing in a positive way.
But guys, you're my real soldier, real friend.
My brave young men, can you help me
Just stay with me, it won't work.
Whatever you know about today's world, it's not an old generation.
It may be that even the elder brothers of your family are not familiar with this, they are not familiar with the parents, Kaka-kima, Mama-Mami.
You are aware of the kind of online banking and online ticket booking.
It's simple for you and you use it.
But today our dream is the Cashless Society that the country wants to do.
It is true that a hundred percent of the school society is not possible.
But once we start the Less-Cash Society, the goal of the Cashless Society will not be incomplete.
And I would like your active cooperation, time and solemn pledge in this regard. And I know that you will never disappoint me because we all are citizens of India who want to change the lives of the poorest of the poor.
You are aware of the opportunities for cashless society, digital banking or mobile banking.
Each bank offers online access.
Every bank in Hindustan has its own mobile app.
Every bank has a daily wallet.
The white meaning of the wallet is the e-box.
There's a lot of cards.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay ay card, which was used very little.
Since 8th, the poorest of the poor have been using their pulses and have grown by almost three hundred percent.
As the pre-paid cards are available on mobile phones, banking cards are also available for expenditure.
And this is as simple as your Houts Appearance.
Phones that are available with common features can also be a cash transfer.
Whether it is smoke or vegetables, milk, news papers, tea, chicken vendors, everyone can use it unnecessarily.
And I also stressed on simplifying this system.
All the banks are involved in this.
My young friends, despite all this, there are generations who are unfamiliar with these things.
And you are, I know very well that this great work has been done.
The kind of creative messages that you have given on the Houts App - slogans, poems, stories, cartoons, new imaginations, new imaginations, smiles and smiles - seem to have been created by the young generation in the face of challenges.
And that is why today when we are taking such a massive transformation then the fundamental creativity of your hearts is becoming visible.
But my dear young friends, I once again say, I need your help in this thing and I believe that millions and millions of young people of the country will do this thing.
Please do one thing, please promise today that you will be a part of the Cashless Society.
Use online technologies on your mobile phones.
Moreover, every half an hour, every two hours, every day and every two hours, you can tell the ten families how to use this technology, how to download the bank accounts and how to spend the money in your accounts and how to provide it to the investors.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business.
You will voluntarily enter this Cashless Society, you will have to give leadership to the great campaign of expelling the society from the cycle of this note, the campaign of corruption-freeing the country, the campaign to free the country from black money, the campaign to free people from misery and misery.
I invite you to come, not just to compete, but to become a soldier of this change and to change it.
We will carry forward this fight to liberate the country from corruption and black money and there are many countries in the world where the younger generations have changed the lifestyle of that country. And it will be acknowledged that the changes that will happen are brought about by the youngsters and the youngsters.
A mobile system called M-PESA on Kenya Entrepreneurship, used technology, named M-PESA and today the entire business in this area of Kenya in Africa has changed.
This country has created a big revolution.
My young friends, once again I am very enthusiastic about taking this mission forward.
I invite every school, college, university, NC-C, NS-S to do this thing in a collective manner.
You have seen that the most popular artisans of this time, Amitabh ji, have been taking forward the Swachhata Abhiyan with great hard work.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, through your thoughts, your thoughts, letters of thought, you are reaching MyGov, Narendra Modi App and keeping me in touch with you people.
Now Mann Ki Baat is being published at 11 a.m. but after the completion of this broadcast, it is being heard in regional languages.
I am grateful to AIR, this new initiative has been taken so that the people of the country can get connected to the languages wherever they are translating Hindi.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, October 2016
My dear countrymen, many-many congratulations to all of you on Diwali.
Deepawali is celebrated in every corner of India with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
India is a country where festivals are seen in some parts of the country for 365 days.
We have smoothly acknowledged the changes in the festivals as per the time and society, by closing the traditional festivals.
But we are able to see this thing in a better way that in India, the journey of festivals throughout the year, its depth, its impact on every individual, all these things are related to the same principle, to take the individual forward towards the community.
In order to promote individuals and individuals, an effort has been made to extend their limited thinking from Paris to the universe.
And it can be done through this festival.
Sometimes there is a festival in India which means the festival of food and god, but there is a lot of thinking among them as to what season should be or what should be eaten there.
What kind of crops are being produced by the farmers and how the crops should be linked to the festivals, what kind of reforms should be adopted in the field of diseases, our ancestors have mixed up with scientific festivities.
Today, the whole world is thinking about it.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of concern.
In India, this tradition of festivals strengthens the love and affection of nature and makes every child better and happier.
And science has proved that what kind of changes are brought about in the sea waters of Purnima and Amavasya, what kind of effect is there on the nature and it affects the minds of the people.
So far, our vacations have been linked to the universe to a tradition of nurturing science.
Today, when we are celebrating Deepawali, as I have said, every festival of ours is educated, it comes to the feeling of education.
The festival of Deepawali, Tamsoma, conveys the message of light from darkness.
Deepawali is a festival of social fault - a festival of lighting lamps from the shadow of personal fault and liberating them from darkness.
We all know this thing very well that every family is witnessing Swachhta Abhiyan during Deepawali, from the rich to the rich to the rich.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
The government of every place in the world, the parliament, the ruler and everyone became a part of the festival of Diwali.
The Prime Minister of Singapore, through Instagram, shared the pictures of Deepawali with the world with great pride.
A total of 16 women members of the Singapore Parliament, who stood outside the Parliament after Indian saris, were photographed on the social networking site.
And all this has been done for Diwali.
Deepawali is celebrated everywhere in Singapore.
I mean, this festival of Deepawali inspires everyone from darkness to light.
During Deepawali, news of accidents, fires, epilepsy causes a lot of concern.
And there is a problem during Deepawali. During Deepawali, many of them went home to celebrate Deepawali with their families on Diwali.
It is not just a day but it has been going on for a long time from Govardhan Puja, Bhai Phota, Profit Panchami to Karthik-Purnima.
It is a festival that has been going on for four days.
But it has a special significance: this festival gives a deep message to the society.
There is a proverb that all the people of the world worship the sun.
Chhath Puja is a festival where the sun is worshipped.
These include a very big social message.
This is the time to express my gratitude to all of you on the occasion of Deepawali and Chhath Puja.
In the last few months, every soldier of our army has sacrificed everything for our comfort.
My heartfelt condolences to the sacrifices, meditation and hard work of the soldiers of the Armed Forces.
And that is why I felt that this Deepawali should be dedicated to the security forces.
I have called upon the countrymen to take part in a campaign called Sandesh to Soldiers.
But today I want to bow down to my head that there are no people in India who do not have immense love for the country's army, they are proud of the army, they are not proud of the security forces.
The way people have expressed it will further strengthen the countrymen.
We cannot imagine how much a message gives them to the soldiers of the security forces.
Be it the Indo-Tibetan Police, the Assam Rifles, the Navy, the Air Force or the Coast Guard, I do not know what kind of suffering our soldiers suffer.
When we are celebrating Diwali then some of them are protecting the Himalayas, some are protecting the industrialists, some are protecting the airports, some are fulfilling their responsibilities in the desert.
I really want to express my gratitude to my countrymen.
The artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the film, the cloth, the cartoon for which he has written the poems.
I can imagine how proud it is for the soldiers of my country.
Sandesh to Soldiers - How many messages have come in this hashtag
Shriman Ashwini Kumar Chouhan has written a poem, I would like to read it.
Today I tell you, it's impossible that you are.
My dear countrymen, many families of both father-in-law and father-in-law have served in the army. One such sister, Shivani has sent me a telephone message.
Come, let us hear this soldier family saying - Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am Shivani Mohan.
In this Deepawali, the Sandesh to Soldiers campaign has been inspired by our army personnel.
My family is a soldier family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and father-in-law were the army officers.
This Sandesh inspires all of us, our army officers on the border, and all of us in the Army Circle.
I would like to say that the army officers and soldiers have to abandon their wives and their entire family.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of fact that not only the borders that our soldiers are guarding, but also the lives of our soldiers.
Our brave soldiers, be it natural calamities or administrative calamities or be it fighting the enemies or bringing the wrong-guided youth back to the right path.
This discussion shows that some families are not able to build a household toilet due to lack of money.
Development has given a boost to the Swachhta Abhiyan by providing Rs. 1,000 each to 57 families from their pockets.
Similarly, Himachal Pradesh has become an Open Defecation Free State.
Nobody goes there easily.
These youngsters walked on their shoulders with bricks, cement and other toilets and reached the jungle.
More than 150 municipalities and corporations have been declared toilet-free in Gujarat.
Ten districts have also been listed on this list.
My dear countrymen, the government has planned a lot, and if there is a better plan after the first plan, then the first one has to be abandoned.
Normally, no one pays attention to it.
There is no need for kerosene in every household in our country that has gas connections and electricity.
But who keeps the government looking for Arya
I have heard that seven or eight districts have been kerosene-free for the best.
I believe that the entire state will become kerosene-free.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi always guides all of us.
What the country will do, how it will do, all his illusions are still considered to be examples.
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you plan, you will remember the poor and vulnerable sections of the country and then you will wonder if what you are going to do is beneficial to these people, will they not be harmed
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the problem.
Whatever our ancient beliefs, we have to bridge the gap between boys and girls in our society.
This opportunity is a symbol of discrimination among our daughters in Indian society.
Though vaccination is done by the government, lakhs of children are left out of the vaccination programme.
Mission Indradhanush vaccination is one such drive, which includes survivors and children, which empowers children to get rid of terrible diseases.
Villages will remain dark in the 21st century, it will not happen.
In order to make the village free from darkness, the mission of electrifying the village is progressing successfully.
Work is going on ahead of schedule.
Efforts are being made to free 5 crore families from smoke and this campaign is progressing successfully.
Small entrepreneurs, small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, peasants get trapped in the interests of the Mahajan.
Mudra Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account are all successful campaigns to get rid of the beneficiaries.
Financial benefits are being provided directly to the beneficiaries through Aadhaar Card.
Time has come to save the lives of ordinary citizens from the loss of moneylenders.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the great soul of this country who had demonstrated and laid the foundation of India's unity - Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's birth anniversary.
Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary on 31st October, 2019, is a great leader of the country's unity, and Smt.
My Lord, you know that 31st October is Sardar Patel's birthday.
Sardar Patel is a person who has dedicated his entire life to the integrity of his country and I believe that he has succeeded in this endeavour.
He united everyone, and we can say the country's misfortune or say that Gandhiji was assassinated on that day.
And what we all know is what happened in the country after his assassination.
My Lord, I want to tell you how to shut down such unfortunate incidents.
My dear countrymen, this sadness is not one.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel is a witness to this event and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great job of uniting the country after charming it.
But it was also a pain that Sardar Saheb had dedicated his life for unity, had fought for it, had been the main objective of unity of the country and had suffered dissatisfaction among the people but never left Ektarasta.
But on the occasion of the birth anniversary of that Sardar, thousands of Sardar Saheb and thousands of Sardar Saheb were deprived of their lives after the assassination of Smt.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great men who have spent their entire life in unity, the oppression of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and the pages of history, all of us are troubled.
But within this crisis, we have to take forward the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of the country.
There are many languages, nations, numerous, nutritional, dietary, but unity in diversity is the strength of India.
Every generation has a responsibility, every government has a responsibility, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner
We should protect ourselves and our country from the tendency of discrimination.
Sardar Saheb has given us Ek Bharat. It is our responsibility to create Shreshtha Bharat.
The main mantra of unity is to build a Best India.
Sometimes we hear the name of 'Am'.
Today, the people of India and the people of India are also familiar with every product of 'AMU'.
However, few people know that the Doordarshan Sardar Saheb had envisaged the creation of a Cooperative Producers Association.
The Kheda district, which was once known as the district, insisted on this idea in 1942. And in fact, we have a living example of what Sardar Saheb did for the happiness and prosperity of the farmers.
I pay my homage to Sardar Saheb.
On 31st October, we will remember Sardar Saheb, on the occasion of Ekta Diwas.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali, Karthik Purnima is also a part of the festival of light.
Guru Nanak ji is philosophy of his teachings for the entire humanity, not just for India but also for the entire humanity.
Service, truth and good for everyone, this is Guru Nanak's message.
Peace, unity and goodwill were his theme.
In every word of Guru Nanak, the campaign to free the society from discrimination, blind faith and evil.
I salute Guru Nanak from the core of my heart on the occasion of Sanskrit Prakash Festival.
My dear countrymen, once again I convey my best wishes to you all on this Diwali and also on this Diwali.
Your dreams, your determination to be successful.
May your lives be filled with happiness and peace.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you.
A few days ago, we had lost all the eighteen brave sons of the country in an attack in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay my homage.
And that is why I will tell my countrymen that on that day, I will repeat what I said that the guilty will be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We're proud of our army.
I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir in a special way today.
The citizens of Kashmir are well aware of the anti-national forces.
And those who understand the truth, they have separated themselves from all those powers and started walking on the path of peace.
Every mother and child should be fast and full-fledged.
Farmers also want their fruits and crops to reach the markets of the country.
And, in the last few days, businesses have started smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are not only a way of resolving all of us, but also a way of our progress and our development.
We have to scale new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we will find solutions to all the problems by sitting together, we will find ways to find solutions and at the same time we will build better ways for the sisters of Kashmir.
It is the responsibility of the Government of Kashmir to protect the citizens.
Governance has to take some measures to maintain law and order.
I would like to tell the legal guardians that we have the capabilities, the powers, the rules and regulations are required to maintain law and order, to give the lives of the people of Kashmir a life of peace and prosperity.
Sometimes people are more concerned than what we think.
I have the opportunity to know a lot in social media these days.
Every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country gets the opportunity to know about the thoughts of the people and it enhances the strength of democracy.
A few days ago, Harsh Vardhan, an eleventh-class student, had sent me a different feeling.
He wrote: "I was very nervous after an insurgency attack in Uri.
In my mind, there was a question as to what I could do for the countrymen.
I take a pledge that every day I will study for three hours.
I will become an eligible citizen of our country.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, I am delighted to be here in this atmosphere of anger and in such a young age as you can imagine.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had tried to reach out to the entire world.
And he inspired the people through the mantra of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' and showed them how to work for the country.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji showcased the patriotic display between the sounds of bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi also carried out a movement, at a rapid pace, there was a need to create an orientation, he used this intensity to further build a constructive work within the society.
All of us, the armed forces, the administrators, should perform their duties and we should contribute to this patriotic cause in a constructive manner so that the country can scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T.
S.
Karthik has written to me through the Narendra Modi App that all the athletes who went to Para-Olympics have made history and won their victory in the Human Spirit.
Both of you have not only created an emotional attachment for every individual of the country but also for the participants of Para-Olympics.
Perhaps the para-Olympics and the performance of our sportspersons, in terms of humanity, have completely changed our attitude towards the disabled.
And I will never forget the words of our winner Deepa Malik.
When he was awarded the medal, he said, "This is why I lost the disability.
There is plenty of strength in this thing.
This time, in Para-Olympics, three women from our country and nineteen women athletes participated.
In comparison with other sports, physical strength, sports talent becomes a big thing - will power, will power and will power.
You will be happy to know that our athletes have won four medals with two gold medals, one silver medal and one medal.
Debendra Jhajharia, a gold medal winner, brought gold medals for the second time after 12 years.
Twelve years of age grows a lot, and once the goldsmiths are found, the starvation becomes even more.
However, Debendra has shown that the condition of the body, the growing age has never let him fall apart and he has won the gold medal after 12 years.
He wasn't a Divyang since he was born.
Electrical shock caused her to lose one hand.
You can imagine that the person who had received the first gold medal at the age of twenty-three years and the second gold medal at the age of twenty-fifteen years has done a great job in his life.
Mariyappan won the Gold Medal at Thangavelu Hijamp.
Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of five.
Poverty couldn't stand her way of determination.
He didn't come from a big city, he didn't come from a clean family.
In the 21 years of his life, he fought against the evil deeds and brought medals to the nation in the power of determination despite physical evils.
The name of the athletes is associated with the name of the owner.
Varun C.
You won medals at the Bhatti Hijamp.
In our country, in our society, in our surroundings, our Divyang brothers and sisters, all these medals have played a very big role in bringing about a change in our vision.
Very few people are aware of the kind of valour that the Divyangjans have shown in the Para-Olympics this time.
A few days ago, there was an Olympic contest at the same place.
Not only this, I was surprised when I came to know that the fourth person among the differently abled persons, who did not receive any medal, ran in less time than the one who had received the gold medal, I once again congratulate all our players.
In the coming days, India is on the path of formulating a smooth scheme for Para-Olympics and for its development.
My dear countrymen, I had a wonderful experience in Navsari last week.
It was a very sensitive moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mega Camp for the Divyangjans and several World Record Camps were held on that day.
There I met a small girl, Gaurishardul, who could not see the girl, who came from the farthest jungle of Dang district.
The Government of India has set up a world record on the land of business which is very important.
Six hundred Divyangjans were made available to those who didn't listen in eight hours.
This incident has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for our countrymen that three world records were set up by the Divyangjans in a day.
Dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we started the Swachh Bharat Mission on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
On that day, I had said that Swachhta, Swachhta, Swachhta, Swachhata, should be the duty of every citizen, it should be the responsibility of every citizen to create a synergy of hatred towards cleanliness.
On 2nd October, when we complete two years, I can say with confidence that there has been an increase in awareness of cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore Indians.
I had said that let us move ahead in the direction of Swachhata, today we all can say that we have made every effort to move forward in one step.
That is, the country has moved towards 125 crore steps towards cleanliness.
Therefore, everyone may be citizens, rulers, government departments or roadsides, buses or railway stations, schools, colleges, hospitals, adults from children to adults, farmers and women have contributed something or the other for cleanliness.
Friends from the media have also celebrated a positive land in this regard.
I think we still have to move a long way.
In order to be healthy, to respect the citizens, especially the mothers and sisters, we have to stop the practice of open defecation.
And that is why a campaign for Open Defecation Free (ODF) has been started in Kholaja.
I had visited Gujarat recently, officials have told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will reach the goal of ODF on October 2 this year.
Congratulations to all those who have been successful in this endeavour. Congratulations to all those who have been successful.
My condolences to the countrymen - for the honor of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children, our country will be freed from this problem.
Let us resolve to move forward.
I would like to initiate a new scheme for young friends, especially those who are habituated to using technology today.
The government of India has given a telephone number 1969 so that everyone is entitled to know about the cleanliness mission in your city.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
And in 2019, we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1969, you will not only know the data on the toilets of your city but also ask for the construction of new toilets.
You, especially the younger generation, should take advantage of it.
The Government of India is also calling upon the corporate world to come forward and sponsor the professional youth who want to work for transparency.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Personnel.
And along with the Swachhata Mission, we have to move forward towards Wasteto Compost.
The chemical sercompanis have been told that the compost that was made from the Waste is what they buy.
The farmers who are going to organic farming should get the required juices.
Those who have improved the health of their soil, those who have suffered a lot due to the use of chemical fertilizers, they should be provided with such fertilizers if required.
Shri Amitabh Bachchan has joined the Brand Ambassador for this purpose.
I see new news coming about transparency.
Once I got the news papers, students from Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and started a campaign to create awareness about toilets.
The Government of India has also created one-year calendar in different departments.
Every department is focusing on 15 days, especially on cleanliness.
My request to the citizens is that if you are associated with the work done by these government departments, if you are associated with it then you are also involved in this campaign.
This time, nearly five hundred cities of over one lakh people have fled.
That is why there is a feeling among the people of every city that we are lagging behind and we will do something good next time.
An environment of competition has been created in a transparent manner.
I hope that all citizens will be able to participate in this campaign.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri will be celebrated.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is completing two years.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepawali, I would like to request you to buy something from Khadi.
I would like to urge every family to buy Khadi products so that the lamp of Deepawali burns in the houses of the poor.
Though 2nd October is Sunday, but as a citizen, can we participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan anywhere
You should work hard for at least two-four hours for cleanliness and share one of your photographs on the Narendra Modi App.
If you're video, you can share it.
Our collective endeavours will give a new impetus to this mission.
Let us resolve to do something good for the country by remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
My dear countrymen, there is a different joy in donating life to make a recognition.
In the last few days, I have also seen that when I had requested to give up the subsidy on gas, the way the common man has responded is an inspirational thing in our national life.
Some youngsters, small organizations, corporate people, students and some voluntary organizations of our country have joined hands to celebrate the 'Joy of Giving Week' in several cities from October 8 to October 8.
The objective of the expedition is to collect food items, dresses and clothing to reach out to the distressed.
When I was in Gujarat, I saw that our officers visited the families and collected the old toys in their houses and provided them with all the commitments of the poorest of the poor.
It was really a pleasure to see all those poor kids enjoying these toys.
I believe that in every city where Joy of Giving Week will be celebrated, the enthusiastic youth will have to inspire and help.
This festival is a festival of charity.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the youngsters who are doing this.
Dear countrymen, today on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and his birth centenary is being celebrated from today.
How can the poorest of the poor benefit from development
He expressed his economic vision of working with all hands and water in all lands.
The country will celebrate his 150th birth anniversary as a 'Grib Kalyan Yojana'.
We will be able to make the country free from poverty if the society, the government and all others are concentrated on the benefits of development.
My dear countrymen, I started the Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the occasion of Vijayadashmi.
My heart is filled with the people of the country, which has always been published in Mann Ki Baat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the listeners for the way you have encouraged and blessed this programme on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat.
I also express my gratitude to the Akashwani that they have not only propagated the programme but have also made every effort to reach out to the audience in all the languages.
I also express my gratitude to all those people who have written and advised the Mann Ki Baat programme, have published the faults of the government system, AIR has prepared special programmes for all these letters, and have created a platform to solve the problems faced by the government employees during the programme.
This is the reason why Mann Ki Baat has become a medium of social transformation, not just a minute or two.
What else could be the reason for anybody's satisfaction
I thank and thank all those associated with it for making this institution a success.
My dear countrymen, the festivals of Navratri and Durga Puja and Vijaya Dashmi are going on in the coming weeks.
Navratri or Durga Puja - this worship of Shakti must worship the unity of the society.
It will be a festival to connect with each other.
This will be the practice of real energy and we will be able to celebrate the festival of victory together.
Let us worship the energy, let us move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Yesterday, 29th August is the birthday of Hockey's wizard meditation.
National Sports Day was celebrated across the country on this day.
I pay tribute to Dhyan Chand ji and remind you all of his contributions.
He played a crucial role in winning Gold in the Hi Olympics of India in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
We all know Bradman's name.
He used to talk about meditation, He scores goals like runs.
Dhyan Chand ji was a sportsperson and a living torch of patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, a hockey stick hits the head of the opposition's player Dhyan Chand ji.
There's only 10 minutes left when the match is over.
Dhyan Chand ji did three rounds in those 10 minutes and said, I took the wounds.
My dear countrymen, whenever Mann Ki Baat comes, there are many suggestions on MyGov portal or Narendra Modi App.
ShrimanAjit Singh wrote in the NarendraModi App, Please tell me about Mann Ki Baat and their participation in sports as they have honoured the country by winning the medal at the Rio Olympics.
Shri Sachin has written to you, "In Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely mention the work done by Sindhi, Sakshi and Deepa.
One of them is from North India and one from South India, one from East India and the other from India.
It seems as if the daughters of the entire country have taken the responsibility of brightening the name of India.
Shakta Thakur wrote on MyGov portal that we could have done better in Olympus.
He said, "Dear Modi sir, I thank you for winning two medals in Rio first.
But I also want to draw your attention to this thing that what was the meaning of our participation in other competitions
The answer is: No.
And no one else can do this without you.
The Prime Minister said that in Mann Ki Baat, we need to focus on our additional educational programmes, especially on the interaction between children and youth.
Thousands of people have expressed the same feeling.
There is no way to deny that we cannot show results as expected.
In some cases, it has been decided that our sportspersons have not been able to reach the level of affordability in sports.
And in the medal list, we have just won two medals.
But if we do not find this as a fact, we will see that India's sportspersons have shown immense efficiency for the first time in many cases.
Look, our Abhinavindra has been ranked fourth in the shooting and he has won the medal for a very short span of time.
The Deepa workers also performed well in Gymnastics and secured fourth positions, with very few medals.
But how can we forget that he was the first Indian woman in the gymnastics to qualify for the Olympics and the final session of the Olympics
Approximately the same happened in Sania and Rohan Bopanna Jute.
We've shown good results in the athletics.
After thirty-two years, Lalitabar achieved sporting qualifications in the Track and Field Fields.
Boxing-Obikash Krishna Yadav reached the finals of the uarter, but he could not win the medal.
There are many players like Aditi Ashok, Dadu Bhoknal, Atanu Das, who have performed very well.
But, my dear countrymen, we have to do more.
If we do what we've done this time, we'll be disappointed again.
I have announced the formation of a committee.
We will go back home and discuss how sports is being practiced in the world.
We'll build a roadmap for how we can do better.
We have planned the outcome by 2020, 2024 and 2028.
I would like to urge the state governments to create such a committee and see what we can do in the field of sports.
I would like to urge the sportspersons to do brainstorming in an indispensable manner.
State Governments should review themselves and send their suggestions.
We have to prepare our architects and I believe that we will be able to fulfil the promise of 125 crore Indians, 65 per cent of our youth in the world of sports.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is Teachers Day.
I spent a few years with students on a teacher's day and spent time as a student.
I learned a lot from all these little boys.
On 5th September, I have teachers' day as well as education days.
But this time I have to go to G-20summit and I want to express my heartfelt feelings in Mann Kibat today.
As much as the mother's place in life, the teacher's place.
After the Reo Olympics, Pullela Gopichandra is being discussed again and again.
He's a player, but we've got evidence of how good he is.
Today, I have seen Gopichad as an excellent trainer than a player.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand, his meditation, his self-sufficiency towards sports and his disciple's success.
We always feel the role of a teacher in our lives.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering.
The nation celebrates the birth anniversary of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan ji as Teachers Day.
Wherever he reached in his life, he always tried to spend his day as a teacher.
Not only that, he always used to say, "Good teacher is one whose inner students never lose.
Dr. Radhakrishnan ji has lived a wonderful life by spending his day as a teacher even after being the President.
I sometimes feel that I remember a lot of teachers because they were our models in our small villages.
Today, I can say with joy that a teacher of mine, who is now ninety years old, has received his own letter every month.
If there is a photograph with your teachers, if there is any good incident with your teachers, if there is a message from your teachers then you must share it with everyone in the Narendra Modi App.
Look, the contribution of teachers in the country is very valuable to the students.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Ganesh will be celebrated a few days later.
Lord Ganesh removes all odds and all of us want our country, our society, our family, our individuals and their lives to be uninterrupted.
Whenever we talk of Ganesh Utsav, it is rare to remember the name of Lokmanya Tilak.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave the Ganesh Festival a universal form.
He made this religious festival a festival of national consciousness, a festival of social reforms, and a festival of social reforms.
Everything that affects social life through the universal Ganesh Utsav should be discussed so that society becomes a new force and a new dimension in the institutions organised during this period.
At the same time, the mantra that Lokmanya Tilak had given - Swaraj is our birthright - be it the centre of all the discussions.
Nowadays, Ganesh festivals are celebrated not only in Maharashtra but also everywhere in the country.
The youth, especially the youngsters, enthusiastically started preparing for the festival.
Why are some people striving hard to follow the idea of Lokmanya Tilak ji who started this festival
Discussion meetings, composition competitions, observation competitions were held on various subjects.
Everything that affects our society is beautifully presented in the iconic decoration.
The Ganesh Festival is being organised to promote one-way public education.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us this inspirational mantra of 'Swaraj is our birth right'.
But now we live in a free India.
We will now say, Su-Raj is our right at this Ganesh festival.
We will proceed on the path of Su-Raj, Su-Raj will be our main demand.
Can't we move ahead with this mantra
Come on, I'll invite you.
Our lives are impossible without festivities, but we have to change according to the demands of time.
This time many people have written to me about the festivals and Durga Puja.
They are particularly concerned about the environment.
An individual named Shankar Narayana Passenger has told me: "Modi ji, you must tell everyone through your Baat programme that they should not use the Ganesh Statue of Paris and use the Ganesh Statue made from the soil of Pushkarini in the village.
Conservation of the environment, conservation of rivers and fountains and protection of small creatures living in the water from pollution is the end of the service of God.
Lord Ganesh - Vighanhari
So we don't create such statues that cause disturbances.
I don't know how you're going to take my words, but I'm not the only one who's talking about it.
Eco-friendly Ganesh Utsav - this is also a social service.
There's still some time left for Durga Puja.
Now we have to decide that those old families who constructed statues will get the opportunity to earn if they build the statues of the drainage from the river or the statues of the drain.
And after the festival, they will be resurrected and the environment will be protected.
I convey my best wishes to you all on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be conferred the title of Saint on September 4th.
Mother Teresa spent her entire life in the service of the poor people of India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud to receive the title of Mother Teresa Saint.
A delegation of officials led by our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will be present on behalf of the Government of India and the Government of India to participate in the 4th September.
We can always learn from saints, sages, monks and great men.
I hope we get something new, learn and do something good.
Jan Shakti is considered to be God's form.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the people of the five states with the Ganga Safai campaign for clean Ganga.
The villagers present in Allahabad have sworn in as witnesses to mother Ganga that they will stop the practice of open defecation in the villages, drive toilets, and participate in Ganga Safai Abhiyan.
I thank all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have made it possible.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of five states who have taken an important step by linking the people with Ganga Safai Abhiyan.
Boys and girls of seven to seventeen years have done this.
The emotional effect of this letter is that the day after the letter was received, some parents had sent letters to the school teachers and they would make household toilets by a specific date.
A sixteen year old girl from Koppal district of Karnataka is sitting on a Satyagraha against her family.
When the village chief Mohammad Shafi came to know that Mallamma was serving a satyagraha, he paid 18 thousand rupees to construct a toilet within a week.
Girls like Mallamma, Jeed Shakti and Mohammad Shafi are very remarkable.
This is the strength of the people to find solutions to the problems.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is now the dream of all Indians.
It's a pledge for someone.
And some Indians have chosen it as their objective.
The Government of India has thought of making a film on Swachh Bharat for two or three minutes and send this shortfill to the Government of India.
Details about this will be available on the website.
It will be a competition and the winner will be awarded on 2nd October on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti.
I'm telling TV channels, you've made such photographs.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to ensure that our relations with our neighbours are deep, simple and vibrant.
A few days ago, an important incident took place, the President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, graced the Akashwani Maitri Channel in Kolkata.
Now, maybe a lot of people wonder if the President will engage in a radio channel
But it's not an ordinary radio channel, it's a very important step.
We're in West Bengal.
We know that Bangladesh and the West are taking forward the same cultural traditions.
On the one hand, Akashwani Maitri and Bajpayee Vetara will exchange programmes and enjoy the All India Radio programme on both sides.
All India Radio has contributed immensely to people-to-people contacts.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the event.
I would also like to thank Bangladesh for being associated with it.
I also convey my best wishes to all the friends of All India Radio who are playing their role in foreign policy.
This kind of events give new energy, new inspiration and this is a source of inspiration for the countrymen.
A few days ago, I got a letter that shaken my mind.
A mother of about sixty years, a retired teacher, wrote this letter.
Unless he'd ever forbid his name to be published in the letter, I'd like him to tell you all.
In a letter, he wrote, When you applied for gas subsidy, I gave up the gas subsidy and then I forgot it.
My dear countrymen, you know for your sake, I tried to send a letter to those who gave up their gas subsidy.
I'm trying to write more than a million letters.
25,000 is not important here, it is important that this mother's emotions and the blessings of millions and millions of mothers and sisters like her help us build the future of our country.
My dear countrymen, last year we were very worried about drought, but in August this month we will continue to suffer from floods.
It has been flooded several times in some parts of the country.
State Governments, Central Governments, local administrative agencies, social institutions and citizens have done everything possible.
But there are reports in the floods that we need to remember.
Those who are striving to create unrest in Kashmir by moving ahead with these little boys, they must certainly answer these innocent boys sometimes.
My dear countrymen, this country is bright and rich in diversity.
Thank you very much.
This morning, I had the opportunity to spend some time with the young friends of Delhi.
I believe that in the days to come, the entire country will be spread across the country.
We all know that within a few days, Mahakumbh is going to be the largest sports event in the world.
Our ears will revolve again and again.
In Delhi today, the Government of India organized a massive and beautiful Run for Rio, Khelo and Live, Sports and Excitement.
Wherever I may be, I will do something to inspire our players.
I will also be with you to encourage our sportspersons as a citizen and a citizen of 125 crore countrymen.
Let us all make every effort to make every sportsperson proud in the coming days.
Today, when I talk about Rio Olympics, a poetry-loving and scholar of Kendriya University, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, composed a poem.
Perhaps there are many other poets who have written several poems, perhaps somebody will recite them in every language, but I would like to enjoy the poems that Surajji has taught me.
A young man, Shriman Ankit, has reminded me of the death anniversary of President Abdul Kalam ji.
The country and the world have paid homage to Abdul Kalam Ji on his death anniversary last week.
Whenever Abdul Kalam ji was named, the picture of a powerful India of science, technology, missiles and future was visible to us.
And he wrote that what is your government doing to realise the dream of Abdul Kalam Ji
If we drive out research and innovation into old technologies, then we will be out of the changing times of this world.
And that is why the government has taken several steps so that the new generation gets attracted towards science, technology development, research and innovation.
So I say Let us use aim to innovate.
And when I say "Let us aim to innovate" then AIM means "Atal India".
If we need to empower the next generation then we will have to connect our children with this work.
And that is why the government of India has taken the initiative to create Atal Tinkering Labs.
If we have a strong and advanced laboratory, we have a framework for innovation, entrepreneurship, for sustainable development.
Just as there is a need to build a new laboratory, there is a need to make the old laboratory better.
Everyday we have to find technological solutions to these problems.
We have called upon todays youth to come up with Atal Grand Challenges, if you look at problems, find technology to solve them, do research and invent them.
The Government of India is encouraging and rewarding innovators to find new technologies to solve our problems.
I'm glad people are very interested in this.
When we talked about Tinkering Lab, we applied for more than thirty thousand schools and when we talked about Incubation Centres, more than four thousand educational institutions and others applied.
The Government of India and the Government of India have been working shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to shoulder with the people of the flood affected areas.
Some of the problems arising out of the rains are fascinating in the minds of people every year because our entire economic landscape is at the centre of rain and farming.
Sometimes a disease occurs that we have to afford life.
However, if we are conscious, alert, efficient to combat diseases, then it is easy to prevent this.
Try to be concentrated on cleanliness, be cautious, try to be safe.
Pay special attention to the children and there is no mistake that dengue is only in the poorest of the poor.
Happy, prosperous Elaka is the first dengue to spread.
You must have seen the analysis of Doordarshan but sometimes we become indifferent to using it.
My dear countrymen, I want to draw your attention.
Life is so racing, so there is no need to worry about itself.
I'm sick, I think I'm gonna get cured quickly, so I'm gonna get some antibiotics.
But my dear countrymen, the habit of eating antibiotics in such a way can create serious problems.
Maybe you're relaxing for a while, but we should stop eating antibiotics as advised by doctors.
The microbes that malaria and malaria are rapidly transforming themselves so fast that the functionality of the medicine is lost.
In medical terms, it is called antibiotic registration.
Therefore, antibiotics should be used as a rule.
You must pay attention to it.
When there is talk of health, I want to add another thing to it.
Sometimes the thought of life-threatening of pregnant mothers in our country is very much appreciated.
About three crore women are pregnant every year in our country but some mothers die during childbirth, sometimes mothers die, sometimes children, sometimes mothers and children die.
It is true that in the last one decade, maternal mortality rates have come down but still many pregnant mothers have not been able to save their lives.
Nobody knows that an unknown problem of abortion, infection during pregnancy, high blood pressure or circulation can eradicate his life.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new drive - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan for the last few months.
As per the campaign, all pregnant women can be tested on 9th of every month at Government Health Centre at a nominal cost.
Both mothers and children will be able to save their lives. And I would like to especially tell the specific gynaecologists that you cannot treat the poor mothers without cotton on a day or nineth of the month.
Whether my doctor brothers and sisters cannot dedicate their lives for the welfare of the poor for 12 days in a year
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is concerned about climate change, global warming and environment.
During the Kurukshetra war, Lord Krishna had also spoken to the trees on the battlefield and we can guess the importance of thinking about trees on the battlefield.
In Geetha, Lord Shri Krishna says, I am amongst all the trees.
The Survey states that there is no tree that has no medicinal properties like Nestle Rooling Anushadhang.
The tree that donates goes beyond that tree.
And that is why the parents who talk about their welfare should bring good trees and bring them up like a child.
Our scriptures, be it Geetha, Sukracharya Niti or the discipline of Mahabharata - are some of the present generations who have shown this philosophy of Shastri in their own way.
Just a few days ago, I have been reminded of the example of a daughter of Pune, Gold, who touched my heart.
In the discipline of Mahabharata, it has been said that trees and plants perform the duties of children, and Golden has worked in such a way to fulfill the needs of the society and not only the responsibility of his parents but also of the society.
Krishan Khandu Maruti Mahatra of Narayanpur village in Poonar Taluk, Maharashtra has given her daughter-in-law marriage in an exemplary manner.
Other temples can also start the tradition of sacrificing trees instead of rainforest.
Currently, in order to build a house in India, we have to import timber worth crores of rupees from abroad.
If we plant plant trees along the edge of our food, which will be useful in making furniture and housing, then after 15-20 years you can cut and sell them with government permission.
This could be a new source of income for you, and save India from wood imports.
During the last few days, several states have carried out several drives for the benefit of this rainy season, the Government of India has also passed a CAMPA Act recently. More than 40 thousand crore rupees are being deposited in the states for plantation.
Rajasthan has celebrated a desert state with so many forest festivals and has taken a pledge to plant 25 lakh saplings.
25 lakh saplings planted in Rajasthan are not small.
He will be able to understand the hard work done by visiting the soil of Rajasthan.
Andhra Pradesh has set a target to increase the green cover by 50 by 2029.
The Government of India is implementing the Green India Mission, which is being implemented by the Railways.
There is a vibrant sustainability in Gujarat as well.
This year Gujarat has celebrated several schemes called Amban, Ektawan and Shahid Van as Van Mahotsav and has launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I can't mention all the states, but everyone is praiseworthy.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa.
This is my departure journey, and whenever there is a foreign travel, there is talk of diplomacy, industrial-commerce, discussions about safety and sometimes the 'mouth' is supplied.
But I had a pilgrimage to South Africa.
Whenever South Africa is remembered, it is rare to recall Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever words like egoism, love, forgiveness etc come to the ears of this world, their faces are visible to us.
During my visit to South Africa, I visited the Phoenix Satellite, which is known as Sabdodaya, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi.
I am fortunate that the train on which Mahatma Gandhi had visited, the train on which Janak Mohandas was discovered as Mahatma Gandhi, I had the privilege of travelling from that Petermaritzburg station, but I would like to say that this time I had the opportunity to meet those great people who have spent their lives for the equality of all and for the equality of all.
Even after such penance, there was no need to take anything on their faces, there was nothing left to show.
I could see the duties that have been spoken of in Geetha.
I'll remember that interview.
There cannot be a mantra of equality and equal opportunity for any government or society.
This is the path that leads us to a bright future.
We want a good life, we want a good future for our children. Everyone needs a different one.
Priority can be different, but the only way is development, equality, equal opportunity, equality of feeling and feeling for everyone.
Let us take pride in those Indians who lived in South Africa as well as in the spirit of our lives.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to the artist Burma, he told me about an incident.
Prime Minister, I am an artist from Bangalore, Burma.
A few days ago, I had read a paper that a lady had committed suicide by cheating and cheating.
As a woman, I have enough compassion for her family.
I want to know what you are thinking about these fraudulent and fake e-mails.
"Some people mistakenly get stuck in the face of money.
This is a new way of evolution through technology that is spreading across the globe.
On the one hand, technology has played a major role in economic development, on the other hand, people who use it have also come down to the ground.
You also make mistakes at some point of time because they write your letters so beautifully that it appears to be true.
Your credit cards, your debit card numbers, and your bank accounts become empty through technology.
This is a new kind of fraud, digital fraud.
We have to stay away from such humours, stay alert and share such false messages with the friends and friends of Alaniz.
Our parliamentarians also bring people from their respective areas, meet me, talk to them and talk to them about their problems.
But recently I had a good experience.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
You drew a nice picture at the station.
He not only found the plastic bottles and oil cane dumped in the village, he also planted the soil and made the 'Vartical Garden'.
This has given a new shape to the tarelstation.
If you ever visit Aligarh, you will definitely see the station.
There's a feeling of newness.
This is an example of a change in the participation of the people.
Thanks to those who are doing such work in the country, especially my colleagues in Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of festivals starts in our country when it rains.
Festivals will be held in different parts of the country in the coming days.
Festivals will be held at the temples, at the shrines, and you will also be able to celebrate the festivals at home and outside.
Rakhibandhan is an important festival for us.
Just like last year, cannot you give the mothers and sisters the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana on the occasion of Rakshabandhan
My dear countrymen, we have a lot of people who were born after independence.
I am the first Prime Minister of India to be born in a free India.
The uit India Movement was launched on 8th August, this year, it will be 75 years of its existence and on 15th August it will be 70 years of its independence.
We are enjoying our freedom, we are proud of being a free citizen.
75 years of the uit India Movement and 70 years of independence can give us new inspiration, new zeal and take a pledge to do something good for the country.
I hope that you too will do some good work in the spirit of patriotism.
And nowadays technology has become so affordable that you can easily convey to me something and I invite you to come and remember the virtues of our freedom fighters.
Everybody plans on vacations.
And during this vacation, the season of mango, I think we'll taste mango.
Sometimes it seems that if you get a chance to sleep sometime in the afternoon then it is very good.
But this time it's a terrible hot cycle of fun.
The thoughts of our countrymen are very natural.
And the water conservation sites are also decreasing due to continuous drought.
Therefore, there is a lot of sensitivity towards water and there is a lot of effort to do with water conservation.
A few days ago, someone had told me that the Hebrew Bazar Gram Panchayat in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra and the villagers under it had emphasized on the need for water in the villages.
The crops like sugarcane, banana etc. which require water, they have decided to give up their crops.
As simple as it sounds, it's not as easy to do.
Everybody made a big pledge together.
If a factory uses water and we talk about shutting down the factory, because if water is being used more then you are aware of the consequences.
It's true that I talked about a small village in Hebde Bazar, but there are many more such villages.
I congratulate all the villagers for this kind of good work.
I was told by a public person that the Gorba Gram Panchayat of Debas district of Madhya Pradesh had tried to build agricultural reservoirs in their own efforts.
They built about 27 agricultural reservoirs.
This led to an increase in ground water levels, water was rising.
I would like to say that they are more than the railways.
The nature of human beings is that whenever there is a day in danger, if there is any good news then it seems to be dangerous.
From 106 per cent to 110 per cent of the rainfall in the world, it seems as if a message of great peace came.
It is still late for rains but the news of good rainfall has created a new inspiration.
The farmers need soil, the crops are used for crops.
Can't we take the soil out of the village pond and pour it into the field
It will keep the fields better and increase its water conservation capacity.
Sometimes in a cement bag, sometimes in a serpent-filled bag, sometimes in a serpent-filled rock and soil-filled way, can water be harvested
The water levels will rise, our wells will have water.
So we need to save as much water as we can.
Rainfall, water of the village will remain in the village and if we do something for this purpose then it is possible to collectively try.
So today the water crisis is good, it is dry, but we have time for the next one and a half months.
Shriman Kumar Krishna asked MyGov: Will Ganga Safai Abhiyan be possible in our lives
How many governments have come up, how many projects have been formulated and a lot of expenditure has been incurred.
And that is why it is very natural for millions of people like Bhai Kumar Krishna to ask these questions.
The Ganga provides us a ropeway, the Ganga gives us a new strength to live.
The way Ganga flows, it also gives a new impetus to the economy of the country.
We had brought the Ganga but it required crores of devotees to save it.
This will never be possible without the comprehensive support of the people.
We need to be a change agent for its cleanliness and cleanliness.
The government has been running a number of schemes.
Efforts are being made to fully cooperate with all the states along the banks of river Ganga.
Efforts are being made to unite social and voluntary organizations.
Several initiatives have been taken to prevent pollution through environmental pollution and plants.
Every day there is a lot of waste in the Ganges through drains and drains.
Trash skimmers in Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc.
All local organisations have been informed and requested to continue the work and regularise the work of cleaning the garbage.
Earlier, I was told that wherever an effort is made, it is possible to clean 3 to 11 tonnes of waste every day.
So it's true that we're able to clean up a large amount of waste.
In the coming days, there are plans for setting up of Trash skimmers in some other places.
And people along the banks of river Ganga and Yamuna will soon realise that an effective plan has been prepared to control pollution of pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industry.
The waste disposal from the plants of Pulp and Paper Industries Bblack Liquid is almost completely shut down.
All these things prove that we are moving towards the right goal and awareness has also increased.
People are also helping in cleaning the Ganga, which is why this work is going on very well.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
This day is celebrated in India as 'Panchayati Raj Diwas'.
Today, Panchayati Raj system has been started in our country.
And today the Panchayati Raj system of the country is working successfully as one of the most important units of our democracy.
On 4th April, we celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar and today on 24th April we are celebrating Panchayati Raj Diwas.
This is a beautiful end, the most important part of our Constitution is our village.
He was inspired to do this important work of connecting the village with the Constitution.
For this purpose, on his birthday from 14th April to 24th April, this 10-day expedition from Bapi Gramodya was organised.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to salute Babasaheb Ambedkar on his birth anniversary on 14th April.
Today, on 24th December, I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Diwas in Jharkhand where most tribal brothers and sisters are present.
Once again in three hours, I will talk to all the Panchayats of the country.
This campaign has done a great job of awareness.
At the same time, all these programmes have been going on for ten days in so many villages of India.
I congratulate all the state governments and the village heads for this thing.
You have utilised this opportunity to further strengthen democracy for the development and prosperity of the villages in a very basic and new way.
And that is why we will get the epidemic fruits as much as we emphasise on the village belly.
Shermila called from Mumbai on the edge and expressed her thoughts.
Prime Minister Namaskar
I'm talking from Mumbai to Sharmila.
You have questions about my school and school education.
For example, education needs to be revised over the last several years.
Today, if every family has a dream then it is a child's education.
I'm talking about a house-to-house.
In a country like India, this feeling of education is a great strength for children.
I would like to further enhance this feeling of good education to the child and there is a need to be more awareness about it.
I would like to urge all the parents and parents to discuss the programmes of the school with the children for a long time.
And if you think of something then go to school and discuss with the teachers.
This surveillance will help in reducing the flaws in our education sector.
And it must be possible with everyone's participation.
Every government in our country has emphasized on education and they have tried their best.
And it is also true that for a long time we have been focusing on educational institutions, educational institutions, school-colleges, teachers, educational institutions, educational institutions etc.
We have done a great job in education.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Good education through literature missions should be our main goal.
So far, infrastructure accounts were required.
Now we need to calculate the achievements of education.
The focus was on how many students had come to school till now.
Affordable, affordable and affordable.
But now we have to focus on providing good and efficient education to the children who have come to school.
You have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to focus on good education.
It's right, there's a lot of way left.
If we decide on 125 crore Indians then we will be able to cross this path.
But Sharmila ji's statement is true that it is also desirable to bring about a change in the mindset of ours.
You must have noticed that some work has been done outside the conventional concept in the budget.
Out of the budget, 10 Government Universities and 10 Base-Government Universities have been asked to get rid of government bonds and ask them to know what challenges they are facing to become the best universities.
Universities of India can compete with other universities around the world and there is a need to compete with them.
Along with this, education is as important as it is important.
That is why technology will play a big role in education.
Tele-education technology will make our education easier.
And I believe that we will understand the results in the near future.
Your Excellency, Namaskar
I'm from Bijnor to Mina Karnwal.
Young people have an important role in sports along with writing and sports.
They must have a teamworking mindset, and qualities of good leadership, so that their overall development becomes possible.
I want you to inspire a large number of youngsters, I want the government to encourage the maximum number of NCC, NSS and India Scouts and Guides.
You have sent me such an offer that I would like to talk to the NCC, NSS, India Scouts and Guides before talking to you.
I had organized a meeting to repeat your request so that the heads of NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guides, Red Cross, Nehru Yuva Kendras were present.
When I asked them when they had met earlier, they told me that they had attended such a meeting for the first time since independence.
This time I've given them some of these topics.
I told them why our young friends will not participate in water conservation during this summer
There was such a conversation with them.
I see it as a matter of irritation among us.
You must have noticed that the political situation in our country has reached such a stage that in the last few elections, there has been a lot of talk about this thing.
Economists also talked about reducing gas subsidies.
Some committees have also proposed to reduce gas subsidies.
It's all the experience.
I had said this thing but today I want to say that I am proud of my countrymen.
One crore families voluntarily gave up gas subsidies.
And this one million families are not rich.
I see that among those who have left the SubCD, some of them are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers, families of middle class or lower middle class.
However, it has been observed that more than 80 per cent of those families who have left the gas subsidies have gone to the distributors and have left the gas subsidies by standing on the lines.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
Weekly TV and newspapers will be appreciated by the government if the government gives some tax relief.
In our country, Subsidy is considered to be a right.
But one crore families have given up subsidies.
First of all, I convey my best wishes to one crore families because they have forced the political leaders to think in a new way.
The world's economists, who do this, present such a financial equation, are out of their minds.
Sometimes I feel that we have announced that there will not be any ticket examiner on this route of railways.
We can do many such tests.
If we believe in the people of the country then we can achieve the desired results.
Anyway, that's your opinion.
It can't be a government rule, but we can create an environment like this.
And this environment is not being created by any political leader but by one crore families of the country.
All breaking news is bad news.
Isn't there anything good about 125 crore people in this country
Please change this situation.
He used to talk about it again and again.
A few days ago, he wrote to me on behalf of a newspaper that he would not print any disappointing news on Monday.
And everybody wants people to get good and good news.
If a well-known person speaks good words, chooses good words and presents them in a better way, the effects of it can be seen more than that of good news.
Good news inspires us to do good work.
That's right, if you're focused on good, you'll lose the bad spot.
If the lamp burns, darkness will go away, it will happen
Perhaps you are aware of the fact that a website has been opened by the government - Transforming India - has been published on this website.
This is not just a government, it is a people who can send good news to this portal.
You can also join it.
Raviji, you gave me good advice, but please don't be angry with me.
We will all strive to work together, work constructively, work together, and work towards a constructive goal.
The specialty of our country is Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela can be the center of attraction for tourists.
Very few people around the world are aware that crores of people have come to the bank of the river for such a long time.
Calm down, this fair is finished in a quiet atmosphere.
Institutional approach, in an event management perspective, creates a huge glimpse of the peoples participation.
For the past few days, I have seen that some people are uploading the pictures of the Singhstha Kumbh.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India and the State Government to organize a competition on these pictures.
And tell the people to upload a good photo.
He had said that we have laid special emphasis on cleanliness and not only should cleanliness be stuck in this premise but they should also take the message of cleanliness from the Kumbh Mela.
I believe that this Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual fair, but we can also make it a social meeting place.
We can also build a cultural area.
This can be an opportunity to reach out to the villages in the form of a solemn pledge.
My dear countrymen, on this auspicious day of Panchayati Raj, I will meet you once again. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat July 2019
Mann Ki Baat always waits on my behalf and on your behalf.
This time too, I have seen a large number of letters, comments, phone calls, a lot of stories, suggestions and inspiration.
I think you're taking my exams.
In spite of this, I would like to share your words with you people once again in the chain of Mann Ki Baat.
You must be reminded that last time I had discussed a book on Premchandji's story and we had decided that if someone reads a book, he would share a book with everyone through the NarendraModiApp.
I've seen that a large number of people shared information on various types of books.
I am glad that people have discussed books on science, technology, new innovations, history, culture, trade and self-reliance.
Some people also advised me to talk about some more books.
But one thing I have to admit is that I don't have much time to read.
But I think we should take this experience forward in the last one month.
I want this book to become an active platform for corner, reader and writer.
Friends, I feel that earlier I had touched the issue of water conservation in Mann Ki Baat but today I feel that even before I had said this thing that water conservation was like touching your hearts, it was a matter of public interest.
I am feeling that the recent issue of water has shaken the hearts of our countrymen.
Efforts are being made across the country on water conservation.
People are sharing information about traditional methods.
A lot of innovative propaganda has begun on the conservation of Media.
This not only prevents land degradation and crop damage, but also provides water to the fields.
You will be glad to know that the beautiful state of the North-East is Meghalaya, the country's first state that has dedicated its water policy to the nation.
I congratulate the government there.
There's a lot of fairs in this time.
We can use these fairs for water conservation.
People from all walks of life come to this fair.
We can organize exhibitions on water conservation here, dramatise and provide water conservation along with festivals.
And that is why I would like to tell you about some children today.
These are Nidhi Biputu, Manish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Deodharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Forest Tesh Ganguly and Hrithik Ala Manda.
You will be proud of what I would like to say about them.
We all know, "Cancer" is a word that the whole world fears.
Looks like death stands in the craze.
But these 10 children have not only defeated cancer-like illnesses but have also brought laurels for India in the world with their achievements.
In the field of sports, we often see that a player is a champion after winning a tournament or after winning a medal, but this is a rare experience where they have become a champion before participating in the competition and that too, they are a champion of life.
This month the World Childrens Winners Games was organized in Moscow.
Sports like shooting, copper, swimming, race, football, table tennis were organised.
The ten players of our country have won the medal in this tournament.
Some of them have won medals in a series of games.
My dear countrymen, I believe that you are proud of Indias achievements in the long run across the sky - Chandrayaan 2.
From Jodhpur, Rajasthan to Sanjeev Haripura, Kolkata to Mahendra Kumar Daga, Telangana to P.
Several others like Aurobindo Rao have written on Narendra Modi App and MyGov from different parts of the country and expressed interest in discussing Chandrayaan 2.
In fact, 2019 is a very good year for India in terms of space research.
Our scientists launched the A-Sat in March and then launched the Chandrayaan-2.
In the course of elections, it was not possible to discuss such a big and important news like A-Sat at that time.
In just 3 minutes, the A-Sat missile was capable of hitting a 300-km satellite.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this goal.
Recently, on 22nd July, the entire country has seen how Chandrayaan II has moved from Sriharikota to space.
The successful launch of Chandrayaan 2 has made the country proud, powerful and happy.
Chandrayaan 2 is a special mission.
We must believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan 2 is a complete Indian initiative.
It's an Indian in life.
This is a fully indigenous mission.
The way our scientists used to launch Chandrayaan 2 in a record time, day and night by rectifying all the technological problems.
We have faced such temporary setbacks in our lives.
But always keep in mind that we have the ability to overcome this barrier.
I firmly believe that this Chandrayaan-2 campaign will inspire the youth of the country towards science and innovation.
This is the ultimate truth that science is the path of development.
We are now waiting for the month of September with immense interest when two landers and rovers will land on the Moon land.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share with my country's student friends, my young friends an interesting competition, such as competition and invite the youth of the country to participate in a quiz competition.
Asks about space and space, Indias space mission, science and technology are the key factors of this questionnaire: what to do when we launch a rocket, how to send a satellite to orbit or what to know from this satellite or satellite
I would like to appeal to my young friends to participate in this quiz competition and make it more entertaining and memorable.
This will be a historic event in the lives of those artisans but for that you will have to take part in this uiz Competition and get the maximum number.
My dear countrymen, you will keep an eye on one thing that our Mann Ki Baat has given momentum to the cleanliness drive.
The efforts that have been made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago, today, has set new benchmarks of Swachhata with the help of everyone.
It is true that we have not achieved the goal of Swachhata but the way the Swachhata Abhiyan has been achieved in the public places due to the anti-toilet movement in the open space is the result of the will power of 130 crore Indians.
But that's why we don't stop.
This movement has now moved from Swachhata to Beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching a news report from Shri Yogesh Saini and his team on the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who has left the job of serving Mother India and has returned to the country.
A few days ago, he took the responsibility of not only making Delhi clean but also making it beautiful.
He started beautification with his team from Lodhi Garden.
Through the Street Art, many areas of Delhi are being decorated with beautiful pictures.
When he made the huts beautiful from the walls of the overbridge and the school, many more started moving forward.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during Kumbh Mela.
I came to know that Yogesh Saini and his team had played a major role in this thing too.
There might not be any word in the colours and lines, but the images created by them are more meaningful than thousands of words.
We have also seen this beauty in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is very important that we make efforts to make wealth from garbage in our lives.
That is, we have to move ahead with the goal of making gold from garbage.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read an interesting comment on MyGov portal.
Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Sopian district of Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote: I like listening to Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am glad that I have played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme Back to Village in my state Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was held in June.
I think this programme should be organized every three months.
The programme should be organized online monitoring.
I believe that this is the first such event where people could talk directly to the government.
After reading the message that Brother Aslam ji had sent me, my interest in knowing about the scheme Back to Village has increased, so I read in detail about it, and then I felt that it was necessary to inform the entire country.
This scheme shows how the people of Kashmir are keen to connect with the mainstream of the country.
They also knew whether the villagers are now getting government services.
How can we increase their income
Some other things were added to the programme to make it more attractive.
Childrens Sports Competition was organized under Khelo India Scheme.
The event was distributed among sports equipment, Manrega Project Workshop Cards and ST Certificates.
Economic Literacy Camps were opened and stalls were provided by Government Departments such as agriculture, horticulture etc.
In this way, the event should have become a development festival.
It was a festival of public participation and a festival of public awareness.
The people of Kashmir were immersed in this festival of development.
Some officers were so overwhelmed by the warm welcome accorded to the villagers that they stayed in that village for more than two days.
It is indeed a matter of great pleasure for a large number of people participating in the Gram Sadak Yojana and partnership in building schemes for their betterment.
This is a wonderful outcome of new zeal and new resolve.
Such programmes and peoples participation in it prove that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir are interested in good governance and the power of progress is always more than the strength of a bomb.
Those who want to spread hatred on the path of development and stop progress, they will never succeed in their hatred.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Vendre, honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, has said in a poem describing the form of Shravanamas in his poem, "Hodige Agydelna, Adrag Bhoomi Magna", meaning the verse of rain and the bond of Baridhara.
Whenever we get closer to this season, it looks like the springs have covered the green sheet.
The festival of love for brothers and sisters is also celebrated during this period.
You will be pleased to know that during the last four years, the maximum number of pilgrims have participated in the Amarnath Yatra.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave since 1st July.
In 2015, more devotees participated in this journey which lasted for 60 days, more than the number of pilgrims have joined in 28 days.
I particularly appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
Those who have come back after completing their journey have brought the people of that state with warmth and warmth of hospitality.
All these things will help in improving tourism in the future.
I have been told that more than 8 lakh pilgrims visited Kedarnath Dham within a period of one and a half months since the 4 Dham Yatra started in Uttarakhand this year.
For the first time since the Great Natural Disaster in 2013, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there.
I appeal to all of you, to all those regions of the country where the beauty, the rainy season is spectacular.
I believe that there is no greater teacher than this to look at the beauty of our country and understand the emotions of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for this beautiful and lively month of Shravan. May you all have new energy, new hopes and new zeal.
On the other hand, it is at a time when heavy rainfall occurs in different parts of the country.
When we watch TV, there was a flood around the rains, there was water, traffic jams.
Another picture of the rains is that you will have to go out with your family to see the farmers, the birds chirping, the waterfalls flowing, the green coverings.
The rains, the freshness and the happiness of the people come together and my best wishes to all of you for a sustained joy.
My dear countrymen, where do we begin Mann Ki Baat, where do we stop
I'll be back after a month.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My young friends, you're all busy with the exams.
Some people may have finished the test.
And some people are dragging because on the one hand there are tests and on the other T-20 cricket world cups.
Even today, you are waiting for the match between India and Australia.
Today, India will play with Australia and I convey my best wishes to all the players of both the countries.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been continuously languishing, we are losing, we are lagging behind and behind.
Now our place has come down so low that we cannot dare to talk.
Throughout this year, we can create a football environment.
In schools, colleges, in every corner of the country, our younger generations, our school children sweat them.
There are very few people who go abroad, most of the people travel in their own state somewhere or the other for five days or seven days.
Some people go out of the kingdom.
I had told you that wherever you don't go, upload the photo from there.
We have to take this work forward.
You should do the same thing, but now write something with him - not just the photo.
And it is said - A traveler without observation is a bird without wing.
If you're fond of seeing good things, you're gonna have to make a glance.
And I'm lucky I got a lot of chance to travel.
When I was not the Chief Minister, I was not the Prime Minister, I was a young man like you, I traveled a lot.
Perhaps there is no such district in India where I did not have the opportunity to visit.
Tourism has a big role to play in creating life.
And now the youth of India is going on tourism with courage and enthusiasm.
I believe this is a very good example.
Our younger generation should be brave, they should try to reach where no one has stepped.
I would like to especially thank Coal India.
Then I'll stay away.
When we look at the pictures of the people there, we feel like what's going on there.
And the word is that the coal is black, so people get away from the mines.
But the coal mines have become a tourist destination
And I am glad that more than ten thousand people have seen the environment friendly mine tourism centres in Saon village near Nagpur.
This place gives you a chance to see new things.
I hope that if you go out on vacation, you will also be able to do something about cleanliness.
Perhaps it's not very scientific, but it's happening.
Wouldn't you like to give importance to the cleanliness of tourist centres as a tourist
I firmly believe that our young friends will definitely help in this thing.
There are immense employment opportunities from tourism.
India is still lagging behind in tourism compared to other countries of the world.
But if we believe that our tourism needs to be strengthened then we must attract the entire world.
We can drag a large part of the world tourism to ourselves.
And it will be possible to provide employment opportunities to millions and millions of youngsters of our country.
Whether it is the government, the institutions, the society or the citizens, all have to do this together.
Come on, we do something for that purpose.
My young friends, the vacations just come and go away - I don't like it.
You should also think about it.
Would you like to let your vacations, your important years of life and these moments of importance go away like this
How many things I'm talking about - you can think about it.
Can you make a solemn pledge to add some more qualities to your personality on this holiday
If you don't know how to swim, you can pledge to swim on vacation.
If you don't know how to ride a bike, you'll learn to ride a bicycle.
Do something to develop your personality during the vacation, to enhance your capabilities and efficiency.
It is not just the areas that I have spoken about, but there is a lot of opportunity to do more than that.
This will enhance your personality and your self-confidence.
We'll talk about it among our friends.
This time some suggestions have been received on the MyGov portal for Mann Ki Baat.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
I am delighted to do this and have been friends with many birds on this occasion.
I request you to repeat this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to this boy named Abhi Chaturvedi.
He reminded me of a good job.
Abhi told me he's been doing this all year and many birds have become his friends.
The great Hindi poet Mahadevi Varma loved the birds very much.
In his poem, he had written - We will not let you go away, we will fill up the doors, we will fill the vessels with sweet and cold water.
Come, let us make this message of Mahadevi ji work.
I convey my best wishes and thank you for reminding me of something very important.
From Mysore to Shilpa Cook has shown a lot of sensitivity for us.
He said that the milkman, the news papers, the postman came to our house.
Sometimes the dresser and the cloth seller go that way.
Have we ever invited them to drink water during the summer season or have we given them water
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have heard a lot about Digital India.
Some people think Digital India is the youngest city in the world
If you download this app on your mobile phone, you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and weather.
The App provides a range of topics such as market conditions, piecer market conditions, good cropping facilities, proper medicines etc.
And if you put any questions in front of them, they will answer it and will also explain it to you.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
This period is very important for the farmers.
Can't we dig those old places once again, clean them up so that they can save more water
This time you might have seen that efforts have been made to construct 5 lakh ponds and farm land ponds.
Under the MNREGA scheme, water conservation has been envisaged to create resources.
How to save water in villages and villages, how to save every drop of the rain in the coming days, how to keep the water in the villages and how to start this awareness campaign.
You must join the various government schemes to create a peoples movement for the importance and conservation of water.
There are several villages in the country, there are several progressive farmers and many conscious citizens who are working in this direction.
But we have to go further.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to tell you one more thing, just a few days ago, the government of India organized a big agricultural fair.
I have seen how many modern technologies have been developed and how many changes have been brought about in agriculture.
But these technologies will now have to reach the farmers' fields.
And now the farmers are saying that we have to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers.
I congratulate you for this.
The excessive use of chemical fertilizers has made our mom sick.
But if good spices are given in large quantities, what does it like to eat
Whatever the best of fertilizers, the use of extra fertilizers will be harmful.
Everything needs to be used as per requirement.
It also costs less and saves money.
I hope that we will be able to complete this task with full focus on water conservation.
The more water is saved, the more it benefits the farmers and the more life is saved.
My dear countrymen, 7th April is World Health Day.
This year, the theme of World Health Day is Beat Diabetes.
Diabetes is a disease that brings all other diseases.
Once someone is diabetes, many patient guests enter their homes and body.
According to statistics, there were 6. 5 crore diabetes patients in our country in 2014.
Three percent of deaths are due to diabetes.
Diabetes is of two types Type 1 and Type 2.
Type 1 is genetic, parental, possibilities of children.
And the reason for type 2 is adultery, aging and extra weight.
The whole world is concerned about diabetes and therefore, the theme of World Health Day is Diabetes.
We all know, the biggest cause of diabetes is our lifestyle.
Kayik's labouring down.
There's no smell of sweat.
I'm not walking.
We're playing games online.
Nothing's going on in offline.
If you are interested in yoga, practice yoga.
Otherwise, at least run.
If every citizen of our country is healthy then India will be healthy.
And now all the privileges are easily accessible.
You must think about it.
TB Day was celebrated on 24th March, 2019 in the world.
When I was a kid, I was afraid to hear Tuberculosis.
But when TB was due to death, we were scared.
But now we don't care about TB.
The number of TB patients in our country is much higher than in the world.
We need proper treatment and comprehensive treatment if we need to get rid of TB.
Leaving the treatment in the middle, there's a new problem.
Tuberculosis is a disease that everybody in the vicinity knows, they can also advise to check up.
It means it's a disease that needs to be tested quickly.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is going on in this regard.
There are more than 13,500 microscopic centers, more than 4 lakh DOTs providers.
Treat properly and continue till the disease is eradicated.
I would like to appeal to you, be it TB or diabetes we have to defeat them.
India has to be free from these diseases.
But this will not happen only with the help of government, doctors and medicines until you have come forward.
And that is why I request the countrymen to come, defeat diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, several important days are coming in April, especially on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar on 14th April.
He was accompanied by the 125th birth anniversary of Dhammadham.
A "Mahoo" of Panchteerth is his birthplace.
His study in London, initiation in Nagpur.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Mahu, the birthplace of revered Babasaheb Ambedkar on April 14 this year.
Babasaheb has given us a lot to become a responsible citizen of the country.
We can pay tribute to him as a responsible citizen of the country by following that path.
This festival is celebrated in different states, in different names.
Some people call it 'Nab Samvatsar', some people call it 'Gudi-Purba', some people call it 'Year of Resurrection' or 'Ugadi'.
You all are aware of the fact that last time I had said that my Mann Ki Baat programme will be able to hear your mobile phones in almost 20 languages.
You just have to make a missed call.
It has been a month and I am glad that about 35 lakh people have benefited from it.
You can also write the number 81908 81908.
I repeat, 81908 81908.
I'll be glad to join you.
I also want to be your partner in this regard.
The more you think about your children's tests, the more I care about them.
However, if we change our thinking process in terms of exams, we may be free of tension.
I have said in my earlier Mann Ki Baat that you must send me your suggestions through the Narendra Modi App.
In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to parents, examinees and teachers in a special way.
I want to tell you something from what I heard, what I read, what I've been told.
I know, the test is about to begin in a few days.
How many percent will you get in the exam
I want to say that you set some goals for yourself.
Don't take pressure on yourself from anyone else's expectations.
You must work hard, but try to achieve a realistic and possible goal for yourself.
When I was playing cricket, I had a lot of expectations.
Just as time has passed, people's expectations have increased.
It was very important for me to find a solution.
I thought that I would expect myself and set myself for myself.
And if I set myself for myself and achieve that goal then I must do something good for the country.
And I've always tried to achieve this goal.
My goal was always on the ball and that is why the goal has gradually been fulfilled.
And I believe God will give you good results.
Good luck
Don't ever fall under the pressure of hope.
You have to prepare your future.
You set your goals yourself.
Why would we waste our time in competing with others
Why don't I try to break all my records
Friends, don't consider exams as numbers.
Life should always be guided by a noble cause - a dream should be guided.
Whether we're on the right track, or if we're on the right track, this test takes care of him.
So, if there's any flaw in fulfilling the expectations, it won't be disappointed.
Make the mindset of hard work and effort.
Thousands of people have written several small words on my app through mobile phones.
Shreya Gupta has said that the healthy mind lives in the body.
Students, you should focus on your studies and your health so that you can get the tests done properly.
However, for 365 days, our daily routine should be in line with our dreams and resolves.
I have agreed with Shri Prabhakar Reddy, who specifically asked him to lie down at the right time and asked him to get up at dawn.
Prabhakar Reddy has said that we should reach the test centre with admit cards and other papers.
I couldn't say that, because I'm a little indifferent to sleeping.
And when I talked about sleep, don't think I'm sleeping for the test.
Don't misunderstand, I'm talking about sleeping for a better test.
I'm sure you don't.
I'm sure you won't do that.
It is essential to strengthen the foundation of chaos and success in life.
Discipline creates a strong foundation of life.
The irregularity and disorder that works in the morning, works in the afternoon, seems to have worked out.
That's why I don't think anything is small.
Do it properly, do it.
Friends, I've seen sometimes the test takers are both.
One, they concentrate on what they read, what they learn, what's good.
Secondly, there are other test takers who don't know what questions, what questions will come up, whether we can solve them or not.
I have seen these two types of test takers.
The exams are very similar to the cooking game.
When you're playing, you don't know what trick you're gonna do. You don't know what questions you're gonna ask for.
So if you're calm, eat and drink properly, sleep enough, you'll see that your brain will remember the correct answer to the right question in the right moment.
Don't expect it to be a challenge. Think, can I remember what I have learnt throughout the year, can I answer these questions
So stay calm, sleep well at night, don't be too self-defeating, but don't be negative.
I've seen that your exams are better than your fears about exams.
So, be confident and best wishes for you.
"Vishwanathan Anand is really very important.
His eyes don't turn around.
We have heard that Arjuna's life was only visible to the bird's eyes.
I have seen that Viswanathan is a joy, his focus is entirely on the goal and that is a reflection of the peace of his inner life.
You will not talk to friends, you will remain lonely, you will not be able to calm yourself if you reverse a lot of books to the last minute.
For this, laugh, laugh and smile with your friends. Look at your heart.
But if the water is not calm, nothing can be seen.
Then I feel that if I take some rest then it will be better. Therefore, I myself have developed a system for this.
Deep breathing.
Three times I breathe deeply.
Sometimes it takes 30, 40 or 50 seconds, but my mind becomes completely calm, it becomes perfect to understand something.
Maybe it's my experience, but it can help you too.
Because most of the time we have seen that we have come out of the exams and we are wondering what is right and what is wrong
If parents are educated at home then they should write what I have written in the entire account.
We're stuck in it.
Friends, don't do this.
It's done what happened during the test.
Talk to the family about something else, remember the smile of the day they leave.
If you go somewhere with your parents then remember that vision.
Spend at least half an hour off the test.
In the current perspective, he has been trying to reach out to the world about the importance of conventional minds.
Revered Murari Bapu gave some important suggestions for the students.
And admit him whatever the situation is.
In my experience, it is said that we can be happy and happy if we adapt to the situation.
Without any stress, it will certainly succeed in examining the joyful heart.
And if you do not succeed, you will not be sad for failure.
We are grateful for the advice given by the revered Muraribapu to all of us.
Friends, today I want to talk about one more thing.
My mobile app includes Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, Shri Sushant Kumar, Shri K.
G.
But friends, if I say that Yoga will start from tomorrow morning then it will be wrong for you.
But, those who practice Yoga, I will not do it today because they are tested.
If you practice yoga, you must do it.
If you dont practice yoga before examining, if you are familiar with Yoga, if you are familiar with Yoga, please contact yourself with someone who can do Yoga in two to four-five minutes.
Why don't you hurry
Prepare your day-to-day schedule so that the traffic jam can be checked on time.
Otherwise, such a situation creates anxiety.
And one more thing, the guideline on the question paper, I think it's going to be a waste of time.
I have seen that sometimes after getting the question papers, we dont understand, but if the guidelines are read properly then we can adjust ourselves to it and we can decide how to move forward.
It's very important to understand the questions.
Rao stressed upon patience, he advised all the test takers in very few words.
That's what I say to my young friends.
At the same time, we have a lot of opportunities in our country.
What you need is stubbornness, self-sacrifice and ability to hold.
With all these qualities, you will be successful in all the tests and efforts.
This is the power of science and the power of scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for encouraging the children of the country, for their determination, dedication and practice.
Hang on, guys. Hang on.
If you're having it, you're afraid too.
A bright future is waiting for you to do well.
My app, Ruchika Dubs shared her experience of exams.
We all know about Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the electric bull, and we've read about him in our syllabus.
But today, the light of that bubble is illuminating the lives of the people, that is why the seeds of success lie in failures.
He had no legal education in mathematics, no special training.
Harry Potter is popular all over the world today.
But it wasn't in the beginning.
He had to face so many difficulties and so many failures.
Nowadays, the examinations are not only for students but also for the entire family, schools and teachers.
But the situation of students is not suitable without the collaboration between parents and teachers.
The examination becomes easier when teachers, parents and even senior students prepare a team, unite and move forward with a consciousness.
Shri Keshab Bishop wrote on my app, he complained that parents should not be pressurized on students to get more numbers.
I just need to encourage you to be ready.
We need to think that they are worried.
Writing Vijay Jindal, don't stress your hopes on the children.
Get them as much courage as you can.
Please don't press.
If he's talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Friends, I am sure about one thing that especially my young friends, our present lifestyle has changed much more than our older generations.
We want to move forward with science at the same speed.
Friends, I am saying this because today is National Science Day.
Every year we celebrate the 15th February as National Science Day.
In February 1928, Sir C.
Raman announced his discovery of the Raman Effect.
For this discovery, he received the prize.
This is the reason why the day of February is celebrated as National Science Day.
Asked the mother of science.
Scientific thinking, attraction towards science creates new ideas and on the other hand, new ideas cannot be created without science and technology.
"I am C.
I salute Raman and urge you all to enhance your interest in science.
Friends, Sometimes success is delayed and when success is achieved then the perspective of seeing the world changes.
Perhaps because of your busy scientific experiments, you might have noticed a lot of stories but I would like to remind the countrymen that you might have heard that there has been a very important discovery of science in the world.
Our scientists have identified gravitational waves in their capabilities.
I extend my heartiest congratulations to all those scientists.
Our scientists will continue to take this research forward in the future.
India will also participate in international efforts.
My countrymen, we have taken a very important decision in the last few days.
There are only two such systems in the world.
India is third.
I once again thank all the scientists.
My dear countrymen, this is the number one. From tomorrow onwards, you will hear my Mann Ki Baat.
You will also hear your mother tongue.
The number of missed calls is 81908-81908, I repeat: 81908-81908.
Friends, your exams are on.
I'll have to test tomorrow.
125 crore Indians will take my exams.
February 29th - it's a lip year.
Yes, you must have seen how healthy I am, how confident I am.
I'll be tested tomorrow. You'll start tomorrow.
If we all succeed, the entire country will succeed.
Thank you very much
This is my last episode of Mann Ki Baat in 2015.
The next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
A few days ago, we followed the Christmas, and now we are preparing to welcome the New Year.
India is a diverse country.
There are so many festivals here.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where the economy is associated with festivals.
Festivals are a means of livelihood for the poorest of the poor.
I also convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Christmas and my best wishes to the people of English for the New Year 2016.
May 2016 bring immense happiness to all of you.
New joys, new hopes and new resolves will take you to new heights.
Whether it is terrorism, global warming, natural calamities or other humanitarian calamities, the Earth is free from all these things.
You all know, I use technology completely, so I can learn a lot from it.
Many go out of Christmas holidays.
The focus is on other facilities in the tourism sector, but he has drawn attention, where tourists visit and accommodate, we should be particularly interested in keeping the tourist destinations clean.
The cleaner our tourist destinations will be, the brighter India will be in the world.
I welcome the thoughts of Shri Sauleswarkar and convey his words to the people of India.
He did a remarkable job, printed in the newspaper.
So I think I'll get it to you.
Dileep Singh Malviya, a resident of a small village, decided that if a villager collects the equipment for toilets, he will construct toilets without any remuneration.
Considering this, he has worked hard in Bhojpura village so far to construct 100 toilets.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes we hear disappointing things about our country.
As a result of the collective efforts of all the people, our country is moving at a rapid pace.
125 crore Indians are moving ahead collectively and are taking the country forward.
We have achieved new opportunities for better education, new technologies and sustainable livelihoods, banking opportunities for citizens from insurance coverage, new reforms in the era of global trade and new business infrastructure.
The people of ordinary families who could not afford to reach Dorgoda have been provided loans easily through Mudra Yojana.
When every Indian came to know that the entire world was attracted towards Yoga and when all the countries of the world got together on the occasion of International Day of Yoga then it was our belief that this is our country-Great India.
When this kind of feelings are created in our minds then a wonderful picture spreads in front of our eyes.
Cleanliness is being heard in every household.
Public participation is also increasing.
But I believe that the media will reach all these villages and showcase the hopes and aspirations of the people there.
And that is why the biggest benefit is that those government employees who are associated with this scheme will be encouraged to think that they have done something that will bring about a big change in the lives of the people of the village.
Is it not necessary to reach out to the farmers, the poor, the youth and the women
Whatever government has worked, which government has not worked, it doesnt have to be reached, what should be achieved is that they should not be deprived of it.
They must be informed about their rights.
We should strive to reach out to a large number of people, the right and the right message of the common man.
It's a kind of service.
I've made a little effort like me to do this.
I can't do everything alone, but I should do what I'm saying.
A common man can download the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone and contact me.
You should join this effort like yourself.
I want to reach out to 125 crore Indians. This is not possible without your help.
Come, let us inspire the common man by encouraging him to share the goodwill and rights he deserves.
My dear young friends, from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August, I have started Start-up India, Stand-up India.
Since then, it has spread to every department of the government that India can become a start-up capital.
New ideas and new strategies are desirable for everyone because the world cannot progress without new innovation.
There are talented young friends in every corner of India, they need only opportunities.
We will take this scheme forward by requesting all the state governments.
On January 16, I will meet you and discuss in detail, wait for your suggestions.
There are millions of people in this country like me who are inspired by the ideals of Swami Vivekananda.
The birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated as the National Youth Festival from January 12, 1991.
The festival is scheduled to be held from 12th January to 16th January, 2018 at Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
Can you give me some suggestions on this youth festival
My special request to the young friends is to send your suggestions directly through the Narendra Modi App.
I want to know and understand your minds.
This will be reflected in the National Youth Festival and I will give appropriate advice and information to my Government.
Friends, I am waiting for your views on the youth festival through the Narendra Modi App.
Dileep Chouhan, a visually impaired teacher from Ahmedabad and Gujarat, has celebrated Accessible India Day in his school.
I have received a very encouraging response from the students and have been inspired to help the physically challenged persons in the society.
I think this effort is an important step.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
You're doing it yourself.
You are well aware of their problems and you must have faced a lot of problems.
Whenever there is an opportunity to interact with such people in the society, I have a lot of feelings.
As per our thoughts, we express our vision for their problems.
Some people are accidentally victims of organ loss.
Some people are born with physical disabilities.
A lot of words are used for identification of these people and a lot of thoughts are being made about them.
But it always seems that the use of such words is not right and respectable for these people.
It's true that word has a special significance.
This year, the Government of India has launched the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
Since I was supposed to be present at the function, I had some thoughts about it.
During this period, I feel that God has given some incompleteness to the body or one organ of which does not work properly, we know him as handicapped and disabled.
But sometimes when I meet them, I realize that there is something incomplete in our eyes but God has given him some extra power.
These are those people who have one or several organs, which have divine power, which are not in the body of ordinary people like us.
I like this book.
I appeal to the countrymen, can we use the word 'Divyang' instead of the word 'Divyang'
On that day we started the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
Physical and Virtual Infrastructure will be developed to facilitate access to persons with disabilities.
We may need schools, hospitals, government offices or bus terminus, slopeways or ramps at railway stations, easy parking and lifting systems, braille libraries etc.
We are providing gas cylinders to our country.
The government has brought about some changes in this regard.
With the help of Jan Dhan accounts, Aadhaar cards etc, the beneficiary's bank account is directly credited to the bank accounts of the beneficiary through the world's largest Largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
I am proud to inform the countrymen that it has been ranked as the Guinness Book of World Records to successfully launch the largest Direct Benefit Scheme.
This project, known as Pahal, has been successful.
By the end of November, nearly 15 crore LPG consumers have benefited from the Pahal Yojana.
Nowadays, the livelihood of rural people is being ensured through the MNREGA scheme.
There were several complaints regarding the amount received under the scheme.
Now most of the money is being directly transferred to the bank accounts of the workers.
There was a lot of problem with the students' scholarships, there were many complaints.
This system has also been started for them and it will be taken forward gradually.
About 40,000 crore rupees have been directly transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries under various schemes.
Approximately 35 to 40 projects have been included in the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).
My dear countrymen, 26 January is Republic Day.
It is a matter of happiness that this year marks the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the founder of the Constitution.
The two-day session of the Parliament was marked by a very good experience to discuss the Constitution.
The Constitution also lays equal emphasis on duties.
There is a lot of duties to vote, but why shouldn't there be any duties in everyday life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, cant we organise a competition of debates and poetry in schools, colleges, villages, cities and social organisations
I have got a new idea in my mind that before 26th January, you can write poetry on your mother tongue or in English or in Hindi.
I want to be aware of your thoughts.
You can send it to my MyGov portal.
I am very keen to know about the responsibilities of our youth.
I want to make a small offer.
When we observe Republic Day on January 26th, can we not take steps to clean and decorate the images of the great men who have been established in our cities by our citizens and school-children
I'm not talking about government.
As ordinary citizens, the more enthusiastic and emotional, the more indifferent we are about to preserve these great men.
Can't we make it a normal habit for the society, for the country
On 26th January, let us all work together for the cleanliness of all these statues that have been constructed in the honour of the great men.
For this, the common man and the citizens will have to move ahead voluntarily.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2016.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Business and Employment will start with a new zeal.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas must have begun.
Festivals have a distinct significance in social life.
Sometimes the festival works to remove grief, sometimes it creates a new zeal.
But sometimes, whenever there is a problem in the festival, it becomes very painful.
There are reports of natural disasters everywhere in the world.
There are reports of natural disasters that have never heard or thought before.
I convey my condolences and condolences to all these families in this hour of grief.
The State Government is utilizing all the strengths to rescue and rescue.
The government has always worked shoulder to shoulder.
At present, a team rescued by the Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I believe that in spite of this danger, Tamil Nadu will continue to move ahead at a rapid pace with its role in taking the country forward.
The necessity of resisting these hazards is also increasing when they are happening around.
Now his appearance has changed.
In each case, its capacity building has become extremely important.
The government, the society, the people, even the smaller organizations have to work in a scientific manner in the Capacity Building.
I am happy to note that this initiative has been launched through a series of table tax exercises and excellent programme discussions and workshops held in Delhi.
Besides the biotechnology being cultivated, you also understand the problems of the farmers.
It is our habit and generations have been working to illuminate the crop roots.
Initially, there was no idea about the damage caused by it. Everyone is doing so.
Secondly, there was no training on what other methods could be.
When the impact of these dangers started falling on the city, people started moving against it.
The sorrow you have expressed is worthwhile.
First of all, we have to train our farmer brothers and sisters in a proper manner.
If we burn the roots of the crops then the time will be saved, the hard work will be saved, the fields will be ready for the next crop but that is not right.
Crop roots are precious.
It's a biological furnace.
We're burning it and destroying it.
This is not the end, if these ankles are squeezed, it can also be cattle feed.
In order to burn this root, the upper level of agriculture is burning.
The upper levels of our land are burnt to death by our fertiles.
And that's why we have to play our part.
Mix the root of this crop in the ground, it will be cured.
If this biological fertilizer is used in that land, it can be doubled.
Once I had the opportunity to talk to the artisans.
They spoke of a very good experience.
Earlier, when they used to cultivate bananas, they used to spend five thousand rupees or ten or fifteen thousand rupees per hectare to clean the root of bananas.
If we hadn't got a tracker to clean it, the heels would have fallen like that.
Some farmers used to bury these roots with six or eight inches of measurement.
Because there is so much water in the root of that banyan tree that if there is any tree, tree or crop there is no need to give water for three months separately.
The water on the root of banana keeps the crops alive.
The roots that used to be used for cleaning the roots, now the income is coming from them.
Our farmer brothers and sisters are not less than a scientist.
Dear Countrymen, on December 3, the entire world will celebrate International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had talked about organ donations.
I also talked about the helpline of NOTO for organ donation.
The National Organ Donation Day was celebrated on 27th November.
Chitravinetry Ravina Tandon and other dignitaries from the society were present on the occasion.
Organ donation can save very valuable lives.
It can bring immortality in a way.
When a part of the body is transplanted from one body to another then it leads to a new life and that person also gets a new life.
What could be greater than this
A National Level Competition was organised through the Mygov. in portal to generate shlogans on the issue of Notor Logo, Donor Cards and Doordarshan.
People with physical and mental disabilities have immense courage and capabilities.
But if we change our vision and change our attitude towards them then they can become a source of inspiration for our lives and work.
We're crying when we're in small trouble.
That is why they are the source of our inspiration.
I appreciate their determination, energy, ways of fighting with life and their indomitable efforts to make them stronger.
I want to talk about Javed Ahmas today.
Some parts of the kidneys, microscopics and stomach were to be fired by terrorists.
There was a serious injury in the backbone too.
The ability to stand on his feet ended like his own, but Javed didn't believe in the Ahmed.
The terrorists couldn't punish him.
An innocent person is suffering without any hesitation, life-threatening, yet without expressing any anger or anxiety, Javed Ahmad has dealt with these dangers sensitively.
This is his greatest mental stability and he has spent his life in the service of society.
He is not empowered all the time, but has been engaged in teaching children for the past 20 years.
He has done MA in Social Sciences and as a social worker and a conscious citizen, he is making a silent revolution as an angel to disabled persons.
Can people from every corner of India get inspired from the story of Javed
I will commemorate the life, penance and service of Javed Ahmad on December 3.
Timely I am talking about Javed but I know that every corner of India is a lamp of inspiration that brings a new light to life and finds a new path.
3rd December is the day to remember all those inspiring people.
Our country is a big country.
There are many things that make people dependent on the government.
The government and the government are in constant touch with the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the oppressed, the deprived and the underprivileged.
We have a network of ASHA workers across the country.
They did a lot of social work in India.
There's an outbreak of malaria.
Yamuna Monising, an ASHA worker from this village, has decided that no one in his village will be allowed to die due to malaria.
Someone in the village had a small fever but immediately reached that house.
He started treatment on the basis of preliminary treatment being taught.
Emphasis on the use of pesticides in every household.
Just as the children need to sleep and take care of their children, the ASHA workers have completely dedicated themselves to protecting the entire village from mosquitoes and have made all villages capable of preventing malaria.
How many Yamuna Monitorings are there
There are millions of people around us.
We will try to see their respect.
These are the major strengths of the country.
Our times are friends of happiness and sorrow.
I honour all the hope workers through Yamuna Monising.
The first is the Swachh Bharat episode, the second is the Adarsh Gram Parishad and the third is health care.
I request you to see these e-books.
Not only yourself, but also others.
You might feel like adding something to it by reading it.
Then surely send it to mygov portal.
There are many things that do not come to our notice but are the real strength for our society.
The right example is our greatest strength.
I urge you to come and join the nation building.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is concerned about climate change.
World Warming, Climate Change is now the most lighted and thought-provoking, which is being recognized as an indicator before doing everything.
The temperature of the world should not rise and it should be thoughtful and accountable for all.
Energy conservation is the first way to avoid rising temperatures.
Once I had said that on the full moon night, we should shut the street lights and bath in the full moon after hours.
You should feel the rays of that moon.
I had a chance to see a friend who sent me a link to such a sight.
There is a woman named Nurjahan in Kanpur who cannot be seen on TV that she has got the opportunity to study, she has done something that no one ever thought of.
He has been using solar energy from the sunlight to provide electricity to the poor.
He is fighting with darkness and brightening his name.
People take the laundry in the evening, go back to charge in the morning.
It costs about three to four rupees per day, but there is enough light in the house.
This Nurjahan recharged these plants with solar energy throughout the day.
Look, the world's largest people are doing a lot of things for climate change, but a New York City seems to inspire all of them.
Nurjahan means illuminating the world.
He's spreading lights like this.
Congratulations to Honble Prime Minister that he has started a scheme on MUDRA Bank.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana Fund the Unfunded.
However, the speed at which we want to move, the speed at which we need to move is still going.
The beneficiaries are mostly SCs, STs and other Backward Classes, who are striving hard to run their families with dignity.
Absolutely encouraging himself.
There's a lot of news coming to me.
I've been told that there's someone named Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He has received loans worth Rs. 8.
And he's starting to clean up the penny.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that this campaign will create new entrepreneurs.
And the monster showed it to the bed.
And there was a good business for his family.
But I want this scheme to be further publicized.
May all our banks be more sensitive and help small businessmen.
In fact, the economy of the country is guided by these things.
People employed in small jobs are the real power of the country's economy.
We want to focus on it.
Good, but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had talked about Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
There are many things that always create awareness in our social life.
Internal Vigilance as the Prize for Liberty will be the prize for Internal Security.
In order to maintain the unity of the country, the Inland Security River has to be kept on flowing.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat - I want to make it a plan and I asked for an idea on the portal.
I've been told there's a lot of suggestions.
I have been told that all the participants will be given certificates.
Big prizes have also been announced.
I believe your advice will be very useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter season is starting.
It's a good time to eat and drink and wear dresses.
I'll tell you, exercise.
At least one hour, the family members should work together and see what kind of awareness will be there about this thing and how fresh it will be.
Be a good habit in the good season.
Jai Hind
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to you all
This is the twelfth episode of Mann Ki Baat, and it has been a year since we saw it.
For the first time on 3rd October last year, I had the privilege of speaking in Mann Ki Baat.
Democracy has unprecedented majesty.
There is a fundamental concern in my life and that is why I have unwavering faith in the peoples power.
What Mann Ki Baat has taught me, what I have learnt, what I have experienced, I can say that the strength of the people is greater than what we thought.
Our ancestors have said that they are a part of God.
I can say from Mann Ki Baat that our ancestors have immense power and immense truth because I have experienced it.
I have asked everyone for advice on Mann Ki Baat but perhaps I have been able to consult or understand two or four suggestions.
But lakhs of people are actively advising me.
It's a big power itself.
And in this way Mann Ki Baat has become a medium of expressing the feelings of the society.
I once talked about selfie with daughter.
And so the whole world was amazed.
But the pictures of millions of selfie with daughters from all over the world have reached and the daughters have become proud of it.
And when they took selfy with daughter, they did not only honour their daughters but also raised a resolution within themselves.
And when the others see these selfies, each one of them feels that they have to leave their indifference to their daughters.
Millions of such photographs have been sent by people from every corner of India.
The tourism department of the state government or the central government could not even imagine that we have such valuable assets in the country.
Even if we were a little bit short, we'd like to buy khadi things.
Today, I can say with great pleasure that the sale of Khadi has almost doubled in the last one year.
And it wasn't for any government advertisements.
We didn't have to spend crores of rupees.
This was a belief of Jan Shakti, a feeling.
I had requested the financially sound people to extradite the subsidy for gas cylinders.
On a TV channel, I saw a widow, a retired teacher, standing on the lines of extradition of gas cylinders.
The middle class, lower-middle class families of the society, who are extremely difficult to give up their subsidy, have also given up their beneficiaries.
Isn't that a quiet revolution
He said that the government will work with the people and work with them as a good driver for the betterment of the society.
The people of my country are trying to contribute to the welfare of the country by giving importance to every small thing.
In this episode of Mann Ki Baat, I thought of taking a new initiative.
Whether it is Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup or Kanyakumarika, there is no such place in India from where people have not called.
It's a feeling of my own.
People of all ages have called.
I heard some phones myself and I liked it.
My entire government will work according to your advice.
They gave positive suggestions.
Therefore, the people of the country have a positive attitude and this is a huge resource for the country.
Perhaps there were serious complaints on one or two of the phones.
One more thing we have noticed is that there have been a lot of calls from persons with disabilities, especially those with blindness.
One of the reasons for this is that since they don't have the opportunity to watch TV, they must listen to the radio.
From this, I realize how important the radio is for the blind.
I have received a new direction from these phones and these phones are very important for making the government more sensitive.
Pawan Acharya gave me a suggestion from Rajasthan Alwar.
I think everyone should listen to it and the people of the country should follow it.
You must listen to what he is saying: My name is Pawan Acharya, I live in Alwar in Rajasthan.
Pawan, I believe that your suggestions will spread to every corner of India at the earliest.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the Army.
I have spent time with the Air Force, the Air Force, the Air Force and the Navy personnel who have provided them with water, land and air.
What wasn't there - the entire history was reflected alive.
The glorious moments of the war, the indomitable courage and sacrifices of our army, we can observe through this exhibition, as we have not received any pictures of that time, and videography was not possible.
Whether it is the battle of Haji Peer or the fight of the North, the fight of the Chamunda or the victory of Haji Peer Pass, whatever be the case, it is a thrilling experience and it is a matter of pride for our soldiers.
This exhibition will last a few days.
My request is that those who live around Delhi, you must see this exhibition with your family and not hurry like me.
Look at the power of democracy, a small boy is ordering the Prime Minister, but that little boy has forgotten to mention his name.
We should make transparency inclusive and take appropriate measures for it.
I have to hear a lot of things that Modi ji has spoken about cleanliness but what is happening at the end
On the other hand, on the one hand, both the Parliament and the children of the country are talking about cleanliness and what can be a bigger fortune than this
This movement of Swachhata, the atmosphere of hatred and hatred towards garbage, the awareness of cleanliness, will enable this government to work towards Swachh Bharat.
Local Autonomous Bodies - Panchayats, Municipal Corporations, Municipal Corporations or States or Centres - have to work in this regard.
And when we will celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will move forward in the right direction to fulfil the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Once Mahatma Gandhi had said that if I have to choose between freedom and transparency then I would first like cleanliness, after independence.
Gandhiji had more importance than freedom.
Come, let us follow Mahatma Gandhi and take some steps to fulfil his wishes.
He wanted to know about Deendayal ji's birth centenary.
My dear countrymen, the philosophy of life of great men is a source of inspiration for us.
Any day is historically associated with the name of a great man.
In the days to come, we will remember all these great men, their philosophy of life will reach every house and we will try to learn something from it.
I would particularly like to mention on 2nd October that day, the birthday of revered Mahatma Gandhi, I had said last year that you have different fashion clothes, different kinds of fabrics, different kinds of fabrics, many other things but Khadi items should have a special place.
And that is why in this Deepawali we will definitely provide space to our homes, we will wear Khadi clothes.
And look, last time the sale of clothing was doubled.
How many poor people have benefited.
The work that the government cannot afford to spend lakhs of crores of rupees through advertising has been done by you people.
This is Jan Shakti and that is why I once again request you all for this thing.
Dear countrymen, one thing has filled my heart with joy.
I wish you all the very best.
I went to Kolkata in the month of May and some of the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose had come to meet me.
His brother-in-law Chandra Bose made all the arrangements.
I had the opportunity to spend some time with the family members of Subhash Babu.
You can imagine how pleasant this thing is for me.
Perhaps this is the first time they are coming to the residence of the Prime Minister.
But it is a matter of great pleasure for me that I have never had the opportunity to have such a hospitality in the Prime Minister's residence in October.
More than 50 members of the family of Subhash Babu who live in different countries are coming here.
He sent me a message from the heavenly whisper, and I heard his voice and thought he was going to be a leader or a leader.
He said, My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I urge the Prime Minister to make the youth aware about the registration of voters, which will enhance the participation of youth in the coming days, and make the youth an important part of the government in the future.
Thank you for enrolling on the Electoral Roll and for voting.
Every voter in the democracy is the country's fate, and this awareness is gradually increasing.
Even a few years ago, we have seen that the Election Commission was conducting elections, but in the last few years there has been a major change.
Today, our Election Commission is not only the Election Director but also the Electoral Director, the Electoral Friendly and the voters are at the centre of all their thoughts and schemes.
But only the Election Commission will work, it won't work.
I hope that if the youngsters of the country do not register their names on the electoral roll, they will definitely register and vote.
On the day of the election, I can say, Polling in the future, then drinking water.
It's a sacred duty, everyone should do it.
Yesterday, I've visited Kashi.
I have met a lot of people, several programmes have been organized, many have met but I want to tell you about two children.
But at such a young age, his interest in physics research surprised me.
I think he studies a lot, surfs internet, familiar with new applications of science.
He was talking about how to get rid of the rail accidents, what kind of technology, how to reduce the cost of energy, how to feel the bottom of the bottom.
One such guy has met a small sandwich called Sonampatel.
Sonam is nine years old.
I was surprised, the whole Geetha was a woman's voice, but the most important thing is, when I asked her, she was arguing in English, explaining the verse, and analyzing in Hindi.
I told her to ask her father, she's been doing this since she was five years old.
I asked her about her studies, did she just read Geetha or do something else
The gentleman said, "No, if Sonam once started reading and reading in the evening, and if history had been read, he would have died in the evening."
They're astonished with the girl, she's the only one in her family.
I really amazed.
Sometimes a child's hobby of celebrity, and there was nothing in Sonam.
I think God has given it some power.
Sandeep ji, what else will you do with me
Once a month, I have to make a lot of effort to do this.
Sometimes I have to wait for half an hour for my friends in All India Radio.
Mann Ki Baat celebrates one year.
Do you know how well Subhash Babu used the radio
He started broadcasting his radio from Germany and he used to tell the people of India about the freedom movement through radio.
He launched Azad Hind Radio with a weekly news bulletin.
And this radio was broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengal, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushti, and Adam.
I would like to tell you, I would like to think about your suggestions, and that is why the horizons of my thoughts are open to you through the All India Radio.
I say, but it's all about you, and it's my satisfaction.
Once again I have got the opportunity to be amongst you at Mann Ki Baat.
The people of far-flung South India are now celebrating the festival of Onam and yesterday the entire nation celebrated the festival of Rakhibandhan.
Government of India has started several new schemes including social security for the common man.
I am glad that many people have come under these schemes in a short span of time.
I had requested that our sisters should be given such a safety scheme in the festival of Rakhibandhan.
A lot of information has come to me, which shows that eleven crore families have been associated with the scheme since its inception.
I have been told that almost half of the benefits have been received by the mothers and sisters.
The Jan Dhan Yojana was launched a year ago when I was talking to you people.
A lot of questions were raised whether the work that was not done in sixty years would be done in such a short time
This has also helped the youth of the country.
You will be happy to know that in this year, 1 lakh 31 lakh Financial Literacy Camps have been opened to bring together the banking sector, the economy and the lower class.
This belief has been created that the poorest of the poor can get the money from the bank.
Once again I express my gratitude to all those associated with it and also to those poor brothers and sisters who have opened their bank accounts.
This bank is yours, you will not leave it anymore.
I took it to you, it's your responsibility to hold it.
We have to keep all our accounts in the bank.
I have full faith, you will keep it.
A few days ago, the violence in Gujarat had disturbed the entire country.
And it is natural that if something happens in the state of Gandhi and Sardar Patel then the whole country feels sad.
But in a short span of time, the people of Gujarat and my brothers and sisters have been able to handle the situation.
They have played an active role in preventing the situation from becoming unsettled and Gujarat has again taken the path of peace.
This is the path of peace, unity and brotherhood that we have to walk shoulder to shoulder for the right path and for the betterment.
Prosperity is the solution to all our problems.
Recently, I had the opportunity to meet and listen to the individuals of Sufi clause.
I am telling the truth that this experience of listening to them has brought a musical experience in my ears.
The words of those pundits, the way they talk, that is, the tradition of calm liberality in the Sufi stream, must have come to my mind like a rhythm of music.
I liked it.
Perhaps it's the most important thing to get this true form of Islam to the world.
I believe that this love and generosity of the Sufi tradition will reach far and wide, so that the entire humanity and Islam can benefit.
I would also like to tell others that we are from different communities but we need to understand the Sufi sentiment.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider myself fortunate to receive this invitation.
Buddhist scholars from all over the world are coming to Buddha in India and will discuss various issues related to mankind all over the world.
I am glad that these scholars have invited me there too.
Pandit Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India to visit Buddha.
This is a moment of joy for me to meet all these evils of the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to talk to you people especially in your hearts.
I have already spoken about this thing in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
You have heard this thing in Parliament, in the public meeting or in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I have been saying this thing every time that the government's mindset remains open on the issue of disputes regarding land acquisition laws.
I am willing to take any suggestions for the welfare of the farmers.
But today I would like to tell the farmers that the proposal to amend the Land Acquisition Act has come from the state.
But I have seen that there has been a lot of misconceptions about this and the farmers are scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, our farmers will never misbelieve and they will never get scared.
I don't want anybody to misunderstand or scare farmers.
I have every claim of the country but the demand of the farmers is even more important.
I've decided to let this expiry.
That is, the position before the formation of my government came back.
But one thing was incomplete.
There were 13 such things which were to be completed in a year and that is why we brought them in the Ordinance, but due to this debate, that too was incomplete.
We are a mantra for the welfare of the poor and the farmers in our villages.
Therefore, I had said on 15th August that not only the Department of Agriculture, but also the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.
We are trying to transform this decision into a rapid transformation.
My farmer brothers and sisters, There is no reason to be confused and there is no doubt.
Don't be scared if anyone tries to scare you.
I have one more thing to say.
Two days ago, the 1955 war was completed.
Whenever there is talk of war in 1952, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is also natural to remember the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan.
It is also natural to remember the sacrifices made by those who have laid down their lives for the pride and honour of the Tricoloured National Flag of India.
I salute all those associated with the 65th Indian victory. I salute the brave martyrs.
Such historical events inspire us.
I am glad that India is doing a very good job in various fields of science.
Our scientists are actually doing a great job.
I have seen how young scientists are talking with enthusiasm, I have dreamt of new dreams in their eyes.
In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had said that our students should move towards science.
After this interaction with the scientists, I felt that there are many opportunities and opportunities in this field.
I am glad that in just fifteen days, the government has started working on this thing in a short span of time.
Instructions are being issued and it is expected that interviews for small jobs will be removed very soon.
Recently, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
In order to reduce the health, especially the maternal and child deaths, 24 countries of the world have come together to discuss Indias Call to Action Plan.
This is for the first time in any other country outside America.
It is true that even today, nearly 50,000 mothers and approximately one lakh children die every year during or after delivery.
It's too worrying and fearful.
Though there has been a lot of improvement in this regard, Indias appreciation has started at the international level, yet these numbers are no less.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of death due to tetanus of mothers and children.
The whole world has recognized it.
But we still have to save mothers and newborns.
Brothers and sisters, Dengue is getting news these days.
It's right that Dengue is dangerous, but it's easy to get rid of dengue.
It has a direct connection with the Swachh Bharat Mission.
We saw advertisements on TV about dengue, advertisements on news papers, but we don't mind.
Cleanliness of small household items, purifying water.
People's education has started at a rapid rate, but we are not paying attention to it.
Sometimes it seems that we live in a very clean house, a very good arrangement, but I don't remember that the water that is accumulated in my house, I invite you to Dengu.
I urge everyone not to let death come so easily.
Life is precious.
The indifference to dirty water around will cause death, it's not right.
There are about 514 dengue testing centres across the country.
Examining time is essential to keep the death in check.
I wish you all the very best in this regard.
Cleanliness must be emphasized.
Now there will be several festivals across the country from Rakhibandhan to Deepavali.
You will see that you will be able to observe this method of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, today I want to share a happy news.
I have often said that it is not fortunate to give life to our country but it is fortunate to have saved our country.
Two youngsters from my country, two brothers from Nasik in Maharashtra, Dr.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan has a strong desire to serve the tribals of the country.
These two brothers have enhanced India's pride.
There's a bike race in America, Ross Across America, which's very difficult.
I convey my best wishes, thanks and congratulations to these two brothers.
I am glad that these two brothers have successfully achieved the goal of Team India Vision for Tribals.
See how everybody is working at a personal level to take the country forward.
When I heard of all this, I felt proud.
Sometimes we do injustice to the new generation by following the old minds.
The older generations are conscious of the fact that the new generations do not know anything, this concept has been going on for centuries.
I have met several youngsters who have blessed the Sunday on Cycle.
Some people say that I celebrate 'bicycle day' in a week.
It is also very useful for protecting my body and health and environment.
And I like to think about the young man I am.
Now there are several cities in our country where there is a lot of people who are encouraging our cycling.
It is a good effort to protect the environment and improve health.
Today, when two youngsters of my country have raised the national flag in America, I am happy to mention the way the thoughts and thoughts of the youth of India are going on.
I would like to specially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
The construction of the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar in the Indus Mills land in Mumbai was stuck for a long time.
With this, we have bought the house of 10 King Henry Road in London where Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar used to live.
The Government of Maharashtra will build a memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This place of London will be an inspiration for the Indians who travel around the world.
I appreciate both of these efforts of the Government of Maharashtra for honouring Babasaheb Ambedkar. I am proud of them.
It's a good start this year.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will be helped in harvesting.
And it's a pleasure to hear about it.
There is a shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
We need pulses for the poor, we need some oil to make swimming pools.
I am glad that this time the number of pulses has increased by almost 50 and oilseeds have increased by almost 33.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in our countrys history.
The farmers are closely associated with the land and the soldiers of our country.
The Kargil war was not just on the borders of the country, but every city and every village of India was associated with this war.
This war was fought by all the mothers and sisters whose soldiers were fighting against the enemies in Kargil.
Today, India has been able to talk to the world about the sacrifices made by them.
I am glad that almost two crore people have seen the MyGov portal.
Why can't the reservation be kept for the disabled persons while booking the train tickets through the website of RCTC
Now this thing is very small, but it has never been considered by the government or discussed.
Brothers and sisters, the government has taken into consideration the suggestions of Akhilesh Vajpayee ji and today this system has been started for our disabled brothers and sisters.
The logos that are being prepared today, the taglines are being laid, the plans are being formulated, the policies are being formulated, the MyGov portal has positive opinions about all these things.
There is a feeling of a new transparent air in the system of governance.
I feel a new consciousness.
The MyGov portal has received several suggestions on what I should say on 15th August.
The film stars from Chennai have sent a lot of opinions.
You can send it to MyGov portal, write letters in All India Radio and also write letters in the Prime Ministers office.
Look, I believe it's a good thing that on 15th August, I received advisory from public for my speech.
I believe you must send good advice.
Just two days ago, I saw an accident in Delhi and after the accident, a scooter driver has been running for 10 minutes.
He didn't get any help
And when you look at the statistics, you feel painful.
There was an accident every minute in our country.
For accidents, one died every 4 minutes for accidents.
And the biggest concern is that one third of all the dead persons, between the ages of 15 and 25 years, can be destroyed by death.
They will do whatever the administration should do, but I would like to request the parents, your children should be the cunning person of two-wheeler and all the efforts should be made for the family to take care of them.
Sometimes I see it written in the background of Auto Ricksaw, "Papa hurry up, come back home".
And that is why I say that the government has taken several new initiatives in this regard - be it education on road safety or be it the artisans of road construction, administrative arrangements or be it the immediate treatment of the injured persons after the accident, we are introducing Road Transport and Safety Bill.
In the coming days, I have been thinking of taking some important steps for the use of National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
I have taken another scheme which will cover all the highways of the country including Gurgao, Jaipur and Vadodara, Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangao and Mondiar.
I am thinking of a cashless treatment system for the first fifty hours after the accident - whether the injured have money or not, who will pay or not - how the injured person gets good healthcare and first aid will be seen.
I have arranged a toll-free number 1033, an ambulance for reporting of accidents across the country but this is the next step of the accident.
Sometimes I say that the employees are employed.
In the last few days, some incidents have come to my notice and I would like to tell you that what I like.
Vijay Viswaal showed how to connect oneself with one's own interests, with one's own industry, with one's own capabilities.
In the coming days, there will be discussions and discussions on the pictures of Vijay Viswaal.
I am reminded of one more thing that the entire team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has started a work in the entire district which touched my heart and I liked their work.
And they have taken the responsibility of providing toilets to their sisters during the Rakhibandhan festival so that no mothers and sisters of the entire district dont have to go for toilets in the open.
I came to know about this kind of news that I want to share with you people.
There is a small village named Keshla in Rajnand village of Chhattisgarh.
The people of this village have been campaigning for toilets for the past few months.
Now no person in this village has to do the toilets in the open.
After the completion of toilets, the people of the entire village celebrated a big festival on this occasion.
This is an example of how the values of the society are changing, the mental needs of the people are changing, how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
I have written to you about the North-Eastern India that the way the people of North-East are very active in their work.
They keep writing a lot - it's a good thing.
Today, I am happy to say to them that there is a separate ministry for Northeast India.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was the Prime Minister, a separate ministry was formed by the Development of North-East Region (DoNER).
After the formation of our government, our DONER department took an important decision that the development of North-Eastern India could not be possible by sitting in Delhi.
Everyone decided that a team of officers from the Government of India will visit the states of North-Eastern India like Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal, Tripura, Assam, Sikkim etc. and stay in the camp for seven days.
Efforts to move from Delhi to the East, which I call Act East Policy, need to take this forward.
My dear countrymen, we are delighted and proud of the success of Merce Mission.
In the last few days, India has successfully launched five satellites from the PSLV-C28 United Kingdom.
All this news comes for a few moments and goes away.
We don't normally remember these things.
But sometimes I think that today when we talk to the younger generation and want to know what they want to be in the future, one-sixth of the students are found who say I want to be a scientist.
The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India has launched a National Intellectual Research Campaign to explore new talents.
Now we have to go to another village to charge mobile phones.
All the facilities available in the city should also be available in the villages.
That is why we have started the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Karyakram.
But we have to do more for the poor.
We'll finish it.
I've started it, I'll finish it, and I want to talk about it today.
On the one hand, the month of August-September is celebrated in our country.
Several festivals are also celebrated.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
You must send your suggestions for August 15th.
Your opinions will help me a lot.
Thank you very much
When I said, I didn't think I'd get such a remarkable response.
Millions of people posted photos on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
I have seen a photo of how diverse India is - architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas.
I believe that the government of India has done such a big thing for tourism.
I liked some more pictures that I re-tweeted myself.
I believe that if the Belum cave of Andhra Pradesh had not been photographed then we would not have been able to know the places hidden in our country.
But the sight that we saw on 21st June is very strange, I think there was no country in the world where the sun rays reached, where the sun was not welcomed by Yoga exercises.
I can assert that the sun never sets in the world of Yoga.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that the way people of the world have respected and sacrificed Yoga.
I'm also very happy.
The Sin River and the Eiffel Tower are a symbol of pride for the people of France, and they like the place for Yoga and have also given equal respect to Yoga.
People have practiced Yoga at the Times Square in New York.
As the Australian Sydney speaks, the pictures of the Opera House swell in front of the eyes.
Australian citizens have practiced Yoga at Opera House, have shown Yoga equal respect to Opera House.
Be it North America or Silicon Valley or Duomo Cathedral in Milan, Yoga has made us proud everywhere.
I am glad that on 21st June, when Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban-ki-moon, performed Yoga at the headquarters of the United Nations.
Similarly, the UN Peacekeeping Forces have performed very well.
In Siachen of India, our army has deployed white ice sheets and marines have participated in Yoga programmes wherever our marines were.
In Delhi, Yoga has been placed in the Guinnessbook of World Records.
It seemed that everywhere in the world, a new question, a new joy, a new spirit, a new spirit is emerging.
A few days ago, when I visited a photo of a Vietnamese family for practicing Yoga, that photo was so beautiful that it was appreciated all over the world.
Wives, children, villages, cities, developed or developing countries have associated themselves with Yoga.
Yoga has truly bound the whole world together.
I dont know how to see this thing but I feel one thing, every Indian can proudly proud that the whole world is keen to know India.
Everyone's interest in knowing India has increased.
The world wants to know Indias values, traditions and heritage.
All of us are responsible for distributing this legacy to everyone.
We can do this if we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we are so familiar with something that we cannot see any innovation like the values of our family, we do not know that our family values are important for the people of the world.
Why shouldn't we introduce our family traditions and values to the world
I believe that the world will be surprised - my firm belief will be surprised - there is a lot of such great things that the ancestors have given us.
The success, joy and satisfaction of International Yoga Day has brought a new responsibility.
It is our responsibility to provide good Yoga teachers to the world.
I believe that you can create a database about where Yoga will be taught and where Yoga teachers will be found.
We have seen that if the government is working very actively, if the goal is fixed then we have seen the results.
When we were disappointed, as we used to hear a year ago, nothing would happen - nothing would happen - nothing would happen.
There is a department of the government which is Ayush.
Nobody gave any importance to it
However, on the occasion of Yoga Day, this small department, which is located in a corner of the country, has led and organized such a massive event all over the world.
If the target is set, small departments can do a good job, it is a sample of that.
A few days ago, the world saw how our people protected people from Yemen.
Within a few hours, Indians have moved to Nepal to help.
If the government is active then all the bank employees have come forward to open Jan Dhan Account in the bank and within a few days crores of people of the country have joined the bank.
On 15th August, I had requested all the schools in the Red Fort to construct toilets. And I had said that we will have to complete this work by 15th August.
It was a great bravery to urge the people to complete the work that was not done in sixty years.
That is, the government, the people, the government employees, everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month, I started three public safety schemes from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have been associated with the Jan Arogya Yojana.
Festival of Rakhibandhan is coming in August.
Can't all our countrymen together make a strong Jan Andolan before this festival and facilitate the mothers and sisters of our country's Jan Arogya Yojana
On the occasion of Rakhibandhan, it may be a great gift to sister on behalf of her brother.
When I come to Mann Ki Baat, many people send me suggestions.
Many people have suggested that I should talk about rain.
From Nagpur to Yogesh Dandekar, from Mysore to Harsh Vardhan Mahasay, veteran Nadkarni Mahasay, Divyaansu Gupta Mahasay, everyone told me to talk about rain in Mann Ki Baat.
This season makes the mind very happy.
People of any age want to enjoy the first rain water.
You must be enjoying the warmth of tea with hot pakora, bhajabhuji and cotton during this rainy season.
As the sun rays give us energy, so the rains give us strength.
Some drop of water is very valuable.
As citizens, as people of the society, we have to develop a habit of saving water at a point of time.
We should make a solemn pledge that the water of the village will remain in the village, the water of the city should be in the city.
Ren water harvesting is not a new thing for centuries.
Whatever be the check dam, watershed development, small ponds, small field reservoirs, we have to save a pint of water.
The Porbandar was on the shores of the sea so rainwater was collected for sweet water and kept in the house.
At that time, so much effort was made to conserve rain water.
We can do the same.
And I would like to give you a suggestion that I have received from my direct and successful experience.
It's a rural artisan.
When you plant trees then put an old earthen pot near the tree and fill it with water.
Filling water once or twice a month.
You will see that this tree will grow very fast and become very strong.
I would also like to tell the farmers that you should plant trees without roaming around your fields.
And we also know that in the rainy season, the diseases are more prone to water.
Bacteria activate to increase humidity in the weather.
Therefore, cleanliness is very important at this time.
You should drink pure drinking water at this time.
It's true that the more careful we are, the more the disease remains.
We want water, we want rain, but we want to avoid diseases.
My countrymen, we have recently started three new projects, especially for the citizens.
There are at least five hundred small towns in our country.
We have to take this effort forward.
And I want this house to have electricity, drinking water, toilets and schools for children's education.
When India will complete 75 years of its independence in 2022, we want to provide our houses to every countrymen.
I am connected with you all through social media.
I got new ideas, suggestions from you people, I got a lot of suggestions about the work done by the government.
But when this government scheme becomes a scheme of its own for individuals, society or villages then its strength increases.
In the last few days, Shriman Sunil Jaglan Mahasai, a Panchayat chief of Bibipur village in Haryana, has started a very funny attempt.
This creates an environment where every father takes selfie with his daughters and post them on social media.
The number of sands in Harian is much less than boys.
There are about 100 districts in the country where there is such a situation which is extremely worrying.
The worst situation in Haryana.
And that is why I request you all to join your daughters in Selfie with Daughter.
In order to strengthen the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, write taglines, write beautiful taglines, it can be in any language, English, Hindi, your mother tongue or any other language.
I will revive your selfie with your daughter that the tag line will be inspiring.
In a way, we can transform this Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme into a mass movement.
Take our country to ruins.
I am telling you from my experience that this effort should be taken forward.
Make this a part of your life.
And one more thing - Incredible India - wherever you do not go, you must send a picture there.
Can the entire world know how diverse our country is
I feel that the handicrafts pictures that you are sending are very rare.
You can also post pictures of handicrafts in your area in Incredible India.
There are several things in your city, the poor people are also making things.
And we have a simple medium with which we can reach.
My dear countrymen, that's all.
The next episode of Mann Ki Baat will be interacting with you.
Some people sometimes feel that in Mann Ki Baat, I should announce a big scheme of the government but it is not the case.
I'm working day and night.
Through this programme, I am talking to you lightly, sweetly and bitterly.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
Imagine how the time has passed.
When I used to talk about Mann Ki Baat, I used to say that the words are mine, the voice of the throat is mine, but it was yours, yours, yours, yours, yours, yours and yours.
But I've waited a long time on this Sunday.
Well, there's a chance.
In a household environment, Mann Ki Baat means a small light mind which can change the lives of the society and its sustainability can create a new vision and in this way, this sustainability should continue by strengthening the soul of New India.
My congratulations to you all, I had this kind of spiritual journey.
Some people asked me why did I go to Kedarnath during the busy schedules of the vote
You have the right and I understand your curiosity.
I think I've ever talked to you about the situation of that time.
But today I feel that if I talk about those things then the nature of Mann Ki Baat will change.
Polling remains when I got out.
Most people have discovered this politically.
But for me, this was an opportunity to meet myself.
I could tell you I went to meet with me.
I don't know when I can tell you, but I'm sure you have your rights on me.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I have always felt a positive power in your endeavours.
Sometimes some words of yours make my thoughts sharper.
He also spoke of the challenges faced by the people of the country and the society, and the urgent solutions.
I have noticed that the letter not only describes the problems but also provides some solutions, some suggestions, some imaginations directly or indirectly.
He expressed his concern over the issue of cleanliness and welcomed the effort towards cleanliness.
Whenever someone talks about the environment, he feels the pain of pollution and he also talks about his own efforts.
He also spoke of the ways being adopted, and the imagination that he imagined in his mind to prevent environmental pollution.
It means that the solution to the problem should be a glimpse of how it can be done with the entire society.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror to the country and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of inner strength, capability and talent in our countrymen.
It is only necessary to guide, guide and utilize that talent in the right direction.
Mann Ki Baat also said that the energy and activity of the 130 crore countrymen must be linked to the progress of the country.
I must say one more thing that in Mann Ki Baat, I have a lot of letters, several phone calls, several messages, but there are very few complaints.
You can imagine that nobody is writing letters to the Prime Minister of India but is asking for anything for himself
This is a symbol of the high thinking of millions of people of the country.
My heart is full of happiness today.
And that is why I have easily announced in Mann Ki Baat that after a few months I will return to you.
Keeping this in mind, let us move ahead with the stability of Mann Ki Baat.
When emergency came into force in the country, the agitation against it was not limited to just political circles, political leaders or prisons.
I don't feel hungry when we eat dinner.
Similarly, in everyday life, the importance of the right to democracy is felt only when the right is undermined.
And this is not because the Constitution of India has taken some steps to promote democracy.
The Constitution and the Legislation are required to streamline the social system smoothly.
And that is why the country had dedicated itself to a total election, not for itself but for the protection of democracy.
Recently, the General Assembly of Democracy, the Great Elections were held in our country, where the richest of the poor, all of them participated in this campaign and decided to decide the future of the country.
When something is very close to us, we cannot understand its importance
More than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India, the Sixty One Crore
The number may appear to be very small, but if we look at the world below, I would say that more than a population of any country in the world has voted in India.
The number of people who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than double the total population of the United States.
The total number of electors in India is more than the total number of Europeans.
These are the hallmarks of the vastness and magnitude of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha Election is the largest ever democratic election in history.
You can imagine what massive organisations and human resources are required to complete this process.
This election has been done for the hard work of more than lakhs of teachers, officers and staff.
On the one hand, nearly three lakh security personnel of the Para Military Forces have discharged their responsibilities to successfully fulfil this legacy of democracy, while over two and a half lakh police personnel of different states have worked tirelessly.
As a result of these hard work, this time more polling was done than the last election.
More than 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines and more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines are being provided in this election process.
For ensuring that no one is deprived of the right to vote.
Polling stations were set up for only one female electorate in a remote place in Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the Election Commission officials had to travel in that place for two days.
This is the true honor of democracy.
It is also the highest polling station in the world.
The polling stations are located at a height of 15000 feet in Lahul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
There is also one more information that we can take pride in.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women have also voted with enthusiasm like men.
The number of male and female electors in this election is approximately equal.
One more inspiring information is now that there are 78 women MPs in Parliament, who are a record.
I congratulate the Election Commission and everyone associated with the voting process and salute the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, sometimes you will listen to me not Bouquet but Books.
My wish was to appease the habitual if books can be replaced by flowers
Another story that deepens my heart is Eidgah.
The story is a boy's sympathy, a pure love for his sister.
When the four-five-year-old Hamid takes a pinch from the fair to his grandmother, it is really a matter of pride that the love and compassion of mankind are so unprecedented.
The last line of this story is an unprecedented truth in our thoughts and teachings. "Christian Hamid played the role of elderly Hamid.
A very interesting story like this is Puss Ki Rat.
This story shows a vibrant picture of the life of a poor farmer.
The farmers are very happy even after their crops have been destroyed because they do not have to sleep in the fields during winters.
Though these stories are almost centuries old, yet their relevance still remains the same.
After reading the story, I have a different kind of feeling.
When I was about to read the book, I read about Kerala's letters library.
You will be surprised to know that the library is located in a village in the deep forests of Idukki.
There is a primary school teacher P.
V. Chinnathampi worked very hard for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by placing them on their backs.
Today, this library is showing a new direction to the tribal children as well.
Gujarat's 'Wangch Gujarat' campaign is a successful initiative.
Millions of people of all ages participated in this campaign to read books.
In today's digital world, in the times of Guru Gobind ji, I would like to urge all of you to take some time out and put some space in your daily routine.
You will really enjoy it and you must write on the NarendraModiApp so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat are aware of it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy that the people of my country are thinking about those things which are not just present but also a big challenge for the future.
I was reading your comments on NarendraModiApp and MyGov, I noticed that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Belgavir Pawan Gowda, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahawa Altaf and many others have written about water related issues.
Water has a huge impact on our culture.
Rikveda's Up-Suttam has said about water: Apo Hishtha Myo Bhubah: Desh Na Urje Datta, Maha Ranne Chaksey Yo Bah Shivatmo Rasa: Tasya Bhajayteh Nh Ushtiriva Matar.
Several parts of the country are being damaged every year due to lack of water.
You will be surprised to know that in a year only 8 of the water received from the rainwater is preserved in our country.
Only 8 percent.
But now it's time to solve this problem.
I believe that we will find solutions to this problem as well as through other problems, through peoples participation, through the capabilities, cooperation and resolutions of 130 crore Indians.
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country keeping in mind the importance of water.
This will facilitate quick decision making of all water related matters.
A few days ago, I tried to invent something different.
I wrote letters to all the village heads of the country.
I had written to the village heads to save water, to save water, to save every drop of rain, to convene a Gram Sabha meeting, to sit with the villagers and to consult them.
I am glad that they have given full encouragement to this thing and on 22nd May crores of people have laboured in thousands of panchayats.
People have resolved to save one drop of water in the village.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to recite the message of a Gram Panchayat.
My name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas, when the Prime Minister wrote a letter to us to save water, we did not believe that the Prime Minister had written a letter to us.
Once again the people of that place are ready to play an active role in water conservation.
I convey my best wishes to all the village heads, to all the Panchayat chiefs and their active participation.
There are several Panchayat heads across the country who have worked towards water conservation.
As I said, everybody's efforts can have a big positive outcome.
But everyone's goal is to save water, conserve water.
Water drainage drainage is underway in Punjab.
This has prevented the problem of water accumulation.
The construction of a reservoir at Thimaipalli in Telangana is transforming the lives of the villagers.
The construction of small ponds built in the fields at Kavirdham in Rajasthan has brought about a major change.
I was talking about a public effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women have come together to resurrect the river.
I was also reading about the women of Gadhwal who have been working very well to keep the rain water simultaneously.
Today, through the Mann Ki Baat programme, three requests have been made to the countrymen.
My first request is: Just as the countrymen gave the form of a mass movement to cleanliness, let us start a mass movement for water conservation.
Together we resolve to save every drop of water, I believe that water is a prasad from Parameswar, water is a rock.
Let us begin an awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Be it the world of cinema or be it the world of sports or be it the friends of the media or be it the people associated with social organisations or be it the artists of cultural organisations or be it the leaders of this movement through their own methods.
Awakening the society, connecting everyone and binding together.
You see, we will see changes in front of our eyes.
Let us make a list of water conservation related methods and inspire people to conserve water.
You all can share your content with Hashtag Janshakti4jalShakti.
My dear countrymen, I thank you and all the people of the world for one more thing.
Just like on 21st June, once again on Yoga Day, three-four generations of each and every family have come together to celebrate Yoga Day.
The importance of Yoga Day is on the rise in the awareness that has come up for the Holistic Health Care.
If every corner of the world welcomes the sun with the sun, then its entire journey ends with the sunset.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, distinguished personalities and people from all over the world have shown me how they have celebrated Yoga Day in their own country.
On that day, the world looked like a family full of happiness.
We all know that Yoga ensures a healthy society, a healthy and sensitive person.
Therefore, the promotion and promotion of Yoga is an integral part of social service.
Prime Ministers Awards were announced in 2019 for their outstanding contribution towards the promotion and development of Yoga, which is of course a good news to me.
This award has been given to those organisations of the world who have played a key role in the promotion and promotion of Yoga.
For example, Japan Yoga Niketan, which has made Yoga extremely popular in Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan is a part of many institutions and training courses.
And can Indians remain lagging behind when it comes to Yoga
Yoga Vidyalayas in Munger, Bihar, who have been dedicated to Yoga for several decades, have been honoured.
Likewise, Swami Rajarshi Munich has also been honoured for setting up of Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
Honouring the glorious commemoration of Yoga and honouring those at home who have delivered the message of Yoga, both of these things have added a different dimension to Yoga Day.
My dear countrymen, this journey of ours has started accomplishing new ideas, new experiences, new resolutions and new energy.
You can connect yourselves with your thoughts, it is important for me that Mann Ki Baat is exactly the same.
May your blessings be with me.
You are my inspiration, my strength.
Let us all sit together and listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme.
In the coming month, I will once again interact with you in Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much, Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
My heart is filled with the spirit of Mann Ki Baat.
Ten days ago, Mother India lost her brave sons.
In order to address the challenges faced by the country, all of us must forget caste, communalism, regionalism and other similarities so that we can take stronger, stronger and effective steps against terrorism.
Our armed forces introduce indomitable courage.
You have seen how action has been taken within 100 hours of terrorism.
The Army has taken a pledge to eliminate terrorists and their alcoholists.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, an inspiring message came to the fore through the media, which inspires the people of the country with immense courage, zeal and energy.
Ram Niranjan ji, the father of martyr Ratan Tagore in Bhagalpur, Bihar, who gave a solid pledge during this sad hour, inspires us all.
He said that his other son will also be sent to fight against the enemies of the country and if necessary, he will also be present on the battlefield.
The entire nation salutes the indomitable courage of the wife of Prasanna Sahu, the martyr of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
He resolved to join his only son in the CRPF.
When the body of Vijay Soren, who was laid on the National Flag, reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his younger son used to say that he too would join the armed forces.
With the passion of this innocent child, this determination and thinking today reflects the sentiments of the young children of India.
My dear countrymen, all of us have been waiting for the War Memorial in such a long time since independence.
It is very natural for the countrymen to have a lot of questions and disciplines in this regard.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today expressed happiness at the creation of the National War Memorial at Odupi, Karnataka.
I was surprised to know that there was no National Warrior Memorial in India.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai was born on February 29-September.
You all are aware of the fact that this special day comes once in four years.
In a simple, peaceful personality, Morarji Bhai was one of the most dedicated leaders of this country.
In our independent India, the record of presenting the most budget in Parliament is in the name of Morarji Bhai Desai.
During that difficult period, Morarji gave India the right leadership while the country's democracy was in a dilemma.
Morarji Bhai had dedicated himself in the struggle against the Emergency to protect this democracy.
And for this, he had to pay a lot of money even after coming to Buddha.
The government arrested him and sent him to jail.
But when the Janta Party won in 1971, he became our Prime Minister.
The 44th Amendment to the Constitution was proposed during his tenure.
This is the reason why the 42nd Amendment to the Emergency was proposed, where there were other proposals to de-clog the power of the Supreme Court, so that our democratic values could not be neglected and sent back.
For example, due to the 44th Amendment Resolution, all the work done by the Parliament and the Legislative Assemblies was made public in the newspapers.
Certain powers of the Supreme Court were vested in the Amendment proposing that clauses 20 and 21 of the Constitution enforce the basic rights of the citizens to be abolished in any way due to Emergency.
Once again I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, people were very curious about the Padma awards.
I want to tell you about some of these people today.
Remembering the words of Abdul Gafoor Khatdi ji in Gujarat, he has done wonderful work to revive Kutch's traditional rogan arts.
He has done a wonderful job in bringing this rare industry to the next generation.
I gave a present to former US President Barack Obama, the 'Tree of Life' made by Abdul Ghafoor.
Among the awardees of the Padma awards, everyone knows Sabbi Sayeed of Marathwada as the servant of cow.
He added that the way he has spent his entire life in the service of cow slaughter.
Madurai Chinna Pillai, the distinguished people who have tried to make the victims and the victims self-reliant through the Kalanjiyam movement in Tamil Nadu.
He has trained all people around the world in Yoga even at the age of 100 and has produced 1500 Yoga teachers till date.
Yamuna Tudu, famously known as the Lady Tarzan of Jharkhand, has done a brave job of dealing with planting mafia and designers and has not only saved 50 hectares of forests from flying, but has also sent ten thousand women together to protect trees and wildlife.
As a result of this hard work of Yamuna Ji, today the people of the village do 18 at the time of birth of every child and plant 10 trees at the time of marriage of every girl child.
He dedicated himself to the cause of self-reliance and self-reliance of visually impaired children by creating an organisation called 'Chokhi Mahila Sevakunj' for the development of women with disabilities.
In fact, he has done experimental work with the farmers and my dear countrymen, for the first time this year, there are 12 farmers out of those who have been awarded the Padma awards.
Normally, very few people associated with agriculture and those who are directly from the farmers are listed on the list of 'Pamshree' beneficiaries.
And this is the living picture of changing India.
My dear countrymen, I would like to share a heart-wrenching experience with all of you today.
Today, I want to meet the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana PM-JYA and PM Jan Arogya Yojana everywhere in the country.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, nearly 12 lakh poor families have taken the opportunity of this scheme.
I understand how big a change has been made in the lives of the poor.
If you are aware of the poor, who cannot afford to get the treatment, you are aware of this scheme.
This scheme has been launched for the benefit of the poor.
My dear brothers and sisters, there is going to be a school examination.
Preparations will be made for the examination of the Board of Parliament and 12th Category across the country.
My best wishes to the test takers, their parents and teachers.
A few days ago, a massive programme was organized at Town Hall Format in Delhi under the Pariksha Pe Charcha.
I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all the students, their teachers, parents and YouTube for witnessing the recording of this programme.
My dear countrymen, India will talk and it will not be a matter of worship.
Perhaps there is no day in our country for which there is no festival or mountaineering or there is no significance because we have a thousand years old tradition.
In a few days, the Mahashivaratri is coming and this time Shivratri has fallen on Mondays and Saturdays and when Shivratri falls together, our hearts are filled with sacred feelings and devotion.
I am extremely impressed with the power of Divyangjan.
My dear countrymen, it is a unique experience for me to connect with you all through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I face millions of families every month through radio.
Sometimes, I got the opportunity to read your letters, talk to you people, or listen to your suggestions and suggestions by sending them on the phone.
It's a great pleasure for me.
Friends, Elections are the biggest festival of democracy.
We will be busy with elections for the next two months.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
He had spent his entire life in the field of food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
The cultivation of the cultivation of the Siddhaganga.
I once again pay my heartfelt respect to such a great man.
But today I'm talking about something else.
Imagine, just for a voter.
If you're unable to vote for a reason, you're gonna have to suffer a lot of mental hardship.
I would like to convey my best wishes to all the dignitaries of the country, to all the citizens of the country, to all the citizens of the country, to enroll and enroll the electoral rolls in the Amrus bay.

This is where the British rulers visited the Birth Col Prem Sehgal, Col. Gurubox Singh and the Major General Shahan.
When I looked at the stories related to Mandir Netaji at the Lal uila, the members of Netaji's family gave me a special gift.
Once Netaji used this thing.
This is what I have done in the satellite museum so that people can look at the museum and inspire the nation.
The valour of our heroes, the patriotic tales of our younger generations are immensely beneficial to our media.
Ahead of this month on 30th December, I visited Andaman Nicobar Islands.
But it was the 75-year-old Flying Organisation of India.
Dillichlo, Your Majesty, I am your Freedom Deity.
A couple of years ago, all the files related to Netaji would have to be made public.
I'm glad we've done this.
On that day, I had come to the residence of the Prime Minister as the Prime Minister of India.
I have been told that Radio Station Weekly Writing English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pusti, Urdu-Thadi.
Business has been a land of great importance.
The museum has the history hibition and there's a 450-year-old painting art work ethnic.
It showcases excellent artisans from Amritshergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Abanindranath Thakur, Gagan Abhitakur, Nandlal Bose, Jaminira and Shailja Mukherjee.
He made a lot of painting.
He said that there is a lot of natural beauty amongst the birds, and he has immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immensely immense possibilities in the field of arts.
And it is surprising that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore never mentioned the root cause of this art.
He said that if you think about painting, you can understand the visually impaired people, you can see them in a vision of academics.
Orpainting has also been exhibited in various countries, Russia and the United States of America.
I hope you will visit the temple painting.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of the saints.
Our saints have given the opinion of the citizens and have given the message of harmony, equality and social efficiency.

I would like to make an unprecedented experiment with my young friends, especially in the field of stress free exams.
In this regard, I got to know the opinions of the people and the opinions of mygov are being shared by those great men.
Wherever we are, we must pay homage to the martyrs by two minutes.
In the memory of the revered Bapu, we will continue to fulfill his dreams by declaring the creation of New India, the duties of Citizenship.

On 19th December, the life of Dr. Jaya Chandra ji was lost in Chennai.
Narsamma was a helpful smoke in the delivery of pregnant mothers and sisters.
He has served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
He was awarded the Padmashri award earlier this year.
Dr. Jaya Chandran and Sulagitti are illustrated personalities like Narsamma who have laid down their lives for the betterment of society.
When I talk about healthcare, I would like to mention the social efforts of the doctors in Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some members of my party told me that some young doctors of the city are camping and treating the poor free of cost.
Now hundreds of poor people are benefiting from this camp every month.
This spirit of selfless service is really commendable.
Today, I can say with pride that our collective efforts have made the Swachh Bharat Mission a successful mission.
Some people have told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people joined the cleanliness drive in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
In this magnificence of Swachhata, citizens, voluntary organisations, school-children and the people of Jabalpur participated with enthusiasm.
This is where I can get to know about Dr. Jaya Chandran.
Whenever it comes to time, I go to The Batter India.com website and try to find out about this inspiring thing.
I am glad that there are several such websites today that introduce us to the life story of inspiring people.
You can easily learn Sanskrit language by sitting at home through Sanskrit Bharati.
I believe that many people will know about these heroes who have brought about change in society.
It is very easy to spread negativeness but surrounding us, there is a lot of good work being done in our society and this is possible because of the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports has a different significance in all societies.
Whenever there is a game, the audience also gets enthusiastic.
I would like to mention about Hannaya Nisa, a daughter from Kashmir, who won a gold medal in Carette in Korea.
The twelfth year Hannaya lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
I wish all the countrymen a bright future.
Many congratulations and best wishes to Hannai.
A lot of discussions have been going on in the media regarding this kind of other daughters and sixteen Rajnis.
You must have read.
Junior Boxing of Rajini Girls won the Gold Medal in 1951.
He did something in honor of his father Jasmer Singh who sold luxury in a waterways shop.
Rajani said he had to admit a lot of sacrifices and sufferings to reach this place.
Jasmer Singh went to work every morning before Rajani and his brothers and sisters got up.
When Rajani wanted to teach his father boxing, he tried his best to enhance his zeal and make his dream successful.
Rajini started boxing practice with old gloves, because then his family's financial condition was not good.
Despite all adversity, Rajini did not lose courage and continued to teach boxing.
He won a medal in Serbia.
As I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajni, I congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani for being close to Rajni and encouraging her.
This month, the twenty-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni of Pune, travelled the world on a bike and earned the pride of being the fastest Asian.
He used to carry around 300 kilometers of bicycle per day for 159 days.
Imagine, 300 kilometers of cycling every day
His indomitable enthusiasm for cycling is really commendable.
Adversity never stops.
When we hear about such other examples, we also get inspired from every moment of our life.
My dear countrymen, several festivals are being celebrated in January like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magha Bihu, Maghi etc.
In all these festivals, the whole of India will see the colors of traditional dance and the joy of growing crops somewhere in the world.
Sports will be organised somewhere, and somewhere will be celebrated with sweets and sweets.
The Festival is a unique festive festivities, in some way or the other, associated with agriculture and rural life.
At this time the sun is answered and the sun enters the Makar Rashi.
Since then, the day begins to grow gradually and winter crops start to grow.
I also extend my best wishes to our brothers and sisters who feed us on this occasion.
The idea of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is inherent in the glorious festival of diversity.
We can see how deep these festivals are associated with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not seen separately, individuals and groups.
Another beautiful example of our detail with nature is the Festival-based calendar.
The calendars are accompanied by the Festival of Years with the details of planetary content.
These traditional calendars show how ancient our relationship with natural and psychological events is.
Based on the speed of the moon and the sun, the lunar calendar sets the festivities and festivals.
It depends on who follows a calendar.
Festivals are scheduled to be held at many places on the planets.
The festivals like Gudi Padwa, Cheti Chand, Ugadi are celebrated in accordance with the lunar calendar as well as in Tamil Nadu, Puthandu and Vishnu, Vaisakh, Vaishakhi, Paula Vaishakh, Bihu etc. are celebrated as per the sun calendar.
Many of us have a special objective of protecting rivers and water in the mountains.
Chhota Parvati River and the pond are associated with sun worship.
Millions of people take bath in the holy rivers in Makar Sankranti.
Our festivals also teach social values.
On the one hand, they have an ancient significance, on the other hand, these festivals inspire and educate each other in a very simple way.
I wish you all the very best in 2019 and wish you all the very best.
You should share the photographs on this festival with all of you so that everyone can see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there are so many things in our culture that we can take pride in and we can highlight the entire world and this is the Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
Several films also showcase the rich heritage and diversity of the fair, which is really important as the larger theme of the Kumbh.
People from all over the world come to participate in the Kumbh.
The Kumbh Mela is a source of faith and admiration.
Millions of people from India and abroad are coming together at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh has been strengthened and thrived by our great cultural heritage.
Saints and souls have started reaching the Kumbh Mela from now on.
Last year, the UNESCO Kumbh Mela was listed on the Intensive Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, Ambassadors of many countries have seen the preparations for Kumbh.
The National Flag was unveiled simultaneously.
The Kumbh Mela being held at Prayagraj is expected to bring more than 150 people to the country.
It can be a very large learning experience, especially for the youth.
I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the Kumbh is undergoing a strong preparation.
The people of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic about the Kumbh.
This time there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness in the Kumbh.
This Akshayvat was shut down in the fort for thousands of years, so the devotees could not see it even if they wanted.
Now the Akshay Bot's door is opened for everyone.
I appeal to you all, when you visit Kumbh, you must share the different features and photos of Kumbh on social media so that more and more people are inspired to visit Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of spirituality be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith be the Mahakumbh of patriotism and national integration.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, the Republic Day is celebrated with great fervour and on that day we remember those great men who gave us the Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
Fortunately, the President of South Africa, Mr. Sir Cyril Ramaphosa, is coming to India as the Chief Guest on Republic Day.
Revered Bapu and South Africa have an unbreakable bond.
South Africa is the place where Mohan became the Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started the first Satyagraha and stood up against casteism.
He had established Phoenix and Tolstoy Farm, from where the voices of peace and justice were heard all over the world.
He had gained strength and inspiration from revered Bapu for so many years in prison.
Mandela had said, "Spirit is an integral part of our history because it is here that he first used himself on the path of truth.
There is a detailed discussion on how steps are needed to strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen.
In this conference, I have announced the introduction of the Sardar Patel Award for National Integration which will be given to those who have contributed somehow towards national unity.
Sardar Patel had laid down his life for the unity of the country.
He has worked for the rest of his life to keep India's integrity untouched.
He said the country's unity lies in diversity.
I would like to pay homage to Sardar Patel through this prize of unity.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh will be celebrated on 13th January.
Guru Gobind Singh was born in Patna.
Most of his life was the land of North India and he gave up his last breath at Nanded in Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna, the workplace of North India and the last time of life in Nanded.
In a way, the entire India has received his blessings.
According to Guru Gobind Singh, it is the biggest service to alleviate the sorrows of the people.
He was blessed with valour, valour, sacrifice and devotion.
Weapons and scriptures were his extraordinary knowledge.
On the one hand, he was an archer, on the other hand, mastermind, Braj Bhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi, Adivasi etc.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are some good things happening in the country that are not widely practiced.
Several events are being organized across the country to mark the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Efforts are being made to create safe and healthy food habits.
As part of Eat Right India campaign, Swasth Bharat Yatra is being organised across the country.
The expedition will continue till 27th January, 2019.
India will be prosperous only when it becomes clean and healthy.
Nutritious diet is needed for good health.
Whether individual life or national life or social life is a source of inspiration for progress.
Come, let us move ahead with innovative inspiration, innovation, new resolve, new goals and new heights.
Mann Ki Baat November, 2019
The 50th edition of Mann Ki Baat was completed today.
Golden Jubilee Episode.
This time, most of the letters and phone calls have been mentioned in this 50th edition.
Through the MyGov App, the Participants of Delhi, Kamalkumar and Vikas Yadav from Patna, Manika Jain from Delhi on the Narendra Modi App, Government from West Bengal, Sangeeta Shastri from Nagpur have raised almost every question.
This question is very natural.
In today's era, when people had almost forgotten the radio, why did Modi bring back the radio
This time the shopkeeper says, listen to the radio.
I heard on the radio, that bomb exploding is going on.
The shopkeeper said that the Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had said on the radio that the historical significance of the Nuclear Bomb Examination was to break the bomb.
I was wondering if the shopkeeper's gentlemen were glad to see the dance, they were listening to the radio stores in this area, in the snowy mountainous regions, in the midst of the forests.
I am thinking of the Radio Communication Reach and its far-reaching impact.
Next, when I became the Prime Minister, I would like to seek help from the most powerful media.
Since May 2014, when I started assuming the office of the Chief Servant, I felt that our country's unity, our glorious history, valour, diversity, cultural diversity, people's work, men's emotions, sacrifice and penance should be spread across the country.
I have reached the 50th edition to read lakhs of letters every month, to listen to phone calls, to know about the various apps and to share them with each other, to talk about my own fun.
The results of the survey are very encouraging.
Seventy percent of those listening to Mann Ki Baat have heard every episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Most people think that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced the emotions of positive thinking among all sections of the society.
Through Mann Ki Baat, peoples movement has achieved a lot of expansion.
Hass Tag India Positive has been discussed in detail.
This is a paradigm shift in which people are coming forward for social service.
Modi will come and go, but our country will endure and our culture will remain immortal.
These short stories of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
A new inspiration filled with enthusiasm will take the country to greater heights.
I read letters and feel like this and work with them.
I have realized both these things myself and shared them and shared them with all of you.
But who knows when these words go home again.
Sometimes the government will have such power that the schemes like Selfie with Daughter will start from a small village in Haryana and will spread across the country and across the world.
Every section of the society, every section of the society and every celebrity, has been associated with it and the ideas of the society have been demonstrated in a modern speech and a modern generation will be illuminated.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat has also been enjoyed, but in my mind, 130 crore Indians are roaming around.
Their minds are mine.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government thing, it is a matter of society.
There are many aspects of social life in which politics is only one aspect.
Politics becomes a key factor, it cannot be a reflection of a healthy society.
Sometimes political events or political people become so important that other talents or other talents of the society become neglected.
It is our collective responsibility to take care of the talent of the people and other things of the society for the bright future of a country like India and the humble and humble endeavour of Mann Ki Baat.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat is that you not only ask the Prime Minister but also ask a close associate of yours, that is democracy.
There is also a toll free number - 1 x 7800, calling there, people record their message in their voices.
I am trying to read as many letters and comments as possible before Mann Ki Baat.
I've heard a lot of calls.
This time Mann Ki Baat episode keeps on moving forward and I keep reading the ideas and ideas sent by you people during your visits.
That paper is not just a piece of paper for me.
Besides, I have spent 40-45 years of my life in a paradigm shift and have spent a lot of time in most of the districts of the country.
And that is why when I read a letter, I can easily connect myself to that place.
After that, I note some information, such as village, name of individuals.
In fact, in Mann Ki Baat, I have voices, but for example, emotions and energy belong to my countrymen, I would like to thank all those who contribute to Mann Ki Baat.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not yet taken the name of Mann Ki Baat but they continue to send their letters and comments without disappointment.
I have full faith that your message will come to me more than ever before and it will make Mann Ki Baat more entertaining, effective and useful.
It is also being tried that all the letters which are not included in the Mann Ki Baat programme should also be monitored by the concerned departments regarding all the letters and suggestions.
I would also like to thank all the media, Doordarshan, other TV channels, social media friends of All India Radio.
Mann Ki Baat is reaching out to the maximum number of people due to their hard work.
Thus, they became Narendra Modi for thirty minutes.
I congratulate and thank them for their talent and skills.
I urge you all to listen to this event in your regional languages as well.
I also thank those friends of the media who are regularly publishing Mann Ki Baat programmes on their channels.
No political person gets satisfactory with the media, thinks that he is covered very little or is a negative coverage, but the media has taken a number of topics in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
This journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete without your help.
Nidhi-ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
Normally I say I have no mystery.
What I'm doing is perhaps in all families.
In a simple language, I try to create myself like all the youngsters, keep myself in that position and try to match their opinions with a wave length match.
We have some old baggages in our own life, if they are not brought forward then it becomes easier to convince someone.
We don't know how one of us has acknowledged the thoughts of others.
The good quality of the present youth is that he never does what he does not believe in himself, and when he believes in something, he leaves everything behind him.
Often people talk about communication gap between the elders of the family and the Teenager.
But most of the families had limited discussions with the teenagers.
Most of the time you talk about reading or habits, life style, don't do it.
It is also a matter of concern that without any conditions, the conversation in the open mind is gradually becoming less in the family.
If we replace the aspirations and discuss without negotiating badly, any media becomes very important.
I have been in constant touch with the youth through various programmes and social media.
I've always learned from the thoughts of the youth.
Young people have different ideas.
Youngsters are enthusiastic, innovative and innovative.
Some say that young students want to do different things together.
I mean, what's wrong with that
They are skilled in multi-tasking, so they do it.
If we look around, we will see social initiatives, start-ups, sports, or any other sector bringing about a big change in the society.
The young men who dared to question and dream.
If we give up the ability to make decisions on the youth and if they can openly express their thoughts then they can bring about a positive change in the country and they are doing it.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to MyGov website, Vinita Ji has written that this time Mann Ki Baat will have to say something about the Constitution Day of November 26th.
This is a special occasion because we are entering the seventeenth year of the Constitution of India.
Binita ji, thank you very much for your suggestion.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
Let us remember those great personalities who have framed our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1949.
It took two years and 11 months and 17 days for the Constitution to complete this historic task of drafting the Constitution.
Imagine, within three years, these great talented individuals have given us such a comprehensive and broad-based constitution.
The unprecedented speed at which the Constitution has been created is a unique example of Time Management and Productivity.
Inspired by this, we are also eager to finish our responsibilities in record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a gathering of great talents of the country, in which each country was committed to provide a Constitution that empowers the people of India and the poorest of the poor.
The salient features of our Constitution are: Rights and duties, i. e.
It will enhance the balance of these two things in the lives of the citizens of the country.
If we respect each other's rights, you will be protected from your rights and if we do our duty in the Constitution, then it will be our duty to protect our rights.
I remember that in 2010, in 60 years of India's democracy, we had carried out a procession on the back of an elephant in Gujarat.
It was a memorable effort to make the youth aware of the Constitution and to inspire them to follow the various clauses of the Constitution.
As a democratic country in 2020, we will complete 70 years and 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Let us all respect the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, prosperity and prosperity in our country.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
His Mahaparinirvana Diwas on 6th December.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I salute Baba Saheb who has given the right to save crores of Indians with dignity.
The republic was under Babasaheb's concern and he used to say that India's democratic ideals are not exclusive.
The definition of republic or parliamentary system was nothing new to India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he had given an emotional impression that we have achieved this independence after many years of struggle and that is why we have to protect it with the last point of blood.
He added that no matter how different the Indians are, the idea of the welfare of the nation is always priority.
Once again I pay my homage to Babasaheb.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji and are going to celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev always wished for the welfare of mankind.
He has always shown the path of truth, action, service, compassion and goodness to society.
Our country will celebrate the 550th Birth Anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev next year, and the entire world will be marked by its extension.
All States and Union Territories have been requested to observe this day with Dhoom Dham.
Thus, the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated across the world.
Along with this, a train will also be run at all the holy places associated with Shri Guru Nanak Dev.
I remember Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara when I was discussing this issue recently.
This Gurudwara was severely damaged during the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, but the way the people of the state along with the local people revived that Gurudwara is an example.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that passengers of our country can easily visit the holy land of Shri Guru Nanak Dev at Kartarpur in Pakistan.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th episode, we will again meet in Mann Ki Baat, I believe that for the first time, I could express my thoughts about the Mann Ki Baat programme in front of you because you people wanted to know it.
Our journey will continue.
The more I get your courage, the deeper this journey will be and satisfactory.
Sometimes a question arises in the minds of people that what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Today, I want to say that the feedback of Mann Ki Baat has touched my heart. Most of the people have said that when they listen to Mann Ki Baat, they feel that the family members are sharing their words with them.
I am very happy when I came to know about this thing in detail that I am one of you, one of you and yourself have made me bigger and I am very happy that as a member of your family, I will come again and again with you people through Mann Ki Baat.
I want you to, too.
Come, let us take this journey forward.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
My wish is that all of you must participate in this race of unity in large numbers.
About six-and-a-half months before independence, photos of Sardar Patel were printed on 27th January, 1947 in the edition of the famous international newspaper Time magazine.
The Time served as a model for India in its lead story.
There were more than 550 Indian states at that time.
Although the interest of the British in India was lost, they wanted to disintegrate this country.
The Time Magazine wrote, the threats like separation, violence, food crisis, price rise and power-politics are posing to India. However, if anyone has the power to unite the country then it is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Gandhiji had told Sardar Patel that the problem of the states is so terrible that you can solve it only.
Sardar Patel has truly resolved one problem and has shown the impossible task of uniting the entire country.
Whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad, Trivandrum or Rajasthan, Sardar Patel was the only person in whose mind and strategy we are seeing an integral India today.
It is indeed a reminder of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's remembrance to this nation that is bound by unity and to our Mother India.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel is even more important because on this day, as a tribute to Sardar Patel, we will hand over the Statue of Unity to the nation.
Settled on the banks of the river Narmada in Gujarat, the statue is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty in America.
This will be the world's highest skyrocketing architecture.
Every Indian can proudly say that the tallest statue in the world is now in India.
I believe that this unique architecture will be identified as a favourite destination across the country.
This was the day when Indian soldiers landed in Kashmir and protected the valley from intruders.
This historical event is also related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I had an old meeting with the great soldiers of India, Sam Manekesh.
In this meeting, Field Marshal Manekesh spoke of the time when he was the Colonel.
At that time, an army drive started in Kashmir in 1947.
Field Marshal Manekesh said, "How was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel disturbed in a meeting to delay the deployment of troops in Kashmir at that time, while in the meeting, Sardar Patel looked at Manekesh with his habit and said that there will be no delay in the Army operations in Kashmir and we will have to solve this problem as soon as possible.
On 31st October, the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi.
I pay my homage to Indraiji.
My dear countrymen, are there people who don't like sports
Spirit, Stamina, Strength, Skill etc. are very important in the world of sports.
These are the measurements of success of a player.
On the other hand, these four qualities are important for nation building.
If the youth of any country have these qualities, they will not only improve the economy, science and technology of the country but will also highlight the country's victory in sports.
Recently, I have two meetings, which are worth remembering.
First of all, I got the opportunity to meet the Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
India has made a new record of winning a total of 72 medals in the Games and has enhanced the country's respect.
We have won 3 more medals in the 13 medals at Mix Event.
You must have remembered that this time the Asian Games too had a very good performance in India.
Look, in the last few minutes, I've used the best, most beautiful words so far.
He was a patriarch at the age of eight.
He spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he used to clean the DTC bus and wait for the roadside.
This Narayana has won the gold medal for India at the International event today.
Not only this, the field of sports in India is spreading in such a way that events like Judo, where India has not won an Olympic medal in the Junior Level till date, Tababi Devi made a new history of winning a silver in Judo at Youth Olympics.
Sixteen year old Tawabi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
His father sold a day-to-day fish and a mother.
Sometimes there is a situation where they don't even have the money to buy food.
Similar situations have also come to a standstill for Goddess Tawabi.
He made history by winning medals for the country.
There are many more such stories, their lives are a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson, his enthusiasm is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, all of you remember that we successfully organized the FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUP in 2017.
This has been appreciated in the world's most successful tournament.
The FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUPRECD broke the audience.
More than 12 lakh audiences have watched football in various stadiums across the country and have encouraged young players.
India is fortunate to be the World Cup hockey organisation in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will be held from 28th November to 16th December.
Any Indian who does not love sports has a different place in his mind.
India has a golden history in the hockey game.
In the past, India has won gold sometimes, has won a victory once.
India has also gifted some world class players to the Hockey Games.
Whenever a hockey is discovered anywhere in the world, it becomes incomplete.
Hockey's magician Major Dhyanchand is known all over the world.
Belvindar Singh Sinior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Saheed, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai Hockey has brought laurels for India in the world.
Even today, the Hockey players of Team India are setting an example of success for the new generations.
It's a great experience for sports enthusiasts to sit on the stadium.
He said that while visiting Bhubaneswar, not only Indian teams will encourage all the countries.
We have a tradition of prosperity and cultural excellence and the people of Odisha must remember the inspiring character.
It is also a great opportunity for sports enthusiasts to visit Odisha.
I also convey my best wishes to the rest of the world.
My dear countrymen, a lot of people are coming forward in social work, they are doing volunteering, it is becoming a big inspiration for the people of the country.
A youngster has also made a pledge to learn a wheelchair basketball for playing basketball in a wheelchair.
This is the emotion, this is self-employment.
There is an Indian who will not be proud of this.
This idea of 'We' will inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I was seeing your suggestions on Mann Ki Baat, I got the opportunity to see a very thrilling comment from Mr. Manish Mahapatra of Puducherry.
He wrote in MyGov: Please talk about Mann Ki Baat this time about how the tribal and traditions of India are the best examples of being united with nature.
We need to learn something from them about how to make their traditions committed to the sustainable development.
Manish ji, I express my gratitude to all of you for putting this thing in front of the audience of Mann Ki Baat.
This is one thing that I am inspiring to see our glorious past and culture back. Today, the entire world, especially the western countries are discussing environmental conservation and are looking for a new path for a balanced lifestyle.
Today, our India is not far away from this problem but we have to surrender to solve it.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh, especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the trees like Bat and Arjun with reverence.
In a desert like Rajasthan, Vishnoi has shown us the way to preserve the environment.
They are ready to sacrifice their lives for tree conservation, but they are not ready to admit harm to a tree.
The Mishmis of Arunachal demand their relationship with the tiger.
They call him their own brothers and sisters.
Even in Nagaland, the tiger was seen as a guardian of the forest.
The people of the Warlie community of Maharashtra regard the tiger as a guest, and the tiger's habitat is a symbol of prosperity.
The Kola community of Madhya Pradesh means that their destiny is linked to the tiger and if the tiger does not feed, the villagers too will have to remain illiterate.
The Gond tribe of Madhya Pradesh stops fishing at some places of the Ken River in the Breeding Season.
These places are known as fish shelters, and they have a lot of fresh fish in this tradition.
Tribal communities have made their homes from natural material which becomes strong and environment friendly.
In southern India, there is a small zoological community in the far-flung areas of the Nilgiri Mountain.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in being very peaceful and living in harmony with themselves but whenever someone harms their natural resources, they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were tribal people too.
Who can forget Bhagwan Birsa Munda who fought hard against the British rule to protect his forest land
There are many such examples of tribal communities that teach us how to live in harmony with nature and our country is indebted to the tribal community for the forest wealth that is around us.
Come on, we respect them.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, we talk about the problems faced by those people and those who are doing something amazing for the society.
These are the things that appear to be common but in reality it has a far-reaching impact on the transformation of our mindset and the goals of society.
A few days ago, I was reading about Gurubachan Singh ji.
Gurubachan Singh ji's son was married to an ordinary and hardworking farmer.
Prior to this marriage, Gurubachan Singh ji had told his parents that they would do this marriage unanimously.
Again he suddenly said he had a condition.
Nowadays, when conditions are stated in marriage, it seems usually that he is going to talk about a big sermon, he will ask for something that will make Conne's family difficult.
But you will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurubachan Singh was a simple white farmer and he told his father that the condition that I am talking about is the true strength of the society.
Gurubachan Singh ji said, You promise me that from now on you will not loose the remains of the crop after harvesting in the field of farming.
You can imagine how big social power is hidden in them.
Gurubachan Singh ji is extremely optimistic but it is his personality. And we have seen that there are many such families in our society who have transformed personal matters into good work for the society.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh ji has just set an example.
I have read about another village of Kallar Majra in Punjab, which is situated near Navar.
Kallar Majra was on the top because the people there did not burn the paddy straw and mixed it with the soil, so that the necessary technologies were made by themselves.
I convey my best wishes to Bhai Gurubachan Singh Ji.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Kallar Majra and those places who have been trying their best to make the environment clean.
You all have been taking forward the healthy lifestyle of Indian heirs.
Just as a drop of water produces the sea, similarly small awareness and positive work always helps in creating a positive environment.
India has a special significance for November 11 this year as the first World War ended on November 11, a hundred years ago.
It means that the end of the horrific destruction and the end of the massacre will be a hundred years.
First World War is an important event for India.
To be honest, we had nothing to do with this war.
Nevertheless, the soldiers of our country fought with Bahadur in this war, played a very big role and made the maximum sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that they were not behind anybody in the field of war.
Our soldiers showed their bravery in difficult situations.
All this was aimed at restoring peace.
In the first World War, the whole world saw the catastrophe.
It is estimated that nearly one crore soldiers and more civilians lost their lives.
After this horrific war, the entire world understood the importance of peace.
The language of peace has changed over the last hundred years.
My dear countrymen, there is a specialty in the North-East of this country.
The natural beauty of this place is immense and the people here are also very talented.
Our north-east is now known for its best and greatest work.
It's a place where organic farming has improved.
Just a few days ago, the honourable Future Policy Gold Award for encouraging long-term food industry was won by Sikkim.
The awards were presented on behalf of the United Nations Federal Organization (FAO) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
You will be glad to know that the awards given for outstanding policy formulation are equivalent to Oscars.
Moreover, our Sikkim has won the award by losing only one nomination from twenty-five countries.
That's why I thank the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, the month of October is about to end.
